algernon sidney  manus haec inimica tyrannis ense petit placidam sub liberate quietem    discourses concerning government by algernon sidney son to robert earl of leicester and ambassador from the commonwealth of england to charles gustavus king of sweden published from an original manuscript the second edition carefully corrected to which is added the paper he delivered to the sheriffs immediately before his death and an alphabetical table  dulce and decorum est pro patria mori hor london printed by j darby in bartholomewclose mdcciv  the preface how highly the writings of wise and good men concerning government have bin esteemed in all ages the testimony of history and the preservation of so many books composed by the ancients on that subject do sufficiently manifest and it may be truly said that unless men have utterly abandoned themselves to all that is detestable they have seldom attempted to detract from the worth of the assertors of liberty tho ambition and other passions have influenced them to act in opposition to it when augustus had surpised a young roman who was related to him reading a political discourse of cicero he commended his judgment in that choice the history of france written by the president de thou with a spirit of freedom that might have bin worthy of those who lived before the violation of their liberty has bin so generally valued by men of all ranks in that nation that it is hard to find a book on any important subject which has had so many editions and the just esteem that the emperor charles the fifth made of the memoirs of philip de commines tho that author has given so many instances of his detestation of tyranny may be enough to put this matter out of dispute but if all other proof were wanting the implacable hatred and unwearied industry of the worst of men to suppress such writings would abundantly testify their excellency  that nations should be well informed of their rights is of the most absolute necessity because the happiness or infelicity of any people entirely depends upon the enjoyment or deprivation of liberty which is so invincibly proved in the following discourses that to endeavor to make i more clear would be an unpardonable presumption  if any man think the publication of this work to be unseasonable a this time he is desired to consider that as men expect good laws only from a good government so the reign of a prince whose title is founded upon the principle of liberty which is here defended cannot but be the most proper if not the only time to inform the people of the just  that from a due sense of their inestimable value they may  encouraged to assert them against the attempts of ill men in time to ome  it is not necessary here to say anything concerning the person of the author he was so well known in the world so universally esteemed by those who knew how to set a just value upon true merit and will appear so admirable in the following discourses as not to stand in need of a flattering panegyric but it may not be amiss to say something of the discourses now published  the paper delivered to the sheriffs immediately before his death informs us that he had left a large and a lesser treatise written against the principles contained in filmers book and that a small part of the lesser treatise had bin produced for evidence against him at his trial it is there also said that the lesser treatise neither was nor probably ever should have bin finished this therefore is the large work mentioned in that paper and not the lesser upon part of which the wicked sentence pronounced and executed against him was grounded  it remains only to add a few words for satisfaction of the public that these discourses are genuine and here i shall not need to say that they were put into the hands of a person of eminent quality and integrity by the author himself and that the original is in the judgment of those who knew him best all written by his own hand his inimitable manner of treating this noble subject is instead of a thousand demonstrations that the work can belong to no other than the great man whose name it bears  errata page    line    for it read

person p    sect    the ancients chose those to be kings who excelled in the virtues that are most beneficial to civil societys p  0 sect   god having given the government of the world to no one man nor declared how it should be divided left it to the will of man p    sect    if a right of dominion were esteemed hereditary according to the law of nature a multitude of destructive and inextricable controversys would thereupon  p    sect    kings cannot confer the right of father upon princes nor princes upon kings p   sect  0 all just magistratical power is from the people p    chap ii sect   that it is natural for nations to govern or to choose governors and that virtue only gives a natural preference of one man above another or reason why one should be chosen rather than another p    sect   every man that has children has the right of a father and is capable of preferment in a society composed of many p    sect   government is not instituted for the good of the governor but of the governed and power is not an advantage but a burden p  0 sect   the paternal right devolves to and is inherited by all the children p    sect   free men join together and frame greater or lesser societys and give such forms to them as best please themselves p    sect   they who have a right of choosing a king have the right of making a king p    sect   the laws of every nation are the measure of magistratical power p    sect   there is no natural propensity in man or beast to monarchy p    sect   the government instituted by god over the israelites was aristocratical p    sect  0 aristotle was not simply for monarchy or against popular government but approved or disapproved of either according to circumstances p  0 sect    liberty produces virtue order and stability slavery is accompanied with vice weakness and misery p    sect    the glory virtue and power of the romans began and ended with their liberty p    sect    there is no disorder or prejudice in changing the name

p     sect    good governments admit of changes in the superstructures whilst the foundations remain unchangeable p     sect    xenophon in blaming the disorders of democracys favors aristocracys p     sect    that corruption and venality which is natural to courts is seldom found in popular governments p     sect  0 mans natural love to liberty is tempered by reason which originally is his nature p     sect    mixed and popular governments preserve peace and manage wars better than absolute monarchys p     sect    commonwealths seek peace or war according to the variety of their constitutions p     sect    that is the best government which provides best for war p     sect    popular governments are less subject to civil disorders than monarchys manage them more ably and more easily recover out of them p     sect    courts are more subject to venality and corruption than popular governments p     sect    civil tumults and wars are not the greatest evils that befall nations p     sect    the mischiefs and crueltys proceeding from tyranny are greater than any that can come from popular or mixed governments p     sect    men living under popular or mixed governments are more careful of the public good than in absolute monarchys p     sect    there is no assurance that the distempers of a state shall be cured by the wisdom of a prince p  00 sect  0 a monarchy cannot be well regulated unless the powers of the monarch are limited by law p  0  sect    the libertys of nations are from god and nature not from kings p   0 sect    the contracts made between magistrates and the nations that created them were real solemn and obligatory p     chap iii  gs not being fathers of their people nor excelling all others  can have no other just power than what the laws give nor any  privileges of the lords anointed p      the kings of israel and judah were under a law not safely to be transgrest p     sect   samuel did not describe to the israelites the glory of a free monarchy but the evils the people should suffer that he might divert them from desiring a king p   0 sect   no people can be obliged to suffer from their kings what they have not a right to do p     sect   the mischiefs suffered from wicked kings are such as render it both reasonable and just for all nations that have virtue and power to exert both in repelling them p     sect   it is not good for such nations as will have kings to suffer them to be glorious powerful or abounding in riches p     sect   when the israelites asked for such a king as the nations about them had they asked for a tyrant tho they did not call him so p     sect   under the name of tribute no more is understood than what the law of each nation gives to the supreme magistrate for the defraying of public charges to which the customs of the romans or sufferings of the jews have no relation p     sect   our own laws confirm to us the enjoyment of our native rights p     sect  0 the words of st paul enjoining obedience to higher powers favor all sorts of government no less than monarchy p     sect    that which is not just is not law and that which is not law ought not to be obeyed p     sect    the right and power of a magistrate depends upon his institution not upon his name p     sect    laws were made to direct and instruct magistrates and if they will not be directed to restrain them p     sect    laws are not made by kings not because they are busied in greater matters than doing justice but because nations will be governed by rule and not arbitrarily p     sect    a general presumption that kings will govern well is not a sufficient security to the people p     sect    the observation of the laws of nature is absurdly expected from tyrants who set themselves up against all laws and he that subjects kings to no other law than what is common to tyrants destroys their being p     sect    kings cannot be the interpreters of the oaths they take p     sect    the next in blood to deceased kings cannot generally be said to be kings till they are crowned p  0  sect    the greatest enemy of a just magistrate is he who endeavors to invalidate the contract between him and the people or to corrupt their manners p     sect  0 unjust commands are not to be obeyed and no man is obliged to suffer for not obeying such as are against law p     sect    it cannot be for the good of the people that the magistrate have a power above the law and he is not a magistrate who has not his power by law p     sect    the rigor of the law is to be tempered by men of known integrity and judgment and not by the prince who may be ignorant or vicious p     sect    aristotle proves that no man is to be entrusted with an absolute power by showing that no one knows how to execute it but such a man as is not to be found p     sect    the power of augustus caesar was not given but usurped p     sect    the regal power was not the first in this nation nor necessarily to be continued tho it had bin the first p     sect    that the king may be entrusted with the power of choosing judges yet that by which they act is from the law p     sect    magna charta was not the original but a declaration of the english libertys the kings power is not restrained but created by that and other laws and the nation that made them can only correct the defects of them p     sect    the english nation has always bin governed by it self or its representatives p     sect    the king was never master of the soil p     sect  0 henry the first was king of england by as good a title as any of his predecessors or successors p   0 sect    free nations have a right of meeting when and where they please unless they deprive themselves of it p     sect    the powers of kings are so various according to the constitutions of several states that no consequence can be drawn to the prejudice or advantage of any one merely from the name p     sect    the liberty of a people is the gift of god and nature p     sect    no veneration paid or honor conferred upon a just and lawful magistrate can diminish the liberty of a nation p     sect    the authority given by our law to the acts performed by a king de facto detract nothing from the peoples right of creating whom they please p     sect    the general revolt of a nation cannot be called a rebellion p     sect    the english government was not ill constituted the defects more lately observed proceeding from the change of manners and corruption of the times p   0 sect    the power of calling and dissolving parliaments is not simply in the king the variety of customs in choosing parliamentmen and the errors a people may commit neither prove that kings are or ought to be absolute p     sect    those kings only are heads of the people who are good wise and seek to advance no interest but that of the public p     sect  0 good laws prescribe easy and safe remedys against the evils proceeding from the vices or infirmitys of the magistrate and when they fail they must be supplied p     sect    the people for whom and by whom the magistrate is created can only judge whether he rightly performs his office or not p     sect    the person that wears the crown cannot determine the affairs which the law refers to the king p  0  sect    proclamations are not laws p  0  sect    a people that is not free cannot substitute delegats p  0  sect    the legislative power is always arbitrary and not to be trusted in the hands of any who are not bound to obey the laws they make p     sect    the coercive power of the law proceeds from the authority of parliament p     discourses concerning government chap i section i introduction having lately seen a book intituld patriarcha written by sir robert filmer concerning the universal and undistinguished right of all kings i thought a time of leisure might be well employed in examining his doctrine and the questions arising from it which seem so far to concern all mankind that besides the influence upon our future life they may be said to comprehend all that in this world deserves to be cared for if he say true there is but one government in the world that can have any thing of justice in it and those who have hitherto bin esteemed the best and wisest of men for having constituted commonwealths or kingdoms and taken much pains so to proportion the powers of several magistracys that they might all concur in procuring the public good or so to divide the powers between the magistrates and people that a wellregulated harmony might be preserved in the whole were the most unjust and foolish of all men they were not builders but overthrowers of governments their business was to set up aristocratical democratical or mixed governments in opposition to that monarchy which by the immutable laws of god and nature is imposed upon mankind or presumptuously to put shackles upon the monarch who by the same laws is to be absolute and uncontrold they were rebellious and disobedient sons who rose up against their father and not only refused to hearken to his voice but made him bend to their will in their opinion such only deserved to be called good men who endeavored to be good to mankind or to that country to which they were more particularly related and in as much as that good consists in a felicity of estate and perfection of person they highly valued such as had endeavored to make men better wiser and happier this they understood to be the end for which men entered into societys and tho cicero says that commonwealths were instituted for the obtaining of justice he contradicts them not but comprehends all in that word because it is just that whosoever receives a power should employ it wholly for the accomplishment of the ends for which it was given this work could be performed only by such as excelled in virtue but lest they should deflect from it no government was thought to be well constituted potentiora legum quam hominum imperia tacit unless the laws prevailed above the commands of men and they were accounted as the worst of beasts who did not prefer such a condition before a subjection to the fluctuating and irregular will of a man  if we believe sir robert all this is mistaken nothing of this kind was ever left to the choice of men they are not to inquire what conduces to their own good god and nature have put us into a way from which we are not to swerve we are not to live to him nor to our selves but to the master that he has set over us one government is established over all and no limits can be set to the power of the person that manages it this is the prerogative or as another author of the same stamp calls it the royal charter granted to kings by god they all have an equal right to it women and children are patriarchs and the next in blood without any regard to age sex or other qualitys of the mind or body are fathers of as many nations as fall under their power we are not to examine whether he or she be young or old virtuous or vicious sober minded or stark mad the right and power is the same in all whether virtue be exalted or suppressed whether he that bears the sword be a praise to those that do well and a terror to those that do evil or a praise to those that do evil and a terror to such as do well it concerns us not for the king must not lose his right nor have his power diminished on any account i have bin sometimes apt to wonder how things of this nature could enter into the head of any man or if no wickedness or folly be so great but some may fall into it i could not well conceive why they should publish it to the world but these thoughts ceased when i considered that a people from all ages in love with liberty and desirous to maintain their own privileges could never be brought to resign em unless they were made to believe that in conscience they ought to do it which could not be unless they were also persuaded to believe that there was a law set to all mankind which none might transgress and which put the examination of all those matters out of their power this is our authors work by this it will appear whose throne he seeks to advance and whose servant he is whilst he pretends to serve the king and that it may be evident he has made use of means suitable to the ends proposed for the service of his great master i hope to show that he has not used one argument that is not false nor cited one author whom he has not perverted and abused whilst my work is so to lay open these snares that the most simple may not be taken in them i shall not examine how sir robert came to think himself a man fit to undertake so great a work as to destroy the principles which from the beginning seem to have bin common to all mankind but only weighing the positions and arguments that he alleges will if there be either truth or strength in them confess the discovery comes from him that gave us least reason to expect it and that in pe of the ancients there is not in the world a piece of wood out of which a mercury may not be made  sect ii the common notions of liberty are not from schooldivines but from nature in the first lines of his book he seems to denounce war against mankind endeavoring to overthrow the principle of liberty in which god created us and which includes the chief advantages of the life we enjoy as well as the greatest helps toward the felicity that is the end of our hopes in the other to this end he absurdly imputes to the schooldivines that which was taken up by em as a common notion written in the hearts of all men denied by none but such as are degenerated into beasts from whence they might prove such points as of themselves were less evident thus did euclid lay down certain axioms which none could deny that did not renounce common sense from whence he drew the proofs of such propositions as were less obvious to the understanding and they may with as much reason be accused of paganism who say that the whole is greater than a part that two halfs make the whole or that a straight line is the shortest way from point to point as to say that they who in politics lay such foundations as have bin taken up by schoolmen and others as undeniable truths do therefore follow them or have any regard to their authority tho the schoolmen were corrupt they were neither stupid nor unlearned they could not but see that which all men saw nor lay more approved foundations than that man is naturally free that he cannot justly be deprived of that liberty without cause and that he dos not resign it or any part of it unless it be in consideration of a greater good which he proposes to himself but if he unjustly imputes the invention of this to schooldivines he in some measure repairs his fault in saying this has bin fostered by all succeeding papists for good divinity the divines of the reformed churches have entertained it and the common people every where tenderly embrace it that is to say all christian divines whether reformed or unreformd do approve it and the people every where magnify it as the height of human felicity but filmer and such as are like to him being neither reformed nor unreformd christians nor of the people can have no title to christianity and in as much as they set themselves against that which is the height of human felicity they declare themselves enemies to all that are concerned in it that is to all mankind  but says he they do not remember that the desire of liberty was the first cause of the fall of man and i desire it may not be forgotten that the liberty asserted is not a licentiousness of doing what is pleasing to every one against the command of god but an exemption from all human laws to which they have not given their assent if he would make us believe there was any thing of this in adams sin he ought to have proved that the law which he transgrest was imposed upon him by man and consequently that there was a man to impose it for it will easily appear that neither the reformed or unreformd divines nor the people following them do place the felicity of man in an exemption from the laws of god but in a most perfect conformity to them our savior taught us not to fear such as could kill the body but him that could kill and cast into hell and the apostle tells us that we should obey god rather than man it has bin ever hereupon observed that they who most precisely adhere to the laws of god are least sollicitous concerning the commands of men unless they are well grounded and those who most delight in the glorious liberty of the sons of god do not only subject themselves to him but are most regular observers of the just ordinances of man made by the consent of such as are concerned according to the will of god  the error of not observing this may perhaps deserve to be pardoned in a man that had read no books as proceeding from ignorance if such as are grossly ignorant can be excused when they take upon them to write of such matters as require the highest knowledge but in sir robert it is prevarication and fraud to impute to schoolmen and puritans that which in his first page he acknowledged to be the doctrine of all reformed and unreformd christian churches and that he knows to have bin the principle in which the grecians italians spaniards gauls germans and britans and all other generous nations ever lived before the name of christ was known in the world insomuch that the base effeminate asiaticks and africans for being careless of their liberty or unable to govern themselves were by aristotle and other wise men called slaves by nature and looked upon as little different from beasts  this which has its root in common sense not being to be overthrown by reason he spares his pains of seeking any but thinks it enough to render his doctrine plausible to his own party by joining the jesuits to geneva and coupling buchanan to doleman as both maintaining the same doctrine tho he might as well have joined the puritans with the turks because they all think that one and one makes two but whoever marks the proceedings of filmer and his masters as well as his disciples will rather believe that they have learned from rome and the jesuits to hate geneva than that geneva and rome can agree in any thing farther than as they are obliged to submit to the evidence of truth or that geneva and rome can concur in any design or interest that is not common to mankind  these men allowed to the people a liberty of deposing their princes this is a desperate opinion bellarmin and calvin look asquint at it but why is this a desperate opinion if disagreements happen between king and people why is it a more desperate opinion to think the king should be subject to the censures of the people than the people subject to the will of the king did the people make the king or the king make the people is the king for the people or the people for the king did god create the hebrews that saul might reign over them or did they from an opinion of procuring their own good ask a king that might judge them and fight their battles if gods interposition which shall be hereafter explained dos alter the case did the romans make romulus numa tullus hostilius and tarquinius priscus kings or did they make or beget the romans if they were made kings by the romans it is certain they that made them sought their own good in so doing and if they were made by and for the city and people i desire to know if it was not better that when their successors departed from the end of their institution by endeavoring to destroy it or all that was good in it they should be censured and ejected than be permitted to ruin that people for whose good they were created was it more just that caligula or nero should be suffered to destroy the poor remains of the roman nobility and people with the nations subject to that empire than that the race of such monsters should be extinguished and a great part of mankind especially the best against whom they were most fierce preserved by their death  i presume our author thought these questions might be easily decided and that no more was required to show the forementioned assertions were not at all desperate than to examine the grounds of them but he seeks to divert us from this enquiry by proposing the dreadful consequences of subjecting kings to the censures of their people whereas no consequence can destroy any truth and the worst of this is that if it were received some princes might be restrained from doing evil or punished if they will not be restrained we are therefore only to consider whether the people senate or any magistracy made by and for the people have or can have such a right for if they have whatsoever the consequences may be it must stand and as the one tends to the good of mankind in restraining the lusts of wicked kings the other exposesem without remedy to the fury of the most savage of all beasts i am not ashamed in this to concur with buchanan calvin or bellarmin and without envy leave to filmer and his associats the glory of maintaining the contrary  but notwithstanding our authors aversion to truth he confesses that hayward blackwood barclay and others who have bravely vindicated the right of kings in this point do with one consent admit as an unquestionable truth and assent unto the natural liberty and equality of mankind not so much as once questioning or opposing it and indeed i believe that tho since the sin of our first parents the earth has brought forth briars and brambles and the nature of man has bin fruitful only in vice and wickedness neither the authors he mentions nor any others have had impudence enough to deny such evident truth as seems to be planted in the hearts of all men or to publish doctrins so contrary to common sense virtue and humanity till these times the production of laud manwaring sibthorp hobbs filmer and heylin seems to have bin reserved as an additional curse to complete the shame and misery of our age and country those who had wit and learning with something of ingenuity and modesty tho they believed that nations might possibly make an ill use of their power and were very desirous to maintain the cause of kings as far as they could put any good color upon it yet never denied that some had suffered justly which could not be is there were no power of judging them nor ever asserted any thing that might arm them with an irresistible power of doing mischief animate them to persist in the most flagitious courses with assurance of perpetual impunity or engage nations in an inevitable necessity of suffering all manner of outrages they knew that the actions of those princes who were not altogether detestable might be defended by particular reasons drawn from them or the laws of their country and would neither undertake the defense of such as were abominable nor bring princes to whom they wished well into the odious extremity of justifying themselves by arguments that favored caligula and nero as well as themselves and that must be taken for a confession that they were as bad as could be imagined since nothing could be said for them that might not as well be applied to the worst that had bin or could be but filmer heylin and their associats scorning to be restrained by such considerations boldly lay the ax to the root of the tree and rightly enough affirm that the whole fabric of that which they call popular sedition would fall to the ground if the principle of natural liberty were removed and on the other hand it must be acknowledged that the whole fabric of tyranny will be much weakened if we prove that nations have a right to make their own laws constitute their own magistrates and that such as are so constituted owe an account of their actions to those by whom and for whom they are appointed  sect iii implicit faith belongs to fools and truth is comprehended by examining principles whilst filmers business is to overthrow liberty and truth he in his passage modestly professes not to meddle with mysterys of state or arcana imperii he renounces those inquirys through an implicit faith which never entered into the head of any but fools and such as through a carelessness of the point in question acted as if they were so this is the foundation of the papal power and it can stand no longer than those that compose the roman church can be persuaded to submit their consciences to the word of the priests and esteem themselves discharged from the necessity of searching the scriptures in order to know whether the things that are told them are true of false this may show whether our author or those of geneva do best agree with the roman doctrine but his instance is yet more sottish than his profession an implicit faith says he is given to the meanest artificer i wonder by whom who will wear a shoo that hurts him because the shoomaker tells him it is well made or who will live in a house that yields no defense against the extremitys of weather because the mason or carpenter assures him it is a very good house such as have reason understanding or common sense will and ought to make use of it in those things that concern themselves and their posterity and suspect the words of such as are interested in deceiving or persuading them not to see with their own eyes that they may be more easily deceived this rule obliges us so far to search into matters of state as to examine the original principles of government in general and of our own in particular we cannot distinguish truth from falsehood right from wrong or know what obedience we owe to the magistrate or what we may justly expect from him unless we know what he is why he is and by whom he is made to be what he is these perhaps may be called mysterys of state and some would persuade us they are to be esteemed arcana but whosoever confesses himself to be ignorant of em must acknowledge he is incapable of giving any judgment upon things relating to the superstructure and in so doing evidently shows to others that they ought not at all to hearken to what he says  his argument to prove this is more admirable if an implicit faith says he is given to the meanest artificer in his craft much more to a prince in the profound secrets of government but where is the consequence if i trust to the judgment of an artificer or one of a more ingenuous profession it is not because he is of it but because i am persuaded he dos well understand it and that he will be saithful to me in things relating to his art i do not send for lower or micklethwait when i am sick nor ask the advice of maynard or jones in a suit of law because the first are physicians and the other lawyers but because i think them wise learned diligent and faithful there being a multitude of others who go under the same name whose opinion i would never ask therefore if any conclusion can be drawn from thence in favor of princes it must be of such as have all the qualitys of ability and integrity that should create this confidence in me or it must be proved that all princes in as much as they are princes have such qualitys no general conclusion can be drawn from the first case because it must depend upon the circumstances which ought to be particularly proved and if the other be asserted i desire to know whether caligula claudius nero vitellius domitian commodus heliogabalus and others not unlike to them had those admirable endowments upon which an implicit faith ought to have bin grounded how they came by them and whether we have any promise from god that all princes should for ever excel in those virtues or whether by experience we find that they do so if they are or have bin wanting in any the whole falls to the ground for no man enjoys as a prince that which is not common to all princes and if every prince has not wisdom to understand these profound secrets integrity to direct him according to what he knows to be good and a sufficient measure of industry and valor to protect me he is not the artificer to whom the implicit faith is due his eyes are as subject to dazzle as my own but it is a shame to insist on such a point as this we see princes of all sorts they are born as other men the vilest flatterer dares not deny that they are wise or foolish good or bad valiant or cowardly like other men and the crown dos neither bestow extraordinary qualitys ripen such as are found in princes sooner than in the meanest nor preserve them from the decays of age sickness or other accidents to which all men are subject and if the greatest king in the world falls into them he is as incapable of that mysterious knowledge and his judgment is as little to be relied on as that of the poorest peasant  this matter is not mended by sending us to seek those virtues in the ministers which are wanting in the prince the ill effects of rehoboams folly could not be corrected by the wisdom of solomons counselors he rejected them and such as are like to him will always do the same thing nero advised with none but musicians players chariotdrivers or the abominable ministers of his pleasures and crueltys arcadius his senate was chiefly composed of buffoons and cooks influenced by an old rascally eunuch and it is an eternal truth that a weak or wicked prince can never choose a wise council nor receive any benefit by one that is imposed upon him unless they have a power of acting without him which would render the government in effect aristocratical and would probably displease our author as much as if it were so in name also good and wise counselors do not grow up like mushrooms great judgment is required in choosing and preparing them if a weak or vicious prince should be so happy to find them chosen to his hand they would avail him nothing there will ever be variety of opinions amongst em and he that is of a perverted judgment will always choose the worse of those that are proposed and favor the worst men as most like to himself therefore if this implicit faith be grounded upon a supposition of profound wisdom in the prince the foundation is overthrown and cannot stand for to repose confidence in the judgment and integrity of one that has none is the most brutish of all follys so that if a prince may have or want the qualitys upon which my faith in him can be rationally grounded i cannot yield the obedience he requires unless i search into the secrets relating to his person and commands which he forbids i cannot know how to obey unless i know in what and to whom nor in what unless i know what ought to be commanded nor what ought to be commanded unless i understand the original right of the commander which is the great arcanum our author finding himself involved in many difficultys proposes an expedient as ridiculous as any thing that had gone before being nothing more than an absurd begging the main question and determining it without any shadow of proof he enjoins an active or passive obedience before he shows what should oblige or persuade us to it this indeed were a compendious way of obviating that which he calls popular sedition and of exposing all nations that fall under the power of tyrants to be destroyed utterly by them nero or domitian would have desired no more than that those who would not execute their wicked commands should patiently have suffered their throats to be cut by such as were less scrupulous and the world that had suffered those monsters for some years must have continued under their fury till all that was good and virtuous had bin abolished but in those ages and parts of the world where there has bin any thing of virtue and goodness we may observe a third sort of men who would neither do villanys nor suffer more than the laws did permit or the consideration of the public peace did require whilst tyrants with their slaves and the instruments of their crueltys were accounted the dregs of mankind and made the objects of detestation and scorn these men who delivered their countries from such plagues were thought to have something of divine in them and have bin famous above all the rest of mankind to this day of this sort were pelopidas epaminondas thrasibulus harmodius aristogiton philopemen lucius brutus publius valerius marcus brutus c cassius m cato with a multitude of others amongst the ancient heathens such as were instruments of the like deliverances amongst the hebrews as moses othniel ehud barac gideon sampson jephtha samuel david jehu the maccabees and others have from the scriptures a certain testimony of the righteousness of their proceedings when they neither would act what was evil nor suffer more than was reasonable but lest we should learn by their examples and the praises given to them our author confines the subjects choice to acting or suffering that is doing what is commanded or lying down to have his throat cut or to see his family and country made desolate this he calls giving to caesar that which is cesars whereas he ought to have considered that the question is not whether that which is cesars should be rendered to him for that is to be done to all men but who is caesar and what does of right belong to him which he no way indicates to us so that the question remains entire as if he had never mentioned it unless we do in a compendious way take his word for the whole  sect iv the rights of particular nations cannot subsist if general principles contrary to them are received as true notwithstanding this our anthor if we will believe him dos not question or quarrel at the rights or libertys of this or any other nation he only denies they can have any such in subjecting them necessarily and universally to the will of one man and says not a word that is not applicable to every nation in the world as well as to our own but as the bitterness of his malice seems to be most especially directed against england i am inclined to believe he hurts other countries only by accident as the famous the marchioness of brinvilliers french lady intended only to poison her father husband brother and some more of her nearest relations but rather than they should escape destroyed many other persons of quality who at several times dined with them and if that ought to excuse her i am content he also should pass uncensurd tho his crimes are incomparably greater than those for which she was condemned or than any can be which are not of a public extent  sect v to depend upon the will of a man is slavery this as he thinks is farther sweetened by asserting that he dos not inquire what the rights of a people are but from whence not considering that whilst he denies they can proceed from the laws of natural liberty or any other root than the grace and bounty of the prince he declares they can have none at all for as liberty solely consists in an independency upon the will of another and by the name of slave we understand a man who can neither dispose of his person nor goods but enjoys all at the will of his master there is no such thing in nature as a slave if those men or nations are not slaves who have no other title to what they enjoy than the grace of the prince which he may revoke whenever he pleases but there is more than ordinary extravagance in his assertion that the greatest liberty in the world is for a people to live under a monarch when his whole book is to prove that this monarch has his right from god and nature is endowed with an unlimited power of doing what he pleases and can be restrained by no law if it be liberty to live under such a government i desire to know what is slavery it has bin hitherto believed in the world that the assyrians medes arabs egyptians turks and others like them lived in slavery because their princes were masters of their lives and goods whereas the grecians italians gauls germans spaniards and carthaginians as long as they had any strength virtue or courage amongst em were esteemed free nations because they abhorred such a subjection they were and would be governed only by laws of their own making potentiora erant legum quam hominum imperia even their princes had the c tacit ibid authority or credit of persuading rather than the power of commanding but all this was mistaken these men were slaves and the asiaticks were freemen by the same rule the venetians switzers grisons and hollanders are not free nations but liberty in its perfection is enjoyed in france and turkey the intention of our ancestors was without doubt to establish this amongst us by magna charta and other preceding or subsequent laws but they ought to have added one clause that the contents of em should be in sorce only so long as it pleased the king king alfred upon whose laws magna charta was grounded when he said the english nation was as free as the internal thoughts of a man did only mean that it should be so as long as it pleased their master this it seems was the end of our law and we who are born under it and are descended from such as have so valiantly defended their rights against the encroachments of kings have followed after vain shadows and without the expense of sweat treasure or blood might have secured our beloved liberty by casting all into the kings hands  we owe the discovery of these secrets to our author who after having gravely declared em thinks no offense ought to be taken at the freedom he assumes of examining things relating to the liberty of mankind because he has the right which is common to all but he ought to have considered that in asserting that right to himself he allows it to all mankind and as the temporal good of all men consists in the preservation of it he declares himself to be their mortal enemy who endeavors to destroy it if he were alive this would deserve to be answered with stones rather than words he that oppugns the public liberty overthrows his own and is guilty of the most brutish of all follys whilst he arrogates to himself that which he denies to all men  i cannot but commend his modesty and care not to detract from the worth of learned men but it seems they were all subject to error except himself who is rendered infallible through pride ignorance and impudence but if hooker and aristotle were wrong in their fundamentals concerning natural liberty how could they be in the right when they built upon it or if they did mistake how can they deserve to be cited or rather why is such care taken to pervert their sense it seems our author is by their errors brought to the knowledge of the truth men have heard of a dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant who saw farther than the giant but now that the dwarf standing on the ground sees that which the giant did overlook we must learn from him if there be sense in this the giant must be blind or have such eyes only as are of no use to him he minded only the things that were far from him these great and learned men mistook the very principle and foundation of all their doctrine if we believe our author this misfortune befell them because they too much trusted to the schoolmen he names aristotle and i presume intends to comprehend plato plutarch thucydides xenophon polybius and all the ancient grecians italians and others who asserted the natural freedom of mankind only in imitation of the schoolmen to advance the power of the pope and would have compast their design if filmer and his associats had not opposed em these men had taught us to make the unnatural distinction between royalist and patriot and kept us from seeing that the relation between king and people is so great that their wellbeing is reciprocal if this be true how came tarquin to think it good for him to continue king at rome when the people would turn him out or the people to think it good for them to turn him out when he desired to continue in why did the syracusians destroy the tyranny of dionysius which he was not willing to leave till he was pulled out by the heels how could nero think of burning rome or why did caligula wish the people had but one neck that he might strike it off at one blow if their welsare was thus reciprocal it is not enough to say these were wicked or mad men for other princes may be so also and there may be the same reason of differing from them for if the proposition be not universally true it is not to be received as true in relation to any till it be particularly proved and then it is not to be imputed to the quality of prince but to the personal virtue of the man  i do not find any great matters in the passages taken out of bellarmin which our author says comprehend the strength of all that ever he had heard read or seen produced for the natural liberty of the subject but he not mentioning where they are to be found i do not think my self obliged to examine all his works to see whether they are rightly cited or not however there is certainly nothing new in them we see the same as to the substance in those who wrote many ages before him as well as in many that have lived since his time who neither minded him nor what he had written i dare not take upon me to give an account of his works having read few of them but as he seems to have laid the foundation of his discourses in such common notions as were assented to by all mankind those who follow the same method have no more regard to jesuitism and popery tho he was a jesuit and a cardinal than they who agree with faber and other jesuits in the principles of geometry which no sober man did ever deny  sect vi god leaves to man the choice of forms in government and those who constitute one form may abrogate it but sir robert desires to make observations on bellarmin s words before he examins or refutes them and indeed it were not possible to make such stuff of his doctrine as he dos if he had examined or did understand it first he very wittily concludes that if by the law of god the power be immediately in the people god is the author of a democracy and why not as well as of a tyranny is there any thing in it repugnant to the being of god is there more reason to impute to god caligulas monarchy than the democracy of athens or is it more for the glory of god to assert his presence with the ottoman or french monarchs than with the popular governments of the switsers and grisons is pride malice luxury and violence so suitable to his being that they who exercise them are to be reputed his ministers and is modesty humility equality and justice so contrary to his nature that they who live in them should be thought his enemies is there any absurdity in saying that since god in goodness and mercy to mankind has with an equal hand given to all the benefit of liberty with some measure of understanding how to employ it it is lawful for any nation as occasion shall require to give the exercise of that power to one or more men under certain limitations or conditions or to retain it in themselves if they think it good for them if this may be done we are at the end of all controversys concerning one form of government established by god to which all mankind must submit and we may safely conclude that having given to all men in some degree a capacity of judging what is good for themselves he has granted to all likewise a liberty of inventing such forms as please them best without favoring one more than another  his second observation is grounded upon a falsity in matter of fact bellarmin dos not say that democracy is an ordinance of god more than any other government nor that the people have no power to make use of their right but that they do that is to say ordinarily transmit the exercise of it to one or more and it is certain they do sometimes especially in small citys retain it in themselves but whether that were observed or not by bellarmin makes nothing to our cause which we defend and not him  the next point is subtle and he thinks thereby to have brought belarrmin and such as agree with his principle to a nonplus he doubts who shall judge of the lawful cause of changing the government and says it is a pestilent conclusion to place that power in the multitude but why should this be esteemed pestilent or to whom if the allowance of such a power to the senate was pestilent to nero it was beneficial to mankind and the denial of it which would have given to nero an opportunity of continuing in his villanys would have bin pestilent to the best of men whom he endeavored to destroy and to all others that received benefit from them but this question depends upon another for if governments are constituted for the pleasure greatness or profit of one man he must not be interrupted for the opposing of his will is to overthrow the institution on the other side if the good of the governed be sought care must be taken that the end be accomplished tho it be with the prejudice of the governor if the power be originally in the multitude and one or more men to whom the exercise of it or a part of it was committed had no more than their brethren till it was conferred on him or them it cannot be believed that rational creatures would advance one or a few of their equals above themselves unless in consideration of their own good and then i find no inconvenience in leaving to them a right of judging cujus est instituere ejus est abrogate whether this be duly performed or not we say in general he that institutes may also abrogate most especially when the institution is not only by but for himself if the multitude therefore do institute the multitude may abrogate and they themselves or those who succeed in the same right can only be fit judges of the performance of the ends of the institution our author may perhaps say the public peace may be hereby disturbed but he ought to know there can be no peace where there is no justice nor any justice if the government instituted for the good of a nation be turned to its ruin but in plain english the inconvenience with which such as he endeavor to afright us is no more than that he or they to whom the power is given may be restrained or chastisd if they betray their trust which i presume will displease none but such as would rather subject rome with the best part of the world depending on it to the will of caligula or nero than caligula or nero to the judgment of the senate and people that is rather to expose many great and brave nations to be destroyed by the rage of a savage beast than subject that beast to the judgment of all or the choicest men of them who can have no interest to pervert them or other reason to be severe to him than to prevent the mischiefs he would commit and to save the people from ruin  in the next place he recites an argument of bellarmin that it is evident in scripture god has ordained powers but god has given them to no particular person because by nature all men are equal therefore he has given power to the people or multitude i leave him to untie that knot if he can but as it is usual with impostors he goes about by surmises to elude the force of this argument pretending that in some other place he had contradicted himself and acknowledged that every man was prince of his posterity because that if many men had bin created together they ought all to have bin princes of their posterity but it is not necessary to argue upon passages cited from authors when he that cites em may be justly suspected of fraud and neither indicates the place nor treatise lest it should be detected most especially when we are no way concerned in the authors credit i take bellarmins argument to be strong and if he in some place did contradict it the hurt is only to himself but in this particular i should not think he did it tho i were sure our author had faithfully repeated his words for in allowing every man to be prince of his posterity he only says every man should be chief in his own family and have a power over his children which no man denies but he dos not understand latin who thinks the word princeps does in any degree signify an absolute power or a right of transmitting it to his heirs and successors upon which the doctrine of our author wholly depends on the contrary the same law that gave to my father a power over me gives me the like over my children and if i had a thousand brothers each of them would have the same over their children bellarmins argument therefore being no way enervated by the alleged passage i may justly insist upon it and add that god has not only declared in scripture but written on the heart of every man that as it is better to be clothed than to go naked to live in a house than to lie in the fields to be defended by the united force of a multitude than to place the hopes of his security solely in his own strength and to prefer the benefits of society before a savage and barbarous solitude he has also taught them to frame such societys and to establish such laws as were necessary to preserve them and we may as reasonably affirm that mankind is for ever obliged to use no other clothes than leather breeches like adam to live in hollow trees and eat acorns or to seek after the model of his house for a habitation and to use no arms except such as were known to the patriarchs as to think all nations for ever obliged to be governed as they governed their familys this i take to be the genuin sense of the scripture and the most respectful way of interpreting the places relating to our purpose it is hard to imagine that god who has left all things to our choice that are not evil in themselves should tie us up in this and utterly incredible that he should impose upon us a necessity of following his will without declaring it to us instead of constituting a government over his people consisting of many parts which we take to be a model fit to be imitated by others he might have declared in a word that the eldest man of the eldest line should be king and that his will ought to be their law this had bin more suitable to the goodness and mercy of god than to leave us in a dark labyrinth full of precipices or rather to make the government given to his own people a false light to lead us to destruction this could not be avoided if there were such a thing as our author calls a lord paramount over his childrens children to all generations we see nothing in scripture of precept or example that is not utterly abhorrent to this chimera the only sort of kings mentioned there with approbation is such a one as may not raise his heart above his brethren deuteronomy    if god had constituted a lord paramount with an absolute power and multitudes of nations were to labor and fight for his greatness and pleasure this were to raise his heart to a height that would make him forget he was a man such as are versed in scripture not only know that it neither agrees with the letter or spirit of that book but that it is unreasonable in it self unless he were of a species different from the rest of mankind his exaltation would not agree with gods indulgence to his creatures tho he were the better for it much less when probably he would be made more unhappy and worse by the pride luxury and other vices that always attend the highest fortunes it is no less incredible that god who disposes all things in wisdom and goodness and appoints a due place for all should without distinction ordain such a power to every one succeeding in such a line as cannot be executed the wise would refuse and fools cannot take upon em the burden of it without ruin to themselves and such as are under them or expose mankind to a multitude of other absurditys and mischiefs subjecting the aged to be governed by children the wise to depend on the will of fools the strong and valiant to expect defense from the weak or cowardly and all in general to receive justice from him who neither knows nor cares for it  sect vii abraham and the patriarchs were not kings if any man say that we are not to seek into the depth of gods counsels i answer that if he had for reasons known only to himself affixed such a right to any one line he would have set a mark upon those who come of it that nations might know to whom they owe subjection or given some testimony of his presence with filmer and heylin if he had sent them to reveal so great a mystery till that be done we may safely look upon them as the worst of men and teachers only of lies and follys this persuades me little to examine what would have bin if god had it once created many men or the conclusions that can be drawn from adams having bin alone for nothing can be more evident than that if many had bin created they had bin all equal unless god had given a preference to one all their sons had inherited the same right after their death and no dream was ever more empty than his whimsy of adams kingdom or that of the ensuing patriarchs to say the truth it is hard to speak seriously of abrahams kingdom or to think any man to be in earnest who mentions it he was a stranger and a pilgrim in the land where he lived and pretended to no authority beyond his own family which consisted only of a wife and slaves he lived with lot as with his equal and would have no contest with him because they were brethren his wife and servants could neither make up nor be any part of a kingdom in as much as the despotical government both in practice and principle differs from the regal if his kingdom was to be grounded on the paternal right it vanished away of it self he had no child eliezer of damascus for want of a better was to be his heir lot tho his nephew was excluded he durst not own his own wife he had not one foot of land till he bought a field for a buryingplace his three hundred and eighteen men were servants bought according to the custom of those days or their children and the war he made with them was like to gideons enterprise which shows only that god can save by a few as well as by many but makes nothing to our authors purpose for if they had bin as many in number as the army of semiramis they could have no relation to the regal much less to the paternal power for a father dos not buy but beget children  notwithstanding this our author bestows the proud title of lord paramount upon him and transmits it to isaac who was indeed a king like his father great admirable and glorious in wisdom and holiness but utterly void of all worldly splendour or power this spiritual kingdom was inherited by jacob whose title to it was not founded on prerogative of birth but election and peculiar grace but he never enjoyed any other worldly inheritance than the field and cave which abraham had bought for a buryingplace and the goods he had gained in labans service  the example of judah his sentence upon thamar is yet farther from the purpose if it be possible for he was then a member of a private family the fourth son of a father then living neither in possession nor under the promise of the privileges of primogeniture tho ruben simeon and levi fell from it by their sins whatsoever therefore the right was which belonged to the head of the family it must have bin in jacob but as he professed himself a keeper of sheep as his fathers had bin the exercise of that employment was so far from regal that it deserves no explication if that act of judah is to be imputed to a royal power i have as much as i ask he tho living with his father and elder brothers when he came to be of age to have children had the same power over such as were of or came into his family as his father had over him for none can go beyond the power of life and death the same in the utmost extent cannot at the same time equally belong to many if it be divided equally it is no more than that universal liberty which god has given to mankind and every man is a king till he devests himself of his right in consideration of something that he thinks better for him  sect viii nimrod was the first king during the life of chush cham shem and noah the creation is exactly described in the scripture but we know so little of what past between the finishing of it and the flood that our author may say what he pleases and i may leave him to seek his proofs where he can find them in the mean time i utterly deny that any power did remain in the heads of familys after the flood that dos in the least degree resemble the regal in principle or practice if in this i am mistaken such power must have bin in noah and transmitted to one of his sons the scripture says only that he built an altar sacrificed to the lord was a husbandman planted a vineyard and performed such offices as bear nothing of the image of a king for the space of three hundred and fifty years we have reason to believe that his sons after his death continued in the same manner of life and the equality properly belonging to brethren it is not easy to determine whether shem or japhet were the elder but ham is declared to be the younger genesis   and noahs blessing to shem seems to be purely prophetical and spiritual of what should be accomplished in his posterity with which japhet should be persuaded to join if it had bin worldly the whole earth must have bin brought under him and have for ever continued in his race which never was accomplished otherwise than in the spiritual kingdom of christ which relates not to our authors lord paramount  as to earthly kings the first of em was nimrod the sixth son of chush the son of ham noahs younger and accursed son this kingdom was set up about a hundred and thirty years after the flood whilst chush ham shem and noah were yet living whereas if there were any thing of truth in our authors proposition all mankind must have continued under the government of noah whilst he lived and that power must have bin transmitted to shem who lived about three hundred and seventy years after the erection of nimrods kingdom and must have come to japhet if he was the elder but could never come to cham who is declared to have bin certainly the younger and condemned to be a servant to them both much less to the younger son of his son whilst he and those to whom he and his posterity were to be subjects were still living  this rule therefore which the partisans of absolute monarchy fancy to be universal and perpetual falling out in its first beginning directly contrary to what they assert and being never known to have bin recovered were enough to silence them if they had any thing of modesty or regard to truth but the matter may be carried farther for the scripture not only testifys that this kingdom of nimrod was an usurpation void of all right proceeding from the most violent and mischievous vices but exercised with the utmost fury that the most wicked man of the accursed race who set himself up against god and all that is good could be capable of the progress of this kingdom was suitable to its institution that which was begun in wickedness was carried on with madness and produced confusion the mighty hunter whom the best interpreters call a cruel tyrant receding from the simplicity and innocence of the patriarchs who were husbandmen or shepherds arrogating to himself a dominion over shem to whom he and his fathers were to be servants did thereby so peculiarly become the heir of gods curse that whatsoever has bin said to this day of the power that did most directly set it self against god and his people has related literally to the babel that he built or figuratively to that which resembles it in pride cruelty injustice and madness  but the shameless rage of some of these writers is such that they rather choose to ascribe the beginning of their idol to this odious violence than to own it from the consent of a willing people as if they thought that as all action must be suitable to its principle so that which is unjust in its practice ought to scorn to be derived from that which is not detestable in its principle it is hardly worth our pains to examine whether the nations that went from babel after the confusion of languages were more or less than seventy two for they seem not to have gone according to familys but every one to have associated himself to those that understood his speech and the chief of the fathers as noah and his sons were not there or were subject to nimrod each of which points does destroy even in the root all pretense to paternal government besides it is evident in scripture that noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood shem five hundred abraham was born about two hundred and ninety years after the flood and lived one hundred seventy five years he was therefore born under the government of noah and died under that of shem he could not therefore exercise a regal power whilst he lived for that was in shem so that in leaving his country and setting up a family for himself that never acknowledged any superior and never pretending to reign over any other he fully showed he thought himself free and to owe subjection to none and being as far from arrogating to himself any power upon the title of paternity as from acknowledging it in any other left every one to the same liberty  the punctual enumeration of the years that the fathers of the holy seed lived gives us ground of making a more than probable conjecture that they of the collateral lines were in number of days not unequal to them and if that be true ham and chush were alive when nimrod set himself up to be king he must therefore have usurped this power over his father grandfather and great grandfather or which is more probable he turned into violence and oppression the power given him by a multitude which like a flock without a shepherd not knowing whom to obey set him up to be their chief i leave to our author the liberty of choosing which of these two dos best suit with his paternal monarchy but as far as i can understand the first is directly against it as well as against the laws of god and man the other being from the consent of the multitude cannot be extended farther than they would have it nor turned to their prejudice without the most abominable ingratitude and treachery from whence no right can be derived nor any justifiable example taken  nevertheless if our author resolve that abraham was also a king he must presume that shem did emancipate him before he went to seek his fortune this was not a kingly posture but i will not contradict him if i may know over whom he reigned paternal monarchy is exercised by the father of the family over his descendents or such as had bin under the dominion of him whose heir he is but abraham had neither of these those of his nearest kindred continued in mesopotamia as appears by what is said of bethuel and laban he had only lot with him over whom he pretended no right he had no children till he was a hundred years old that is to say he was a king without a subject and then he had but one i have heard that omnisque potestas impatiens consortis erit  lucan   sovereigns do impatiently bear competitors but now i find subjection also does admit of none abrahams kingdom was too great when he had two children and to disburden it ishmael must be expelled soon aster the birth of isaac he observed the same method after the death of sarah he had children by keturah but he gave them gifts and sent em away leaving isaac like a stoical king reigning in and over himself without any other subject till the birth of jacob and esau but his kingdom was not to be of a larger extent than that of his father the two twins could not agree jacob was sent away by his mother he reigned over esau only and it is not easy to determine who was the heir of his worldly kingdom for tho jacob had the birthright we do not find he had any other goods than what he had gotten in labans service if our author say true the right of primogeniture with the dominion perpetually annexed by the laws of god and nature must go to the eldest isaac therefore tho he had not bin deceived could not have conserd it upon the younger for man cannot overthrow what god and nature have instituted jacob in the courtlanguage had bin a double rebel in beguiling his father and supplanting his brother the blessing of being lord over his brethren could not have taken place or if isaac had power and his act was good the prerogative of the elder is not rooted in the law of god or nature but is a matter of convenience only which may be changed at the will of the father whether he know what he dos or not but if this paternal right to dominion were of any value or dominion over men were a thing to be desired why did abraham isaac and jacob content themselves with such a narrow territory when after the death of their ancestors they ought according to that rule to have bin lords of the world all authors conclude that shem was the eldest by birth or preferred by the appointment of god so as the right must have bin in him and from him transmitted to abraham and isaac but if they were so possessed with the contemplation of a heavenly kingdom as not to care for the greatest on earth it is strange that esau whose modesty is not much commended should so far forget his interest as neither to lay claim to the empire of the world nor dispute with his brother the possession of the field and cave bought by abraham but rather to fight for a dwelling on mount seir that was neither possessed by nor promised to his fathers if he was fallen from his right jacob might have claimed it but god was his inheritance and being assured of his blessing he contented himself with what he could gain by his industry in a way that was not at all suitable to the pomp and majesty of a king which way soever therefore the business be turned whether according to isaacs blessing esau should serve jacob or to our authors opinion jacob must serve esau neither of the two was effected in their persons and the kingdom of two being divided into two each of them remained lord of himself  sect ix the power of a father belongs only to a father this leads us to an easy determination of the question which our author thinks insoluble if adam was lord of his children he dos not see how any can be free from the subjection of his parents for as no good man will ever desire to be free from the respect that is due to his father who did beget and educate him no wise man will ever think the like to be due to his brother or nephew that did neither if esau and jacob were equally free if noah as our author affirms divided europe asia and africa amongst his three sons tho he cannot prove it and if seventy two nations under so many heads or kings went from babylon to people the earth about a hundred and thirty years after the flood i know not why according to the same rule and proportion it may not be safely concluded that in four thousand years kings are so multiplied as to be in number equal to the men that are in the world that is to say they are according to the laws of god and nature all free and independent upon each other as shem ham and japhet were and therefore tho adam and noah had reigned alone when there were no men in the world except such as issued from them that is no reason why any other should reign over those that he has not begotten as the right of noah was divided amongst the children he lest and when he was dead no one of them depended on the other because no one of them was father of the other and the right of a father can only belong to him that is so the like must for ever attend every other father in the world this paternal power must necessarily accrue to every father he is a king by the same right as the sons of noah and how numerous soever familys may be upon the increase of mankind they are all free till they agree to recede from their own right and join together in or under one government according to such laws as best please themselves  sect x such as enter into society must in some degree diminish their liberty reason leads them to this no one man or family is able to provide that which is requisite for their convenience or security whilst every one has an equal right to every thing and none acknowledges a superior to determine the controversys that upon such occasions must continually arise and will probably be so many and great that mankind cannot bear them therefore tho i do not believe that bellarmin said a commonwealth could not exercise its power for he could not be ignorant that rome and athens did exercise theirs and that all the regular kingdoms in the world are commonwealths yet there is nothing of absurdity in saying that man cannot continue in the perpetual and entire fruition of the liberty that god has given him the liberty of one is thwarted by that of another and whilst they are all equal none will yield to any otherwise than by a general consent this is the ground of all just governments for violence or fraud can create no right and the same consent gives the form to them all how much soever they differ from each other some small numbers of men living within the precincts of one city have as it were cast into a common stock the right which they had of governing themselves and children and by common consent joining in one body exercised such power over every single person as seemed beneficial to the whole and this men call perfect democracy others chose rather to be governed by a select number of such as most excelled in wisdom and virtue and this according to the signification of the word was called aristocracy or when one man excelled all others the government was put into his hands under the name of monarchy but the wisest best and far the greatest part of mankind rejecting these simple species did form governments mixed or composed of the three as shall be proved hereafter which commonly received their respective denomination from the part that prevailed and did deserve praise or blame as they were well or ill proportioned  it were a solly hereupon to say that the liberty for which we contend is of no use to us since we cannot endure the solitude barbarity weakness want misery and dangers that accompany it whilst we live alone nor can enter into a society without resigning it for the choice of that society and the liberty of framing it according to our own wills for our own good is all we seek this remains to us whilst we sorm governments that we our selves are judges how far it is good for us to recede srom our natural liberty which is of so great importance that from thence only we can know whether we are freemen or slaves and the difference between the best government and the worst dos wholly depend upon a right or wrong exercise of that power if men are naturally free such as have wisdom and understanding will always frame good governments but if they are born under the necessity of a perpetual slavery no wisdom can be of use to them but all must for ever depend on the will of their lords how cruel mad proud or wicked soever they be  sect xi no man comes to command many unless by consent or by force but because i cannot believe god has created man in such a state of misery and slavery as i just now mentioned by discovering the vanity of our authors whimsical patriarchical kingdom i am led to a certain conclusion that every father of a family is free and exempt from the domination of any other as the seventy two that went from babel were it is hard to comprehend how one man can come to be master of many equal to himself in right unless it be by consent or by force if by consent we are at an end of our controversys governments and the magistrates that execute them are created by man they who give a being to them cannot but have a right of regulating limiting and directing them as best pleases themselves and all our authors assertions concerning the absolute power of one man fall to the ground if by force we are to examine how it can be possible or justifiable this subduing by force we call conquest but as he that forces must be stronger than those that are forced to talk of one man who in strength exceeds many millions of men is to go beyond the extravagance of fables and romances this wound is not cured by saying that he first conquers one and then more and with their help others for as to matter of fact the first news we hear of nimrod is that he reigned over a great multitude and built vast citys and we know of no kingdom in the world that did not begin with a greater number than any one man could possibly subdue if they who choose one to be their head did under his conduct subdue others they were fellowconquerors with him and nothing can be more brutish than to think that by their virtue and valor they had purchased perpetual slavery to themselves and their posterity but if it were possible it could not be justifiable and whilst our dispute is concerning right that which ought not to be is no more to be received than if it could not be no right can come by conquest unless there were a right of making that conquest which by reason of the equality that our author confesses to have bin amongst the heads of familys and as i have proved goes into infinity can never be on the aggressors side no man can justly impose any thing upon those who owe him nothing our author therefore who ascribes the enlargement of nimrod s kingdom to usurpation and tyranny might as well have acknowledged the same in the beginning as he says all other authors have done however he ought not to have imputed to sir walter raleigh an approbation of his right as lord or king over his family sor he could never think him to be a lord by the right of a father who by that rule must have lived and died a slave to his fathers that overlivd him whosoever therefore like nimrod grounds his pretensions of right upon usurpation and tyranny declares himself to be like nimrod a usurper and a tyrant that is an enemy to god and man and to have no right at all that which was unjust in its beginning can of it self never change its nature tempus in e says grotius nullam habet vim effectricem he that persists in doing injustice aggravates it and takes upon himself all the guilt of his predecessors but if there be a king in the world that claims a right by conquest and would justify it he might do well to tell whom he conquered when with what assistance and upon what reason he undertook the war for he can ground no title upon the obscurity of an unsearchable antiquity and if he dos it not he ought to be looked upon as a usurping nimrod  sect xii the pretended paternal right is divisible or indivisible if divisible it is extinguished if indivisible universal this paternal right to regality if there be any thing in it is divisible or indivisible if indivisible as adam has but one heir one man is rightly lord of the whole world and neither nimrod nor any of his successors could ever have bin kings nor the seventy two that went from babylon noah survived him near two hundred years shem continued one hundred and fifty years longer the dominion must have bin in him and by him transmitted to his posterity for ever those that call themselves kings in all other nations set themselves up against the law of god and nature this is the man we are to seek out that we may yield obedience to him i know not where to find him but he must be of the race of abraham shem was preferred before his brethren the inheritance that could not be divided must come to him and from him to isaac who was the first of his descendents that outlived him it is pity that jacob did not know this and that the lord of all the earth through ignorance of his title should be forced to keep one of his subjects sheep for wages and strange that he who had wit enough to supplant his brother did so little understand his own bargain as not to know that he had bought the perpetual empire of the world if in conscience he could not take such a price for a dish of pottage it must remain in esau however our lord paramount must come from isaac if the deed of sale made by esau be good we must seek him amongst the jews if he could not so easily divest himself of his right it must remain amongst his descendents who are turks we need not scruple the reception of either since the late scots act tells us that kings derive their royal power from god alone and no difference of religion etc can divert the right of succession but i know not what we shall do if we cannot find this man for de non apparentibus and non existentibus eadem est ratio the right must fall if there be none to inherit if we do not know who he is that has the right we do not know who is near to him all mankind must inherit the right to which every one has an equal title and that which is dominion if in one when it is equally divided among all men is that universal liberty which i assert wherefore i leave it to the choice of such as have inherited our authors opinions to produce this jew or turk that ought to be lord of the whole earth or to prove a better title in some other person and to persuade all the princes and nations of the world to submit if this be not done it must be confessed this paternal right is a mere whimsical fiction and that no man by birth has a right above another or can have any unless by the concession of those who are concerned  if this right to an universal empire be divisible and noah did actually divide it among his three sons if seventy and two absolute monarchs did at once arise out of the multitude that had assembled at babel noah nor his sons nor any of the holy seed nor probably any elder than nimrod having bin there many other monarchs must necessarily have arisen from them also abraham as our author says was a king lot must have bin so also for they were equals his sons ammon and moab had no dependence upon the descendents of abraham ismael and esau set up for themselves and great nations came of them abrahams sons by keturah did so also that is to say every one as soon as he came to be of age to provide for himself did so without retaining any dependence upon the stock from whence he came those of that stock or the head of it pretended to no right over those who went from them nay nearness in blood was so little regarded that tho lot was abrahams brothers son eliezer his servant had bin his heir if he had died childless the like continued among jacobs sons no jurisdiction was given to one above the rest an equal division of land was made amongst em their judges and magistrates were of several tribes and familys without any other preference of one before another than what did arise from the advantages god had given to any particular person this i take to be a proof of the utmost extent and certainty that the equality amongst mankind was then perfect he therefore that will deny it to be so now ought to prove that neither the prophets patriarchs or any other men did ever understand or regard the law delivered by god and nature to mankind or that having bin common and free at the first and so continued for many hundreds of years after the flood it was afterward abolished and a new one introduced he that asserts this must prove it but till it dos appear to us when where how and by whom this was done we may safely believe there is no such thing and that no man is or can be a lord amongst us till we make him so and that by nature we are all brethren  our author by endeavoring farther to illustrate the patriarchical power destroys it and cannot deny to any man the right which he acknowledges to have bin in ismael and esau but if every man has a right of setting up for himself with his family or before he has any he cannot but have a right of joining with others if he pleases as his joining or not joining with others and the choice of those others depends upon his own will he cannot but have a right of judging upon what conditions it is good for him to enter into such a society as must necessarily hinder him from exercising the right which he has originally in himself but as it cannot be imagined that men should generally put such fetters upon themselves unless it were in expectation of a greater good thereby to accrue to them no more can be required to prove that they do voluntarily enter into these societys institute them for their own good and prescribe such rules and forms to them as best please themselves without giving account to any but if every man be free till he enter into such a society as he chooses for his own good and those societys may regulate themselves as they think sit no more can be required to prove the natural equality in which all men are born and continue till they resign it as into a common stock in such measure as they think fit for the constituting of societys for their own good which i assert and our author denies  sect xiii there was no shadow of a paternal kingdom amongst the hebrews nor precept for it our author is so modest to confess that jacobs kingdom consisting of seventy two persons was swallowed up by the power of the greater monarch pharaoh but if this was an act of tyranny it is strange that the sacred and eternal right grounded upon the immutable laws of god and nature should not be restored to gods chosen people when he delivered them from that tyranny why was not jacobs monarchy conferred upon his right heir how came the people to neglect a point of such importance or if they did forget it why did not moses put em in mind of it why did not jacob declare to whom it did belong or if he is understood to have declared it in saying the scepter should not depart srom judah why was it not delivered into his hands or into his heirs if he was hard to be found in a people of one kindred but four degrees removed from jacob their head who were exact in observing genealogys how can we hope to find him after so many thousand years when we do not so much as know from whom we are derived or rather how comes that right which is eternal and universal to have bin nipd in the bud and so abolished before it could take any effect in the world as never to have bin heard of amongst the gentiles nor the people of god either before or after the captivity from the death of jacob to this day this i assert and i give up the cause if i do not prove it to this end i begin with moses and aaron the first rulers of the people who were neither of the eldest tribe according to birth nor the disposition of jacob if he did or could give it to any nor were they of the eldest line of their own tribe and even between them the superiority was given to moses who was the younger as it is said i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet if moses was a king as our author says but i deny and shall hereafter prove the matter is worse he must have bin an usurper of a most unjust dominion over his brethren and this patriarchical power which by the law of god was to be perpetually fixed in his descendents perished with him and his sons continued in an obscure rank amongst the levites joshua of the tribe of ephraim succeeded him othniel was of judah ehud of benjamin barak of napthalim and gideon of manasseh the other judges were of several tribes and they being dead their children lay hid among the common people and we hear no more of em the first king was taken out of the least family of the least and youngest tribe the second whilst the children of the first king were yet alive was the youngest of eight sons of an obscure man in the tribe of judah solomon one of his youngest sons succeeded him ten tribes deserted rehoboam and by the command of god set up joroboam to be their king the kingdom of israel by the destruction of one family passed into another that of judah by gods peculiar promise continued in davids race till the captivity but we know not that the eldest son was always preferred and have no reason to presume it david their most reverenced king left no precept sor it and gave an example to the contrary he did not set up the eldest but the wisest after the captivity they who had most wisdom or valor to defend the people were thought most fit to command and the kingdom at the last came to the asmonean race whilst the posterity of david was buried in the mass of the common people and utterly deprived of all worldly rule or glory if the judges had not a regal power or the regal were only just as instituted by god and eternally annexed to paternity all that they did was evil there could be nothing of justice in the powers exercised by moses joshua gideon samuel and the rest of the judges if the power was regal and just it must have continued in the descendents of the first saul david and solomon could never have bin kings the right failing in them their descendents could inherit none from them and the others after the captivity were guilty of the like injustice  now as the rule is not general to which there is any one just exception there is not one of these examples that would not overthrow our authors doctrine if one deviation from it were lawful another might be and so to infinity but the utmost degree of impudent madness to which perhaps any man in the world has ever arrived is to assert that to be universal and perpetual which cannot be verified by any one example to have bin in any place of the world nor justified by any precept  if it be objected that all these things were done by gods immediate disposition i answer that it were an impious madness to believe that god did perpetually send his prophets to overthrow what he had ordained from the beginning and as it were in spite to bring the minds of men into inextricable confusion and darkness and by particular commands to overthrow his universal and eternal law but to render this point more clear i desire it may be considered that we have but three ways of distinguishing between good and evil    when god by his word reveals it to us    when by his deeds he declares it because that which he dos is good as that which he says is true    by the light of reason which is good in as much as it is from god  and first it cannot be said we have an explicit word for that continuance of the power in the eldest for it appears not and having none we might conclude it to be lest to our liberty for it agrees not with the goodness of god to leave us in a perpetual ignorance of his will in a matter of so great importance nor to have suffered his own people or any other to persist without the least reproof or admonition in a perpetual opposition to it if it had displeased him  to the   d the dispensations of his providence which are the emanations of his will have gone contrary to this pretended law there can therefore be no such thing for god is constant to himself his works do not contradict his word and both of them do equally declare to us that which is good  thirdly if there be any precept that by the light of nature we can in matters of this kind look upon as certain it is that the government of a people should be given to him that can best perform the dutys of it no man has it sor himself or from himsels but for and from those who before he had it were his equals that he may do good to them if there were a man who in wisdom valor justice and purity surpassed all others he might be called a king by nature because he is best able to bear the weight of so great a charge and like a good shepherd to lead the people to good detur digniori is the voice of reason and that we may be sure detur seniori is not so solomon tells us that a wise child is better than an old and foolish king but if this pretended right do not belong to him that is truly the eldest nothing can be more absurd than a fantastical pretense to a right deduced from him that is not so now lest i should be thought to follow my own inventions and call them reason or the light of god in us i desire it may be observed that god himself has ever taken this method when he raised up moses to be the leader of his people he endowed him with the most admirable gifts of his spirit that ever he bestowed upon a man when he chose seventy men to assist him he endowed them with the same spirit joshua had no other title to succeed him than the like evidence of gods presence with him when the people through sin fell into misery he did not seek out their descendents nor such as boasted in a prerogative of birth but showed whom he designed for their deliverer by bestowing such gifts upon him as were required for the performance of his work and never failed of doing this till that miserable sinful people rejecting god and his government desired that which was in use among their accursed neighbors that they might be as like to them in the most shameful slavery to man as in the worship of idols set up against god  but if this pretended right be grounded upon no word or work of god not the reason of man it is to be accounted a mere figment that has nothing of truth in it  sect xiv if the paternal right had included dominion and was to be transferred to a single heir it must perish if he were not known and could be applied to no other person having showed that the first kings were not fathers nor the first fathers kings that all the kings of the jews and gentiles mentioned in scripture came in upon titles different from and inconsistent with that of paternity and that we are not led by the word nor the works of god nor the reason of man or light of nature to believe there is any such thing we may safely conclude there never was any such thing or that it never had any effect which to us is the same it is as ridiculous to think of retrieving that which from the beginning of the world was lost as to create that which never was but i may go farther and affirm that tho there had bin such a right in the first fathers of mankind exercised by them and for some ages individually transmitted to their eldest sons it must necessarily perish since the generations of men are so confused that no man knows his own original and consequently this heir is no where to be found for it is a folly for a man to pretend to an inheritance who cannot prove himself to be the right heir if this be not true i desire to know from which of noahs sons the kings of england france or spain do deduce their original or what reason they can give why the title to dominion which is fancied to be in noah did rather belong to the first of their respective races that attained to the crowns they now enjoy than to the meanest peasant of their kingdoms or how that can be transmitted to them which was not in the first we know that no man can give what he has not that if there be no giver there is no gift if there be no root there can be no branch and that the first point failing all that should be derived from it must necessarily fail  our author who is good at resolving difficultys shows us an easy way out of this strait it is true says he all kings are not natural parents of their subjects yet they either are or are to be reputed the next heirs to those first progenitors who were at first the natural parents of the whole people and in their right succeed to the exercise of the supreme jurisdiction and such heirs are not only lords of their own children but also of their brethren and all those that were subject to their father etc by this means it comes to pass that many a child succeeding a king has the right of a father over many a greyheaded multitude and has the title of pater patriae  an assertion comprehending so many points upon which the most important rights of all mankind do depend might deserve some proof but he being of opinion we ought to take it upon his credit dos not vouchsafe to give us so much as the shadow of any nevertheless being unwilling either crudely to receive or rashly to reject it i shall take the liberty of examining the proposition and hope i may be pardoned if i dwell a little more than ordinarily upon that which is the foundation of his work  we are beholden to him for confessing modestly that all kings are not the natural fathers of their people and sparing us the pains of proving that the kings of persia who reigned from the indies to the hellespont did not beget all the men that lived in those countries or that the kings of france and spain who began to reign before they were five years old were not the natural fathers of the nations under them but if all kings are not fathers none are as they are kings if any one is or ever was the rights of paternity belong to him and to no other who is not so also this must be made evident for matters of such importance require proof and ought not to be taken upon supposition if filmer therefore will pretend that the right of father belongs to any one king he must prove that he is the father of his people for otherwise it dos not appertain to him he is not the man we seek  it is no less absurd to say he is to be reputed heir to the first progenitor for it must be first proved that the nation did descend from one single progenitor without mixture of other races that this progenitor was the man to whom noah according to filmers whimsical division of asia europe and africa among his sons did give the land now inhabited by that people that this division so made was not capable of subdivisions and that this man is by a true and uninterrupted succession descended from the first and eldest line of that progenitor and all fails if every one of these points be not made good if there never was any such man who had that right it cannot be inherited from him if by the same rule that a parcel of the world was allotted to him that parcel might be subdivided amongst his children as they increased the subdivisions may be infinite and the right of dominion thereby destroyed if several nations inhabit the same land they owe obedience to several fathers that which is due to their true father cannot be rendered to him that is not so for he would by that means be deprived of the right which is inseparably annexed to his person and lastly whatsoever the right of an heir may be it can belong only to him that is heir  lest any should be seduced from these plain truths by frivolous suggestions it is good to consider that the title of pater patriae with which our author would cheat us has no relation to the matters of right upon which we dispute it is a figurative speech that may have bin rightly enough applied to some excellent princes on account of their care and love to their people resembling that of a father to his children and can relate to none but those who had it no man that had common sense or valued truth did ever call phalaris dionysius nabis nero or caligula fathers of their countries but monsters that to the utmost of their power endeavored their destruction which is enough to prove that sacred name cannot be given to all and in consequence to none but such as by their virtue piety and good government do deserve it  these matters will yet appear more evident if it be considered that tho noah had reigned as a king that zoroaster as some suppose was ham who reigned over his children and that thereby some right might perhaps be derived to such as succeeded them yet this can have no influence upon such as have not the like original and no man is to be presumed to have it till it be proved since we have proved that many had it not if nimrod set himself up against his grandfather and if ninus who was descended from him in the fifth generation slew him they ill deserved the name and rights of fathers and none but those who have renounced all humanity virtue and common sense can give it to them or their successors if therefore noah and shem had not so much as the shadow of regal power and the actions of nimrod ninus and others who were kings in their times show they did not reign in the right of fathers but were set up in a direct opposition to it the titles of the first kings were not from paternity nor consistent with it  our author therefore who should have proved every point dos neither prove any one nor assert that which is agreeable to divine or human story as to matter of fact and as little conformable to common sense it dos not only appear contrary to his general proposition that all governments have not begun with the paternal power but we do not find that any ever did they who according to his rules should have bin lords of the whole earth lived and died private men whilst the most wicked and boisterous of their children commanded the greatest part of the then inhabited world not excepting even those countries where they spent and ended their days and instead of entering upon the government by the right of fathers or managing it as fathers they did by the most outrageous injustice usurp a violent domination over their brethren and fathers  it may easily be imagined what the right is that could be thus acquired and transmitted to their successors nevertheless our author says all kings either are or ought to be reputed next heirs etc but why reputed if they are not how could any of the accursed race of ham be reputed father of noah or shem to whom he was to be a servant how could nimrod and ninus be reputed fathers of ham and of those whom they ought to have obeyed can reason oblige me to believe that which i know to be false can a lie that is hateful to god and good men not only be excused but enjoined when as he will perhaps say it is for the kings service can i serve two masters or without the most unpardonable injustice repute him to be my father who is not my father and pay the obedience due to him who did beget and educate me to one from whom i never received any good if this be so absurd that no man dares affirm it in the person of any it is as preposterous in relation to his heirs for nimrod the first king could be heir to no man as king and could transmit to no man a right which he had not if it was ridiculous and abominable to say that he was father of chush ham shem and noah it is as ridiculous to say he had the right of father if he was not their father or that his successors inherited it from him if he never had it if there be any way through this it must have accrud to him by the extirpation of all his elders and their races so as he who will assert this pretended right to have bin in the babylonian kings must assert that noah shem japhet ham chush and all nimrods elder brothers with all their descendents were utterly extirpated before he began to reign and all mankind to be descended from him  this must be if nimrod as the scripture says was the first that became mighty in the earth unless men might be kings without having more power than others for chush ham and noah were his elders and progenitors in the direct line and all the sons of shem and japhet and their descendents in the collaterals were to be preferred before him and he could have no right at all that was not directly contrary to those principles which our author says are grounded upon the eternal and indispensable laws of god and nature the like may be said of the seventy two heads of colonys which following as i suppose sir walter raleigh he says went out to people the earth and whom he calls kings for according to the same rule noah shem and japhet with their descendents could not be of the number so that neither nimrod nor the others that established the kingdoms of the world and from whence he thinks all the rest to be derived could have any thing of justice in them unless it were from a root altogether inconsistent with his principles they are therefore false or the establishments beforementioned could have no right if they had none they cannot be reputed to have any for no man can think that to be true which he knows to be false having none they could transmit none to their heirs and successors and if we are to believe that all the kingdoms of the earth are established upon this paternal right it must be proved that all those who in birth ought to have bin preferred before nimrod and the seventy two were extirpated or that the first and true heir of noah did afterward abolish all these unjust usurpations and making himself master of the whole left it to his heirs in whom it continues to this day when this is done i will acknowledge the foundation to be well laid and admit of all that can be rightly built upon it but if this fails all fails the poison of the root continues in the branches if the right heir be not in possession he is not the right who is in possession if the true heir be known he ought to be restored to his right if he be not known the right must perish for nothing can be said to belong to any man if no man knows to whom it belongs and can have no more effect than if it were not this conclusion will continue unmovable tho the division into seventy two kingdoms were allowed which cannot be without destroying the paternal power or subjecting it to be subdivided into as many parcels as there are men which destroys regality for the same thing may be required in every one of the distinct kingdoms and others derived from them or we must know who was that true heir of noah that recovered all how when and to whom he gave the several portions and that every one of them do continue in the possession of those who by this prerogative of birth are raised above the rest of mankind and if they are not it is an impious folly to repute them so to the prejudice of those that are and if they do not appear to the prejudice of all mankind who being equal are thereby made subject to them for as truth is the rule of justice there can be none when he is reputed superior to all who is certainly inferior to  in this place two pages are wanting in the original manuscript   degenerated from that reason which distinguishes men from beasts tho it may be fit to use some ceremonys before a man be admitted to practice physic or set up a trade it is his own skill that makes him a doctor or an artificer and others do but declare it an ass will not leave his stupidity tho he be covered with scarlet and he that is by nature a slave will be so still tho a crown be put upon his head and it is hard to imagine a more violent inversion of the laws of god and nature than to raise him to the throne whom nature intended for the chain or to make them slaves to slaves whom god has endowed with the virtues required in kings nothing can be more preposterous than to impute to god the frantic domination which is often exercised by wicked foolish and vile persons over the wise valiant just and good or to subject the best to the rage of the worst if there be any family therefore in the world that can by the law of god and nature distinct from the ordinance of man pretend to an hereditary right of dominion over any people it must be one that never did and never can produce any person that is not free from all the infirmitys and vices that render him unable to exercise the sovereign power and is endowed with all the virtues required to that end or at least a promise from god verified by experience that the next in blood shall ever be able and fit for that work but since we do not know that any such has yet appeared in the world we have no reason to believe that there is or ever was any such and consequently none upon whom god has conferred the rights that cannot be exercised without them  if there was no shadow of a paternal right in the institution of the kingdoms of saul and david there could be none in those that succeeded rehoboam could have no other than from solomon when he reigned over two tribes and jeroboam over ten it is not possible that both of em could be the next heir of their last common father jacob and it is absurd to say that ought to be reputed which is impossible for our thoughts are ever to be guided by truth or such an appearance of it as dos persuade or convince us  the same title of father is yet more ridiculously or odiously applied to the succeeding kings baasha had no other title to the crown than by killing nadab the son of jeroboam and destroying his family zimri purchased the same honor by the slaughter of elah when he was drunk and dealing with the house of baasha as he had done with that of jeroboam zimri burning himself transferred the same to omri as a reward for bringing him to that extremity as jehu was more fierce than these he seems to have gained a more excellent recompense than any since jeroboam even a conditional promise of a perpetual kingdom but falling from these glorious privileges purchased by his zeal in killing two wicked kings and above one hundred of their brethren shallum must have inherited them by destroying zachary and all that remained of his race this in plain english is no less than to say that whosoever kills a king and invades a crown tho the act and means of accomplishing it be never so detestable dos thereby become father of his country and heir of all the divine privileges annexed to that glorious inheritance and tho i cannot tell whether such a doctrine be more sottish monstrous or impious i dare affirm that if it were received no king in the world could think himself safe in his throne for one day they are already encompast with many dangers but lest pride avarice ambition lust rage and all the vices that usually reign in the hearts of worldly men should not be sufficient to invite em perpetually to disturb mankind through the desire of gaining the power riches and splendour that accompany a crown our author proposes to em the most sacred privileges as a reward of the most execrable crimes he that was stirred up only by the violence of his own nature thought that a kingdom could never be bought at too dear a rate  pro regno velim patriam penates conjugem flammis dare imperia precio quolibet constant been senec theb but if the sacred character of gods anointed or vicegerent and father of a country were added to the other advantages that follow the highest fortunes the most modest and just men would be filled with fury that they might attain to them nay it may be even the best would be the most forward in conspiring against such as reign they who could not be tempted with external pleasures would be most in love with divine privileges and since they should become the sacred ministers of god if they succeeded and traitors or rogues only if they miscarried their only care would be so to lay their designs that they might be surely executed this is a doctrine worthy of filmers invention and heylins approbation which being well weighed will show to all good and just kings how far they are obliged to those who under pretense of advancing their authority fill the minds of men with such notions as are so desperately pernicious to them  sect xvi the ancients chose those to be kings who excelled in the virtues that are most beneficial to civil societys if the israelites whose lawgiver was god had no king in the first institution of their government it is no wonder that other nations should not think themselves obliged to set up any if they who came all of one stock and knew their genealogys when they did institute kings had no regard to our authors chimerical right of inheritance nor were taught by god or his prophets to have any it is not strange that nations who did not know their own original and who probably if not certainly came of several stocks never put themselves to the trouble of seeking one who by his birth deserved to be preferred before others and various changes happening in all kingdoms whereby in process of time the crowns were transported into diverse familys to which the right of inheritance could not without the utmost impiety and madness be imputed such a fancy certainly could only enter into the heads of fools and we know of none so foolish to have harbored it  the grecians amongst others who followed the light of reason knew no other original title to the government of a nation than that wisdom valor and justice which was beneficial to the people these qualitys gave beginning to those governments which we call heroum regna and the veneration paid to such as enjoyed them proceeded from a grateful sense of the good received from them they were thought to be descended from the gods who in virtue and beneficence surpassed other men the same attended their descendents till they came to abuse their power and by their vices showed themselves like to or worse than others those nations did not seek the most ancient but the most worthy and thought such only worthy to be preferred before others who could best perform their duty the spartans knew that hercules and achilles were not their fathers for they were a nation before either of them were born but thinking their children might be like to them in valor they brought them from thebes and epirus to be their kings if our author is of another opinion i desire to know whether the heraclidae or the aeacidae were or ought to be reputed fathers of the lacedaemonians for if the one was the other was not  the same method was followed in italy and they who esteemed themselves  qui rupto robore nati compositi luto millos habuere parents juven sat    aborigines could not set up one to govern them under the title of parent they could pay no veneration to any man under the name of a common father who thought they had none and they who esteemed themselves equal could have no reason to prefer any one unless he were distinguished from others by the virtues that were beneficial to all this may be illustrated by matters of fact romulus and remus the sons of a nun constuprated as is probable by a lusty soldier who was said to be mars for their vigor and valor were made heads of a gathered people we know not that ever they had any children but we are sure they could not be fathers of the people that flocked to them from several places nor in any manner be reputed heirs of him or them that were so for they never knew who was their own father and when their mother came to be discovered they ought to have bin subjects to amulius or numitor they could not be his heirs whilst he lived and were not when he died the government of the latins continued at alba and romulus reigned over those who joined with him in building rome the power not coming to him by inheritance must have bin gained by force or conferred upon him by consent it could not be acquired by force for one man could not force a multitude of fierce and valiant men as they appear to have bin it must therefore have bin by consent and when he aimed at more authority than they were willing to allow they slew him he being dead they fetched numa from among the sabines he was not their father nor heir to their father but a stranger not a conqueror but an unarmed philosopher tullus hostilius had no other title ancus martius was no way related to such as had reigned the first tarquin was the son of a banished corinthian servius tullus came to rome in the belly of his captive mother and could inherit nothing but chains from his vanquished father tarquin the proud murdered him and first took upon himself the title of king sine jussu populi if this t live murder and usurpation be called a conquest and thought to create a right the effect will be but small the conqueror was soon conquered banished and his sons slain after which we hear no more of him or his descendents whatsoever he gained from servius or the people was soon lost and did accrue to those that conquered and ejected him and they might retain what was their own or confer it upon one or more in such manner and measure as best pleased themselves if the regal power which our author says was in the consuls could be divided into two parts limited to a year and suffer such restrictions as the people pleased to lay upon it they might have divided it into as many parcels and put it into such form as best suited with their inclinations and the several magistracys which they did create for the exercise of the kingly and all other powers shows they were to give account to none but themselves  the israelites spartans romans and others who thus framed their governments according to their own will did it not by any peculiar privilege but by a universal right conferred upon them by god and nature they were made of no better clay than others they had no right that dos not as well belong to other nations that is to say the constition of every government is referred to those who are concerned in it and no other has any thing to do with it  yet if it be asserted that the government of rome was paternal or they had none at all i desire to know how they came to have six fathers of several familys whilst they lived under kings and two or more new ones every year afterward or how they came to be so excellent in virtue and fortune as to conquer the best part of the world if they had no government hobbs indeed dos scurrilously deride cicero plato and aristotle caeterosque romanae and graecae anarchiae fautores but it is strange that this anarchy which he resembles to a chaos full of darkness and confusion that can have no strength or regular action should overthrow all the monarchys that came within their reach if as our authors says the best order greatest strength and most stability be in them it must therefore be confessed that these governments are in their various forms rightly instituted by several nations without any regard to inheritance or that these nations have had no governments and were more strong virtuous and happy without government than under it which is most absurd  but if governments arise from the consent of men and are instituted by men according to their own inclinations they do therein seek their own good for the will is ever drawn by some real good or the appearance of it this is that which man seeks by all the regular or irregular motions of his mind reason and passion virtue and vice do herein concur tho they differ vastly in the objects in which each of em thinks this good to consist a people therefore that sets up kings dictators consuls pretors or emperors dos it not that they may be great glorious rich or happy but that it may be well with themselves and their posterity this is not accomplished simply by setting one a few or more men in the administration of powers but by placing the authority in those who may rightly perform their office this is not every mans work valor integrity wisdom industry experience and skill are required for the management of those military and civil affairs that necessarily fall under the care of the chief magistrates he or they therefore may reasonably be advanced above their equals who are most fit to perform the dutys belonging to their stations in order to the public good for which they were instituted  marius sylla catiline julius or octavius caesar and all those who by force or fraud usurped a dominion over their brethren could have no title to this right much less could they become fathers of the people by using all the most wicked means that could well be imagined to destroy them and not being regularly chosen for their virtues or the opinion of them nor preferred on account of any prerogative that had bin from the beginning annexed to their familys they could have no other right than occupation could confer upon them if this can confer a right there is an end of all disputes concerning the laws of god or man if julius and octavius caesar did successively become lords and fathers of their country by slaughtering almost all the senate and such persons as were eminent for nobility or virtue together with the greater part of the people it cannot be denied that a thief who breaks into his neighbors house and kills him is justly master of his estate and may exact the same obedience from his children that they rendered to their father if this right could be transferred to tiberius either through the malice of octavius or the fraud of his wife a wet blanket laid over his face and a few corrupted soldiers could invest caligula with the same a vile rascal pulling claudius out by the heels from behind the hangings where he had hid himself could give it to him a dish of mushrooms well seasoned by the infamous strumpet his wife and a potion prepared for britannicus by locusta could transfer it to her son who was a stranger to his blood galba became heir to it by driving nero to despair and death two common soldiers by exciting his guards to kill him could give a just tittle to the empire of the world to otho who was thought to be the worst man in it if a company of villains in the german army thinking it as fit for them as others to create a father of mankind could conser the dignity upon vitellius and if vespasian causing him to be killed and thrown into a jakes less impure than his life did inherit all the glorious and sacred privileges belonging to that title it is in vain to inquire after any mans right to any thing  but if there be such a thing as right or wrong to be examined by men and any rules set whereby the one may be distinguished from the other these extravagancys can have no effect of right such as commit em are not to be looked upon as fathers but as the most mortal enemies of their respective countries no right is to be acknowledged in any but such as is conferred upon them by those who have the right of conferring and are concerned in the exercise of the power upon such conditions as best please themselves no obedience can be due to him or them who have not a right of commanding which cannot reasonably be conferred upon any that are not esteemed willing and able rightly to execute it this ability to perform the highest works that come within the reach of men and integrity of will not to be diverted from it by any temptation or consideration of private advantages comprehending all that is most commendable in man we may easily see that whenever men act according to the law of their own nature which is reason they can have no other rule to direct them in advancing one above another than the opinion of a mans virtue and ability best to perform the duty incumbent upon him that is by all means to procure the good of the people committed to his charge he is only fit to conduct a ship who understands the art of a pilot when we are sick we seek the assistance of such as are best skilled in physic the command of an army is prudently conferred upon him that has most industry skill experience and valor in like manner he only can according to the rules of nature be advanced to the dignitys of the world who excels in the virtues required for the performance of the dutys annexed to them for he only can answer the end of his institution the law of every i stituted power is to accomplish the end of its institution as creature are to do the will of their creator and in deflecting from it overthro their own being magistrates are distinguished from other men by th power with which the law invests them for the public good he tha cannot or will not procure that good destroys his own being and becomes like to other men in matters of the greatest importance detudigniori is the voice of nature all her most sacred laws are perverted if this be not observed in the disposition of governments and all ar neglected and violated if they are not put into the hands of such as exce in all manner of virtues for they only are worthy of them and they only can have a right who are worthy because they only can perform the end for which they are instituted this may seem strange to those wh have their heads infected with filmers whimsys but to others so certainly grounded upon truth that la razon es porque siempre se ha de tener respeto al fin y causa final por el qual el tal supremo y universal sennor se les pone que es su bien y utilitad y a que no se le converte el tal supremo sennorio in danno pernicie y destruycion porque si assi fuesse no ay que

lo qual de la razon natural y de todas las leyes humanas y divinas es abhorrecido y abhorrescible bar de las casas destr de las indias page     bartolomeo de las casas bishop o chiapa in a treatise written by him and dedicated to the empero charles v concerning the indies makes it the foundation of all his discourse that notwithstanding his grant of all those countries from the pope and his pretensions to conquest he could have no right over any of those nations unless he did in the first place as the principal end regard their good the reason says he is that regard is to be had to the principal end and cause for which a supreme or universal lord is set over them which is their good and profit and not that it should turn to their destruction and ruin for if that should be there is no doubt but from thence forward that power would be tyrannical and unjust as tending more to the interest and profit of that lord than to the public good and profit of the subjects which according to natural reason and the laws of god and man is abhorred and deserves to be abhorred and in another place speaking of the governors who abusing their power brought many troubles and vexations upon the indians he says el yugo y governacion de vuestra magestad importable tirannico y degno de todo abhorrecimiento page     they had rendered his majestys government intolerable and his yoke insupportable tyrannical and most justly abhorred i do not alledg this through an opinion that a spanish bishop is of more authority than another man but to show that these are common notions agreed by all mankind and that the greatest monarchs do neither refuse to hear them or to regulate themselves according to them till they renounce common sense and degenerate into beasts  but if that government be unreasonable and abhorred by the laws of god and man which is not instituted for the good of those who live under it and an empire grounded upon the donation of the pope which amongst those of the roman religion is of great importance and an entire conquest of the people with whom there had bin no former compact do degenerate into a most unjust and detestable tyranny so soon as the supreme lord begins to prefer his own interest or profit before the good of his subjects what shall we say of those who pretend to a right of dominion over free nations as inseparably united to their persons without distinction of age or sex or the least consideration of their infirmitys and vices as if they were not placed in the throne for the good of their people but to enjoy the honors and pleasures that attend the highest fortune what name can be fit for those who have no other title to the places they possess than the most unjust and violent usurpation or being descended from those who for their virtues were by the peoples consent duly advanced to the exercise of a legitimate power and having sworn to administer it according to the conditions upon which it was given for the good of those who gave it turn all to their own pleasure and profit without any care of the public these may be liable to hard censures but those who use them most gently must confess that such an extreme deviation from the end of their institution annuls it and the wound thereby given to the natural and original rights of those nations cannot be cured unless they resume the libertys of which they have bin deprived and return to the ancient custom of choosing those to be magistrates who for their virtues best deserve to be preferred before their brethren and are endowed with those qualitys that best enable men to perform the great end of providing for the public safety  sect xvii god having given the government of the world to no one man nor declared how it should be divided left it to the will of man our authors next inquiry is what becomes of the right of fatherhood in case the crown should escheat for want of an heir whether it does not escheat to the people his answer is it is but the negligence or ignorance of the people to lose the knowledge of the true heir etc and a little below the power is not devolved to the multitude no the kingly power escheats on independent heads of familys all such prime heads have power to consent in the uniting or conferring their fatherly right of sovereign authority on whom they please and he that is so elected claims not his power as a donative from the people but as being substituted by god from whom he receives his royal charter of universal father etc  in my opinion before he had asked what should be done in case the crown should escheat for want of an heir he ought to have proved there had bin a man in the world who had the right in himself and telling who he was have showed how it had bin transmitted for some generations that we might know where to seek his heir and before he accused the multitude of ignorance or negligence in not knowing this heir he ought to have informed us how it may be possible to know him or what it would avail us if we did know him for it is in vain to know to whom a right belongs that never was and never can be executed but we may go farther and affirm that as the universal right must have bin in noah and shem if in any who never exercised it we have reason to believe there never was any such thing and having proved from scripture and human history that the first kingdoms were set up in a direct opposition to this right by nimrod and others he that should seek and find their heirs would only find those who by a most accursed wickedness had usurped and continued a dominion over their fathers contrary to the laws of god and nature and we should neither be more wise nor more happy than we are tho our author should furnish us with certain and authentic genealogys by which we might know the true heirs of nimrod and the seventy two kings that went from babylon who as he supposes gave beginning to all the kingdoms of the earth  moreover if the right be universal it must be in one for the world being butone the whole right of commanding it cannot at the same time be in many and proceed from the ordinance of god or of man it cannot proceed from the ordinance of god for he dos nothing in vain he never gave a right that could not be executed no man can govern that which he dos not so much as know no man did ever know all the world no man therefore did or could govern it and none could be appointed by god to do that which is absolutely impossible to be done for it could not consist with his wisdom we find this in our selves it were a shame for one of us poor weak shortsighted creatures in the disposal of our affairs to appoint such a method as were utterly ineffectual for the preservation of our familys or destructive to them and the blasphemy of imputing to god such an ordinance as would be a reproach to one of us can suit only with the wicked and impudent fury of such as our author who delights in monsters this also shows us that it cannot be from men one or a few may commit follys but mankind dos not universally commit and perpetually persist in any they cannot therefore by a general and permanent authority enact that which is utterly absurd and impossible or if they do they destroy their own nature and can no longer deserve the name of reasonable creatures there can be therefore no such man and the folly of seeking him or his heir that never was may be left to the disciples of filmer  the difficultys are as great if it be said the world might be divided into parcels and we are to seek the heirs of the first possessors for besides that no man can be obliged to seek that which cannot be found all men knowing that caliginosa nocte haec premit deus and that the genealogys of mankind are so confused that unless possibly among the jews we have reason to believe there is not a man in the world who knows his own original it could be of no advantage to us tho we knew that of every one for the division would be of no value unless it were at the first rightly made by him who had all the authority in himself which dos no where appear and rightly deduced to him who according to that division claims a right to the parcel he enjoys and i fear our author would terribly shake the crowns in which the nations of europe are concerned if they should be persuaded to search into the genealogys of their princes and to judge of their rights according to the proofs they should give of titles rightly deduced by succession of blood from the seventy two first kings from whom our author fancys all the kingdoms of the world to be derived  besides tho this were done it would be to no purpose for the seventy two were not sent out by noah nor was he or his sons of that number but they went or were sent from babylon where nimrod reigned who as has bin already proved neither had nor could have any right at all but was a mighty hunter even a proud and cruel tyrant usurping a power to which he had no right and which was perpetually exercised by him and his successors against god and his people from whence i may safely conclude that no right can ever be derived and may justly presume it will be denied by none who are of better morals and of more sound principles in matters of law and religion than filmer and heylin since it is no less absurd to deduce a right from him that had none than to expect pure and wholesome waters from a filthy polluted and poisonous fountain  if it be pretended that some other man since noah had this universal right it must either remain in one single person as his right heir or be divided if in one i desire to know who he is and where we may find him that the empire of the world may be delivered to him but if he cannot be found the business is at an end for every man in the world may pretend himself to be the person and the infinite controversys arising thereupon can never be decided unless either the genealogys of every one from noah were extant and proved or we had a word from heaven with a sufficient testimony of his mission who announces it when this is done twill be time to consider what kind of obedience is due to this wonderfully happy and glorious person but whilst the first appears to be absolutely impossible and we have no promise or reason to expect the other the proposition is to be esteemed one of our authors empty whimsys which cannot be received by mankind unless they come all to be possessed with an epidemical madness which would cast them into that which hobbs calls bellum omnium contra omnes when every mans sword would be drawn against every man if god should so abandon the world to suffer them to fall into such misery  if this pretended right be divided it concerns us to know by whom when how and to whom for the division cannot be of any value unless the right was originally in one that he did exercise this right in making the division that the parcels into which the world is divided are according to the allotment made and that the persons claiming them by virtue of it are the true heirs of those to whom they were first granted many other difficultys may be alleged no less inextricable than these but this seeming sufficient for the present i shall not trouble my self with more promising that when they shall be removed i will propose others or confessing my errors yield up the cause  but if the dominion of the whole world cannot belong to any one man and every one has an equal title to that which should give it or if it did belong to one none did ever exercise it in governing the whole or dividing it or if he did divide it no man knows how when and to whom so that they who lay claim to any parcels can give no testimony of that division nor show any better title than other men derived from his first progenitor to whom it is said to have bin granted and that we have neither a word nor the promise of a word from god to decide the controversys arising thereupon nor any prophet giving testimony of his mission that takes upon him to do it the whole fabric of our authors patriarchical dominion falls to the ground and they who propose these doctrins which if they were received would be a root of perpetual and reconcilable hatred in every man against every man can be accounted no less than ministers of the devil tho they want the abilitys he has sometimes infused into those who have bin employed upon the like occasions and we may justly conclude that god having never given the whole world to be governed by one man nor prescribed any rule for the division of it nor declared where the right of dividing or subdividing that which every man has should terminate we may safely affirm that the whole is for ever left to the will and discretion of man we may enter into form and continue in greater or lesser societys as best pleases our selves the right of paternity as to dominion is at an end and no more remains but the love veneration and obedience which proceeding from a due sense of the benefits of birth and education have their root in gratitude and are esteemed sacred and inviolable by all that are sober and virtuous and as it is impossible to transfer these benefits by inheritance so it is impossible to transfer the rights arising from them no man can be my father but he that did beget me and it is as absurd to say i owe that duty to one who is not my father which i owe to my father as to say he did beget me who did not beget me for the obligation that arises from benefits can only be to him that conferred them it is in vain to say the same is due to his heir for that can take place only when he has but one which in this case signifies nothing for if i being the only son of my father inherit his right and have the same power over my children as he had over me if i had one hundred brothers they must all inherit the same and the law of england which acknowledges one only heir is not general but municipal and is so far from being general as the precept of god and nature that i doubt whether it was ever known or used in any nation of the world beyond our island the words of the apostle if we are children we are therefore heirs and coheirs with christ are the voice of god and nature and as the universal law of god and nature is always the same every one of us who have children have the same right over them as abraham isaac and jacob had over theirs and that right which was not devolved to any one of them but inherited by them all i mean the right of father as father not the peculiar promises which were not according to the law of nature but the election of grace is also inherited by every one of us and ours that is by all mankind but if that which could be inherited was inherited by all and it be impossible that a right of dominion over all can be due to every one then all that is or can be inherited by every one is that exemption from the dominion of another which we call liberty and is the gift of god and nature  sect xviii if a right of dominion were esteemed hereditary according to the law of nature a multitude of destructive and inextricable controversys would thereupon arise there being no such thing therefore according to the law of nature as an hereditary right to the dominion of the world or any part of it nor any one man that can derive to himself a title from the first fathers of mankind by which he can rightly pretend to be preferred before others to that command or a part of it and none can be derived from nimrod or other usurpers who had none in themselves we may justly spare our pains of seeking farther into this matter but as things of the highest importance can never be too fully explained it may not be amiss to observe that if mankind could be brought to believe that such a right of dominion were by the law of god and nature hereditary a great number of the most destructive and inextricable controversys must thereupon arise which the wisdom and goodness of god can never enjoin and nature which is reason can never intend but at present i shall only mention two from whence others must perpetually spring first if there be such a law no human constitution can alter it no length of time can be a defense against it all governments that are not conformable to it are vicious and void even in their root and must be so for ever that which is originally unjust may be justly overthrown we do not know of any at least in that part of the world in which we are most concerned that is established or exercised with an absolute power as by the authors of those opinions is esteemed inseparable from it many as the empire and other states are directly contrary and on that account can have no justice in them it being certain therefore that he or they who exercise those governments have no right that there is a man to whom it dos belong and no man knowing who he is there is no one man who has not as good a title to it as any other there is not therefore one who has not a right as well as any to overthrow that which has none at all he that has no part in the government may destroy it as well as he that has the greatest for he neither has that which god ordained he should have nor can show a title to that which he enjoys from that original prerogative of birth from whence it can only be derived  if it be said that some governments are arbitrary as they ought to be and france turkey and the like be alleged as instances the matter is not mended for we do not only know when those who deserve to be regarded by us were not absolute and how they came to be so but also that those very familys which are now in possession are not of very long continuance had no more title to the original right we speak of than any other men and consequently can have none to this day and tho we cannot perhaps say that the governments of the barbarous eastern nations were ever other than they are yet the known original of them deprives them of all pretense to the patriarchical inheritance and they may be as justly as any other deprived of the power to which they have no title  in the second place tho all mens genealogys were extant and fully verified and it were allowed that the dominion of the world or every part of it did belong to the right heir of the first progenitor or any other to whom the first did rightly assign the parcel which is under question yet it were impossible for us to know who should be esteemed the true heir or according to what rule he should be judged so to be for god has not by a precise word determined it and men cannot agree about it as appears by the various laws and customs of several nations disposing severally of hereditary dominions  it is a folly to say they ought to go to the next in blood for it is not known who is that next some give the preference to him who amongst many competitors is the fewest degrees removed from their common progenitor who first obtained the crown others look only upon the last that possessed it some admit of representation by which means the grandchild of a king by his eldest son is preferred before his second son he being said to represent his dead father who was the eldest others exclude these and advance the younger son who is nearer by one degree to the common progenitor that last enjoyed the crown than the grandchild according to the first rule richard ii was advanced to the crown of england as son of the eldest son of edward iii before his uncles who by one degree were nearer to the last possessor and in pursuance of the second sancho sirnamd the brave second son of alphonso the wise king of castile was preferred before alphonso son of ferdinand his eldest brother according to the law of thanestry which was in force in spain ever since we have had any knowledge of that country as appears by the contest between corbis and orsua decided by combat before scipio africanus continued in full force as long as the kingdom of the goths lasted and was ever highly valued till the house of austria got possession of that country and introduced laws and customs formerly unknown to the inhabitants  the historys of all nations furnish us with innumerable examples of both sorts and whosoever takes upon him to determine which side is in the right ought to show by what authority he undertakes to be the judge of mankind and how the infinite breaches thereby made upon the rights of the governing familys shall be cured without the overthrow of those that he shall condemn and of the nations where such laws have bin in force as he dislikes and till that be done in my opinion no place will afford a better lodging for him that shall impudently assume such a power than the new buildings in moorfields  it is no less hard to decide whether this next heir is to be sought in the male line only or whether females also may be admitted if we follow the first as the law of god and nature the title of our english kings is wholly abolished for not one of them since henry the   st has had the least pretense to an inheritance by the masculine line and if it were necessary we have enough to say of those that were before him  if it be said that the same right belongs to females it ought to be proved that women are as fit as men to perform the office of a king that is as the israelites said to samuel to go in and out before us to judge us and to fight our battles for it were an impious folly to say that god had ordained those for the offices on which the good of mankind so much depends who by nature are unable to perform the dutys of them if on the other side the sweetness gentleness delicacy and tenderness of the sex render them so unfit for manly exercises that they are accounted utterly repugnant to and inconsistent with that modesty which dos so eminently shine in all those that are good amongst them that law of nature which should advance them to the government of men would overthrow its own work and make those to be the heads of nations which cannot be the heads of private familys for as the apostle says the woman is not the head of the man but the man is the head of the women this were no less than to oblige mankind to lay aside the name of reasonable creature for if reason be his nature it cannot enjoin that which is contrary to it self if it be not the definition homo est animal rationale is false and ought no longer to be assumed  if any man think these arguments to be mistaken or misapplid i desire him to enquire of the french nation on what account they have always excluded females and such as descended from them how comes the house of bourbon to be advanced to the throne before a great number of familys that come from the daughters of the house of valois or what title those could have before the daughters of the other lines descended from hugh capet pepin meroveus or pharamond i know not how such questions would be received but i am inclined to think that the wickedness and folly of those who should thereby endeavor to overthrow the most ancient and most venerated constitutions of the greatest nations and by that means to involve them in the most inextricable difficultys would be requited only with stones  it cannot be denied that the most valiant wise learned and best polished nations have always followed the same rule tho the reginarumque sub armis barbaries pars magna jacet lucan par  weak and bar arous acted otherwise and no man ever heard of a queen or a man deriving his title from a female among the ancient civilized nations but if this be not enough the law of god that wholly omits females is sufficient to show that nature which is his handmaid cannot advance them when god describes who should be the king of his people if they would have one and how he should govern no mention is made deuteronomy    of daughters the israelites offered the kingdom to gideon and to his sons god promised and gave it to saul david jeroboam jehu and their sons when all of them save david by their crimes fell from the kingdom the males only were extirpated and the females who had no part in the promises did not fall under the penaltys or the vengeance that was executed upon those familys and we do not in the word of god or in the history of the jews hear of any feminin reign except that which was usurped by athaliah nor that any consideration was had of their descendents in relation to the kingdom which is enough to show that it is not according to the law of god nor to the law of nature which cannot differ from it so that females or such as derive their right by inheritance from females must have it from some other law or they can have none at all  but tho this question were authentically decided and concluded that females might or might not succeed we should not be at the end of our contests for if they were excluded it would not from thence follow as in france that their descendents should be so also for the privilege which is denied to them because they cannot without receding from the modesty and gentleness of the sex take upon them to execute all the dutys required may be transferred to their children as henry the second and henry the seventh were admitted tho their mothers were rejected  if it be said that every nation ought in this to follow their own constitutions we are at an end of our controversys for they ought not to be followed unless they are rightly made they cannot be rightly made if they are contrary to the universal law of god and nature if there be a general rule it is impossible but some of them being directly contrary to each other must be contrary to it if therefore all of them are to be followed there can be no general law given to all but every people is by god and nature left to the liberty of regulating these matters relating to themselves according to their own prudence or convenience and this seems to be so certainly true that whosoever dos as our author propose doctrins to the contrary must either be thought rashly to utter that which he dos not understand or maliciously to cast balls of division among all nations whereby every mans sword would be drawn against every man to the total subversion of all order and government  sect xix kings cannot confer the right of father upon princes nor princes upon kings lest what has bin said before by our author should not be sufficient to accomplish his design of bringing confusion upon mankind and some may yet lie still for want of knowing at whose command he should cut his brothers throat if he has not power or courage to set up a title for himself he has a new project that would certainly do his work if it were received not content with the absurditys and untruths already uttered in giving the incommunicable right of fathers not only to those who as is manifestly testified by sacred and profane historys did usurp a power over their fathers or such as owed no manner of obedience to them and justifying those usurpations which are most odious to god and all good men he now fancys a kingdom so gotten may escheat for want of an heir whereas there is no need of seeking any if usurpation can confer a right and that he who gets the power into his hands ought to be reputed the right heir of the first progenitor for such a one will seldom be wanting if violence and fraud be justified by the command of god and nations stand obliged to render obedience till a stronger or more successful villain throws him from the throne he had invaded but if it should come to pass that no man would step into the vacant place he has a new way of depriving the people of their right to provide for the government of themselves because says he the dependency of ancient familys is often obscure and worn out of knowledge therefore the wisdom of all or most princes has thought fit many times to adopt those for heads of familys and princes of provinces whose merits abilitys or fortunes have ennobled them and made them fit and capable of such royal favors all such prime heads and fathers have power to consent to the uniting and conferring of their fatherly right and sovereignty on whom they please etc  i may justly ask how any one or more familys come to be esteemed more ancient than others if all are descended from one common father as the scriptures testify or to what purpose it were to inquire what familys were the most ancient if there were any such when the youngest and most mean by usurpation gets an absolute right of dominion over the eldest tho his own progenitors as nimrod did but i may certainly conclude that whatever the right be that belongs to those ancient familys it is inherent in them and cannot be conferred on any other by any human power for it proceeds from nature only the duty i owe to my father dos not arise from an usurped or delegated power but from my birth derived from him and it is as impossible for any man to usurp or receive by the grant of another the right of a father over me as for him to become or pretend to be made my father by another who did not beget me but if he say true this right of father dos not arise from nature nor the obedience that i owe to him that begot me from the benefits which i received but is merely an artificial thing depending upon the will of another and that we may be sure there can be no error in this our author attributes it to the wisdom of princes but before this comes to be authentic we must at the least be sure that all princes have this great and profound wisdom which our author acknowledges to be in them and which is certainly necessary for the doing of such great things if they were referred to them they seem to us to be born like other men and to be generally no wiser than other men we are not obliged to believe that nebuchadnezzar was wise till god had given him the heart of a man or that his grandson belshazzar who being laid in the balance was found too light had any such profound wisdom ahasuerus showed it not in appointing all the people of god to be slain upon a lie told to him by a rascal and the matter was not very much mended when being informed of the truth he gave em leave to kill as many of their enemies as they pleased the hardness of pharaohs heart and the overthrow thereby brought upon himself and people dos not argue so profound a judgment as our author presumes every prince must have and it is not probable that samuel would have told saul he had done foolishly if kings had always bin so exceeding wise nay if wisdom had bin annexed to the character solomon might have spared the pains of asking it from god and rehoboam must have had it not to multiply examples out of scripture it is believed that xerxes had not inflicted stripes upon the sea for breaking his navy in pieces if he had bin so very wise caligula for the same reason might have saved the labor of making love to the moon or have chosen a fitter subject to advance to the consulat than his horse incitatus nero had not endeavored to make a woman of sueton a man nor married a man as a woman many other examples might be alleged to show that kings are not always wise and not only the roman satyrist who says quicquid delirant reges etc shows that he did horat not believe them to be generally wiser than other men but solomon himself judges them to be as liable to infirmitys when he prefers a wise child before an old and foolish king if therefore the strength of our authors argument lies in the certainty of the wisdom of kings it can be of no value till he proves it to be more universal in them than history or experience will permit us to believe nay if there be truth or wisdom in the scripture which frequently represents the wicked man as a fool we cannot think that all kings are wise unless it be proved that none of them have bin wicked and when this is performed by filmers disciples i shall confess my error  men give testimony of their wisdom when they undertake that which they ought to do and rightly perform that which they undertake both which points do utterly fail in the subject of our discourse we have often heard of such as have adopted those to be their sons who were not so and some civil laws approve it this signifies no more than that such a man either through affection to one who is not his son or to his parents or for some other reason takes him into his family and shows kindness to him as to his son but the adoption of fathers is a whimsical piece of nonsense if this be capable of an aggravation i think none can be greater than not to leave it to my own discretion who having no father may resolve to pay the duty i owed to my father to one who may have showed kindness to me but for another to impose a father upon a man or a people composed of fathers or such as have fathers whereby they should be deprived of that natural honor and right which he makes the foundation of his discourse is the utmost of all absurditys if any prince therefore has ever undertaken to appoint fathers of his people he cannot be accounted a man of profound wisdom but a fool or a madman and his acts can be of no value but if the thing were consonant to nature and referred to the will of princes which i absolutely deny the frequent extravagancys committed by them in the elevation of their favorites shows that they intend not to make them fathers of the people or know not what they do when they do it  to choose or institute a father is nonsense in the very term but if any were to be chosen to perform the office of fathers to such as have none and are not of age to provide for themselves as men do tutors or guardians for orphans none could be capable of being elected but such as in kindness to the person they were to take under their care did most resemble his true father and had the virtues and abilitys required rightly to provide for his good if this fails all right ceases and such a corruption is introduced as we saw in our court of wards which the nation could not bear when the institution was perverted and the king who ought to have taken a tender care of the wards and their estates delivered em as a prey to those whom he favored  our author ridiculously attributes the title and authority of father to the word prince for it has none in it and signifies no more than a man who in some kind is more eminent than the vulgar in this sense trecenti romanae juventutis principes t live mutius scaevola told porsenna that three hundred princes of the roman youth had conspired against him by which he could not mean that three hundred fathers of the roman youth but three hundred roman young men had conspired and they could not be fathers of the city unless they had bin fathers of their own fathers princeps senatus was understood in the same sense and t sempronius the censor choosing q fabius t live l   maximus to that honor gave for a reason se lecturum q fabium maximum quem tum principem romanae civitatis esse vel annibale judice dicturus esset which could not be understood that hannibal thought him to be the father or lord of the city for he knew he was not but the man who for wisdom and valor was the most eminent in it  the like are and ought to be the princes of every nation and tho something of honor may justly be attributed to the descendents of such as have done great services to their country yet they who degenerate from them cannot be esteemed princes much less can such honors or rights be conferred upon courtcreatures or favorites tiberius caligula claudius nero galba and others could advance macro pallas narcissus tigellinus vinnius laco and the like to the highest degrees of riches and power but they still continued to be villains and so they died  no wise or good man ever thought otherwise of those who through the folly of princes have bin advanced to the highest places in several countries the madness of attributing to them a paternal power seems to have bin peculiarly reserved to complete the insamy of our author for he only could acknowledge a cooptitious father or give to another man the power of choosing him i confess that a man in his infancy may have bin exposed like moses cyrus oedipus romulus he may have bin taken in war or by the charity of some good person saved from the teeth of wild beasts or from the sword by which his parents fell and may have bin educated with that care which fathers usually have of their children it is reasonable that such a one in the whole course of his life should pay that veneration and obedience to him who gave him as it were a second birth which was due to his natural father and this tho improperly may be called an adoption but to think that any man can assume it to himself or confer it upon another and thereby arrogate to himself the service and obedience which by the most tender and sacred laws of nature we owe to those from whom we receive birth and education is the most preposterous folly that hitherto has ever entered into the heart of man  our author nevertheless is not ashamed of it and gives reasons no way unsuitable to the proposition men are says he adopted fathers of provinces for their abilitys merits or fortunes but these abilitys can simply deserve nothing for it they are ill employed they are the worst of vices and the most powerful instruments of mischief merits in regard of another are nothing unless they be to him and he alone can merit from me the respect due to a father who has conferred benefits upon me in some measure proportionable to those which we usually receive from our fathers and the world may judge whether all the courtministers and favorites that we have known do upon this account deserve to be esteemed fathers of nations but to allow this on account of their fortunes is if possible more extravagant than any thing that has bin yet uttered by this account mazarin must have bin father of the french nation the same right was inherited by his chaste niece and remained in her till she and her silly husband dissipated the treasures which her uncle had torn from the bowels of that people the partisans may generally claim the same right over the provinces they have pillaged old audley dog smith bp duppa brownloe child dashwood fox etc are to be esteemed fathers of the people of england this doctrine is perfectly canonical if filmer and heylin were good divines and legal if they judged more rightly touching matters of law but if it be absurd and detestable they are to be reputed men who by attributing the highest honors to the vilest wretches of the world for what they had gained by the most abominable means endeavor to increase those vices which are already come to such a height that they can by no other way be brought to a greater daily experience too plainly shows with what rage avarice usually fills the hearts of men there are not many destructive villanys committed in the world that do not proceed from it in this respect it is called idolatry and the root of all evil solomon warns us to beware of such as make have to grow rich and says they shall not be innocent but it is no matter what the prophets the apostles or the wisest of men say of riches and the ways of gaining them for our author tells us that men of the greatest fortunes without examining how they came to them or what use they make of them deserve to be made fathers of provinces  but this is not his only quarrel with all that is just and good his whole book goes directly against the letter and spirit of the scripture the work of all those whom god in several ages has raised up to announce his word was to abate the lusts and passions that arise in the hearts of men to show the vanity of worldly enjoyments with the dangers that accompany riches and honors and to raise our hearts to the love of those treasures that perish not honest and wise men following the light of nature have in some measure imitated this such as lived private lives as plato socrates epictetus and others made it their business to abate mens lusts by showing the folly of seeking vain honors useless riches or unsatissying pleasures and those who were like to them if they were raised to supreme magistracys have endeavored by the severest punishments to restrain men from commiting the crimes by which riches are most commonly gained but filmer and heylin lead us into a new way if they deserve credit whosoever would become supreme lord and father of his country absolute sacred and inviolable is only to kill him that is in the head of the government usurpation confers an equal right with election or inheritance we are to look upon the power not the ways by which it is obtained possession only is to be regarded and men must venerate the present power as set up by god tho gained by violence treachery or poison children must not impose laws upon nor examine the actions of their father those who are a little more modest and would content themselves with the honor of being fathers and lords only of provinces if they get riches by the savor of the king or the favor of the king by riches may receive that honor from him the lord paramount may make them peculiar lords of each province as sacred as himself and by that means every man shall have an immediate and a subaltern father this would be a spur to excite even the most sleeping lusts and a poison that would fill the gentlest spirits with the most violent furys if men should believe this there would hardly be found one of whom it might not be said hac spe minanti fulmen occurret jovi senec theb no more is required to fill the world with fire and blood than the reception of these precepts no man can look upon that as a wickedness which shall render him sacred nor fear to attempt that which shall make him gods vicegerent and i doubt whether the wickedness of filling mens heads with such notions was ever equaled unless by him who said ye shall not die but be as gods  but since our author is pleased to teach us these strange things i wish he would also have told us how many men in every nation ought to be looked upon as adopted fathers what proportion of riches ability or merit is naturally or divinely required to make them capable of this sublime character whether the right of this chimerical father dos not destroy that of the natural or whether both continue in force and men thereby stand obliged in despite of what christ said to serve two masters for if the right of my artificial father arise from any act of the king in favor of his riches abilitys or merit i ought to know whether he is to excel in all or any one of these points how far and which of em gives the preference since it is impossible for me to determine whether my father who may be wise tho not rich is thereby divested of his right and it comes to be transferred to another who may be rich tho not wise nor of any personal merit at all till that point be decided or so much as to guess when i am emancipated from the duty i owe to him by whom i was begotten and educated unless i know whether he be fallen from his right through want of merit wisdom or estate and that can never be till it be determined that he has forfeited his right by being defective in all or any of the three and what proportion of merit wisdom or estate is required in him sor the enjoyment of his right or in another that would acquire it for no man can succeed to the right of another unless the first possessor be rightly deprived of it and it cannot belong to them both because common sense universally teaches that two distinct persons cannot at the same time and in the same degree have an equal right to the same individual thing  the right of father cannot therefore be conferred upon princes by kings but must for ever follow the rule of nature the character of a father is indelible and incommunicable the duty of children arising from benefits received is perpetual because they can never not have received them and can be due only to him from whom they are received for these reasons we see that such as our author calls princes cannot confer it upon a king for they cannot give what they have not in themselves they who have nothing can give nothing they who are only supposititious cannot make another to be real and the whimsy of kings making princes to be fathers and princes conferring that right on kings comes to nothing  sect xx all just magistratical power is from the people having proved that the right of a father proceeds from the generation and education of his children that no man can have that right over those whom he has not begotten and educated that every man has it over those who owe their birth and education to him that all the sons of noah abraham isaac jacob and others did equally inherit it that by the same reasons it dos for ever belong to every man that begets children it plainly appears that no father can have a right over others unless it be by them granted to him and that he receive his right from those who granted it but our author with an admirable sagacity peculiar to himself discovers and with equal confidence tells us that that which is from the people or the chief heads of them is not from the people he that is so elected says he claims not his right from the people as a donative but from god that is if i mistake not romulus was not made king of the romans by that people but by god those men being newly gathered together had two fathers tho neither of them had any children and no man knew who was their father nor which of em was the elder but romulus by the slaughter of his brother decided all questions and purchased to himself a royal charter from god and the act of the people which conferred the power on him was the act of god we had formerly learnt that whatsoever was done by monarchs was to be imputed to god and that whosoever murdered the father of a people acquired the same right to himself but now it seems that nations also have the same privilege and that god dos what they do now i understand why it was said of old vox populi est vox dei but if it was so in regard of romulus the same must be confessed of tullus hostilius ancus martius tarquinius priscus and servius tullus who being all strangers to each other and most of them aliens also were successively advanced by the same people without any respect to the children relations or heirs of their predecessors and i cannot comprehend why the act of the same people should not have the same virtue and be equally attributed to god when they gave the same or more power to consuls military tribunes decemviri or dictators or why the same divine character should not be in the same manner conferred upon any magistracys that by any people have bin are or shall be at any time erected for the same ends  upon the same grounds we may conclude that no privilege is peculiarly annexed to any form of government but that all magistrates are equally the ministers of god who perform the work for which they were instituted and that the people which institutes them may proportion regulate and terminate their power as to time measure and number of persons as seems most convenient to themselves which can be no other than their own good for it cannot be imagined that a multitude of people should send for numa or any other person to whom they owed nothing to reign over em that he might live in glory and pleasure or for any other reason than that it might be good for them and their posterity this shows the work of all magistrates to be always and every where the same even the doing of justice and procuring the welfare of those that create them this we learn from common sense plato aristotle cicero and the best human authors lay it as an unmovable foundation upon which they build their arguments relating to matters of that nature and the apostle from better authority declares romans    that rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil will thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shall have praise of the same for he is the minister of god unto thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he bears not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil  tim   and the reason he gives for praying for kings and all that are in authority is that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty but if this be the work of the magistrate and the glorious name of gods minister be given to him for the performance of it we may easily see to whom that title belongs his children and servants ye are whose works ye do he therefore and he only is the servant of god who dos the work of god who is a terror to those that do evil and a praise to those that do well who bears the sword for the punishment of wickedness and vice and so governs that the people may live quietly in all godliness and honesty the order of his institution is inverted and the institution vacated if the power be turned to the praise of those that do evil and becomes a terror to such as do well and that none who live honestly and justly can be quiet under it if god be the fountain of justice mercy and truth and those his servants who walk in them no exercise of violence fraud cruelty pride or avarice is patronized by him and they who are the authors of those villanys cannot but be the ministers of him who sets himself up against god because it is impossible that truth and falsehood mercy and cruelty justice and the most violent oppression can proceed from the same root it was a folly and a lie in those jews to call themselves the children of abraham who did not the works of abraham and christ declared them to be the children john      of the devil whose works they did which words proceeding from the eternal truth do as well indicate to us whose child and servant every man is to be accounted as to those who first heard them  if our authors former assertions were void of judgment and truth his next clause shows a great defect in his memory and contradicts the former the judgments of god says he who has power to give and take away kingdoms are most just yet the ministry of men who execute gods judgments without commission is sinful and damnable if it be true as he says that we are to look at the power not the ways by which it is gained and that he who has it whether it be by usurpation conquest or any other means is to be accounted as father or right heir to the father of the people to which title the most sublime and divine privileges are annexed a man who by the most wicked and unjust actions advances himself to the power becomes immediately the father of the people and the minister of god which i take to be a piece of divinity worthy our author and his disciples  it may be doubted what he means by a commission from god for we know of none but what is outwardly by his word or inwardly by his spirit and i am apt to think that neither he nor his abettors allowing of either as to the point in question he dos foully prevaricate in alleging that which he thinks cannot be of any effect if any man should say that the word of god to moses joshua ehud gideon samuel jeroboam and jehu or any others are in the like cases rules to be observed by all because that which was from god was good that which was good is good and he that dos good is justified by it he would probably tell us that what was good in them is not good in others and that the word of god dos justify those only to whom it is spoken that is to say no man can execute the just judgments of god to the benefit of mankind according to the example of those servants of god without damnable sin unless he have a precise word particularly directed to him for it as moses had but if any man should pretend that such a word was come to him he would be accounted an enthusiast and obtain no credit so that which way soever the clause be taken it appears to be full of fraud confessing only in the theory that which he thinks can never be brought into practice that his beloved villanys may be thereby secured and that the glorious examples of the most heroic actions performed by the best and wisest men that ever were in the world for the benefit of mankind may never be imitated  the next clause shows that i did our author no wrong in saying that he gave a right to usurpation for he plainly says that whether the prince be the supreme father of his people or the true heir of such a father or whether he come to the crown by usurpation or election of the nobles or people or by any other way whatsoever etc it is the only right and authority of the natural father in the   d chap sect   it skills not which way the king comes by his power whether by election donation succession or by any other means and in another place that we are to regard the power not the means by which it is gained to which i need say no more than that i cannot sufficiently admire the ingeniously invented title of father by usurpation and confess that since there is such a thing in the world to which not only private men but whole nations owe obedience whatsoever has bin said anciently as was thought to express the highest excess of fury and injustice as jus datum sceleri jus omne in ferro est situm lucan etc jus licet in jugulos nostros sibi fecerit ense sylla potens mariusque ferox and cinna cruentus caesareaeque domus series were solid truths good law and divinity which did not only signify the actual exercise of the power but induced a conscientious obligation of obeying it the powers so gained did carry in themselves the most sacred and inviolable rights and the actors of the most detestable villanys thereby became the ministers of god and the fathers of their subdued people or if this be not true it cannot be denied that filmer and his followers in the most impudent and outrageous blasphemy have surpast all that have gone before em  to confirm his assertion he gives us a wonderful explanation of the fisth commandment which he says enjoins obedience to princes under the terms of honor thy father and thy mother drawing this inference that as all power is in the father the prince who has it cannot be restrained by any law which being grounded upon the perfect likeness between kings and fathers no man can deny it to be true but if claudius was the father of the roman people i suppose the chaste messalina was the mother and to be honored by virtue of the same commandment but then i fear that such as met her in the most obscene places were not only guilty of adultery but of incest the same honor must needs belong to nero and his virtuous poppaea unless it were transferred to his newmade woman sporus or perhaps he himself was the mother and the glorious title of pater patriae belonged to the rascal who married him as a woman the like may be said of agathocles dionysius phalaris busiris machanidas peter the cruel of castile christiern of denmark the last princes of the house of valois in france and philip the second of spain those actions of theirs which men have ever esteemed most detestable and the whole course of their abominable government did not proceed from pride avarice cruelty madness and lust but from the tender care of most pious fathers tacitus sadly describes the state of his country vrbs incendiis vastata consumptis antiquissimis delubris ipso capitolio civium manibus incenso pollutae ceremoniae magna adulteria plenum exiliis mare infecti caedibus scopuli atrocius in vrbe saevitum nobilitas opes omissi vel gesti honores pro crimine and ob virtutes certissimum exitium but he was to blame all this proceeded from the ardency of a paternal affection when nero by the death of helvidius priscus and thraseas endeavored to cut up virtue by the roots ipsam exscindere virtutem he did it because he knew it was good for the world that there should be no virtuous man in it when he fired the city and when caligula wished the people had but one neck that he might strike it off at one blow they did it through a prudent care of their childrens good knowing it would be for their advantage to be destroyed and that the empty desolated world would be no more troubled with popular seditions by the same rule pharaoh eglon nebuchodonosor antiochus herod and the like were fathers of the hebrews and without looking far backward or depending upon the faith of history we may enumerate many princes who in a perpetual care of their people have not yielded to nero or caligula if our author say true all those actions of theirs which we have ever attributed to the utmost excess of pride cruelty avarice and perfidiousness proceeded from their princely wisdom and fatherly kindness to the nations under em and we are beholden to him for the discovery of so great a mystery which has bin hid from mankind from the beginning of the world to this day if not we may still look upon them as children of the devil and continue to believe that princes as well as other magistrates were set up by the people for the public good that the praises given to such as are wise just and good are purely personal and can belong only to those who by a due exercise of their power do deserve it and to no others  chap ii sect i that it is natural for nations to govern or to choose governors and that virtue only gives a natural preference of one man above another or reason why one should be chosen rather than another in this chapter our author fights valiantly against bellarmin and suarez seeming to think himself victorious if he can show that either of them has contradicted the other or himself but being no way concerned in them i shall leave their followers to defend their quarrel my work is to seek after truth and tho they may have said some things in matters not concerning their beloved cause of popery that are agreeable to reason law or scripture i have little hope of finding it among those who apply themselves chiefly to school sophistry as the best means to support idolatry that which i maintain is the cause of mankind which ought not to suffer tho champions of corrupt principles have weakly defended or maliciously betrayed it and therefore not at all relying on their authority i intend to reject whatsoever they say that agrees not with reason scripture or the approved examples of the best polished nations he also attacks plato and aristotle upon whose opinions i set a far greater value in as much as they seem to have penetrated more deeply into the secrets of human nature and not only to have judged more rightly of the interests of mankind but also to have comprehended in their writings the wisdom of the grecians with all that they had learned from the phaenicians egyptians and hebrews which may lead us to the discovery of the truth we seek if this be our work the question is not whether it be a paradox or a received opinion that people naturally govern or choose governors but whether it be true or not for many paradoxes are true and the most gross errors have often bin most common tho i hope to prove that what he calls a paradox is not only true but a truth planted in the hearts of men and acknowledged so to be by all that have hearkened to the voice of nature and disapproved by none but such as through wickedness stupidity or baseness of spirit seem to have degenerated into the worst of beasts and to have retained nothing of men but the outward shape or the ability of doing those mischiefs which they have learned from their master the devil  we have already seen that the patriarchical power resembles not the regal in principle or practice that the beginning and continuance of regal power was contrary to and inconsistent with the patriarchical that the first fathers of mankind left all their children independent on each other and in an equal liberty of providing for themselves that every man continued in this liberty till the number so increased that they became troublesome and dangerous to each other and finding no other remedy to the disorders growing or like to grow among them joined many familys into one civil body that they might the better provide for the convenience safety and defense of themselves and their children this was a collation of every mans private right into a public stock and no one having any other right than what was common to all except it were that of fathers over their children they were all equally free when their fathers were dead and nothing could induce em to join and lessen that natural liberty by joining in societys but the hopes of a public advantage such as were wise and valiant procured it by setting up regular governments and placing the best men in the administration whilst the weakest and basest fell under the power of the most boisterous and violent of their neighbors those of the first sort had their root in wisdom and justice and are called lawful kingdoms or commonwealths and the rules by which they are governed are known by the name of laws these governments have ever bin the nurses of virtue the nations living under them have flourished in peace and happiness or made wars with glory and advantage whereas the other sort springing from violence and wrong have ever gone under the odious title of tyrannys and by fomenting vices like to those from whence they grew have brought shame and misery upon those who were subject to them this appears so plainly in scripture that the assertors of liberty want no other patron than god himself and his word so fully justifies what we contend for that it were not necessary to make use of human authority if our adversarys did not oblige us to examine such as are cited by them this in our present case would be an easy work if our author had rightly marked the passages he would make use of or had bin faithful in his interpretation or explication of such as he truly cites but failing grossly in both it is hard to trace him  he cites the    th chapter of the third book of aristotles politics and i do not find there is more than twelve or tho that wound might be cured by saying the words are in the twelfth his fraud in perverting the sense were unpardonable tho the other mistake be past over it is true that aristotle dos there seem to doubt whether there be any such thing as one man naturally a lord over many citizens since a city consists of equals but in the whole scope of that chapter book and his other writings he fully shows his doubt did not arise from an imagination that one man could naturally inherit a right of dominion over many not descended from him or that they were born under a necessity of being slaves to him for such fancys can proceed only from distempered brains but that civil societys aiming at the public good those who by nature were endowed with such virtues or talents as were most beneficial to them ought to be preferred and nothing can be more contrary to the frantic whimsy of our author who fancys an hereditary prerogative of dominion inherent to a person as father of a people or heir or to be reputed heir of the first father when it is certain he is not but that either he or his predecessor came in by election or usurpation than to show that it is only wisdom justice valor and other commendable virtues which are not hereditary that can give the preserence and that the only reason why it should be given is that men so qualified can better than others accomplish the end for which societys are constituted arst pol for tho says he all are equally free all are not equally endowed with those virtues that render liberty safe prosperous and happy that equality which is just among equals is just only among equals but such as are base ignorant vicious slothful or cowardly are not equal in natural or acquired virtues to the generous wise valiant and industrious nor equally useful to the societys in which they live they cannot therefore have an equal part in the government of em they cannot equally provide for the common good and it is not a personal but a public benefit that is sought in their constitution and continuance there may be a hundred thousand men in an army who are all equally free but they only are naturally most fit to be commanders or leaders who most excel in the virtues required for the right performance of those offices and that not because it is good for them to be raised above their brethren but because it is good for their brethren to be guided by them as it is ever good to be governed by the wisest and the best if the nature of man be reason detur digniori in matters of this kind is the voice of nature and it were not only a deviation from reason but a most desperate and mischievous madness for a company going to the indies to give the guidance of their ship to the son of the best pilot in the world if he want the skill required to that employment or to one who was maliciously set to destroy them and he only can have a right grounded upon the dictates of nature to be advanced to the helm who best knows how to govern it and has given the best testimonys of his integrity and intentions to employ his skill for the good of those that are embarked but as the work of a magistrate especially if he be the supreme is the highest noblest and most difficult that can be committed to the charge of a man a more excellent virtue is required in the person to be advanced to it than for any other and he that is most excellent in that virtue is reasonably and naturally to be preferred before any other aristotle having this in his view seems to think that those who believed it not to be natural for one man to be lord of all the citizens since a city consists of equals had not observed that inequality of endowments virtues and abilitys in men which render some more fit than others for the performance of their dutys and the work intended but it will not be found as i suppose that he did ever dream of a natural superiority that any man could ever have in a civil society unless it be such a superiority in virtue as most conduces to the public good  he confirms this in proceeding to examine the different sorts of governments according to the different dispositions of nations and is so bold to say that a popular government is the best for a people who are naturally generous and warlike that the government of a few suits best with those among whom a few men are found to excel others in those virtues that are profitable to societys and that the government of one is good when that one dos so far surpass all others in those virtues that he has more of them than all the rest of the people together and for the same reason that induced him to believe that equality is just amongst equals he concludes inequality of power to be most unjust unless there be inequality of merit and equality of power to be so also when there is inequality of virtue that being the only rule by which every mans part ought to be regulated  but if it be neither reasonable nor just that those who are not equal in virtue should be made equal in power or that such as are equal in virtue should be unequal in power the most brutal and abominable of all extravagancys is to make one or a few who in virtue and abilitys to perform civil functions are inferior to others superior to all in power and the miserys suffered by those nations who inverting the laws of nature and reason have placed children or men of no virtue in the government when men that excelled in all virtues were not wanting do so far manifest this truth that the pains of proving it may be spared  it is not necessary for me to inquire whether it be possible to find such a man as aristotle calls natura regem or whether he intended to recommend alexander to the world for the man designed by god and nature to be king over all because no man was equal to him in the virtues that were beneficial to all for pursuing my position that virtue only can give a just and natural preference i ingenuously confess that when such a man or race of men as he describes shall appear in the world they carry the true marks of sovereignty upon them we ought to believe that god has raised em above all whom he has made to excel all it were an impious folly to think of reducing him to the ordinary level of mankind whom god has placed above it twere better for us to be guided by him than to follow our own judgment nay i could almost say twere better to serve such a master than to be free but this will be nothing to the purpose till such a man or succession of men do appear and if our author would persuade us that all mankind or every particular is obliged to a perpetual subjection to one man or family upon any other condition he must do it by the credit of those who favor his design more than aristotle  i know not who that will be but am confident he will find no help from plato for if his principles be examined by which a grave authors sense is best comprehended it will appear that all his books of laws plato de leg c de republ and of a commonwealth are chiefly grounded upon this that magistrates are chosen by societys seeking their own good and that the best men ought to be chosen for the attaining of it whereas his whole design of seeking which is the best form of government or what laws do most conduce to its perfection and permanency if one rule were by nature appointed for all and none could justly transgress it if god had designed an universal lord over the whole world or a particular one over every nation who could be bound by no law were utterly absurd and they who write books concerning political matters and take upon em to instruct nations how to govern themselves would be found either foolishly to mispend their time or impiously to incite people to rebel against the ordinance of god if this can justly be imputed to plato he is not the wise man he is supposed to have bin and can less deserve the title of divine which our author gives him but if he remain justly free from such censures it must be confessed that whilst he seeks what is good for a people and to convince em by reason that it is so he takes it for granted that they have a liberty of choosing that which appears to plato de leg be the best to them he first says that this good consists in the obtaining of justice but farther explaining himself he shows that under the name of justice he comprehends all that tends to their perfection and felicity in as much as every people by joining in a civil society and creating magistrates does seek its own good and it is just that he or they who are created should to the utmost of their power accomplish the end of their creation and lead the people to justice without which there is neither perfection nor happiness that the proper act of justice is to give to every one his due to man that which belongs to man and to god that which is gods but as no man can be just or desire to be so unless he know that justice is good nor know that it is good unless he know that original justice and goodness through which all that is just is just and all that is good is good it is impossible for any man to perform the part of a good magistrate unless he have the knowledge of god or to bring a people to justice unless he bring them to the knowledge of god who is the root of all justice and goodness if plato therefore deserve credit he only can duly perform the part of a good magistrate whose moral virtues are ripened and heightened by a superinduction of divine knowledge the misery of man proceeds from his being separated from god this separation is wrought by corruption his restitution therefore to felicity and integrity can only be brought about by his reunion to the good from which he is fallen plato looks upon this as the only worthy object of mans desire and in his laws and politics he intends not to teach us how to erect manufactures and to increase trade or riches but how magistrates may be helpful to nations in the manner before mentioned and consequently what men are fit to be magistrates if our author therefore would make use of platos doctrine to his end he ought to have proved that there is a family in every nation to the chief of which and successively to the next in blood god dos ever reveal and infuse such a knowledge of himself as may render him a light to others and failing in this all that he says is to no purpose  the weakness in which we are born renders us unable to attain this good of our selves we want help in all things especially in the greatest the fierce barbarity of a loose multitude bound by no law and regulated by no discipline is wholly repugnant to it whilst every man fears his neighbor and has no other defense than his own strength he must live in that perpetual anxiety which is equally contrary to that happiness and that sedate temper of mind which is required for the search of it the first step toward the cure of this pestilent evil is for many to join in one body that every one may be protected by the united force of all and the various talents that men possess may by good discipline be rendered useful to the whole as the meanest piece of wood or stone being placed by a wise architect conduces to the beauty of the most glorious building but every man bearing in his own breast affections passions and vices repugnant to this end and no man owing any submission to his neighbor none will subject the correction or restriction of themselves to another unless he also submit to the same rule they are rough pieces of timber or stone which it is necessary to cleave saw or cut this is the work of a skilful builder and he only is capable of erecting a great fabric who is so magistrates are political architects and they only can perform the work incumbent on them who excel in political virtues nature in variously framing the minds of men according to the variety of uses in which they may be employed in order to the institution and preservation of civil societys must be our guide in allotting to every one his proper work and plato observing this variety affirms that the laws of nature cannot be more absurdly violated than by giving the government of a people to such as do not excel others in those arts and virtues that tend to the ultimate ends for which governments are instituted by this means those who are slaves by nature or rendered so by their vices are often set above those that god and nature had fitted for the highest commands and societys which subsist only by order fall into corruption when all order is so preposterously inverted and the most extreme confusion introduced this is an evil that solomon detested folly is set in great dignity and the eccl  0   rich sit in low places i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earth they who understand solomons language will easily see that the rich and the princes he means are such only who are rich in virtue and wisdom and who ought to be preferred for those qualitys and when he says a servant that reigns is one of the three things the earth cannot bear he can only mean such as deserve to be servants for when they reign they do not serve but are served by others which perfectly agrees with what we learn from plato and plainly shows that true philosophy is perfectly conformable with what is taught us by those who were divinely inspired therefore tho i should allow to our author that aristotle in those words it seems to some not to be natural for one man to be lord of all the citizens since the city consists of equals did speak the opinion of others rather than his own and should confess that he and his master plato did acknowledge a natural inequality among men it would be nothing to his purpose for the inequality and the rational superiority due to some or to one by reason of that inequality did not proceed from blood or extraction and had nothing patriarchical in it but consisted solely in the virtues of the persons by which they were rendered more able than others to perform their duty for the good of the society therefore if these authors are to be trusted whatsoever place a man is advanced to in a city it is not for his own sake but for that of the city and we are not to ask who was his father but what are his virtues in relation to it this induces a necessity of distinguishing between a simple and a relative inequality for if it were possible for a man to have great virtues and yet no way beneficial to the society of which he is or to have some one vice that renders em useless he could have no pretense to a magistratical power more than any other they who are equally free may equally enjoy their freedom but the powers that can only be executed by such as are endowed with great wisdom justice and valor can belong to none nor be rightly conferred upon any except such as excel in those virtues and if no such can be found all are equally by turns to participate of the honors annexed to magistracy and law which is said to be written reason cannot justly exalt those whom nature which is reason has deprest nor depress those whom nature has exalted it cannot make kings slaves nor slaves kings without introducing that evil which if we believe solomon and the spirit by which he spoke the earth cannot bear this may discover what lawgivers deserve to be reputed wise or just and what decrees or sanctions ought to be reputed laws aristotle proceeding by this rule rather tells us who is naturally a king than where we should find him and after having given the highest praises to this true natural king and his government he sticks not to declare that of one man in virtue equal or inferior to others to be a mere tyranny even the worst of all as it is the corruption of the best or as our author calls it the most divine and such as can be fit only for those barbarous and stupid nations which tho bearing the shape of men are little different from beasts whoever therefore will from aristotles words inser that nature has designed one man or succession of men to be lords of every country must show that man to be endowed with all the virtues that render him fit for so great an office which he dos not bear for his own pleasure glory or profit but for the good of those that are under him and if that be not done he must look after other patrons than aristotle for his opinion  plato dos more explicitly say that the civil or politic man the shepherd father or king of the people is the same designed for the same work enabled to perform it by the excellency of the same virtues and made perfect by the infusion of the divine wisdom this is platos monarch and i confess that wheresoever he dos appear in the world he ought to be accounted as sent from god for the good of that people his government is the best that can be set up among men and if assurance can be given that his children heirs or successors shall for ever be equal to him in the abovementioned virtues it were a folly and a sin to bring him under the government of any other or to an equality with them since god had made him to excel them all and it is better for them to be ruled by him than to follow their own judgment this is that which gives him the preference he is wise through the knowledge of the truth plato in alib l    and thereby becomes good happy pure beautiful and perfect the divine light shining forth in him is a guide to others and he is a fit leader of a people to the good that he enjoys if this can be expressed by words in fashion this is his prerogative this is the royal charter given to him by god and to him only who is so adapted for the performance of his office he that should pretend to the same privileges without the same abilitys to perform the works for which they are granted would exceed the folly of a child that takes upon him a burden which can only be born by a giant or the madness of one who presumes to give physic and understands not the art of a physician thereby drawing guilt upon himself and death upon his patient it were as vain to expect that a child should carry the giants burden and that an ignorant man should give wholesome physic as that one who lives void of all knowledge of good should conduct men to it whenever therefore such a man as is abovedescribd dos not appear nature and reason instruct us to seek him or them who are most like to him and to lay such burdens upon em as are proportionable to their strength which is as much as to say to prefer every man according to his merit and assign to every one such works as he seems able to accomplish  but that plato and aristotle may neither be thought unreasonably addicted to monarchy nor wholly rejecting it to have talked in vain of a monarch that is not to be found it is good to consider that this is not a siction moses joshua samuel and others were such as they define and were made to be such by that communion with god which plato requires and he in all his writings intending the institution of such a discipline as should render men happy wise and good could take no better way to bring his countrymen to it than by showing em that wisdom virtue and purity only could make a natural difference among men  it is not my work to justify these opinions of plato and his scholar aristotle they were men and tho wise and learned subject to error if they erred in these points it hurts not me nor the cause i maintain since i make no other use of their books than to show the impudence and prevarication of those who gather small scraps out of good books to justify their assertions concerning such kings as are known amongst us which being examined are found to be wholly against em and if they were followed would destroy their persons and power  but our authors intention being only to cavil or to cheat such as are not versed in the writings of the ancients or at least to cause those who do not make truth their guide to waver and fluctuate in their discourses he dos in one page say that without doubt moses his history of the creation guided these philosophers in finding out this lineal subjection and in the next affirms that the ignorance of the creation occasioned several among the heathen philosophers to think that men met together as herds of cattle whereas they could not have bin ignorant of the creation if they had read the books that moses writ and having that knowledge they could not think that men met together as herds of cattle however i deny that any of em did ever dream of that lineal subjection derived from the first parents of mankind or that any such thing was to be learned from moses tho they did not perhaps justly know the beginning of mankind they did know the beginnings and progress of the governments under which they lived and being assured that the first kingdoms had bin those which they called heroum regna that is of those who had bin most beneficial to mankind that their descendents in many places degenerating from their virtues had given nations occasion to set up aristocracys and they also falling into corruption to institute democracys or mixed governments did rightly conclude that every nation might justly order their own affairs according to their own pleasure and could have neither obligation nor reason to set up one man or a few above others unless it did appear to them that they had more of those virtues which conduce to the good of civil societys than the rest of their brethren  our authors cavil upon aristotles opinion that those who are wise in mind are by nature fitted to be lords and those who are strong of body ordained to obey deserves no answer for he plainly falsifies the text aristotle speaks only of those qualitys which are required for every purpose and means no more than that such as are eminent in the virtues of the mind deserve to govern tho they do not excel in bodily strength and that they who are strong of body tho of little understanding and incapable of commanding may be useful in executing the commands of others but is so far from denying that one man may excel in all the perfections of mind and body that he acknowledges him only to be a king by nature who dos so both being required for the full performance of his duty and if this be not true i suppose that one who is like agrippa posthumus corporis viribus stolide ferox may be fit to govern many nations and moses or samuel if they naturally wanted bodily strength or that it decayed by age might justly be made slaves which it a discovery worthy our authors invention  sect ii every man that has children has the right of a father and is capable of preferment in a society composed of many i am not concerned in making good what suarez says a jesuit may speak that which is true but it ought to be received as from the devil cautiously lest mischief be hid under it and sir roberts frequent prevarications upon the scripture and many good authors give reason to suspect he may have falsifyd one that few protestants read if it served to his purpose and not mentioning the place his fraud cannot easily be discovered unless it be by one who has leisure to examine all his vastly voluminous writings but as to the point in question that pains may be saved there is nothing that can be imputed to the invention of suarez for that adam had only an oeconomical not a political power is not the voice of a jesuit but of nature and common sense for politic signifying no more in greek than civil in latin it is evident there could be no civil power where there was no civil society and there could be none between him and his children because a civil society is composed of equals and fortified by mutual compacts which could not be between him and his children at least if there be any thing of truth in our authors doctrine that all children do perpetually and absolutely depend upon the will of their father suarez seems to have bin of another opinion and observing the benefits we receive from parents and the veneration we owe to em to be reciprocal he could not think any duty could extend farther than the knowledge of the relation upon which it was grounded and makes a difference between the power of a father before and after his children are made free that is in truth before and after they are able to provide for themselves and to deliver their parents from the burden of taking care of them which will appear rational to any who are able to distinguish between what a man of  0 years old subsisting by himself and having a family of his own or a child of eight dos owe to his father the same reason that obliges a child to submit entirely to the will of his parents when he is utterly ignorant of all things dos permit and often enjoin men of ripe age to examine the commands they receive before they obey them and it is not more plain that i owe all manner of duty affection and respect to him that did beget and educate me than that i can owe nothing on any such account to one that did neither  this may have bin the opinion of suarez but i can hardly believe such a notion as that adam in process of time might have servants could proceed from any other brain than our authors for if he had lived to this day he could have had none under him but his own children and if a family be not complete without servants his must always have bin defective and his kingdom must have bin so too if that has such a resemblance to a family as our author fancies this is evident that a hard father may use his children as servants or a rebellious stubborn son may deserve to be so used and a gentle and good master may show that kindness to faithful and welldeserving servants which resembles the sweetness of a fatherly rule but neither of em can change their nature a son can never grow to be a servant nor a servant to be a son if a family therefore be not complete unless it consist of children and servants it cannot be like to a kingdom or city which is composed of freemen and equals servants may be in it but are not members of it as truth can never be repugnant to justice it is impossible this should be a prejudice to the paternal rule which is most just especially when a grateful remembrance of the benefits received dos still remain with a necessary and perpetual obligation of repaying them in all affection and duty whereas the care of ever providing for their familys as they did probably increase in the time of our first longliving fathers would have bin an insupportable burden to parents if it had bin incumbent on em we do not find that adam exercised any such power over cain when he had slain abel as our author fancies to be regal the murderer went out and built a city for himself and called it by the name of his firstborn and we have not the least reason to believe that after adams death cain had any dominion over his brethren or their posterity or any one of them over him and his he feared that whosoever saw him would kill him which language dos not agree with the rights belonging to the haughty title of heir apparent to the dominion of the whole earth the like was practiced by noah and his sons who set up colonys for themselves but lived as private men in obscure places whilst their children of the fourth or fifth generation especially of the youngest and accursed son were great and powerful kings as is fully proved in the first chapter  tho this had bin otherwise it would have no effect upon us for no argument drawn from the examples of shem ham and japhet if they and their children had continued under the dominion of noah as long as he lived can oblige me to resign my self and all my concernments absolutely into the hands of one who is not my father but when the contrary is evidently true in them and their next ensuing generations it is an admirable boldness in our author to think of imposing upon us for an eternal and universal law when the knowledge of our first progenitors is utterly extinguished that which was not at all regarded by those who could not be ignorant of their own original or the duty thereby incumbent upon them or their immediate fathers then living to whom the rights must have belonged if there had bin any such thing in nature or that they had bin of any advantage to them whereas in truth if there had bin such a law in the beginning it must have vanished of it self for want of being exercised in the beginning and could not possibly be revived after four thousand years when no man in the world can possibly know to whom the universal right of dominion over the whole world or particular nations dos belong for it is in vain to speak of a right when no one man can have a better title to it than any other but there being no precept in the scripture for it and the examples directed or approved by god himself and his most faithful servants being inconsistent with and contrary to it we may be sure there never was any such thing and that men being left to the free use of their own understanding may order and dispose of their own affairs as they think fit no man can have a better title than another unless for his personal virtues every man that in the judgment of those concerned excels in them may be advanced and those nations that through mistake set up such as are unworthy or do not take right measures in providing for a succession of men worthy and other things necessary to their welfare may be guilty of great folly to their own shame and misery but can do no injustice to any in relation to an hereditary right which can be naturally in none  sect iii government is not instituted for the good of the governor but of the governed and power is not an advantage but a burden the follys with which our author endeavors to corrupt and trouble the world seem to proceed from his fundamental mistakes of the ends for which governments are constituted and from an opinion that an excessive power is good for the governor or the diminution of it a prejudice whereas common sense teaches and all good men acknowledge that governments are not set up for the advantage profit pleasure or glory of one or a few men but for tho good of the society for this reason plato and aristotle find no more certain way of distinguishing between a lawful king and a tyrant than that the first seeks to procure the common good and the other his own pleasure or profit and doubt not to declare that he who according to his institution was the first destroys his own being and degenerates into the latter if he deflect from that rule he that was the best of men becomes the worst and the father or shepherd of the people makes himself their enemy and we may from hence collect that in all controversys concerning the power of magistrates we are not to examine what conduces to their profit or glory but what is good for the public  his second error is no less gross and mischievous than the first and that absolute power to which he would exalt the chief magistrate would be burdensome and desperately dangerous if he had it the highest places are always slippery mens eyes dazzle when they are carried up to them and all falls from them are mortal few kings or tyrants says  sine caede and sanguine pauci descendunt reges and sicca morte tyranni juven sat  juvenal go down to the grave in peace and he did not imprudently couple them together because in his time few or no kings were known who were not tyrants dionysius thought no man left a tyranny till he was drawn out by the heels but tacitus says nescit quam grave and intolerandum sit cuncta regendi onus moses could not bear it gideon would not accept of any resemblance of it the moral sense of jothams wise parable is eternal the bramble coveted the power which the vine olive and figtree refused the worst and basest of men are ambitious of the highest places which the best and wisest reject or if some who may be otherwise well qualified   in this place two pages are wanting in the original manuscript   as the fittest to be followed by mankind if these philosophers and divines deserve credit nimrod ninus pharaoh and the rest of that accursed crew did not commit such excesses as were condemned by god and abhorred by good men but gaining to themselves the glorious character of his vicegerents left their practices as a perpetual law to all succeeding generations whereby the world and every part of it would be for ever exposed to the violence cruelty and madness of the most wicked men that it should produce but if these opinions comprehend an extravagancy of wickedness and madness that was not known among men till some of these wretches presumed to attempt the increase of that corruption under which mankind groans by adding fuel to the worst of all vices we may safely return to our propositions that god having established no such authority as our author fancies nations are left to the use of their own judgment in making provision for their own welfare that there is no lawful magistrate over any of them but such as they have set up that in creating them they do not seek the advantage of their magistrate but their own and having found that an absolute power over a people is a burden which no man can bear and that no wise or good man ever desired it from thence conclude that it is not good for any to have it nor just for any to affect it tho it were personally good for himself because he is not exalted to seek his own good but that of the public  sect iv the paternal right devolves to and is inherited by all the children tho the perversity of our authors judgment and nature may have driven him into the most gross errors it is not amiss to observe that many of those delivered by him proceed from his ignorance of the most important differences between father and lord king and tyrant which are so evident and irreconcilable that one would have thought no man could be so stupid as not to see it impossible for one and the same man at the same time to be father and master king and tyrant over the same persons but lest he should think me too scrupulous or too strict in inquiring after truth i intend for the present to wave that inquiry and to seek what was good for adam or noah what we have reason to believe they desired to transmit to their posterity and to take it for a perpetual law in its utmost extent which i think will be of no advantage to our author for this authority which was universal during their lives must necessarily after their decease be divided as an inheritance into as many parcels as they had children the apostle romans      says if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ which alluding to the laws and customs of nations could have bin of no force unless it had bin true and known to be so but if children are heirs or joint heirs whatsoever authority adam or noah had is inherited by every man in the world and that title of heir which our author so much magnifys as if annexed to one single person vanishes into nothing or else the words of the apostle could have neither strength nor truth in them but would be built upon a false foundation which may perhaps agree with our authors divinity  yet if the apostle had not declared himself so fully in this point we might easily have seen that adam and noah did leave their children in that equality for fathers are ever understood to embrace all their children with equal affection till the discovery of personal virtues or vices makes a difference but the personal virtues that give a reasonable preference of one before another or make him more fit to govern than the others cannot appear before he is nor can be annexed to any one line therefore the father cannot be thought to have given to one man or his descendents the government of his brethren and their descendents  besides tho the law of england may make one man to be sole heir of his father yet the laws of god and nature do not so all the children of noah were his heirs the land promised to abraham isaac and jacob was equally divided among their children if the children of joseph made two tribes it was not as the firstborn but by the will of jacob who adopted ephraim and manasseh and they thereby became his sons and obtained an inheritance equal to that of the other tribes the law allowed a double portion to the first begotten but this made a difference between brothers only in proportion whereas that between lord and servant is in specie not in degree and if our authors opinion might take place instead of such a division of the common inheritance between brothers as was made between the children of jacob all must continue for ever slaves to one lord which would establish a difference in specie between brethren which nature abhors  if nature dos not make one man lord over his brethren he can never come to be their lord unless they make him so or he subdue them if he subdue them it is an act of violence contrary to right which may consequently be recovered if they make him lord it is for their own sakes not for his and he must seek their good not his own lest as aristotle says he degenerat from a king into a tyrant he therefore who would persuade us that the dominion over every nation dos naturally belong to one man woman or child at a venture or to the heir whatsoever he or she be as to age sex or other qualifications must prove it good for all nations to be under them but as reason is our nature that can never be natural to us that is not rational reason gives paria paribus equal power to those who have equal abilitys and merit it allots to every one the part he is most fit to perform and this fitness must be equally lasting with the law that allots it but as it can never be good for great nations having men amongst em of virtue experience wisdom and goodness to be governed by children fools or vicious and wicked persons and we neither find that the virtues required in such as deserve to govern them did ever continue in any race of men nor have reason to believe they ever will it can never be reasonable to annex the dominion of a nation to any one line we may take this upon solomons word woe to thee o land when thy king eccl  0    is a child and thy princes eat in the morning and i wish the experience of all ages did not make this truth too evident to us this therefore can never be the work much less the law of nature and if there be any such thing in the world as the dominion over a nation inseparably united to a man and his family it can have no other root than a civil or municipal law which is not the subject of our discourse  moreover every fathers right must cease when he ceases to be or be transmitted to those who being also fathers have the same title to it and tho the contrary method of annexing the whole inheritance to one person or exposing all his brethren to be destroyed by his rage if they will not submit may conduce to the enlargement of a proud and violent empire as in turkey where he that gains the power usually begins his reign with the slaughter of his brothers and nephews yet it can never agree with the piety gentleness and wisdom of the patriarchs or the laws of god and nature  these thing being agreed we need not trouble our selves with the limits or definition of a family and as little with the titles given to the head of it it is all one to us whether it be confined to one roof and fire or extended farther and none but such as are strangers to the practice of mankind can think that titles of civility have a power to create a right of dominion every man in latin is called dominus unless such as are of the vilest condition or in a great subjection to those who speak to them and yet the word strictly taken relates only to servus for a man is lord only of his servant or slave the italians are not less liberal of the titles of signore and padrone and the spaniards of sennor but he would be ridiculous in those countries who thereupon should arrogate to himself a right of dominion over those who are so civil the vanity of our age seems to carry this point a little higher especially among the french who put a great weight upon the word prince but they cannot change the true signification of it and even in their sense prince du sang signifys no more than a chief man of the royal blood to whom they pay much respect because he may come to the crown as they at rome do to cardinals who have the power of choosing popes and out of whose number for some ages they have bin chosen in this sense did scevola when he was apprehended by porsenna t live l   say trecenti conjuravimus romanae juventutis principes which was never otherwise understood than of such young citizens as were remarkable amongst their companions and nothing can be more absurd than to think if the name of prince had carried an absolute and despotical power with it that it could belong to three hundred in a city that possessed no more than a ten miles territory or that it could have bin given to them whilst they were young and the most part of their fathers as is most probable still living  i should like our author run round in a circle if i should refute what he says of a regal power in our first parents or show that the regal where it is is not absolute as often as he dos assert it but having already proved that adam noah abraham isaac jacob etc enjoyed no such power transmitted to every one of their sons that which they had and they became fathers of many great nations who always continued independent on each other i leave to our author to prove when and by what law the right of subdividing the paternal power was stopped and how any one or more of their descendents came to have that power over their brethren which none of their immediate children had over theirs  his question to suarez how and when sons become free favors more of jesuitical sophistry than any thing said by the jesuit but the solution is easy for if he mean the respect veneration and kindness proceeding from gratitude it ceases only with the life of the father to whom it is due and the memory of it must last as long as that of the son and if they had bin possessed of such an absolute power as he fancys it must have ceased with the reasons upon which it was grounded  first because the power of which a father would probably have made a wise and gentle use could not be rightly trusted in the hands of one who is not a father and that which tended only to the preservation of all the children could not be turned to the increase of the pride luxury and violence of one to the oppression of others who are equally heirs  in the second place societys cannot be instituted unless the heads of the familys that are to compose them resign so much of their right as seems convenient into the public stock to which every one becomes subject but that the same power should at the same time continue in the true father and the figurative father the magistrate and that the children should owe entire obedience to the commands of both which may often cross each other is absurd  thirdly it ceases when it cannot be executed as when men live to see four or five generations as many do at this day because the son cannot tell whether he should obey his father grandfather or greatgrandfather and cannot be equally subject to them all most especially when they live in diverse places and set up familys of their own as the sons of the patriarchs did which being observed i know no place where this paternal power could have any effect unless in the fabulous island of pines and even there it must have ceased when he died who by the inventor of the story is said to have seen above ten thousand persons issued of his body  and if it be said that noah shem abraham etc consented that their children should go where they thought fit and provide for themselves i answer that the like has bin done in all ages and must be done for ever it is the voice of nature obeyed not only by mankind but by all living creatures and there is none so stupid as not to understand it a hen leaves her chickens when they can seek their own nourishment a cow looks after her calf no longer than till it is able to feed a lion gives over hunting for his whelps when they are able to seek their own prey and have strength enough to provide what is sufficient for themselves and the contrary would be an insupportable burden to all living creatures but especially to men for the good order that the rational nature delights in would be overthrown and civil societys by which it is best preserved would never be established  we are not concerned to examine whether the political and oeconomical powers be entirely the same or in what they differ for that absolute power which he contends for is purely despotical different from both or rather inconsistent with either as to the same subject and that which the patriarchs exercised having bin equally inherited by their children and consequently by every one of their posterity it is as much as is required for my purpose of proving the natural universal liberty of mankind and i am no way concerned in the question whether the first parents of mankind had a power of life and death over their children or not  sect v freemen join together and frame greater or lesser societys and give such forms to them as best please themselves this being established i shall leave filmer to fight against suarez and bellarmin or to turn one of them against the other without any concernment in the combat or the success of it but since he thereupon raises a question whether the supreme power be so in the people that there is but one and the same power in all the people of the world so that no power can be granted unless all men upon the earth meet and agree to choose a governor i think it deserves to be answered and might do it by proposing a question to him whether in his opinion the empire of the whole world dos by the laws of god and nature belong to one man and who that man is or how it came so to be divided as we have ever known it to have bin without such an injury to the universal monarch as can never be repaired but intending to proceed more heartily and not to trouble my self with bellarmin or suarez i say that they who place the power in a multitude understand a multitude composed of freemen who think it for their convenience to join together and to establish such laws and rules as they oblige themselves to observe which multitude whether it be great or small has the same right because ten men are as free as ten millions of men and tho it may be more prudent in some cases to join with the greater than the smaller number because there is more strength it is not so always but however every man must therein be his own judge since if he mistake the hurt is only to himself and the ten may as justly resolve to live together frame a civil society and oblige themselves to laws as the greatest number of men that ever met together in the world  thus we find that a few men assembling together upon the banks of the tiber resolved to build a city and set up a government among themselves and the multitude that met at babylon when their design of building a tower that should reach up to heaven failed and their language was confounded divided themselves as our author says into seventy two parcels and by the same right might have divided into more as their descendents did into almost an infinite number before the death of their common father noah but we cannot find a more perfect picture of freemen living according to their own will than in abraham and lot they went together into canaan continued together as long as was convenient for them and parted when their substance did so increase that they became troublesome to each other in the like manner ismael isaac and abrahams six sons by keturah might have continued together and made one nation isaac and esau moab and ammon might have done so too or all of them that came of the same stock might have united together but they did not and their descendents by the same rule might have subdivided perpetually if they had thought it expedient for themselves and if the sons of jacob did not do the like it is probable they were kept together by the hope of an inheritance promised to em by god in which we find no shadow of a despotical dominion affected by one as father or heir to the first father or reputed to be the heir but all continued genesis    in that fraternal equality which according to abrahams words to lot they ought to do there was no lord slave or vassal no strife was to be among them they were brethren they might live together or separate as they found it convenient for themselves by the same law that abraham and lot moab and ammon ismael isaac and the sons of keturah jacob esau and their descendents did divide and set up several governments every one of their children might have done the like and the same right remained to their issue till they had by agreement engaged themselves to each other but if they had no dependence upon each other and might live together in that fraternal equality which was between abraham and lot or separate and continue in that separation or reunite they could not but have a right of framing such conditions of their union as best pleased themselves by this means every number of men agreeing together and framing a society became a complete body having all power in themselves over themselves subject to no other human law than their own all those that compose the society being equally free to enter into it or not no man could have any prerogative above others unless it were granted by the consent of the whole and nothing obliging them to enter into this society but the consideration of their own good that good or the opinion of it must have bin the rule motive and end of all that they did ordain it is lawful therefore for any such bodies to set up one or a few men to govern them or to retain the power in themselves and he or they who are set up having no other power but what is so conferred upon them by that multitude whether great or small are truly by them made what they are and by the law of their own creation are to exercise those powers according to the proportion and to the ends for which they were given  these rights in several nations and ages have bin variously executed in the establishment of monarchys aristocracys democracys or mixed governments according to the variety of circumstances and the governments have bin good or evil according to the rectitude or pravity of their institution and the virtue and wisdom or the folly and vices of those to whom the power was committed but the end which was ever proposed being the good of the public they only performed their duty who procured it according to the laws of the society which were equally valid as to their own magistrates whether they were few or many  this might suffice to answer our authors question but he endeavors further to perplex it by a fiction of his own brain that god gave this power to the whole multitude met and not to every particular assembly of men and expects a proof that the whole multitude met and divided this power which god gave them in gross by breaking it into parcels and by appointing a distinct power to each commonwealth he also fathers it upon the assertors of liberty and dos not see as he says how there can be an election of a magistrate by any commonwealth that is not an usurpation upon the privilege of the whole world unless all mankind had met together and divided the power into parcels which god had given them in gross but before i put my self to the trouble of answering that which is but an appendix to a whimsy of his own i may justly ask what hurt he finds in usurpation who asserts that the same obedience is due to all monarchs whether they come in by inheritance election or usurpation if usurpation can give a right to a monarch why dos it not confer the same upon a people or rather if god did in gross confer such a right upon all mankind and they neither did nor can meet together by consent to dispose of it for the good of the whole why should not those who can and do consent to meet together agree upon that which seems most expedient to them for the government of themselves did god create man under the necessity of wanting government and all the good that proceeds from it because at the first all did not and afterward all could not meet to agree upon rules or did he ever declare that unless they should use the first opportunity of dividing themselves into such parcels as were to remain unalterable the right of reigning over every one shall fall to the first villain that should dare to attempt it is it not more consonant to the wisdom and goodness of god to leave to every nation a liberty of repairing the mischiefs fallen upon them through the omission of their first parents by setting up governments among themselves than to lay em under a necessity of submitting to any that should insolently aspire to a domination over them is it not more just and reasonable to believe that the universal right not being executed devolves upon particular nations as members of the great body than that it should become the reward of violence or fraud or is it possible that any one man can make himself lord of a people or parcel of that body to whom god had given the liberty of governing themselves by any other means than violence or fraud unless they did willingly submit to him if this right be not devolved upon any one man is not the invasion of it the most outrageous injury that can be done to all mankind and most particularly to the nation that is enslaved by it or if the justice of every government depends necessarily upon an original grant and a succession certainly deduced from our first fathers dos not he by his own principles condemn all the monarchys of the world as the most detestable usurpations since not one of em that we know do any way pretend to it or tho i who deny any power to be just that is not founded upon consent may boldly blame usurpation is it not an absurd and unpardonable impudence in filmer to condemn usurpation in a people when he has declared that the right and power of a father may be gained by usurpation and that nations in their obedience are to regard the power not the means by which it was gained but not to lose more time upon a most frivolous fiction i affirm that the liberty which we contend for is granted by god to every man in his own person in such a manner as may be useful to him and his posterity and as it was exercised by noah shem abraham isaac jacob etc and their children as has bin proved and not to the vast body of all mankind which never did meet together since the first age after the flood and never could meet to receive any benefit by it  his next question deserves scorn and hatred with all the effects of either if it proceed from malice tho perhaps he may deserve compassion if his crime proceed from ignorance was a general meeting of a whole kingdom says he ever known for the election of a prince but if there never were any general meetings of whole nations or of such as they did delegate and entrust with the power of the whole how did any man that was elected come to have a power over the whole why may not a people meet to choose a prince as well as any other magistrate why might not the athenians romans or carthaginians have chosen princes as well as archons consuls dictators or suffetes if it had pleased them who chose all the roman kings except tarquin the proud if the people did not since their historys testify that he was the first who took upon t live l   him to reign sine jussu populi who ever heard of a king of the goths in spain that was not chosen by the nobility and people or how could they choose him if they did not meet in their persons or by their deputys which is the same thing when a people has agreed it should be so how did the kings of sweden come by their power unless by the like election till the crown was made hereditary in the time of gustavus the first as a reward of his virtue and service in delivering that country from the tyranny of the danes how did charles gustavus come to be king unless it was by the election of the nobility he acknowledged by the act of his election and upon all occasions that he had no other right to the crown than what they had conferred on him did not the like custom prevail in hungary and bohemia till those countries fell under the power of the house of austria and in denmark till the year    0 do not the kings of poland derive their authority from this popular election which he derides dos not the style of the oath of allegiance used in the kingdom of arragon as it is related by antonio perez secretary of state to philip   d show that their kings were of their own making could they say nos que valmos tanto come vos os hazemos neustro rey con tal que no guardeys nuestros suero  libertades  no no relacion de ant perez we who are as good as you make you our king on condition that you keep and observe our privileges and libertys and if not not if he did not come in by their election were not the roman emperors in disorderly times chosen by the soldiers and in such as were more regular by the senate with the consent of the people  our author may say the whole body of these nations did not meet at their elections tho that is not always true for in the infancy of rome when the whole people dwelt within the walls of a small city they did meet for the choice of their kings as afterward for the choice of other magistrates whilst the goths franks vandals and saxons lived within the precincts of a camp they frequently met for the election of a king and raised upon a target the person they had chosen but finding that to be inconvenient or rather impossible when they were vastly increased in number and dispersed over all the countries they had conquered no better way was found than to institute gemotes parliaments diets cortez assemblys of estates or the like to do that which formerly had bin performed by themselves and when a people is by mutual compact joined together in a civil society there is no difference as to right between that which is done by them all in their own persons or by some deputed by all and acting according to the powers received from all  if our author was ignorant of these things which are the most common in all historys he might have spared the pains of writing upon more abstruse points but it is a stupendous folly in him to presume to raise doctrins depending upon the universal law of god and nature without examining the only law that ever god did in a public manner give to man if he had looked into it he might have learnt that all israel   samuel  0 was by the command of god assembled at mispeth to choose a king and did choose saul he being slain all judah came to hebron and made   samuel   david their king after the death of ishbosheth all the tribes went to   samuel   hebron and anointed him king over them and he made a covenant with them before the lord when solomon was dead all israel met together in shechem and ten tribes disliking the proceedings of rehoboam   king    rejected him and made jeroboam their king the same people in the time of the judges had general assemblys as often as occasion did require to set up a judge make war or the like and the several tribes had their assemblys to treat of businesses relating to themselves the historys of all nations especially of those that have peopled the best parts of europe are so full of examples in this kind that no man can question them unless he be brutally ignorant or maliciously contentious the great matters among the germans were transacted omnium consensu de c tacit de mor germ minoribus consultant principes de majoribus omnes the michelgemote among the saxons was an assembly of the whole people the baronagium is truly said to be the same in as much as it comprehended all the freemen that is all the people for the difference between civis and servus is irreconcilable and no man whilst he is a servant can be a member of a commonwealth for he that is not in his own power cannot have a part in the government of others all the forementioned northern nations had the like customs among em the governments they had were so instituted the utmost that any now remaining pretends to is to derive their right from them if according to filmer these first assemblys could not confer it upon the first they had none such as claim under em can inherit none from those that had none and there can be no right in all the governments we so much venerate and nothing can tend more to their overthrow than the reception of our authors doctrine  tho any one instance would be sufficient to overthrow his general negative proposition for a rule is not generally true if there be any just exception against it i have alleged many and find it so easy to increase the number that there is no nation whose original we know out of whose historys i will not undertake to produce the like but i have not bin solicitous precisely to distinguish which nations have acted in their own persons and which have made use of delegats nor in what times they have changed from one way to the other for if any have acted by themselves the thing is possible and whatsoever is done by delegated powers must be referred to their principals for none can give to any a power which they have not in themselves  he is graciously pleased to confess that when men are assembled by a human power that power that dos assemble them may also limit the manner of the execution of that power etc but in assemblys that take their authority from the law of nature it is not so for what liberty or freedom is due to any man by the law of nature no inferior power can alter limit or diminish no one man or multitude of men can give away the natural right of another etc these are strong lines and such as if there be any sense in them utterly overthrow all our authors doctrine for if any assembly of men did ever take their authority from the law of nature it must be of such as remaining in the entire fruition of their natural liberty and restrained by no contract meet together to deliberate of such matters as concern themselves and if they can be restrnind by no one man or number of men they may dispose of their own affairs as they think fit but because no one of them is obliged to enter into the society that the rest may constitute he cannot enjoy the benefit of that society unless he enter into it he may be gone and set up for himself or set up another with such as will agree with him but if he enter into the society he is obliged by the laws of it and if one of those laws be that all things should be determined by the plurality of voices his assent is afterward comprehended in all the resolutions of that plurality reuben or simeon might according to the laws of nature have divided themselves from their brethren as well as lot from abraham or ismael and the sons of keturah from isaac but when they in hopes of having a part in the inheritance promised to their fathers had joined with their brethren a few of their descendents could not have a right by their dissent to hinder the resolutions of the whole body or such a part of it as by the first agreement was to pass for an act of the whole and the   samuel  0 scripture teaches us that when the lot was fallen upon saul they who despised him were styled men of belial and the rest after his victory over the ammonites would have slain em if he had permitted in the like manner when a number of men met together to build rome any man who had disliked the design might justly have refused to join in it but when he had entered into the society he could not by his vote invalidate the acts of the whole nor destroy the rights of romulus numa and the others who by the senate and people were made kings nor those of the other magistrates who after their expulsion were legally created  this is as much as is required to establish the natural liberty of mankind in its utmost extent and cannot be shaken by our authors surmise that a gap is thereby opened for every seditious multitude to raise a new commonwealth for till the commonwealth be established no multitude can be seditious because they are not subject to any human law and sedition implies an unjust and disorderly opposition of that power which is legally established which cannot be when there is none nor by him who is not a member of the society that makes it and when it is made such as entered into it are obliged to the laws of it  this showing the root and foundation of civil powers we may judge of the use and extent of them according to the letter of the law or the true intentional meaning of it both which declare them to be purely human ordinances proceeding from the will of those who seek their own good and may certainly infer that since all multitudes are composed of such as are under some contract or free from all no man is obliged to enter into those contracts against his own will nor obliged by any to which he dos not assent those multitudes that enter into such contracts and thereupon form civil societys act according to their own will those that are engaged in none take their authority from the law of nature their rights cannot be limited or diminished by any one man or number of men and consequently whoever dos it or attempts the doing of it violates the most sacred laws of god and nature  his cavils concerning proxys and the way of using them deserve no answer as relating only to one sort of men amongst us and can have no influence upon the laws of nature or the proceedings of assemblys acting according to such rules as they set to themselves in some places they have voted all together in their own persons as in athens in others by tribes as in rome sometimes by delegats when the number of the whole people is so great that no one place can contain them as in the parliaments diets general assemblys of estates long used in the great kingdoms of europe in other parts many citys are joined together in leagues as anciently the achaians etolians samnites tuscans and in these times the states of holland and cantons of switzerland but our author not regarding such matters in pursuance of his folly with an ignorance as admirable as his stupidity repeats his challenge i ask says he but one example out of the history of the whole world let the commonwealth be named wherever the multitude or so much as the major part of it consented either by voice or procuration to the election of a prince not observing that if an answer could not be given he did overthrow the rights of all the princes that are or ever have bin in the world for if the liberty of one man cannot be limited or diminished by one or any number of men and none can give away the right of another it is plain that the ambition of one man or of many a faction of citizens or the mutiny of an army cannot give a right to any over the libertys of a whole nation those who are so set up have their root in violence or fraud and are rather to be accounted robbers and pirates than magistrates leo africanus observing in his history that since the extinction leonis afr hist africae of mahomets race to whom his countrymen thought god had given the empire of the world their princes did not come in by the consent of those nations which they governed says that they are esteemed thieves and that on this account the most honorable men among the arabians and moors scorn to eat drink or make alliances with them and if the case were as general as that author makes it no better rule could be any where followed by honorable and worthy men but a good cause must not be lost by the fault of an ill advocate the rights of kings must not perish because filmer knows not how to defend or dos maliciously betray them i have already proved that david and diverse of the judges were chosen by all israel jeroboam by ten tribes all the kings of rome except tarquin the proud by the whole city i may add many examples of the saxons in our own country ina and offa were made kings

edwardum concordatur tho the name of conqueror be odiously given to william the norman he had the same title to the crown with his predecessors in magna exultatione a clero and populo susceptus and ab omnibus rex acclamatus i cannot recite all the examples of this kind that the history of almost all nations furnishes unless i should make a volume in bulk not inferior to the book of martyrs but those which i have mentioned out of the sacred roman and english history being more than sufficient to answer our authors challenge i take liberty to add that tho there could not be one example produced of a prince or any other magistrate chosen by the general consent of the people or by the major part of them it could be of no advantage to the cause he has undertaken to maintain for when a people has either indefinitely or under certain conditions and limitations resigned their power into the hands of a certain number of men or agreed upon rules according to which persons should from time to time be deputed for the management of their affairs the acts of those persons if their power be without restrictions are of the same value as the acts of the whole nation and the assent of every individual man is comprehended in them if the power be limited whatsoever is done according to that limitation has the same authority if it dos therefore appear as is testified by the laws and historys of all our northern nations that the power of every people is either wholly or to such a degree as is necessary for creating kings granted to their several gemotes diets cortez assemblys of estates parliaments and the like all the kings that they have any where or at any time chosen do reign by the same authority and have the same right as if every individual man of those nations had assented to their election but that these gemotes diets and other assemblys of state have every where had such powers and executed them by rejecting or setting up kings and that the kings now in being among us have received their beginning from such acts has bin fully proved and is so plain in it self that none but those who are grossly stupid or impudent can deny it which is enough to show that all kings are not set up by violence deceit faction of a few powerful men or the mutinys of armies but from the consent of such multitudes as joining together frame civil societys and either in their own persons at general assemblys or by their delegats confer a just and legal power upon them which our author rejecting he dos as far as in him lies prove them all to be usurpers and tyrants  sect vi they who have a right of choosing a king have the right of making a king tho the right of magistrates dos essentially depend upon the consent of those they govern it is hardly worth our pains to examine whether the silent acceptance of a governor by part of the people be an argument of their concurring in the election of him or by the same reason the tacit consent of the whole commonwealth may be maintained for when the question is concerning right fraudulent surmises are of no value much less will it from thence follow that a prince commanding by succession conquest or usurpation may be said to be elected by the people for evident marks of dissent are often given some declare their hatred others murmur more privately many oppose the governor or government and succeed according to the measure of their strength virtue or fortune many would resist but cannot and it were ridiculous to say that the inhabitants of greece the kingdom of naples or duchy of tuscany do tacitly assent to the government of the great turk king of spain or duke of florence when nothing is more certain than that those miserable nations abhor the tyrannys they are under and if they were not mastered by a power much too great for them they would soon free themselves and they who are under such governments do no more assent to them tho they may be silent than a man approves of being robbed when without saying a word he delivers his purse to a thief that he knows to be too strong for him  it is not therefore the bare sufferance of a government when a disgust is declared nor a silent submission when the power of opposing is wanting that can imply an assent or election and create a right but an explicit act of approbation when men have ability and courage to resist or deny which being agreed it is evident that our authors distinction between eligere and instituere signifys nothing tho if the power of instituting were only left to nations it would be sufficient for he is in vain elected who is not instituted and he that is instituted is certainly elected for his institution is an election as the romans who chose romulus numa and hostilius to be kings and brutus valerius or lucretius to be consuls did make them so and their right was solely grounded upon their election the text brought by our author against this dos fully prove it him shall thou set king over thee whom the lord shall choose deuteronomy    for god did not only make the institution of a king to be purely an act of the people but left it to them to institute one or not as should best please themselves and the words whom the lord shall choose can have no other signification than that the people resolving to have a king and following the rules prescribed by his servant moses he would direct em in their choice which relates only to that particular people in covenant with god and immediately under his government which no other was but this pains might have bin saved if god by a universal law had given a rule to all the israelites could not have bin three hundred years without a king and then left to the liberty of making one or not if he by a perpetual law had ordained that every nation should have one and it had bin as well impertinent as unjust to deliberate who should be king if the dominion had by right of inheritance belonged to one they must have submitted to him whether they would or not no care was to be taken in the election or institution of him who by his birth had a right annexed to his person that could not be altered he could not have bin forbidden to multiply silver or gold who by the law of his creation might do what he pleased it had bin ridiculous to say he should not raise his heart above his brethren who had no brethren that is no equals but was raised above all by god who had imposed upon all others a necessity of obeying him but god who dos nothing in vain did neither constitute or elect any till they desired it nor command em to do it themselves unless it so pleased themselves nor appoint em to take him out of any one line every israelite might be chosen none but strangers were excluded and the people were left to the liberty of choosing and instituting any one of their brethren  our author endeavoring by hookers authority to establish his distinction between eligere and instituere destroys it and the paternal right which he makes the foundation of his doctrine heaps of scripture are alleged says he concerning the solemn coronation and inauguration of saul david solomon and others by nobles ancients and people of the commonwealth of israel which is enough to prove that the whole work was theirs that no other had any title more than what they bestowed upon him that the kings were set up by the nobles ancients and people even god did no otherwise intervene than by such a secret disposition of the lots by his providence as is exercised in the government of all the things in the world and we cannot have a more certain evidence that a paternal right to dominion is a mere whimsy than that god did not cause the lot to fall upon the eldest of the eldest line of the eldest tribe but upon saul a young man of the youngest tribe and afterward tho he had designed david solomon jerobvam and others who had no pretense to the paternal right to be kings he left both the election and institution of them to the elders and people  but hooker being well examined it will appear that his opinions are as contrary to the doctrine of our author as those we have mentioned out hooker eccl pol l   c  0 of plato and aristotle he plainly says it is impossible that any should have a complete lawful power over a multitude consisting of so many familys as every politic society dos but by consent of men or immediate appointment from god because not having the natural superiority of fathers their power must needs be usurped and then unlawful or if lawful then either granted or consented to by them over whom they exercise the same or else given extraordinarily by god and tho he thinks kings to have bin the first governors so constituted he adds that this is not the only regiment that has bin received in the world the inconveniences of one kind have caused sundry others to be devised so that in a word all public regiment of what kind soever seems evidently to have risen from deliberate advice consultation and composition between men judging it convenient and behoofeful and a little below mans nature standing therefore as it does some kind of regiment the law of nature dos require yet the kinds thereof being many nature ties not to any one but leaves the choice as a thing arbitrary and again to live by one mans will became all mens misery this constrained them to come unto laws etc but as those laws do not only teach that which is good but enjoin it they have in them a constraining force to constrain men to any thing inconvenient seems unreasonable most requisite therefore it is that to devise laws which all men should be forced to obey none but wise men should be admitted moreover that which we say concerning the power of government must here be applied to the power of making laws whereby to govern which power god has over all and by the natural law whereunto he has made all subject the lawful power of making laws to command whole politic societys of men belongs so properly to the same entire societys that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth to exercise the same of himself and not either by express commission immediately from god or else by authority derived at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose laws it is no better than mere tyranny laws therefore they are not which public consent has not made so the humor of our age considered i should not have ventured to say so much but if hooker be a man of such great authority i cannot offend in transcribing his words and showing how vilely he is abused by filmer concluding that if he be in the right the choice and constitution of government the making of laws coronation inauguration and all that belongs to the choosing and making of kings or other magistrates is merely from the people and that all power exercised over them which is not so is usurpation and tyranny unless it be by an immediate commission from god which if any man has let him give testimony of it and i will confess he comes not within the reach of our reasonings but ought to be obeyed by those to whom he is sent or over whom he is placed  nevertheless our author is of another opinion but scorning to give us a reason he adds to hookers words as if these solemnitys were a kind of deed whereby the right of dominion is given which strange untrue and unnatural conceits are set abroad by seedsmen of rebellion and a little farther unless we will openly proclaim defiance to all law equity and reason we must say for there is no remedy that in kingdoms hereditary birthright gives a right to sovereign dominion etc those solemnitys do either serve for an open testification of the inheritors right or belong to the form of inducing him into the possession these are bold censures and do not only reach mr hooker whose modesty and peaceableness of spirit is no less esteemed than his learning but the scriptures also and the best of human authors upon which he founded his opinions but why should it be thought a strange untrue or unnatural conceit to believe that when the scriptures say nimrod was the first that grew powerful in the earth long before the death of his fathers and could consequently neither have a right of dominion over the multitude met together at babylon nor subdue them by his own strength he was set up by their consent or that they who made him their governor might prescribe rules by which he should govern nothing seems to me less strange than that a multitude of reasonable creatures in the performance of acts of the greatest importance should consider why they do them and the infinite variety which is observed in the constitution mixture and regulation of governments dos not only show that the several nations of the world have considered them but clearly prove that all nations have perpetually continued in the exercise of that right nothing is more natural than to follow the voice of mankind the wisest and best have ever employed their studys in forming kingdoms and commonwealths or in adding to the perfections of such as were already constituted which had bin contrary to the laws of god and nature if a general rule had bin set that had obliged all to be for ever subject to the will of one and they had not bin the best but the worst of men who had departed from it nay i may say that the law given by god to his peculiar people and the commands delivered by his servants in order to it or the prosecution of it had bin contrary to his own eternal and universal law which is impossible a law therefore having bin given by god which had no relation to or consistency with the absolute paternal power judges and kings created who had no pretense to any preference before their brethren till they were created and commanded not to raise their hearts above them when they should be created the wisdom and virtue of the best men in all ages shown in the constitution or reformation of governments and nations in variously framing them preserving the possession of their natural right to be governed by none and in no other way than they should appoint the opinions of hooker that all public regiment of what kind soever arises from the deliberate advice of men seeking their own good and that all other is mere tyranny are not untrue and unnatural conceits set abroad by the seedsmen of rebellion but real truths grounded upon the laws of god and nature acknowledged and practiced by mankind and no nation being justly subject to any but such as they set up nor in any other manner than according to such laws as they ordain the right of choosing and making those that are to govern them must wholly depend upon their will  sect vii the laws of every nation are the measure of magistratical power our author lays much weight upon the word hereditary but the question is what is inherited in an hereditary kingdom and how it comes to be hereditary it is in vain to say the kingdom for we do not know what he means by the kingdom it is one thing in one place and very different in others and i think it not easy to find two in the world that in power are exactly the same if he understands all that is comprehended within the precincts over which it reaches i deny that any such is to be found in the world if he refers to what preceding kings enjoyed no determination can be made till the first original of that kingdom be examined that it may be known what that first king had and from whence he had it  if this variety be denied i desire to know whether the kings of sparta and persia had the same power over their subjects if the same whether both were absolute or both limited if limited how came the decrees of the persian kings to pass for laws if absolute how could the spartan kings be subject to fines imprisonment or the sentence of death and not to have power to send for their own supper out of the common hall why did xenophon call agesilaus a good and faithful king obedient to the laws of his country when upon the command of the ephori he left the war that he had with so much glory begun in asia if he was subject to none how came the ephori to be established to restrain the power of kings if it could no way be restrained if all owed obedience to them and they to none why did theopompus his wife reprove him for suffering his power to be diminished by their creation if it could not be diminished or why did he say he had made the power more permanent in making it lefs odious if it was perpetual and unalterable we may go farther and taking xenophon and plutarch for our guides assert that the kings of sparta never had the powers of war or peace life and death which our author esteems inseparable from regality and conclude either that no king has them or that all kings are not alike in power if they are not in all places the same kings do not reign by an universal law but by the particular laws of each country which give to every one so much power as in the opinion of the givers conduces to the end of their institution which is the public good  it may be also worth our inquiry how this inherited power came to be hereditary we know that the sons of vespasian and constantine inherited the roman empire tho their fathers had no such title but having gained the empire by violence which hooker says is mere tyranny that can create no right they could devolve none to their children the kings of france of the three races have inherited the crown but meroveus pepin and hugh capet could neither pretend title nor conquest or any other right than what was conferred upon them by the clergy nobility and people and consequently whatsoever is inherited from them can have no other original for that is the gift of the people which is bestowed upon the first under whom the successors claim as if it had bin by a peculiar act given to every one of them it will be more hard to show how the crown of england is become hereditary unless it be by the will of the people for tho it were granted that some of the saxon kings came in by inheritance which i do not having as i think proved them to have bin absolutely elective yet william the norman did not for he was a bastard and could inherit nothing william rufus and henry did not for their elder brother robert by right of inheritance ought to have bin preferred before em stephen and henry the second did not for maud the only heiress of henry the first was living when both were crowned richard and john did not for they were bastards born in adultery they must therefore have received their right from the people or they could have none at all and their successors fall under the same condition  moreover i find great variety in the deduction of this hereditary right in sparta there were two kings of different familys endowed with an equal power if the heraclidae did reign as fathers of the people the aeacidae did not if the right was in the aeacidae the heraclidae could have none for it is equally impossible to have two fathers as two thousand it is in vain to say that two familys joined and agreed to reign jointly for it is evident the spartans had kings before the time of hercules or achilles who were the fathers of the two races if it be said that the regal power with which they were invested did entitle em to the right of fathers it must in like manner have belonged to the roman consuls military tribunes dictators and pretors for they had more power than the spartan kings and that glorious nation might change their fathers every year and multiply or diminish the number of em as they pleased if this be most ridiculous and absurd it is certain that the name and office of king consul dictator or the like dos not confer any determined right upon the person that has it every one has a right to that which is allotted to him by the laws of the country by which be is created  as the persians spartans romans or germans might make such magistrates and under such names as best pleased themselves and accordingly enlarge or diminish their power the same right belongs to all nations and the rights due unto as well as the dutys incumbent upon every one are to be known only by the laws of that place this may seem strange to those who know neither books nor things historys nor laws but is well explained by grotius who denying the sovereign power to be annexed to any name speaks of diverse magistrates under several names that had and others that under the same names had it not and distinguishes grot de jur bell and pac l   c   those who have the summum imperium summo modo from those who have it modo non summo and tho probably he looked on the first sort as a thing merely speculative if by that summo modo a right of doing what one pleases be understood yet he gives many examples of the other among those who had liberrimum imperium if any had it he names the kings of the sabeans who nevertheless were under such a condition that tho they were as agatharchidas reports obeyed in all things whilst they continued within the walls of their palace might be stoned by any that met em without it he finds also another obstacle to the absolute power cum rex partem habeat summi imperii partem senatus sive populus which parts are proportioned according to the laws of each kingdom whether hereditary or elective both being equally regulated by them  the law that gives and measures the power prescribes rules how it should be transmitted in some places the supreme magistrates are annually elected in others their power is for life in some they are merely elective in others hereditary under certain rules or limitations the ancient kingdoms and lordships of spain were hereditary but the succession went ordinarily to the eldest of the reigning family not to the nearest in blood this was the ground of the quarrel between corbis t live l    the brother and orsua the son of the last prince decided by combat before scipio i know not whether the goths brought that custom with em when they conquered spain or whether they learnt it from the inhabitants but certain it is that keeping themselves to the familys of saavedra corona gothica the balthei and amalthei they had more regard to age than proximity and almost ever preferred the brother or eldest kinsman of the last king marian hist hispan before his son the like custom was in use among the moors in spain and africa who according to the several changes that happened among the familys of almohades almoranides and benemerini did always take one of the reigning blood but in the choice of him had most respect to age and capacity this is usually called the law of thanestry and as in many other places prevailed also in ireland till that country fell under the english government  in france and turkey the male that is nearest in blood succeeds and i do not know of any deviation from that rule in france since henry the first was preferred before robert his elder brother grandchild to hugh capet but notwithstanding the great veneration they have for the royal blood they utterly exclude females lest the crown should fall to a stranger or a woman that is seldom able to govern her self should come to govern so great a people some nations admit females either simply as well as males or under a condition of not marrying out of their country or without the consent of the estates with an absolute exclusion of them and their children if they do according to which law now in force among the swedes charles gustavus was chosen king upon the resignation of queen christina as having no title and the crown settled upon the heirs of his body to the utter exclusion of his brother adolphus their mother having married a german tho diverse nations have differently disposed their affairs all those that are not naturally slaves and like to beasts have preferred their own good before the personal interests of him that expects the crown so as upon no pretense whatever to admit of one who is evidently guilty of such vices as are prejudicial to the state for this reason the french tho much addicted to their kings rejected the vile remainders of meroveus his race and made pepin the son of charles martel king and when his descendents fell into the like vices they were often deposed till at last they were wholly rejected and the crown given to capet and to his heirs male as formerly yet for all this henry his grandchild being esteemed more fit to govern than his elder brother robert was as is said before made king and that crown still remains in his descendents no consideration being had of the children of robert who continued dukes of burgundy during the reigns of ten kings and in the memory of our fathers henry of navarr was rejected by two assemblys of the estates because he differed in religion from the body of the nation and could never be received as king till he had renounced his own tho he was certainly the next in blood and that in all other respects he excelled in those virtues which they most esteem  we have already proved that our own history is full of the like examples and might enumerate a multitude of others if it were not too tedious and as the various rules according to which all the hereditary crowns of the world are inherited show that none is set by nature but that every people proceeds according to their own will the frequent deviations from those rules do evidently testify that salus populi est lex suprema and that no crown is granted otherwise than in submission to it  but tho there were a rule which in no case ought to be transgrest there must be a power of judging to whom it ought to be applied it is perhaps hard to conceive one more precise than that of france where the eldest legitimate male in the direct line is preferred and yet that alone is not sufficient there may be bastardy in the case bastards may be thought legitimate and legitimate sons bastards the children born of isabel of portugal during her marriage with john the third of castile were declared bastards and the title of the house of austria to that crown depends upon that declaration we often see that marriages which have bin contracted and for a long time taken to be good have bin declared null and the legitimation of the present king of france is founded solely upon the abolition of the marriage of henry the fourth with marguerite of valois which for the space of twenty seven years was thought to have bin good whilst spain was divided into five or six kingdoms and the several kings linked to each other by mutual alliances incestuous marriages were often contracted and upon better consideration annuld many have bin utterly void through the preingagement of one of the partys these are not feigned cases but such as happen frequently and the diversity of accidents as well as the humors of men may produce many others which would involve nations in the most fatal disorders if every one should think himself obliged to follow such a one who pretended a title that to him might seem plausible when another should set up one as pleasing to others and there were no power to terminate those disputes to which both must submit but the decision must be left to the sword  this is that which i call the application of the rule when it is as plain and certain as human wisdom can make it but if it be left more at large as where females inherit the difficultys are inextricable and he that says the next heir is really king when one is dead before he be so declared by a power that may judge of his title dos as far as in him lies expose nations to be split into the most desperate factions and every man to fight for the title which he fancies to be good till he destroy those of the contrary party or be destroyed by them this is the blessed way proposed by our author to prevent sedition but god be thanked our ancestors found a better they did not look upon robert the norman as king of england after the death of his father and when he did proudly endeavor on pretense of inheritance to impose himself upon the nation that thought fit to prefer his younger brothers before him he paid the penalty of his folly by the loss of his eyes and liberty the french did not think the grandchild of pharamond to be king after the death of his father nor seek who was the next heir of the merovingian line when chilperic the third was dead nor regard the title of charles of lorrain after the death of his brother lothair or of robert of burgundy eldest son of king robert but advanced meroveus pepin capet and henry the first who had no other right than what the nobility and people bestowed upon them and if such acts do not destroy the pretenses of all who lay claim to crowns by inheritance and do not create a right i think it will be hard to find a lawful king in the world or that there ever has bin any since the first did plainly come in like nimrod and those who have bin every where since historys are known to us owed their exaltation to the consent of nations armed or unarmed by the deposition or exclusion of the heirs of such as had reigned before them  our author not troubling himself with these things or any other relating to the matter in question is pleased to slight hookers opinions concerning coronation and inauguration with the heaps of scripture upon which he grounds them whereas those solemnitys would not only have bin foolish and impertinent but profane and impious if they were not deeds by which the right of dominion is really conferred what could be more wickedly superstitious than to call all israel together before the lord and to cast lots upon every tribe family and person for the election of a king if it had bin known to whom the crown did belong by a natural and unalterable right or if there had bin such a thing in nature how could god have caused that lot to fall upon one of the youngest tribe for ever to discountenance his own law and divert nations from taking any notice of it it had bin absurd for the tribe of judah to choose and anoint david and for the other tribes to follow their example after the death of ishbosheth if he had bin king by a right not depending on their will david did worse in slaying the sons of rimmon saying they had killed a righteous man lying upon his bed if ishbosheth whose head they presented had most unrighteously detained from him as long as he lived the dominion of the ten tribes the king elders and people had most scornfully abused the most sacred things by using such ceremonys in making him king and completing their work in a covenant made between him and them before the lord if he had bin already king and if those acts had bin empty ceremonys conferring no right at all  i dare not say that a league dos imply an absolute equality between both partys for there is a foedus inequale wherein the weaker as grotius says dos usually obtain protection and the stronger honor but there can be none at all unless both partys are equally free to make it or not to make it david therefore was not king till he was elected and those covenants made and he was made king by that election and covenants  this is not shaken by our authors supposition that the people would not have taken joas manasseh or josiah if they had had a right of choosing a king since solomon says woe unto the kingdom whose king is a child for first they who at the first had a right of choosing whom they pleased to be king by the covenant made with him whom they did choose may have deprived themselves of the farther execution of it and rendered the crown hereditary even to children unless the conditions come to be violated upon which it was granted in the second place if the infancy of a king brings woe upon a people the government of such a one cannot be according to the laws of god and nature for governments are not instituted by either for the pleasure of a man but for the good of nations and their weal not their woe is sought by both and if children are any where admitted to rule it is by the particular law of the place grounded perhaps upon an opinion that it is the best way to prevent dangerous contests or that other ways may be found to prevent the inconveniences that may proceed from their weakness thirdly it cannot be concluded that they might not reject children because they did not such matters require positive proofs suppositions are of no value in relation to them and the whole matter may be altered by particular circumstances the jews might reasonably have a great veneration for the house of david they knew what was promised to that family and whatever respect was paid or privilege granted on that account can be of no advantage to any other in the world they might be farther induced to set up joas in hope the defects of his age might be supplied by the virtue experience and wisdom of jehoiada we do not know what good opinion may have bin conceived of manasseh when he was twelve years old but much might be hoped from one that had bin virtuously educated and was probably under the care of such as had bin chosen by hezekiah and tho the contrary did fall out the mischiefs brought upon the people by his wicked reign proceeded not from the weakness of his childhood but from the malice of his riper years and both the examples of joas and josiah prove that neither of em came in by their own right but by the choice of the people jehoiada gathered the levites out of all the citys of judah and the chief of the fathers   chronicles    of israel and they came to jerusalem and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god and brought out the kings son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony and made him king whereupon they slew athaliah and when ammon was slain   chronicles    the people of the land slew them that had conspired against king ammon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead which had bin most impertinent if he was of himself king before they made him so besides tho infancy may be a just cause of excepting against and rejecting the next heir to a crown it is not the greatest or strongest it is far more easy to find a remedy against the folly of a child if the state be well regulated than the more rooted vices of grown men the english who willingly received henry the sixth edward the fifth and sixth tho children resolutely opposed robert the norman and the french who willingly submitted to charles the ninth lewis the thirteenth and fourteenth in their infancy rejected the rude remainders of meroveus his race charles of lorrain with his kindred descended from pepin robert duke of burgundy with his descendents and henry of navarr till he had satisfied the nobility and people in the point of religion and tho i do not know that the letter upon the words vae regno lamb leg saxon cujus rex per est recited by lambard was written by eleutherius bishop of rome yet the authority given to it by the saxons who made it a law is much more to be valued than what it could receive from the writer and whoever he was he seems rightly to have understood solomons meaning who did not look upon him as a child that wanted years or was superannuated but him only who was guilty of insolence luxury folly and madness and he that said a wise child was better than an old and foolish king could have no other meaning unless he should say it was worse to be governed by a wise person than a fool which may agree with the judgment of our author but could never enter into the heart of solomon  lastly tho the practice of one or more nations may indicate what laws covenants or customs were in force among them yet they cannot bind others the diversity of them proceeds from the variety of mens judgments and declares that the direction of all such affairs depends upon their own will according to which every people for themselves do form and measure the magistracy and magistratical power which as it is directed solely for the good has its exercises and extent proportionable to the command of those that institute it and such ordinances being good for men god makes them his own  sect viii there is no natural propensity in man or beast to monarchy i see no reason to believe that god did approve the government of one over many because he created but one but to the contrary in as much he did endow him and those that came from him as well the youngest as the eldest line with understanding to provide for themselves and by the invention of arts and sciences to be beneficial to each other he showed that they ought to make use of that understanding in forming governments according to their own convenience and such occasions as should arise as well as in other matters and it might as well be inferred that it is unlawful for us to build clothe arm defend or nourish our selves otherwise than our first parents did before or soon after the flood as to take from us the liberty of instituting governments that were not known to them if they did not find out all that conduces to the use of man but a faculty as well as a liberty was left to every one and will be to the end of the world to make use of his wit industry and experience according to present exigences to invent and practice such things as seem convenient to himself and others in matters of the least importance it were absurd to imagine that the political science which of all others is the most abstruse and variable according to accidents and circumstances should have bin perfectly known to them who had no use of it and that their descendents are obliged to add nothing to what they practiced but the reason given by our author to prove this extravagant fancy is yet more ridiculous than the thing it self god says he showed his opinion viz that all should be governed by one when he endowed not only men but beasts with a natural propensity to monarchy neither can it be doubted but a natural propensity is referred to god who is the author of nature which i suppose may appear if it be considered  nevertheless i cannot but commend him in the first place for introducing god speaking so modestly not declaring his will but his opinion he puts haughty and majestic language into the mouth of kings they command and decide as if they were subject to no error and their will ought to be taken for perpetual laws but to god he ascribes an humble delivery of his opinion only as if he feared to be mistaken in the second place i deny that there is any such general propensity in man or beast or that monarchy would thereby be justified tho it were found in them it cannot be in beasts for they know not what government is and being incapable of it cannot distinguish the several sorts nor consequently incline to one more than another salmasius his story of bees is only fit for old women to prate of in chimnycorners and they who represent lions and eagles as kings of birds and beasts do it only to show that their power is nothing but brutish violence exercised in the destruction of all that are not able to oppose it and that has nothing of goodness or justice in it which similitude tho it should prove to be in all respects adequate to the matter in question could only show that those who have no sense of right reason or religion have a natural propensity to make use of their strength to the destruction of such as are weake than they and not that any are willing to submit or not to resist it if they can which i think will be of no great advantage to monarchy but whatever propensity may be in beasts it cannot be attributed generally to men for if it were they never could have deviated from it unless they were violently put out of their natural course which in this case cannot be for there is no power to force them but that they have most frequently deviated appears by the various forms of government established by them there is therefore no natural propensity to any one but they choose that which in their judgment seems best for them or if he would have that inconsiderate impulse by which brutish and ignorant men may be swayed when they know no better to pass for a propensity others are no more obliged to follow it than to live upon acorns or inhabit hollow trees because their fathers did it when they had no better dwellings and found no better nourishment in the uncultivated world and he that exhibits such examples as far as in him lies endeavors to take from us the use of reason and extinguishing the light of it to make us live like the worst of beasts that we may be fit subjects to absolute monarchy this may perhaps be our authors intention having learned from aristotle that such a government is only suitable to the nature of the most bestial men who being incapable of governing themselves fall under the power of such as will take the conduct of em but he ought withal to have remembered that according to aristotles opinion this conductor must be in nature different from those he takes the charge of and if he be not there can be no government nor order by which it subsists beasts follow beasts and the blind lead the blind to destruction  but tho i should grant this propensity to be general it could not be imputed to god since man by sin is fallen from the law of his creation the wickedness of man even in the first ages was great in the world all the imaginations of his heart are evil and that continually all men are liars there is none that does good no not one out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulterys fornications thefts false testimonys etc these are the fruits of our corrupted nature which the apostle observing dos not only make a difference between the natural and the spiritual man whose proceeding only can be referred to god and that only so far as he is guided by his spirit but shows that the natural man is in a perpetual enmity against god without any possibility of being reconciled to him unless by the destruction of the old man and the regenerating or renewing him through the spirit of grace there being no footsteps of this in our authors book he and his master heylin may have differed from the apostle referring that propensity of nature to god which he declares to be utter enmity against him and we may conclude that this propensity however general it may be cannot be attributed to god as the author of nature since it cannot be more general than the corruptions into which we are fallen  sect ix the government instituted by god over the israelites was aristocratical notwithstanding all this our author is resolved that monarchy must be from god what form of government says he god ordained by his authority may be gathered by that commonwealth which he instituted amongst the hebrews which was not aristocratical as calvin says but plainly monarchical i may in as few words deny the government set up by god to have bin monarchical as he asserts it but finding such language ordinarily to proceed from a mixture of folly impudence and pride i choose rather to show upon what i ground my opinions than nakedly to deliver them most especially when by insisting upon the government instituted by god over his people he refers us to the scripture and i do this the more boldly since i follow calvins exposition and believe that he having bin highly esteemed for his wit judgment and learning by such as were endowed with the like and reverenced as a glorious servant of god might if he were now alive comfort himself tho he had the misfortune to fall under the censures of filmer and his followers it is probable he gave some reasons for his opinions but our author having maliciously concealed em and i not having leisure at present to examine all his writings to find em must content my self with such as my small understanding may suggest and such as i have found in approved authors  in the first place i may safely say he was not alone of that opinion josephus philo and moses maimonides with all the best of the jewish and christian authors had long before delivered the same josephus o ant jud says that readiness first sin by which he fell was that he took away the aristocracy which he could not do if it had never bin established philo imputes the institution of kingly government as it was in israel neither to god nor his word but to the fury of the sinful people abarbenel says it proceeded from their delight in the idolatry to which their abar in   samuel   neighbors were addicted and which could be upheld only by a government in practice and principle contrary to that which god had instituted maimonides frequently says the same thing grounded upon the maim morenevochim words of hosea i gave them kings in my wrath and whosoever will call that a divine institution may give the same name to plagues or famines and induce a necessity incumbent upon all men to go and search the one where they may find it and to leave their lands for ever uncultivated that they may be sure of the other which being too bestial to be asserted by a man i may safely say the hebrew kings were not instituted by god but given as a punishment of their sin who despised the government he had instituted and the abovementioned authors agree in the same thing calling the peoples desire to have a king furious mad wicked and proceeding from their love to the idolatry of their neighbors which was suited to their government both which were inconsistent with what god had established over his own people  but waving the opinions of men it is good to see what we can learn from the scripture and inquire if there be any precept there expressly commanding them to make a king or any example that they did so whilst they continued obedient to the word of god or any thing from whence we may reasonably infer they ought to have done it all which if i mistake not will be found directly contrary  the only precept that we find in the law concerning kings is that of deuteronomy    already mentioned and that is not a command to the people to make but instructions what manner of king they should make if they desired to have one there was therefore none at all  examples do as little favor our authors assertions moses joshua and the other judges had not the name or power of kings they were not of the tribe to which the scepter was promised they did not transmit the power they had to their children which in our adversarys opinion is a right inseparable from kings and their power was not continued by any kind of succession but created occasionally as need required according to the virtues discovered in those who were raised by god to deliver the nation in the time of their distress which being done their children lay hid among the rest of the people thus were ehud gideon jephtha and others set up whosoever will give battle say the princes judge   and people of gilead to the children of ammon shall be head over the inheritance of gilead and finding jephtha to be such a man as they sought they made him their chief and all israel followed them when othniel had showed his valor in taking kiriath sepher and delivering his brethren from cushanrishathaim he was made judge when ehud had killed eglon when shamgar and samson had destroyed great numbers of the philistines and when gideon had defeated the midianites they were sit to be advanced above their brethren these dignitys were not inherent in their persons or familys but conferred upon them nor conferred that they might be exalted in riches and glory but that they might be ministers of good to the people this may justify platos opinion that if one man be found incomparably to excel all others in the virtues that are beneficial to civil societys he ought to be advanced above all but i think it will be hard from thence to deduce an argument in favor of such a monarchy as is necessarily to descend to the next in blood whether man woman or child without any consideration of virtue age sex or ability and that failing it can be of no use to our author but whatever the dignity of a hebrew judge was and howsoever he was raised to that office it certainly differed from that of a king gideon could not have refused to be a king when the people would have made him so if he had bin a king already or that god from the beginning had appointed they should have one the elders and people   samuel   could not have asked a king of samuel if he had bin king and he could not without impiety have bin displeased with them for asking such a one as god had appointed neither would god have said to him they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them if he had ordained what they desired  they did not indeed reject god with their mouths they pretended to use the liberty he had given them to make a king but would have such a one as he had forbidden they drew near to him with their lips but their hearts were far from him and he seeing their hypocrisy severely chastisd em in granting their ill conceived request and foretold the miserys that should thereupon befall em from which he would not deliver em tho they should cry to him by reason of what they suffered from their king he was their creature and the mischiefs thereby brought upon them were the fruits of their own labor  this is that which our author calls gods institution of kings but the hos    prophet explains the matter much better i gave them kings in my anger and took them away in my wrath in destroying them god brought desolation upon the people that had sinned in asking for them and following their example in all kind of wickedness this is all that our author has to boast of but god who acknowledges those works only to be his own which proceed from his goodness and mercy to his people disowns this hos   israel has cast off the thing that is good even the government that he had established the enemy shall pursue him they have set up kings but not by me and princes but i know them not as if he sought to justify the severity of his judgments brought upon them by the wickedness of their kings that they not he had ordained  having seen what government god did not ordain it may be seasonable to examine the nature of the government which he did ordain and we shall easily find that it consisted of three parts besides the magistrates of the several tribes and citys they had a chief magistrate who was numb    called judge or captain as joshua gideon and others a council of seventy chosen men and the general assemblys of the people  the first was merely occasional like to the dictators of rome and as the romans in times of danger frequently chose such a man as was much esteemed for valor and wisdom gods peculiar people had a peculiar regard to that wisdom and valor which was accompanied with his presence hoping for deliverance only from him  the second is known by the name of the great sanhedrin which being instituted by moses according to the command of god continued till they were all save one slain by herod and the third part which is the assembly of the people was so common that none can be ignorant of it but such as never looked into the scripture when the tribes of reuben gad and half that of manasseh had built an altar on the side of jordan josh    the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered together at shiloh to go up to war against them and sent phineas the son of eleazer and with him ten princes etc this was the highest and most important action that could concern a people even war or peace and that not with strangers but their own brethren joshua was then alive the elders never failed yet this was not transacted by him or them but by the collected body of the people for they sent phineas this democratical embassy was democratically received it was not directed to one man but to all the children of reuben gad and manasseh and the answer was sent by them all which being pleasing to phineas and the ten that were with him they made their report to the congregation and all was quiet  the last eminent act performed by joshua was the calling of a like assembly to shechem composed of elders heads of familys judges officers jos    and all the people to whom he proposed and they agreeing made a covenant before the lord  joshua being dead the proceedings of every tribe were grounded upon counsels taken at such assemblys among themselves for their own concerns as appears by the actions of judah simeon etc against the canaanites and when the levite complained that his wife had bin forced judge   by those of gibeah the whole congregation of israel met together at mispeth from all parts even from dan to beersheba as one man and there resolved upon that terrible war which they made against the tribe of benjamin the like assembly was gathered together for the election of saul every man was there and tho the elders only are said to have asked a king of samuel they seem to have bin deputed from the whole congregation for god said hearken to the voice of the people in the   samuel     same manner the tribe of judah and after that the rest chose and anointed david to be their king after the death of solomon all israel met together to treat with rehoboam and not receiving satisfaction from him ten of the tribes abrogated his kingdom  if these actions were considered singly by themselves calvin might have given the name of a democracy to the hebrew government as well as to that of athens for without doubt they evidently manifest the supreme power to have bin in the supreme manner in these general assemblys but the government as to its outward order consisting of those three parts which comprehend the three simple species and no times having bin appointed nor occasions specified upon which judges should be chosen or these assemblys called whereas the sanhedrim which was the aristocratical part was permanent the whole might rightly be called an aristocracy that part prevailing above the others and tho josephus calls it a theocracy by reason of gods presence with his people yet in relation to man he calls it an aristocracy and says that readiness first sin by which he fell from the kingdom was that gubernationem optimatum sustulit which could not be if they were governed by a monarch before he was chosen  our author taking no notice of these matters first endeavors to prove the excellency of monarchy from natural instinct and then begging the question says that god did always govern his people by monarchy whereas he ought in the first place to have observed that this instinct if there be any such thing is only an irrational appetite attributed to beasts that know not why they do any thing and is to be followed only by those men who being equally irrational live in the same ignorance and the second being proved to be absolutely false by the express words of the scripture there was then no king in israel several judge    times repeated and the whole series of the history he has no other evasion than to say that even then the israelites were under the kingly government of the fathers of particular familys  it appears by the forementioned text cited also by our author that in the assembly of the people gathered together to take counsel concerning the war against benjamin were four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword they all arose together saying not a man of us shall go to his tent so all the men of israel were gathered together against the city this is repeated several times in the relation the benjamites proceeded in the like manner in preparing for their defense and if all these who did so meet to consult and determine were monarchs there were then in israel and benjamin four hundred twenty six thousand seven hundred monarchs or kings tho the scripture says there was not one  if yet our author insists upon his notion of kingly government i desire to know who were the subjects if all these were kings for the text says that the whole congregation was gathered together as one man from dan to beersheba if there can be so many kings without one subject what becomes of the right of abraham isaac and jacob that was to have bin devolved upon one man as heir to them and thereby lord of all if every man had an equal part in that inheritance and by virtue of it became a king why is not the same eternally subdivided to as many men as are in the world who are also kings if this be their natural condition how comes it to be altered till they dethrone themselves by consent to set up one or more to have a power over them all why should they divest themselves of their natural right to set up one above themselves unless in consideration of their own good if the     00 kings might retain the power in themselves or give it to one why might they not give it to any such number of men as should best please themselves or retain it in their own hands as they did till the days of saul or frame limit and direct it according to their own pleasure if this be true god is the author of democracy and no assertor of human liberty did ever claim more than the people of god did enjoy and exercise at the time when our author says they were under the kingly government which liberty being not granted by any peculiar concession or institution the same must belong to all mankind  it is in vain to say the     00 men were heads of familys for the scripture only says they were footmen that drew the sword or rather all the men of israel from dan to beersheba who were able to make war when six hundred benjamites did only remain of the    00 it is plain that no more were left of that tribe their women and children having bin destroyed in the citys after their defeat the next chapter makes the matter yet more plain for when all that were at the congregation in mispeth were found to have sworn they would not give their daughters to any of the tribe of benjamin no israelite was free from the oath but jdg   the men of jabesh gilead who had not bin at the assembly all the rest of israel was therefore comprehended and they continuing to govern in a popular way with absolute power sent twelve thousand of their most valiant men to destroy all the males of jabesh gilead and the women that had lain by man reserving the virgins for the benjamites this is enough for my purpose for the question is not concerning the power that every householder in london has over his wife children and servants but whether they are all perpetually subject to one man and family and i intend not to set up their wives prentices and children against them or to diminish their rights but to assert them as the gift of god and nature no otherwise to be restrained than by laws made with their own consent  reason failing our author pleases himself with terms of his own invention when the people begged a king of samuel they were governed by a kingly power god out of a special love and care to the house of israel did choose to be their king himself and did govern them at that time by his viceroy samuel and his sons the behavior of the israelites toward samuel has bin thought proud perverse and obstinate but the fine courtword begging was never before applied to them and their insolent fury was not only seen against samuel but againandst god they have not rejected thee   samuel   but they have rejected me and i think filmer is the first who ever found that beggars in begging did reject him of whom they begged or if they were beggars they were such as would not be denied for after all that samuel had said to dissuade them from their wicked design they said nay but we will have a king ver      but lest i should be thought too much inclined to contradict our author i confess that once he has happened to be in the right god out of a special love to the house of israel chose to be their king he gave them laws prescribed a form of government raised up men in a wonderful manner to execute it filled them with his spirit was ever present when they called upon him he gave them counsel in their doubts and assistance in all their extremitys he made a covenant with them and would be exalted by them but what is this to an earthly monarch who can from hence derive a right to any one man to play the lord over his brethren or a reason why any nation should set him up god is our lord by right of creation and our only lord because he only has created us if any other were equal to him in wisdom power goodness and beneficence to us he might challenge the same duty from us if growing out of our selves receiving being from none depending on no providence we were offered the protection of a wisdom subject to no error a goodness that could never fail and a power that nothing could resist it were reasonable for us to enter into a covenant submit our selves to him and with all the facultys of our minds to addict our selves to his service but what right can from hence accrue to a mortal creature like to one of us from whom we have received nothing and who stands in need of help as much as we who can from hence deduce an argument to persuade us to depend upon his wisdom who has as little as other men to submit to his will who is subject to the same frailtys passions and vices with the rest of mankind or to expect protection and defense from him whose life depends upon as slender threads as our own and who can have no power but that which we confer upon him if this cannot be done but is of all things the most contrary to common sense no man can in himself have any right over us we are all as free as the four hundred twenty six thousand seven hundred hebrew kings we can naturally owe allegiance to none and i doubt whether all the lusts that have reigned amongst men since the beginning of the world have brought more guilt and misery upon them than that preposterous and impudent pretense of imitating what god had instituted when saul set himself most violently to oppose the command of god he pretended to fulfill it when the jews grew weary of gods government and resolved to reject him that he should not reign over them they used some of moses his words and asked that king of god whom they intended to set up against him but this king had not bin set up against god the people had not rejected god and sinned in asking for him if every nation by a general law ought to have one or by a particular law one had bin appointed by him over them there was therefore no king amongst them nor any law of god or nature particular or general according to which they ought to have one  sect x aristotle was not simply for monarchy or against popular government but approved or disapproved of either according to circumstances our author well observes that aristotle is hardly brought to give a general opinion in favor of monarchy as if it were the best form of government or to say true never dos it he uses much caution proposes conditions and limitations and makes no decision but according to circumstances men of wisdom and learning are subject to such doubts but none ought to wonder if stupidity and ignorance defend filmer and his followers from them or that their hatred to the ancient virtue should give em an aversion to the learning that was the nurse of it those who neither understand the several species of government nor the various tempers of nations may without fear or shame give their opinions in favor of that which best pleases them but wise men will always proportion their praises to the merit of the subject and never commend that simply which is good only according to circumstances aristotle highly applauds monarchy when the monarch has more of those virtues that tend to the good of a commonwealth than all they who compose it this is the king mentioned in his ethics and extolled in his politics he is above all by nature and ought not by a municipal law to be made equal to others in power he ought to govern because it is better for a people to be governed by him than to enjoy their liberty or rather they do enjoy their liberty which is never more safe than when defended by one who is a living law to himself and others wheresoever such a man appears he ought to reign he bears in his person the divine character of a sovereign god has raised him above all and such as will not submit to him ought to be accounted sons of belial brought forth and slain but he dos withal confess that if no such man be found there is no natural king all the prerogatives belonging to him vanish for want of one who is capable of enjoying them he lays severe censures upon those who not being thus qualified take upon them to govern men equal to or better than themselves and judges the assumption of such powers by persons not naturally adapted to the administration of them as barbarous usurpations which no law or reason can justify and is not so much transported with the excellency of this true king as not to at ot  confess he ought to be limited by law qui legem praeesse jubet videtur jubere praeesse deum and leges qui autem hominem praeesse jubet adjungit and bestiam libido quippe talis est atque obliquos agit etiam viros optimos qui sunt in potstate ex quo mens atque appetitus lex est this agrees with the words of the best king that is known to have bin in the world proceeding as is most probable from a sense of the passions that reigned in his own breast man being in honor has no understanding but is like to the beast that perishes this shows that such as deny that kings do reign by law or that laws may be put upon kings do equally set themselves against the opinions of wise men and the word of god and our author having found that learning made the grecians seditious may reasonably doubt that religion may make others worse so as none will be fit subjects of his applauded government but those who have neither religion nor learning and that it cannot be introduced till both be extinguished  aristotle having declared his mind concerning government in the books expressly written on that subject whatsoever is said by the by in his moral discourses must be referred to and interpreted by the other and if he said which i do not find that monarchy is the best form of government and a popular state the worst he cannot be thought to have meant otherwise than that those nations were the most happy who had such a man as he thinks fit to be made a monarch and those the most unhappy who neither had such a one nor a few that any way excelled the rest but all being equally brutish must take upon em the government they were unable to manage for he dos no where admit any other end of just and civil government than the good of the governed nor any advantage due to one or a few persons unless for such virtues as conduce to the common good of the society and as our author thinks learning makes men seditious aristotle also acknowledges that those who have understanding and courage which may be taken for learning or the effect of it will never endure the government of one or a few that do not excel them in virtue but no where dispraises a popular government unless the multitude be composed of such as are barbarous stupid lewd vicious and incapable of the happiness for which governments are instituted who cannot live to themselves but like a herd of beasts must be brought under the dominion of another or who having among themselves such an excellent person as is above described will not submit to him but either kill banish or bring him to be equal with others whom god had made to excel all i do not trouble my self or the reader with citing here and there a line out of his books but refer my self to those who have perused his moral and political writings submitting to the severest censures if this be not the true sense of em and that virtue alone in his opinion ought to give the preeminence and as aristotle following the wise men of those times shows us how far reason improved by meditation can advance in the knowledge and love of that which is truly good so we may in filmer guided by heylin see an example of corrupted christians who extinguishing the light of religion by their vices and degenerating into beasts whilst they endeavor to support the personal interest of some men who are raised to dignitys by the consent of nations or by unwarrantable ways and means would cast all the power into the hands of such as happen to be born in certain familys as if governments had not bin instituted for the common good of nations but only to increase their pride and foment their vices or that the care and direction of a great people were so easy a work that every man woman or child how young weak foolish or wicked soever may be worthy of it and able to manage it  sect xi liberty produces virtue order and stability slavery is accompanied with vice weakness and misery our authors judgment as well as inclinations to virtue are manifested in the preference he gives to the manners of the assyrians and other eastern nations before the grecians and romans whereas the first were never remarkable for any thing but pride leudness treachery cruelty cowardice madness and hatred to all that is good whilst the others excelled in wisdom valor and all the virtues that deserve imitation this was so well observed by st augustine that de civ dei he brings no stronger argument to prove that god leaves nothing that is good in man unrewarded than that he gave the dominion of the best part of the world to the romans who in moral virtues excelled all other nations and i think no example can be alleged of a free people that has ever bin conquered by an absolute monarch unless he did incomparably surpass them in riches and strength whereas many great kings have bin overthrown by small republics and the success being constantly the same it cannot be attributed to fortune but must necessarily be the production of virtue and good order machiavel discoursing of these matters finds virtue to be so essentially necessary to the establishment and preservation of liberty that he thinks it impossible for a corrupted people to set up a good government or for a tyranny to be introduced if they be virtuous and makes this si puo far questa conclusione che dove la materia non e corrotta i tumulti ed altri scandali non nuocono la dove la e corrotta le buone leggi non giovano machiav disc sopra t livio lib   conclusion that where the matter that is the body of the people is not corrupted tumults and disorders do no hurt and where it is corrupted good laws do no good which being confirmed by reason and experience i think no wise man has ever contradicted him  but i do not more wonder that filmer should look upon absolute monarchy to be the nurse of virtue tho we see they did never subsist together than that he should attribute order and stability to it whereas order principally consists in appointing to every one his right place office or work and he lays the whole weight of the government upon one person who very often dos neither deserve nor is able to bear the least part of it plato aristotle hooker and i may say in short all wise men have held that order required that the wisest best and most valiant should be placed in the offices where wisdom virtue and valor are requisite if common sense did not teach us this we might learn it from the scripture when god gave the conduct of his people to moses joshua samuel and others he endowed them with all the virtues and graces required for the right performance of their duty when the israelites were oppressed by the midianites philistines and ammonites they expected help from the most vise and valiant when hannibal was at the gates of rome and had filled italy with fire and blood or when the gauls overwhelmed that country with their multitudes and fury the senate and people of rome put themselves under the conduct of camillus manlius fabius scipio and the like and when they failed to choose such as were fit for the work to be done they received such defeats as convinced em of their error but if our author say true order required that the power of defending the country should have bin annexed as an inheritance to one family or left to him that could get it and the exercise of all authority committed to the next in blood tho the weakest of women or the basest of men  the like may be said of judging or doing of justice and it is absurd to pretend that either is expected from the power not the person of the monarch for experience dos too well show how much all things halt in relation to justice or defense when there is a defect in him that ought to judge us and to fight our battles but of all things this ought least to be alleged by the advocats for absolute monarchy who deny that the authority can be separated from the person and lay it as a fundamental principle that whosoever has it may do what he pleases and be accountable to no man  our authors next work is to show that stability is the effect of this good order but he ought to have known that stability is then only worthy of praise when it is in that which is good no man delights in sickness or pain because it is long or incurable nor in slavery and misery because it is perpetual much less will any man in his senses commend a permanency in vice and wickedness he must therefore prove that the stability he boasts of is in things that are good or all that he says of it signifies nothing  i might leave him here with as little fear that any man who shall espouse his quarrel will ever be able to remove this obstacle as that he himself should rise out of his grave and do it but i hope to prove that of all things under the sun there is none more mutable or unstable than absolute monarchy which is all that i dispute against professing much veneration for that which is mixed regulated by law and directed to the public good  this might be proved by many arguments but i shall confine my self to two the one drawn from reason the other from matters of fact  nothing can be called stable that is not so in principle and practice in which respect human nature is not well capable of stability but the utmost deviation from it that can be imagined is when such an error is laid for a foundation as can never be corrected all will confess that if there be any stability in man it must be in wisdom and virtue and in those actions that are thereby directed for in weakness folly and madness there can be none the stability therefore that we seek in relation to the exercise of civil and military powers can never be found unless care be taken that such as exercise those powers be endowed with the qualitys that should make them stable this is utterly repugnant to our authors doctrine he lays for a foundation that the succession goes to the next in blood without distinction of age sex or personal qualitys whereas even he himself could not have the impudence to say that children and women where they are admitted or fools madmen and such as are full of all wickedness do not come to be the heirs of reigning familys as well as of the meanest the stability therefore that can be expected from such a government either depends upon those who have none in themselves or is referred wholly to chance which is directly opposite to stability  this would be the case tho it were as we say an even wager whether the person would be fit or unfit and that there were as many men in the world able as unable to perform the duty of a king but experience showing that among many millions of men there is hardly one that possesses the qualitys required in a king it is so many to one that he upon whom the lot shall fall will not be the man we seek in whose person and government there can be such a stability as is asserted and that failing all must necessarily fail for there can be no stability in his will laws or actions who has none in his person  that we may see whether this be verified by experience we need not search into the dark relations of the babylonian and assyrian monarchys those rude ages afford us little instruction and tho the fragments of history remaining do sufficiently show that all things there were in perpetual fluctuation by reason of the madness of their kings and the violence of those who transported the empire from one place or family to another i will not much rely upon them but slightly touching some of their storys pass to those that are better known to us  the kings of those ages seem to have lived rather like beasts in a forest than men joined in civil society they followed the example of nimrod the mighty hunter force was the only law that prevailed the stronger devoured the weaker and continued in power till ejected by one of more strength or better fortune by this means the race of ninus was destroyed by belochus arbaces rent the kingdom asunder and took media to himself morodach extinguished the race of belochus and was made king nabuchodonosor like a flood overwhelmed all for a time destroyed the kingdoms of jerusalem and egypt with many others and found no obstacle till his rage and pride turned to a most bestial madness and the assyrian empire was wholly abolished at the death of his grandchild belshazzar and no stability can be found in the reigns of those great kings unless that name be given to the pride idolatry cruelty and wickedness in which they remained constant if we examine matters more distinctly we shall find that all things varid according to the humor of the prince whilst pharaoh lived who had received many signal services from joseph the israelites were well used but when another rose up who knew him not they were persecuted with all the extremitys of injustice and cruelty till the furious king persisting in his design of exterminating them brought destruction upon himself and the nation where the like power has prevailed it has ever produced the like effects when some great men of persia had persuaded darius that it was a fine thing to command that no man for the space of thirty days should make any petition to god or man but to the king only daniel the most wise and holy man then in the world must be thrown to the lions when god   had miraculously saved him the same sentence was passed against the princes of the nation when haman had filled ahasuerus his ears with lies all the jews were appointed to be slain and when the fraud of that villain was detected leave was given them with the like precipitancy to kill whom they pleased when the israelites came to have kings they were subject to the same storms and always with their blood suffered the penalty of their princes madness when one kind of fury possessed saul he slew the priests persecuted david and would have killed his brave son jonathan when he fell under another he took upon him to do the priests office pretended to understand the word of god better than samuel and spared those that god had commanded him to destroy upon another whimsy he killed the gibeonites and never rested from finding new inventions to vex the people till he had brought many thousands of them to perish with himself and his sons on mount gilboa we do not find any king in wisdom valor and holiness equal to david and yet he falling under the temptations that attend the greatest fortunes brought civil wars and a plague upon the nation when solomons heart was drawn away by strange women he filled the land with idols and oppressed the people with intolerable tributes rehoboams folly made that rent in the kingdom which could never be made up under his successors the people served god baal or ashtaroth as best pleased him who had the power and no other marks of stability can be alleged to have bin in that kingdom than the constancy of their kings in the practice of idolatry their cruelty to the prophets hatred to the jews and civil wars producing such slaughters as are reported in few other storys the kingdom was in the space of about two hundred years possessed by nine several familys not one of em getting possession otherwise than by the slaughter of his predecessor and the extinction of his race and ended in the bondage of the ten tribes which continues to this day  he that desires farther proofs of this point may seek em in the historys of alexander of macedon and his successors he seems to have bin endowed with all the virtues that nature improved by discipline did ever attain so that he is believed to be the man meant by aristotle who on account of the excellency of his virtues was by nature framed for a king and plutarch ascribes his conquests rather to those than to his fortune plut in vic alex but even that virtue was overthrown by the successes that accompanied it he burnt the most magnificent palace of the world in a frolic to please a mad drunken whore upon the most frivolous suggestions of eunuchs and rascals he killed the best and bravest of his friends and his valor which had no equal not subsisting without his other virtues perished when he became lewd proud cruel and superstitious so as it may be truly said he died a coward his successors did not differ from him when they had killed his mother wife and children they exercised their fury against one another and tearing the kingdom to pieces the survivors left the sword as an inheritance to their familys who perished by it or under the weight of the roman chains  when the romans had lost that liberty which had bin the nurse of their virtue and gained the empire in lieu of it they attained to our authors applauded stability julius being slain in the senate the first question was whether it could be restored or not and that being decided by the battle of philippi the conquerors set themselves to destroy all the eminent men in the city as the best means to establish the monarchy augustus gained it by the death of antonius and the corruption of the soldiers and he dying naturally or by the fraud of his wife the empire was transferred to her son tiberius under whom the miserable people suffered the worst effects of the most impure lust and inhuman cruelty he being stifled the government went on with much uniformity and stability caligula claudius nero galba otho vitellius regularly and constantly did all the mischief they could and were not more like to each other in the villanys they committed than in the deaths they suffered vespasians more gentle reign did no way compensate the blood he spilt to attain the empire and the benefits received from titus his short lived virtue were infinitely overbalancd by the detestable vices of his brother domitian who turned all things into the old channel of cruelty lust rapine and perfidiousness his slaughter gave a little breath to the gasping perishing world and men might be virtuous under the government of nerva trajan antoninus aurelius and a few more tho even in their time religion was always dangerous but when the power fell into the hands of commodus heliogabalus caracalla and others of that sort nothing was safe but obscurity or the utmost excesses of leudness and baseness however whilst the will of the governor passed for a law and the power did usually fall into the hands of such as were most bold and violent the utmost security that any man could have for his person or estate depended upon his temper and princes themselves whether good or bad had no longer leases of their lives than the furious and corrupted soldiers would give them and the empire of the world was changeable according to the success of a battle  matters were not much mended when the emperors became christians some favored those who were called orthodox and gave great revenues to corrupt the clergy others supported arianism and persecuted the orthodox with as much asperity as the pagans had done some revolted and showed themselves more fierce against the professors of christianity than they that had never had any knowledge of it the world was torn in pieces amongst them and often suffered as great miserys by their sloth ignorance and co wardice as by their fury and madness till the empire was totally dissolved and lost that which under the weakness and irregularity of a popular government had conquered all from the euphrates to britain and destroyed the kingdoms of asia egypt macedon numidia and a multitude of others was made a prey to unknown barbarous nations and rent into as many pieces as it had bin composed of when it enjoyed the stability that accompanys divine and absolute monarchy  the like may be said of all the kingdoms in the world they may have their ebbings and flowings according to the virtues or vices of princes or their favorites but can never have any stability because there is and can be none in them or if any exception may be brought against this rule it must be of those monarchys only which are mixed and regulated by laws where diets parliaments assemblys of estates or senats may supply the defects of a prince restrain him if he prove extravagant and reject such as are found to be unworthy of their office which are as odious to our author and his followers as the most popular governments and can be of no advantage to his cause  there is another ground of perpetual fluctuation in absolute monarchys or such as are grown so strong that they cannot be restrained by law tho according to their institution they ought to be distinct from but in some measure relating to the inclinations of the monarch that is the impulse of ministers favorites wives or whores who frequently govern all things according to their own passions or interests and tho we cannot say who were the favorites of every one of the assyrian or egyptian kings yet the examples beforementioned of the different method followed in egypt before and after the death of joseph and in persis whilst the idolatrous princes and haman or daniel esther and mordecai were in credit the violent changes happening thereupon give us reason to believe the like were in the times of other kings and if we examine the historys of latter ages and the lives of princes that are more exactly known we shall find that kingdoms are more frequently swayed by those who have power with the prince than by his own judgment so that whosoever has to deal with princes concerning foreign or domestic affairs is obliged more to regard the humor of those persons than the most important interests of a prince or people  i might draw too much envy upon my self if i should take upon me to cite all the examples of this kind that are found in modern historys or the memoirs that do more precisely show the temper of princes and the secret springs by which they were moved but as those who have well observed the management of affairs in france during the reigns of francis the first henry the second francis the second charles the ninth henry the third henry the fourth and lewis the thirteenth will confess that the interests of the dukes of montmorency and guise queen katherine de medicis the duke of epernon la osseuse madame de guiche de gabriele d entragues the marechal d ancre the constable de luines and the cardinal de richelieu were more to be considered by those who had any public or private business to treat at court than the opinions of those princes or the most weighty concernments of the state so it cannot be denied that other kingdoms where princes legally have or wrongfully usurp the like power are governed in the like manner or if it be there is hardly any princes reign that will not furnish abundant proof of what i have asserted  i agree with our author that good order and stability produce strength if monarchy therefore excel in them absolute monarchys should be of more strength than those that are limited according to the proportion of their riches extent of territory and number of people that they govern and those limited monarchys in the like proportion more strong than popular governments or commonwealths if this be so i wonder how a few of those giddy greeks who according to our author had learning enough only to make them seditious came to overthrow the vast armies of the persians as often as they met with em and seldom found any other difficulty than what arose from their own countrymen who sometimes sided with the barbarians seditions are often raised by a little prating but when one man was to fight against fifty or a hundred as at the battles of salamis platea marathon and others then industry wisdom skill and valor were required and if their learning had not made em to excel in those virtues they must have bin overwhelmed by the prodigious multitudes of their enemies this was so well known to the persians that when cyrus the younger prepared to invade his brother artaxerxes plut vit artax he brought together indeed a vast army of asiaticks but chiefly relied upon the counsel and valor of ten thousand grecians whom he had engaged to serve him these giddy heads accompanied with good hands in the great battle near babylon found no resistance from artaxerxes his army and when cyrus was killed by accident in the pursuit of the victory they had gained and their own officers treacherously murdered they made good their retreat into greece under the conduct of xenophon in despite of above four hundred thousand horse and foot who endeavored to oppose them they were destitute of horse money provisions friends and all other help except what their wisdom and valor furnished them and thereupon relying they passed over the bellys of all the enemies that ventured to appear against them in a march of a thousand miles these things were performed in the weakness of popular confusion but agesilaus not being sensible of so great defects accompanied only with six and thirty spartans and such other forces as he could raise upon his personal credit adventured without authority or money to undertake a war against that great king artaxerxes and having often beaten pharnabazus and tissaphernes his lieutenants was preparing to assault him in the heart of his kingdom when he was commanded by the ephori to return for the defense of his own country  it may in like manner appear strange that alexander with the forces of greece much diminished by the phocean peloponnesian theban and other intestin wars could overthrow all the powers of the east and conquer more provinces than any other army ever saw if so much order and stability were to be found in absolute monarchys and if the liberty in which the grecians were educated did only fit them for seditions and it would seem no less astonishing that rome and greece whilst they were free should furnish such numbers of men excelling in all moral virtues to the admiration of all succeeding ages and thereby become so powerful that no monarchs were able to resist them and that the same countries since the loss of their liberty have always bin weak base cowardly and vicious if the same liberty had not bin the mother and nurse of their virtue as well as the root of their power  it cannot be said that alexander was a monarch in our authors sense for the power of the macedonian kings was small philip confessed the people were freemen and his son found them to be so when his fortune had overthrown his virtue and he fell to hate and fear that generosity of spirit which it creates he made his conquests by it and loved it as long as he deserved to be loved his successors had the same fortune when their hearts came to be filled with barbarick pride and to delight only in rendering men slaves they became weak and base and were easily overthrown by the romans whose virtue and fortune did also perish with their liberty all the nations they had to deal with had the same fate they never conquered a free people without extreme difficulty they received many great defeats and were often necessitated to fight for their lives against the latins sabins tuscans samnites carthaginians spaniards and in the height of their power found it a hard work to subdue a few poor etolians but the greatest kings were easily overcome when antiochus had insolently boasted that he would plut in vit q flamin cover greece and italy with the multitude of his troops quintius flaminius ingeniously compared his army of persians chaldeans syrians mesopotamians cappadocians arabians and other base astatic slaves to a supper set before him by a grecian friend which seeming to be of several sorts of venison was all cut out of one hog variously dressed and not long after that vast multitude was as easily slaughtered as the hog had bin the greatest danger of the war with mithridates was to avoid his poisons and treacherys and to follow him through the deserts where he fled when lucullus with less than twenty thousand men had put tigranes plut in vit lucul with two hundred thousand to flight the roman soldiers who for a while had pursued the chase stood still on a sudden and fell into a loud laughter at themselves for using their arms against such wretched cowardly slaves if this be not enough to prove the falsehood of our authors proposition i desire it may be considered whether good order or stability be wanting in venice whether tuscany be in a better condition to defend it self since it fell under the power of the medices or when it was full of free citys whether it were an easy work to conquer switzerland whether the hollanders are of greater strength since the recovery of their liberty or when they groaned under the yoke of spain and lastly whether the entire conquest of scotland and ireland the victorys obtained against the hollanders when in the height of their power and the reputation to which england did rise in less than five years after      be good marks of the instability disorder and weakness of free nations and if the contrary be true nothing can be more absurdly false than our authors assertion  sect xii the glory virtue and power of the romans began and ended with their liberty among many fine things proposed by our author i see none more to be admired or that better declares the soundness of his judgment than that he is only pleased with the beginning and end of the roman empire and says that their time of liberty between those two extremes had nothing of good in it but that it was of short continuance whereas i dare affirm that all that was ever desirable or worthy of praise and imitation in rome proceeded from its liberty and grew up and perished with it which i think will not be contradicted by any but those who prefer the most sordid vices before the most eminent virtues who believe the people to have bin more worthily employed by the tarquins in cleansing jakes and common shores than in acquiring the dominion of the best part of mankind and account it better for a people to be oppressed with hard labor under a proud master in a steril unhealthy tenmile territory than to command all the countries that lie between the fuphrates and britain such opinions will hardly find any better patrons than filmer and his disciples nor the matters of fact as they are represented be denied by any that know the historys of those times many romans may have had seeds of virtue in them whilst in the insancy of that city they lived under kings but they brought forth little fruit tarquin sirnamd the proud being a grecian by extraction had perhaps observed that the virtue of that nation had rendered them averse to the divine government he desired to set up and having by his wellnaturd tullia poisoned his own brother her husband and his own wife her sister married her killed her father and spared none that he thought able to oppose his designs to finish the work he butchered the senate with such as seemed most eminent among the people and like a most pious father endeavored to render the city desolate during that time they who would not be made instruments of those villanys were obliged for their own safety to conceal their virtues but he being removed they shined in their glory whilst he reigned brutus valerius horatius herminius larcius and coriolanus lay hid and unregarded but when they came to fight for themselves and to employ their valor for the good of their country they gave such testimonys of bravery as have bin admired by all succeeding ages and settled such a discipline as produced others like to them or more excellent than they as long as their liberty lasted in two hundred and sixty years that they remained under the government of kings tho all of em the last only excepted were chosen by the senate and people and did as much to advance the public service as could reasonably be expected from them their dominion hardly extended so far as from london to hownslow but in little more than three hundred years after they recovered their liberty they had subdued all the warlike nations of italy destroyed vast armies of the gauls cimbri and germans overthrown the formidable power of carthage conquered the cisalpine and transalpine gauls with all the nations of spain notwithstanding the ferocity of the one and the more constant valor of the other with the prodigious multitudes of both they had brought all greece into subjection and by the conquest of macedon the spoils of the world to adorn their city and found so little difficulty in all the wars that happened between them and the greatest kings after the death of alexander of epirus and pirrhus that the defeats of siphax perses antiochus prusias tigranes ptolomy and many others did hardly deserve to be numbered amongst their victorys  it were ridiculous to impute this to chance or to think that fortune which of all things is the most variable could for so many ages continue the same course unless supported by virtue or to suppose that all these monarchys which are so much extolled could have bin destroyed by that commonwealth if it had wanted strength stability virtue or good order the secret counsels of god are impenetrable but the ways by which he accomplishes his designs are often evident when he intends to exalt a people he fills both them and their leaders with the virtues suitable to the accomplishment of his end and takes away all wisdom and virtue from those he resolves to destroy the pride of the babylonians and assyrians fell through the baseness of sardanapalus and the great city was taken while belshazzar lay drunk amongst his whores the empire was transported to the persians and grecians by the valor of cyrus alexander and the brave armies that followed them historys furnish us with innumerable examples of this kind but i think none can be found of a cowardly weak effeminate foolish illdisciplind people that have ever subdued such as were eminent in strength wisdom valor and good discipline or that these qualitys have bin found or subsisted any where unless cultivated and nourished by a wellordered government if this therefore was found among the romans and not in the kingdoms they overthrew they had the order and stability which the monarchys had not and the strength and virtue by which they obtained such success was the product of them but if this virtue and the glorious effects of it did begin with liberty it also expired with the same the best men that had not fallen in battle were gleaned up by the proscriptions or circumvented for the most part by false and frivolous accusations mankind is inclined to vice and the way to virtue is so hard that it wants encouragement but when all honors advantages and preferments are given to vice and despised virtue finds no other reward than hatred persecution and death there are few who will follow it tacitus well describes the state of the empire when the  tacit  power was absolutely fallen into the hands of one italia novis cladibus vel post longam seculorum seriem repetitis afflicta vrbs incendiis vastata consumptis antiquissimis delubris ipso capitolio civium manibus incenso pollutae ceremoniae magna adulteria plenum exiliis mare infecti caedibus scopuli atrocius in urbe saevitum nobilitas opes omissi vel gesti honores pro crimine and ob virtutes certissimum exitium his following words show that the rewards of these abominations were not less odious than the things themselves the highest dignitys were bestowed upon the delatores who were a kind of rogues like to our irish witnesses or those that by a new coined word we call trepanners this is not a picture drawn by a vulgar hand but by one of the best painters in the world and being a model that so much pleases our author it is good to see what it produced the first fruit was such an entire degeneracy from all good that rome may be justly said never to have produced a brave man since the first age of her slavery germanicus and corbulo were born expirante liberate and the recompense they received did so little encourage others to follow their example that none have bin found in any degree like to them and those of the most noble familys applied themselves to sleep laziness and luxury that they might not be suspected to be better than their masters thraseas soranus and helvidius were worthy men who resolved to persist in their integrity tho they should die for it but that was the only thing that made them eminent for they were of unknown familys not romans by birth nor ever employed in war and those emperors who did arrive to any degree of virtue were spaniards gauls africans thracians and of all nations except romans the patrician and plebeian familys which for many ages had filled the world with great commanders and such as excelled in all virtues being thus extinguished or corrupted the common people fell into the lowest degree of baseness plebs sordida circo and theatris sueta that people which in c tacit magnanimity surpast all that have bin known in the world who never found any enterprise above their spirit to undertake and power to accomplish with their liberty lost all their vigor and virtue they who by their votes had disposed of kingdoms and provinces fell to desire nothing but to live and see duas tantum res anxius opta pnem and circenses juven sat  plays whether their emperors were good or bad they usually rejoiced at their death in hopes of getting a little money or victuals from the successor tho the empire was by this means grown weak and bloodless yet it could not fall on a sudden so vast a body could not die in a moment all the neighboring nations had bin so much broken by their power that none was able to take advantage of their weakness and life was preserved by the strength of hungry barbarians allured by the greatness of the pay they received to defend those who had no power left to defend themselves this precarious and accidental help could not be durable they who for a while had bin contented with their wages soon began to think it fit for them rather to fight for themselves than for their weak masters and thereupon fell to set up emperors depending on themselves or to seize upon the naked provinces where they found no other difficulty than to contend with other strangers who might have the like design upon the same thus did the armies of the east and west set up emperors at their pleasure and tho the goths vandals huns sueves alans and others had cruel wars among themselves yet they feared and suffered little or nothing from the romans this state of things was so soon observed that in the beginning of tiberius his reign they who endeavored to excite the gauls to take arms used no other arguments than such as were drawn from the extreme weakness of the quam inop italia plebs urbana imbellis nihil in exercitibus validum praeter externum c tacit an l   romans it was evident that after the battles of philippi and actium the strength of the roman armies consisted of strangers and even the victorys that went under their name were gained by those nations which in the time of their liberty they had subdued they had nothing left but riches gathered out of their vast dominions and they learned by their ruin that an empire acquired by virtue could not long be supported by money they who by their valor had arrived at such a height of glory power greatness and happiness that was never equaled and who in all appearance had nothing to fear from any foreign power could never have fallen unless their virtue and discipline had decayed and the corruption of their manners excited em to turn their victorious swords into their own bowels whilst they were in that flourishing condition they thought they had nothing more to desire than continuance but if our authors judgment is to be followed there was nothing of good in it except the shortness of its continuance they were beholden to those who wrought the change they were the better for the battles of pharsalia philippi munda and actium the destruction of two thirds of the people with the slaughter of all the most eminent men among them was for their advantage the proscriptions were wholesome remedys tacitus did not understand the state of his own country when he seems to be annl l   ashamed to write the history of it nobis in arcto and inglorius labor when instead of such glorious things as had bin achieved by the romans whilst either the senate or the common poople prevailed he had nothing left to relate but saeva jussa continuas accusationes fallaces amicitias perniciem innocentium they enjoyed nothing that was good from the expulsion of the tarquins to the reestablishment of divine absolute monarchy in the persons of those pious fathers of the people tiberius caligula claudius nero galba otho vitellius etc there was no virtue in the junii horatii cornelii quintii decii manlii but the generous and tenderhearted princes beforementioned were perfect examples of it whilst annual magistrates governed there was no stability sejanus macro and tigellinus introduced good order virtue was not esteemed by the ancient senate and people messalina agrippina poppaea narcissus pallas vinnius and laco knew how to put a just value upon it the irregularitys of popular assemblys and want of prudence in the senate was repaired by the temperate proceedings of the german pannonian and eastern armies or the modest discretion of the pretorian bands the city was delivered by them from the burden of governing the world and for its own good frequently plundered fired and at last with the rest of desolated italy and the noblest provinces of europe asia and africa brought under the yoke of the most barbarous and cruel nations by the same light we may see that those who endeavored to perpetuate the misery of liberty to rome or lost their lives in the defense of it were the worst or the most foolish of men and that they were the best who did overthrow it this rectifys all our errors and if the highest praises are due to him that did the work the next are well deserved by those who perished in attempting it and if the sons of brutus with their companions the vitellii and aquillii claudius appius the decemvir those that would have betrayed the city to porsenna spurius melius spur cassius manlius capitolinus saturninus catiline cethegus lentulus had bin as fortunate as julius caesar they might as well have deserved an apotheosis but if all this be false absurd bestial and abominable the principles that necessarily lead us to such conclusions are so also which is enough to show that the strength virtue glory wealth power and happiness of rome proceeding from liberty did rise grow and perish with it  sect xiii there is disorder or prejudice in changing the name or number of magistrates whilst the root and principle of their power continues entire in the next place our author would persuade us that the romans were inconstant because of their changes from annual consuls to military tribunes decemviri and dictators and gives the name of sedition to the complaints made against usury or the contests concerning marriages or magistracy but i affirm    that no change of magistracy as to the name number or form dos testify irregularity or bring any manner of prejudice as long as it is done by those who have a right of doing it and he or they who are created continue within the power of the law to accomplish the end of their institution many forms being in themselves equally good and may be used as well one as another according to times and other circumstances    in the second place it is a rare thing for a city at the first to be rightly constituted men can hardly at once foresee all that may happen in many ages and the changes that accompany them ought to be provided for rome in its foundation was subject to these defects and the inconveniences arising from them were by degrees discovered and remedid they did not think of regulating usury till they saw the mischiefs proceeding from the cruelty of usurers or of setting limits to the proportion of land that one man might enjoy till the avarice of a few had so far succeeded that their riches were grown formidable and many by the poverty to which they were reduced became useless to the city it was not time to make a law that the plebeians might marry with the patricians till the distinction had raised the patricians to such pride as to look upon themselves to have something of divine and the others to be inauspicati or profane and brought the city into danger by that division nor to make the plebeians capable of being elected to the chief magistracys till they had men able to perform the dutys of them but these things being observed remedys were seasonably applied without any bloodshed or mischief tho not without noise and wrangling    all human constitutions are subject to corruption and must perish unless timely renewed and reduced to their first principles this was chiefly done by means of those tumults which our author ignorantly blames the whole people by whom the magistracy had bin at first created executed their power in those things which comprehend sovereignty in the highest degree and brought every one to acknowledge it there was nothing that they could not do who first conferred the supreme honors upon the patricians and then made the plebeians equal to them yet their modesty was not less than their power or courage and therefore when by the law they might have made a plebeian consul they did not choose one in forty years and when they did make use of their right in advancing men of their own order they were so prudent that they cannot be said to have bin mistaken in their elections three times whilst their votes were free whereas of all the emperors that came in by usurpation pretense of blood from those who had usurped or that were set up by the soldiers or a few electors hardly three can be named who deserved that honor and most of them were such as seemed to be born for plagues to mankind    he manifests his fraud or ignorance in attributing the legislative power sometimes to the senate and sometimes to the people for the senate never had it the style of senatus censuit populus jussit was never altered but the right of advising continuing in the senate that of enacting ever continued in the people    an occasion of commending absolute power in order to the establishment of hereditary monarchy is absurdly drawn from their custom of creating a dictator in time of danger for no man was ever created but such as seemed able to bear so great a burden which in hereditary governments is wholly left to chance tho his power was great it did arise from the law and being confined to six months twas almost impossible for any man to abuse it or to corrupt so many of those who had enjoyed the same honor or might aspire to it as to bring them for his pleasure to betray their country and as no man was ever chosen who had not given great testimonys of his virtues so no one did ever forseit the good opinion conceived of him virtue was then honored and thought so necessarily to comprehend a sincere love and fidelity to the commonwealth that without it the most eminent qualitys were reputed vile and odious and the memory of former services could no way expiate the guilt of conspiring against it this seeming severity was in truth the greatest clemency for tho our author has the impudence to say that during the roman liberty the best men thrived worst and the worst best he cannot alledg one example of any eminent roman put to death except manlius capitolinus from the expulsion of the tarquins to the time of the gracchi and the civil wars not long after ensuing and of very few who were banished by these means crimes were prevented and the temptations to evil being removed treachery was destroyed in the root and such as might be naturally ambitious were made to see there was no other way to honor and power than by acting virtuously  but lest this should not be sufficient to restrain aspiring men what power soever was granted to any magistrate the sovereignty still remained in the people and all without exception were subject to them this may seem strange to those who think the dictators were absolute because they are said to have bin sine provocatione but that is to be only understood in relation to other magistrates and not to the people as is clearly proved in the case of q fabius whom papirius the dictator  av    would have put to death tribunos plebis appello says fabius maximus his father and provoco ad populum eumque tibi fugienti exercitus tui fugienti senatus judicium judicem sero qui certe unus plusquam tua dictaura potest polletque videro cessurusne sis provocationi cui tullus hostilius cessit and tho the people did rather intercede for fabius than command his deliverance that modesty did evidently proceed from an opinion that papirius was in the right and tho they desired to save fabius who seems to have bin one of the greatest and best men that ever the city produced they would not enervate that military discipline to which they owed not only their greatness but their subsistence most especially when their sovereign authority was acknowledged by all and the dictator himself had submitted this right of appeals to the people was the foundation of the roman commonwealth laid in the days of romulus t live l   submitted to by hostilius in the case of horatius and never violated till the laws and the liberty which they supported were overthrown by the power of the sword this is confirmed by the speech of metellus the tribune who in the time of the second carthaginian war causelessly disliking the proceedings of q fabius maximus then dictator in a public assembly of the people said quod si antiquus animus plebi t live l    romanae esset se audacter laturum de abrogando q fabii imperio nunc modicam rogationem promulgaturum de aequando magistri equitum and dictatoris jure which was done and that action which had no precedent shows that the people needed none and that their power being eminently above that of all magistrates was obliged to no other rule than that of their own will tho i do therefore grant that a power like to the dictatorian limited in time circumscribed by law and kept perpetually under the supreme authority of the people may by virtuous and welldisciplind nations upon some occasions be prudently granted to a virtuous man it can have no relation to our authors monarch whose power is in himself subject to no law perpetually exercised by himself and for his own sake whether he has any of the abilitys required for the due performance of so great a work or be entirely destitute of them nothing being more unreasonable than to deduce consequences from cases which in substance and circumstances are altogether unlike but to the contrary these examples showing that the romans even in the time of such magistrates as seemed to be most absolute did retain and exercise the sovereign power do most evidently prove that the government was ever the same remaining in the people who without prejudice might give the administration to one or more men as best pleased themselves and the success shows that they did it prudently  sect xiv no sedition was hurtful to rome till through their prosperity some men gained a power above the laws little pains is required to confute our author who imputes much bloodshed to the popular government of rome for he cannot prove that one man was unjustly put to death or slain in any sedition before publius gracchus the foundations of the commonwealth were then so shaken that the laws could not be executed and whatsoever did then fall out ought to be attributed to the monarchy for which the great men began to contend whilst they had no other wars than with neighboring nations they had a strict eye upon their commanders and could preserve discipline among the soldiers but when by the excellence of their valor and conduct the greatest powers of the world were subdued and for the better carrying on of foreign wars armies were suffered to continue in the same hands longer than the law did direct soldiery came to be accounted a trade and those who had the worst designs against the commonwealth began to savor all manner of licentiousness and rapine that they might gain the savor of the legions who by that means became unruly and seditious twas hard if not impossible to preserve a civil equality when the spoils of the greatest kingdoms were brought to adorn the houses of private men and they who had the greatest citys and nations to be their dependents and clients were apt to scorn the power of the law this was a most dangerous disease like those to which human bodies are subject when arrived to that which physicians call the athletick habit proceeding from the highest perfection of health activity and strength that the best constitution by diet and exercise can attain whosoever falls into them shows that he had attained that perfection and he who blames that which brings a state into the like condition condemns that which is most perfect among men whilst the romans were in the way to this no sedition did them any hurt they were composed without blood and those that seemed to be the most dangerous produced the best laws but when they were arrived to that condition no order could do them good the fatal period set to human things was come they could go no higher lucan l    summisque negatum stare diu and all that our author blames is not to be imputed to their constitution but their departing from it all men were ever subject to error and it may be said that the mistaken people in the space of about three hundred years did unjustly fine or banish five or six men but those mistakes were so frankly acknowledged and carefully repaired by honors bestowed upon the injured persons as appears by the examples of camillus livius salinator paulus emylius and others that they deserve more praise than if they had not failed  if for the abovementioned time seditions were harmless or profitable they were also absolutely exempted from civil wars those of apulia and greece were revolts of conquered nations and can no way fall under that name but it is most absurdly applied to the servile and gladiatorian wars for the gladiators were slaves also and civil wars can be made only by those who are members of the civil society which slaves are not those that made the bellum sociale were freemen but not citizens and the war they made could not be called civil the romans had three ways of dealing with conquered nations    some were received into the body of the city civitate donati as the latins by romulus the albans by hostilius the privernates when their ambassador declared that no peace could be durable unless it were just and easy and the senate said se viri and liberi vocem audivisse talesque dignos esse ut romani siant and the like favor was shown to many others    by making leagues with them as livy says populum romanum devictos bello populos malle societate and amicitia habere conjunctos quam tristi subjectos servitio of which sort were the samnites who not liking their condition joined with hannibal and afterward under the conduct of the brave telesinus with other nations that lived under the condition of socii made an unprosperous attempt to deliver themselves    those who after many rebellions were in provinciam redacti as the capuans when their city was taken by appius claudius and q flvius flaccus  we osten hear of wars made by those of the two latter sorts but of none that can be called civil till the times of marius sylla and catiline and as they are to be esteemed the last struglings of expiring liberty when the laws by which it had subsisted were enervated so those that happened between caesar and pompey octavius and antonius with the proscriptions triumvirate and all the mischiefs that accompanied them are to be imputed wholly to the monarchy for which they contended as well as those between nero galba otho vitellius and vespasian that hardly ever ceased till the empire was abolished for the name of a commonwealth continued to the end and i know not why tiberius or nero might not use it as well as sylla or marius  yet if our author be resolved to impute to popular government all that passed before caesar made himself perpetual dictator he will find no more than is seen in all places we have known few small states and no great one free from revolts of subjects or allies and the greatest empire of the east was overthrown by the rebellion of the mammalukes their slaves if there is any difference to be observed between what happened at rome it is chiefly that whilst there was any shadow of liberty the slaves gladiators subjects or allies were always beaten and suppressed whereas in the time of the emperors the revolt of a province was sufficient to give a new master to the best part of mankind and he having no more power than was required for a present mischief was for the most part in a short time destroyed by another but to please our author i will acknowledge a second defect even that wantonness to which he ascribes all their disorders tho i must withal desire him to consider from whence wantonness dos proceed if the people of turkey or france did rebel i should think they were driven to it by misery beggary or despair and could lay wantonness only to the charge of those who enjoy much prosperity nations that are oppressed and made miserable may fall into rage but can never grow wanton in the time of the roman emperors the pretorian cohorts or the armies that had the liberty of ravaging the richest provinces might be proud of their strength or grow wanton through the abundance of their enjoyments the janizarys in later ages may for the same reasons have fallen into the like excesses but such as have lost their liberty are in no danger of them when all the nobility of rome was destroyed and those who excelled in reputation or virtue were fallen in the wars or by the proscriptions when two thirds of the people were slain the best citys and colonys burnt the provinces exhausted and the small remains left in them oppressed with a most miserable slavery they may have revolted and sometimes did as the britans batavians and others mentioned in the roman history but they were driven to those revolts by fury and necessity arising from the miserys and indignitys they suffered under an insupportable tyranny and wantonness had no part in them the people of rome when they were a little freed from the terror of the soldiers did sometimes for the same reasons conspire against the emperors and when they could do no more expressed their hatred by breaking their statues but after the battles of pharsalia philippi and the proscriptions they never committed any folly through wantonness in the like manner naples and sicily have revolted within these few years and some who are well acquainted with the state of those kingdoms think them ready again to do the like but if it should so happen no man of understanding would impute it to wantonness the pressures under which they groan have cured em of all such diseases and the romans after the loss of their liberty could never fall into them they may have grown wanton when their authority was reverenced their virtue admired their power irresistible and the riches of the world were flowing in upon them as it were to corrupt their manners by enticing them to pleasure but when all that was lost and they found their persons exposed to all manner of violence from the basest of men their riches exhausted by tributes and rapine whilst the treasures of the empire were not sufficient to supply the luxury of their masters the misery they suffered and the shame of suffering it with the contemptible weakness to which they were reduced did too strongly admonish them that the vices of wantonness belonged only to those who enjoyed a condition far different from theirs and the memory of what they had lost sharpened the sense of what they felt this is the state of things which pleases our author and by praising that government which deprived those who were under it of all that is most desirable in the world and introduced all that ought to be detested he sufficiently shows that he delights only in that which is most abominable and would introduce his admired absolute monarchy only as an instrument of bringing vice misery devastation and infamy upon mankind  sect xv the empire of rome perpetually decayed when it fell into the hands of one man in pursuance of his design our author with as much judgment as truth denies that rome became mistress of the world under the popular government it is not so says he for rome began her empire under kings and did perfect it under emperors it did only increase under that popularity her greatest exaltation was under trajan and longest peace under augustus for the illustration of which i desire these few things may be considered    that the first monarchy of rome was not absolute the kings were made by the people without regard to any mans title or other reason than the common good choosing him that seemed most likely to procure it setting up at the same time a senate consisting of a hundred of the most eminent men among them and after the reception of the sabins into the city adding as many more to them and committing the principal part of the government to their care retaining the power of making those laws to which the kings who reigned by their command were subject and reserving to themselves the judgment of all great matters upon appeal if any of their kings deserved to be called a monarch according to filmers definition it was the last tarquin for he alone of all their  lv l   kings reigned not jussu populi but came in by treachery and murder if he had continued he had cured the people of all vices proceeding from wantonness but his farthest conquest was of the small town of gabii ten miles distant from rome which he effected by the fraud of his detestable son and that being then the utmost limit of the roman empire must deserve to be called the world or the empire of it was not gained by their kings    the extent of conquests is not the only nor the chief thing that ought to be considered in them regard is to be had to the means whereby they are made and the valor or force that was employed by the enemy in these respects not only the overthrow of carthage and the conquests of spain but the victorys gained against the sabins latins tuscans samnites and other valiant nations of italy who most obstinately defended their liberty when the romans had no forces but their own show more virtue and deserve incomparably more praise than the defeats of any nations whatsoever when they were increased in number riches reputation and power and had many other warlike people iustructed in their discipline and fighting under their ensigns but i deny that the romans did ever make any considerable acquisition after the loss of their liberty they had already subdued all italy greece macedon the islands of the mediterranean sea thracia illyrium asia the less pontus armenia syria egypt africa gaul and spain the forces of germany were broken a bridge laid over the rhine and all the countries on this side subdued this was all that was ever gained by the valor of their own forces and that could bring either honor or profit but i know of no conquest made after that time unless the name of conquest be given to caligulas expedition when he said he had subdued the sea in making an useless bridge from puteoli to baiae or that of the other fool who entered rome in triumph for having gathered shells on the seashore trajans expedition into the east was rather a journey than a war he rambled over the provinces that augustus had abandoned as not worth keeping and others that had nothing to defend them but illarmd and unwarlike barbarians upon the whole matter he seems to have bin led only by curiosity and the vanity of looking upon them as conquests appears in their being relinquished as soon as gained britain was easily taken from a naked and unskilful tho a brave people hardly kept and shamefully lost but tho the emperors had made greater wars than the commonwealth vanquished nations of more valor and skill than their italian neighbors the grecians or carthaginians subdued and slaughtered those that in numbers and ferocity had exceeded the cimbri gauls and teutons encountered captains more formidable than pirrhus and hannibal it might indeed increase the glory of him that should have done it but could add nothing of honor or advantage to the roman name the nobility was extirpated long before the people corrupted and enslaved italy lay desolate so as a roman was hardly to be found in a roman army which was generally composed of such as fighting for themselves or their commander never thought of any thing less than the interest of rome and as it is impossible that what is so neglected and betrayed should be durable that empire which was acquired by the valor and conduct of the bravest and best disciplined people of the world decayed and perished in the hands of those absolute monarchs who ought to have preserved it    peace is desirable by a state that is constituted for it who contenting themselves with their own territorys have no desires of enlarging them or perhaps it might simply deserve praise if mankind were so framed that a people intending hurt to none could preserve themselves but the world being so far of another temper that no nation can be safe without valor and strength those governments only deserve to be commended which by discipline and exercise increase both and the roman above all that excelled in both peace therefore may be good in its season and was so in numas reign yet two or three such kings would have encouraged some active neighbors to put an end to that aspiring city before its territory had extended beyond fidenae but the discipline that best agreed with the temper and designs of a warlike people being renewed by his brave successors the dangers were put on their enemies and all of them the last only excepted persisting in the same way did reasonably well perform their duty when they were removed and the affairs of the city depended no longer upon the temper or capacity of one man the ends for which the city was constituted were vigorously pursued and such magistrates annually chosen as would not long continue in a universal peace till they had gotten the empire to which they aspired or were by ill fortune brought to such weakness as to be no longer able to make war both of these happened in the so much magnified reign of augustus he found the empire so great that all additions might rationally be rejected as useless or prejudicial and italy so exhausted that wars could only be carried on by the strength of strangers it was time to lie still when they had no power to act and they might do it safely whilst the reputation gained by former victorys preserved them from foreign invasions when crassus pompey and caesar who had torn the commonwealth into three monarchys were killed and the flower of the roman nobility and people destroyed with them or by them when catos virtue had proved too weak to support a falling state and brutus with cassius had perished in their noble attempt to restore their liberty when the best part of the senate had bin exposed for a prey to the vulturs and wolves of thessaly and one hundred and thirty of those who deserved the hatred of tyrants and had escaped the fury of war had bin destroyed by the proscriptions when neither captains nor soldiers remained in the desolate city when the tyrant abhorred and feared all those who had either reputation or virtue and by the most subtle arts endeavored so to corrupt or break the spirits of the remaining people that they might not think of their former greatness or the ways of recovering it we ought not to wonder that they ceased from war but such a peace is no more to be commended than that which men have in the grave as in the epitaph of the marquess trivultio seen at milan qui nunquam quievit quiescit tace this peace is in every wilderness the turks have established it in the empty provinces of asia and greece where there are no men or if those men have no courage there can be no war our ancestors the britans observed that the peace which in that age the romans established in the provinces consisted in the most c tacit wretched slavery and solitude miserrimam servitutem pacem appellant and in another place solitudinem faciunt pacem vocant this is the peace the spaniards settled in their dominions of the west indies by the destruction of above barth de las casas destruy de las indias forty millions of souls the countries were very quiet when wild beasts only were left to fight in them or a few miserable wretches who had neither strength nor courage to resist their violence this was the peace the romans enjoyed under augustus a few of those who made themselves subservient to his pleasure and ministers of the public calamitys were put into a flourishing condition but the rest pined withered and never recovered if yet our author will have us to think the liberty and people of rome obliged to augustus who procured such a peace for them he ought to remember that besides what they suffered in settling it they paid dear for it even in the future for italy was thereby so weakened as never to recover any strength or virtue to desend it self but depending absolutely upon barbarous nations or armies composed of them was ravaged and torn in pieces by every invader    that peace is only to be valued which is accompanied with justice and those governments only deserve praise who put the power into the hands of the best men this was wholly wanting during the reigns of augustus and his successors the worst of men gained the sovereignty by alliance fraud or violence and advanced such as most resembled themselves augustus was worse in the beginning than in the latter end of his reign but his bloody and impure successor grew every day more wicked as long as he lived whilst he sat upon the rocks at capreae with his chaldeans he meditated nothing but lust or mischief and had sejanus and macro always ready to execute his detestable designs caligula could find none equal to himself in all manner of villanys but savored those most who were likest to him claudius his stupidity drunkenness and subjection to the fury of two impudent strumpets and manumisd slaves proved as hurtful to the empire as the savage fury of his predecessor tho nero was a monster that the world could not bear yet the raging soldiers killed galba and gave the empire to otho for no other reason than that he had bin the companion of his debauches and of all men was thought most to resemble him with them all evils came in like a flood and their successors finding none so bad as themselves but the favorites whores and slaves that governed them would suffer no virtue to grow up and filled the city with a base lewd and miserable rabble that cared for nothing beyond stage plays and bread such a people could not be seditious but rome had bin desolate if they had not thus filled it and tho this temper and condition of a people may please our author yet it was an incurable wound to the state and in consequence to the best part of the world  when the city had bin burnt by the gauls it was soon restored the defeats of ticinum trebia thrasimene and cannae were repaired with equal or greater victorys the war of the allies ended in their overthrow the fury of the gladiators was extinguished with their blood the commonwealth lost battles but was never conquered in any war and in the end triumphed over all that had contended with them whilst liberty continued it was the nurse of virtue and all the losses suffered in foreign or civil wars were easily recovered but when liberty was lost valor and virtue was torn up by the roots and the roman power proceeding from it perished  i have not dwelt so long upon this point to expose the folly of our author but to show that the abovementioned evils did proceed from a permanent cause which will always produce the like effects and historys testify that it has done the same in all places carthage was rebuilt after i had bin destroyed by scipio and continued to be a rich city for almost a thousand years but produced no such men as amilcar asdrubal and hannibal cleomenes and euclidas were the last that deserved to be called spartans athens never had an eminent man after it felt the weight of the macedonian yoke and philopemen was the last of the achaians tho the commonwealths of italy in later ages having too much applied themselves to the acquisition of money wanted that greatness of spirit which had reigned in their ancestors yet they have not bin without valor and virtue that of pisa was famous for power at sea till the genoeses overthrew them florence had a brave nobility and a stout people arezzo pistoia cortona sienna and other small towns of tuscany were not without strength tho for the most part unhappily exercised in the factions of ghibelins and guelphs neri and bianchi that divided all italy but since the introduction of filmers divine absolute monarchy all power virtue reputation and strength are utterly perished from among them and no man dares to oppose the public mischiefs they usually decide private quarrels by assassination or poison and in other respects they enjoy the happiness of that peace which is always found within empty walls and desolated countries and if this be according to the laws of god and nature it cannot be denied that weakness baseness cowardice destruction and desolation are so likewise these are the blessings our wellnaturd author would confer upon us but if they were to be esteemed so i cannot tell why those that felt them complained so much of em tacitus reciting what past in his time and somewhat before for want of a christian spirit in the bitterness of  tacit l   his soul says nec unquam atrocioribus populi romani cladibus magisque justis indiciis probatum est non esse curae deis securitatem nostram esse ultionem some thought that no punishments could be justly deserved by a people that had so much favored virtue others that even the gods they adored envied their felicity and glory but all confessed they were fallen from the highest pitch of human happiness into the lowest degree of infamy and misery and our author being the first that ever found they had gained by the change we are to attribute the discovery of so great a spirit to the excellency of his wisdom if suspending my judgment in this point till it be proved by better authority than his word i in the mean time follow the opinion of those who think slavery dos naturally produce meanness of spirit with its worst effect flattery which tacitus calls foedum servitutis crimen i must believe that the impudence of carrying it to such a height as to commend nothing in the most glorious liberty that made the most virtuous people in the world but the shortness of its continuance and to prefer the tyranny of the basest of men or worst of monsters is peculiar to filmer and that their wickedness which had never bin equaled is surpast by him who recommends as the ordinance of god the principles that certainly produce them  but says our author tho rome was for a while miraculously upheld in glory by a greater prudence than its own yet in a short time after manifold alterations she was ruined by her own hand but it is absurd to say that the overthrow of a government which had nothing of good in it can be a ruin or that the glory in which it continued had nothing of good in it and most of all that it could be ruined by no hands but its own if that glory had not bin gained and immediately or instrumentally supported by such virtue and strength as is worthily to be preferred before all other temporal happiness and dos ever produce it this shows that liars ought to have good memorys but passing over such foolish contradictions i desire to know how that prudence greater than its own which till i am better informed i must think to be inseparably united to justice and goodness came miraculously to support a government which was not only evil in it self as contrary to the laws of god and nature but so perpetually bent against that monarchy which he says is according to them as to hate all monarchs despise all that would live under them destroy as many of them as came within their reach and make a law by which any man was authorized to kill him who should endeavor to set up this divine power among them moreover no human prudence preserved the roman glory but their own the others directly set themselves to oppose it and the most eminent fell under it we know of no prudence surpassing the human unless it be the divine but the divine prudence did never miraculously exert it self except to bear witness to the truth and to give authority to those that announcd it if therefore the glory of this popular government was miraculously supported by a more than human prudence it was good in it self the miracles done in favor of it did testify it and all that our author says against it is false and abominable  if i lay aside the word miraculous as put in by chance twill be hard to know how god who in the usual course of his providence guides all things by such a gentle and undiscerned power that they seem to go on of themselves should give such virtue to this popular government and the magistrates bred up under it that the greatest monarchs of the earth were as dust before them unless there had bin an excellency in their discipline far surpassing that of their enemies or how that can be called ill in its principle and said to comprehend no good which god did so gloriously support and no man was ever able to resist this cannot be better answered than by our authors citation suis and ipsa roma viribus ruit that city which had overthrown the greatest powers of the world must in all appearance have lasted for ever if their virtue and discipline had not decayed or their forces bin turned against themselves if our author therefore say true the greatest good that ever befell the romans was the decay of their virtue and discipline and the turning of their own arms against themselves was not their ruin but their preservation  when they had brought the warlike nations of italy into subjection or association often represt the fury of the gauls cimbri and teutons overthrown the wealth power and wit of carthage supported by the skill industry and valor of hannibal and his brave relations almost extirpated the valiant spaniards who would no other way be subdued defeated philip perses antiochus gentius syphax and jugurtha struck an aw into ptolomy avoided the snares and poisons of mithridates followed him in his flights revenged his treacherys and carried their victorious arms beyond his conquered kingdoms to the banks of tygris when neither the revolt of their italian associats nor the rebellion of their slaves led by spartacus who in skill seems to have bin equal to hannibal and above him in courage could put a stop to their victorys when greece had bin reduced to yield to a virtue rather than a power greater than their own we may well say that government was supported by a more than human prudence which led them through virtue to a height of glory power and happiness that till that day had bin unknown to the world and could never have bin ruined if by the decay of that virtue they had not turned their victorious arms against themselves that city was a giant that could die by no other hand than his own like hercules poisoned and driven into madness after he had destroyed thieves monsters and tyrants and found nothing on the earth able to resist him the wisest of men in ancient times looking upon this as a point of more than human perfection thought or feigned to think that he was descended from the gods and at his death received into their number tho perhaps filmer would prefer a weak base and effeminate slave before him the matter will not be much different if we adhere to the forementioned similitude of the athletick habit for the danger proceeds only from the perfection of it and he who dislikes it must commend that weakness and vice which may perish but can never be changed into any thing worse than it self as those that lie upon the ground can never fall however this fall of the romans which our author speaking truth against his will calls their ruin was into that which he recommends as the ordinance of god which is as much as to say that they were ruined when they fell from their own unnatural inventions to follow the law of god and of nature that luxury also through which they fell was the product of their felicity and that the nations that had bin subdued by them had no other way of avenging their defeats than by alluring their masters to their own vices this was the root of their civil wars when that proud city found no more resistance it grew  saevior armis luxuria incubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem lucan  wanton honest poverty became uneasy when honors were given to illgotten riches this was so monarchical that a people infected with such a custom must needs fall by it they who by vice had exhausted their fortunes could repair them only by bringing their country under a government that would give impunity to rapine and such as had not virtues to deserve advancement from the senate and people would always endeavor to set up a man that would bestow the honors due to virtue upon those who would be most abjectly subservient to his will and interests when mens minds are filled with this fury they sacrifice the common good to the advancement of their private concernments this was the temper of catiline expressed by sallust sallust bell catilin luxuria principi gravis paupertas vix a privato toleranda and this put him upon that desperate extremity to say incendium meum ruina extinguam others in the same manner being filled with the same rage he could not want companions in his most villainous designs it is not long since a person of the highest quality and no less famous for learning and wit having observed the state of england as it stood not many years ago and that to which it has bin reduced since the year sixty as is thought very much by the advice and example of france said that they were now taking a most cruel vengeance upon us for all the overthrows received from our ancestors by introducing their most damnable maxims and teaching us the worst of their vices it is not for me to determine whether this judgment was rightly made or not for i intend not to speak of our affairs but all historians agreeing that the change of the roman government was wrought by such means as i have mentioned and our author acknowledging that change to have bin their ruin as in truth it was i may justly conclude that the overthrow of that government could not have bin a ruin to them but good for them unless it had bin good and that the power which did ruin it and was set up in the room of it cannot have bin according to the laws of god or nature for they confer only that which is good and destroy nothing that is so but must have bin most contrary to that good which was overthrown by it  sect xvi the best governments of the world have bin composed of monarchy aristocracy and democracy our authors cavils concerning i know not what vulgar opinions that democracys were introduced to curb tyranny deserve no answer for our question is whether one form of government be prescribed to us by god and nature or we are left according to our own understanding to constitute such as seem best to our selves as for democracy he may say what pleases him of it and i believe it can suit only with the convenience of a small town accompanied with such circumstances as are seldom sound but this no way obliges men to run into the other extreme in as much as the variety of forms between mere democracy and absolute monarchy is almost infinite and if i should undertake to say there never was a good government in the world that did not consist of the three simple species of monarchy aristocracy and democracy i think i might make it good this at the least is certain that the government of the hebrews instituted by god had a judge the great sanhedrin and general assemblys of the people sparta had two kings a senate of twenty eight chosen men and the like assemblys all the dorian citys had a chief magistrate a senate and occasional assemblys the ionian athens and others had an archon the areopagi and all judgments concerning matters of the greatest importance as well as the election of magistrates were referred to the people rome in the beginning had a king and a senate whilst the election of kings and judgments upon appeals remained in the people afterward consuls representing kings and vested with equal power a more numerous senate and more frequent meetings of the people venice has at this day a duke the senate of the pregadi and the great assembly of the nobility which is the whole city the rest of the inhabitants being only incolae not cives and those of the other citys or countries are their subjects and do not participate of the government genoa is governed in like manner luca not unlike to them germany is at this day governed by an emperor the princes or great lords in their several precincts the citys by their own magistrates and by general diets in which the whole power of the nation resides and where the emperor princes nobility and citys have their places in person or by their deputys all the northern nations which upon the dissolution of the roman empire possessed the best provinces that had composed it were under that form which is usually called the gothic polity they had king lords commons diets assemblys of estates cortez and parliaments in which the sovereign powers of those nations did reside and by which they were exercised the like was practiced in hungary bohemia sweden denmark poland and if things are changed in some of these places within a few years they must give better proofs of having gained by the change than are yet seen in the world before i think my self obliged to change my opinion  some nations not liking the name of king have given such a power as kings enjoyed in other places to one or more magistrates either limited to a certain time or left to be perpetual as best pleased themselves others approving the name made the dignity purely elective some have in their elections principally regarded one family as long as it lasted others considered nothing but the fitness of the person and reserved to themselves a liberty of taking where they pleased some have permitted the crown to be hereditary as to its ordinary course but restrained the power and instituted officers to inspect the proceedings of kings and to take care that the laws were not violated of this sort were the ephori of sparta the maires du palais and afterward the constable of france the justicia in arragon the rijcshofmeister in denmark the high steward in england and in all places such assemblys as are before mentioned under several names who had the power of the whole nation some have continued long and it may be always in the same form others have changed it some being incensed against their kings as the romans exasperated by the villanys of tarquin and the tuscans by the crueltys of mezentius abolished the name of king others as athens sicion argos corinth thebes and the latins did not stay for such extremitys but set up other governments when they thought it best for themselves and by this conduct prevented the evils that usually fall upon nations when their kings degenerate into tyrants and a nation is brought to enter into a war by which all may be lost and nothing can be gained which was not their own before the romans took not this salutary course the mischief was grown up before they perceived or set themselves against it and when the effects of pride avarice cruelty and lust were grown to such a height that they could no longer be endured they could not free themselves without a war and whereas upon other occasions their victorys had brought them increase of strength territory and glory the only reward of their virtue in this was to be delivered from a plague they had unadvisedly suffered to grow up among them i confess this was most of all to be esteemed for if they had bin overthrown their condition under tarquin would have bin more intolerable than if they had fallen under the power of pirrhus or hannibal and all their following prosperity was the fruit of their recovered liberty but it had bin much better to have reformed the state after the death of one of their good kings than to be brought to fight for their lives against that abominable tyrant our author in pursuance of his aversion to all that is good disapproves this and wanting reasons to justify his dislike according to the custom of impostors and cheats has recourse to the ugly terms of a backdoor sedition and faction as if it were not as just for a people to lay aside their kings when they receive nothing but evil and can rationally hope for no benefit by them as for others to set them up in expectation of good from them but if the truth be examined nothing will be found more orderly than the changes of government or of the persons and races of those that governed which have bin made by many nations when pharamonds grandson seemed not to deserve the crown he had worn the french gave it to meroveus who more resembled him in virtue in process of time when this race also degenerated they were rejected and pepin advanced to the throne and the most remote in blood of his descendents having often bin preferred before the nearest and bastards before the legitimate issue they were at last all laid aside and the crown remains to this day in the family of hugh capet upon whom it was bestowed on the rejection of charles of lorrain in like manner the castilians took don sancho sirnamd the brave second son to alphonso the wise before alphonso el desheredado son of the elder brother ferdinand the states of arragon preferred martin brother to john the first before mary his daughter married to the count de foix tho females were not excluded from the succession and the house of austria now enjoys that crown from joan daughter to ferdinand in that and many other kingdoms bastards have bin advanced before their legitimate brothers henry count of trastamara bastard to alphonso xi king of castile received the crown as a reward of the good service he had done to his country against his brother peter the cruel without any regard had to the house of la cerda descended from alphonso el desheredado which to this day never enjoyed any greater honor than that of duke de medina celi not long after the portuguese conceiving a dislike of their king ferdinand and his daughter married to john king of castile rejected her and her uncle by the fathers side and gave the crown to john a knight of calatrava and bastard to an uncle of ferdinand their king about the beginning of this age the swedes deposed their king sigismund for being a papist and made charles his uncle king diverse examples of the like nature in england have bin already mentioned all these transportations of crowns were acts performed by assemblys of the three estates in the several kingdoms and these crowns are to this day enjoyed under titles derived from such as were thus brought in by the deposition or rejection of those who according to descent of blood had better titles than the present possessors the acts therefore were lawful and good or they can have no title at all and they who made em had a just power so to do  if our author can draw any advantage from the resemblance of regality that he finds in the roman consuls and athenian archons i shall without envy leave him the enjoyment of it but i am much mistaken if that dos not prove my assertion that those governments were composed of the three simple species for if the monarchical part was in them it cannot be denied that the aristocratical was in the senate or areopagi and the democratical in the people but he ought to have remembered that if there was something of monarchical in those governments when they are said to have bin popular there was something of aristocratical and democratical in those that were called regal which justifys my proposition on both sides and shows that the denomination was taken from the part that prevailed and if this were not so the governments of france spain and germany might be called democracys and those of rome and athens monarchys because the people have a part in the one and an image of monarchy was preserved in the other  if our author will not allow the cases to be altogether equal i think he will find no other difference than that the consuls and archons were regularly made by the votes of the consenting people and orderly resigned their power when the time was expired for which it was given whereas tarquin dionysius agathocles nabis phalaris caesar and almost all his successors whom he takes for complete monarchs came in by violence fraud and corruption by the help of the worst men by the slaughter of the best and most commonly when the method was once established by that of his predecessor who if our author says true was the father of his country and his also this was the root and foundation of the only government that deserves praise this is that which stamped the divine character upon agathocles dionysius and caesar and that had bestowed the same upon manlius marius or catiline if they had gained the monarchys they affected but i suppose that such as god has blessed with better judgment and a due regard to justice and truth will say that all those who have attained to such greatness as destroys all manner of good in the places where they have set up themselves by the most detestable villanys came in by a backdoor and that such magistrates as were orderly chosen by a willing people were the true shepherds who came in by the gate of the sheepfold and might justly be called the ministers of god so long as they performed their duty in providing for the good of the nations committed to their charge  sect xvii good governments admit of changes in the superstructures whilst the foundations remain unchangeable if i go a step farther and confess the romans made some changes in the outward form of their government i may safely say they did well in it and prosperd by it after the expulsion of the kings the power was chiefly in the nobility who had bin leaders of the people but it was necessary to humble them when they began to presume too much upon the advantages of their birth and the city could never have bin great unless the plebeians who were the body of it and the main strength of their armies had bin admitted to a participation of honors this could not be done at the first they who had bin so vilely oppressed by tarquin and harassed with making or cleansing sinks were not then fit for magistracys or the command of armies but they could not justly be excluded from them when they had men who in courage and conduct were equal to the best of the patricians and it had bin absurd for any man to think it a disparagement to him to marry the daughter of one whom he had obeyed as dictator or consul and perhaps followed in his triumph rome that was constituted for war and sought its grandeur by that means could never have arrived to any considerable height if the people had not bin exercised in arms and their spirits raised to delight in conquests and willing to expose themselves to the greatest fatigues and dangers to accomplish them such men as these were not to be used like slaves or oppressed by the unmerciful hand of usurers they who by their sweat and blood were to defend and enlarge the territorys of the state were to be convinced they fought for themselves and they had reason to demand a magistracy of their own vested with a power that none might offend to maintain their rights and to protect their familys whilst they were abroad in the armies these were the tribuns of the people made as they called it sacrosancti or inviolable and the creation of them was the most considerable change that happened till the time of marius who brought all into disorder the creation or abolition of military tribuns with consular power ought to be accounted as nothing for it imported little whether that authority were exercised by two or by five that of the decemviri was as little to be regarded they were intended only for a year and tho new ones were created for another on pretense the laws they were to frame could not be brought to perfection in so short a time yet they were soon thrown down from the power they usurped and endeavored to retain contrary to law the creation of dictators was no novelty they were made occasionally from the beginning and never otherwise than occasionally till julius caesar subverted all order and invading that supreme magistracy by force jura omnium in se   usurped the right which belonged to all this indeed was a mortal change even in root and principle all other magistrates had bin created by the people for the public good and always were within the power of those that had created them but caesar coming in by force sought only the satisfaction of his own raging ambition or that of the soldiers whom he had corrupted to destroy their country and his successors governing for themselves by the help of the like villains perpetually exposed the empire to be ravaged by them but whatever opinion any man may have of the other changes i dare affirm there are few or no monarchys whose historys are so well known to us as that of rome which have not suffered changes incomparably greater and more mischievous than those of rome whilst it was free the macedonian monarchy fell into pieces immediately after the death of alexander it is thought he perished by poison his wives children and mother were destroyed by his own captains the best of those who had escaped his fury fell by the sword of each other when the famous argyraspides might have expected some reward of their labors and a little rest in old age they were maliciously sent into the east by antigonus to perish by hunger and misery after he had corrupted them to betray eumenes no better fate attended the rest all was in confusion every one followed whom he pleased and all of them seemed to be filled with such a rage that they never ceased from mutual slaughters till they were consumed and their kingdoms continued in perpetual wars against each other till they all fell under the roman power the fortune of rome was the same after it became a monarchy treachery murder and fury reigned in every part there was no law but force he that could corrupt an army thought he had a sufficient title to the empire by this means there were frequently three or four and at one time thirty several pretenders who called themselves emperors of which number he only reigned that had the happiness to destroy all his competitors and he himself continued no longer than till another durst attempt the destruction of him and his posterity in this state they remained till the wasted and bloodless provinces were possessed by a multitude of barbarous nations the kingdoms established by them enjoyed as little peace or justice that of france was frequently divided into as many parts as the kings of meroveus or pepins race had children under the names of the kingdoms of paris orleans soissons arles burgundy austrasia and others these were perpetually vexed by the unnatural fury of brothers or nearest relations whilst the miserable nobility and people were obliged to fight upon their foolish quarrels till all fell under the power of the strongest this mischief was in some measure cured by a law made in the time of hugh capet that the kingdom should no more be divided but the appanages as they call them granted to the kings brothers with the several dukedoms and earldoms erected to please them and other great lords produced frequently almost as bad effects this is testified by the desperate and mortal factions that went under the names of burgundy and orleans armagnac and orleans montmorency and guise these were followed by those of the league and the wars of the hugonots they were no sooner finished by the taking of rochel but new ones began by the intrigues of the duke of orleans brother to lewis the    th and his mother and pursued with that animosity by them that they put themselves under the protection of spain to which may be added that the houses of conde soissons montmorency guise vendosme angouleme bouillon rohan longueville rochefocault epernon and i think i may say every one that is of great eminency in that kingdom with the citys of paris bourdeaux and many others in the space of these last fifty years have sided with the perpetual enemies of their own country  again other great alterations have happened within the same kingdom the races of kings four times wholly changed five kings deposed in less than   0 years after the death of charles the great the offices of maire du palais and constable erected and laid aside the great dukedoms and earldoms little inferior to sovereign principalitys established and suppressed the decision of all causes and the execution of the laws placed absolutely in the hands of the nobility their deputys seneschals or viceseneschals and taken from them again parliaments set up to receive appeals from the other courts and to judge sovereignly in all cases expressly to curb them the power of these parliaments after they had crushed the nobility brought so low that within the last twenty years they are made to register and give the power of laws to edicts of which the titles only are read to them and the general assemblys of estates that from the time of pepin had the power of the nation in their hands are now brought to nothing and almost forgotten  tho i mention these things it is not with a design of blaming them for some of them deserve it not and it ought to be considered that the wisdom of man is imperfect and unable to foresee the effects that may proceed from an infinite variety of accidents which according to emergences necessarily require new constitutions to prevent or cure the mischiefs arising from them or to advance a good that at the first was not thought on and as the noblest work in which the wit of man can be exercised were if it could be done to constitute a government that should last for ever the next to that is to suit laws to present exigences and so much as is in the power of man to foresee and he that should resolve to persist obstinately in the way he first entered upon or to blame those who go out of that in which their fathers had walked when they find it necessary dos as far as in him lies render the worst of errors perpetual changes therefore are unavoidable and the wit of man can go no farther than to institute such as in relation to the forces manners nature religion or interests of a people and their neighbors are suitable and adequate to what is seen or apprehended to be seen and he who would oblige all nations at all times to take the same course would prove as foolish as a physician who should apply the same medicin to all distempers or an architect that would build the same kind of house for all persons without considering their estates dignitys the number of their children or servants the time or climate in which they live and many other circumstances or which is if possible more sottish a general who should obstinately resolve always to make war in the same way and to draw up his army in the same form without examining the nature number and strength of his own and his enemies forces or the advantages and disadvantages of the ground but as there may be some universal rules in physic architecture and military discipline from which men ought never to depart so there are some in politics also which ought always to be observed and wise legislators adhering to them only will be ready to change all others as occasion may require in order to the public good this we may learn from moses who laying the foundation of the law given to the israelites in that justice charity and truth which having its root in god is subject to no change left them the liberty of having judges or no judges kings or no kings or to give the sovereign power to high priests or captains as best pleased themselves and the mischiefs they afterward suffered proceeded not simply from changing but changing for the worse the like judgment may be made of the alterations that have happened in other places they who aim at the public good and wisely institute means proportionable and adequate to the attainment of it deserve praise and those only are to be disliked who either foolishly or maliciously set up a corrupt private interest in one or a few men whosoever therefore would judge of the roman changes may see that expelling the tarquins creating consuls abating the violence of usurers admitting plebeians to marry with the patricians rendering them capable of magistracys deducing colonys dividing lands gained from their enemies erecting tribuns to defend the rights of the commons appointing the decemviri to regulate the law and abrogating their power when they abused it creating dictators and military tribuns with a consular power as occasions required they acted in the face of the sun for the good of the public and such acts having always produced effects suitable to the rectitude of their intentions they consequently deserve praise but when another principle began to govern all things were changed in a very different manner evil designs tending only to the advancement of private interests were carried on in the dark by means as wicked as the end if tarquin when he had a mind to be king poisoned his first wife and his brother contracted an incestuous marriage with his second by the death of her first husband murdered her father and the best men in rome yet caesar did worse he favored catiline and his villainous associats bribed and corrupted magistrates conspired with crassus and pompey continued in the command of an army beyond the time prescribed by law and turned the arms with which he had bin entrusted for the service of the commonwealth to the destruction of it which was rightly represented by his dream that he had constuprated his mother in the like manner when octavius antonius and lepidus divided the empire and then quarreled among themselves and when galba otho vitellius and vespasian set up partys in several provinces all was managed with treachery fraud and cruelty nothing was intended but the advancement of one man and the recompense of the villains that served him and when the empire had suffered infinite calamitys by pulling down or rejecting one and setting up another it was for the most part difficult to determine who was the worst of the two or whether the prevailing side had gained or lost by their victory the question therefore upon which a judgment may be made to the praise or dispraise of the roman government before or after the loss of their liberty ought not to be whether either were subject to changes for neither they nor any thing under the sun was ever exempted from them but whether the changes that happened after the establishment of absolute power in the emperors did not solely proceed from ambition and tend to the public ruin whereas those alterations related by our author concerning consuls dictators decemviri tribunes and laws were far more rare less violent tending to and procuring the public good and therefore deserving praise the like having bin proved by the examples of other kingdoms and might be farther confirmed by many more which on account of brevity i omit is in my opinion sufficient to manifest that whilst the foundation and principle of a government remains good the superstructures may be changed according to occasions without any prejudice to it  sect xviii xenophon in blaming the disorders of democracys favors aristocracys not monarchys in the next place our author introduces xenophon disallowing popular governments cites rome and athens as places where the best men thrived worst and the worst best and condemns the romans for making it capital to pass sentence of death banishment loss of liberty or stripes upon any citizen of rome but lest his fraud in this should be detected he cites no precise passage of any author alleges few examples and those mistaken never tells us what that law was when made or where to be found whereas i hope to prove that he has upon the whole matter abominably prevaricated and advanced things that he knows to be either impertinent or false    to this end we are in the first place to consider whether xenophon speaks of popular governments simply or comparatively if simply it is confessed that a pure democracy can never be good unless for a small town if comparatively we must examine to what he compares it we are sure it was not to absolute monarchy there was no such thing amongst the greeks established by law the little tyrants who had enslaved their own countries as jason phaereus phalaris and the like had no pretense to it and were accounted as the worst of beasts none but such as in all bestiality were like to em did ever speak or think well of them xenophons opinion in this point may be easily found out by what passed between his master plato and the sicilian tyrant and the matter will not be mended by referring to his own experience he had seen the vast monarchy of persia torn in pieces by the fury of two brothers and more than a million of men brought to fight upon their private quarrel instead of that order stability and strength which our author ascribes to absolute monarchy as the effect of wisdom and justice he knew that by filling one man with pride and cruelty it brought unspeakable miserys upon all others and infected em with all the vices that accompany slavery men lived like fishes the great ones devoured the small and as appeared by tissaphernes pharnabazus and others with whom he had to deal the worst and basest were made to be the greatest the satrapes insulted over those of meaner rank with an insolence and cruelty that equaled the depth of their servil submission to their proud master luxury and avarice reigned in all many great nations were made to live for the service of one man and to foment his vices this produced weakness and cowardice no number of those slaves were able to stand against a few free grecians no man knew this better than xenophon who after the death of cyrus the younger and the treacherous murder of clearchus and other officers that commanded the greeks who had served him made his retreat from babylon to the hellespont with ten thousand foot and passed over the bellys of all that dared to oppose him he would never have spent his life in exciting his countrymen to attempt the conquest of asia nor persuaded agesilaus to put himself at the head of the enterprise if he had thought there was such admirable order stability and strength in that monarchy and in the greeks nothing but giddiness of spirit and so much learning as made them seditious nor could he being a wise man and an excellent captain have conceived such a design if he had not by experience found that liberty inspired his countrymen with such solid virtue and produced such stability good order and strength that with small numbers of them he might hope to overthrow the vain pomp of the barbarians and to possess himself of their riches tho they could bring more than a hundred men to fight against one which design being interrupted in his time by domestic wars was soon after his death accomplished by alexander  but that xenophons meaning may be better understood it is good to consider that he spoke of such governments as were then in use among the greeks which tho mixed yet took their denomination from the prevailing part so that the dorians who placed the power chiefly in the hands of a few chosen men were said to be governed aristocratically and the ionians giving more power to the common people democratically and he tho an ionian either through friendship to agesilaus conversation with the spartans or for other reasons best known to himself preferred the government of sparta or some other which he thought he could frame and desired to introduce before that of athens as cimon thucydides and many other excellent men of that city are said to have done and if i acknowledge they were in the right and that athens was more subject to disorder and had less stability than sparta i think it will be of little advantage to absolute monarchy    the athenians did banish some worthy men and put others to death but our author like the devil never speaking truth unless to turn it into a lie prevaricates in his report of them the temporary banishment which they called ostracism was without hurt or dishonor never accounted as a punishment nor intended for any other end than to put a stop to the too eminent greatness of a man that might prove dangerous to the city and some excellent persons who fell under it were soon recalled and brought home with glory but i am not solicitous whether that reason be sufficient to justify it or not we are upon a general thesis relating to the laws of god and nature and if the athenians by a fancy of their own did make an imprudent use of their liberty it cannot prejudice the public cause they who make the worst of it can only say that by such means they for a time deprived themselves of the benefits they might have received from the virtues of some excellent men to the hurt of none but themselves and the application of it as an injustice done to themistocles is absolutely false he was a man of great wit industry and valor but of uncertain faith too much addicted to his plut in vit themist own interest and held a most dangerous correspondence with the persians who then threatened the destruction of greece through envy and spite to aristides and to increase his own power he raised dangerous factions in the city and being summoned to render an account of his proceedings he declined the judgment of his country fled to their enemies and justly deserved the sentence pronounced against him some among them were unjustly put to death and above all socrates but the people who deceived by false witnesses against whom neither the laws of god or man have ever prescribed a sufficient defense had condemned him did so much lament their crime when the truth was discovered to them that i doubt whether a more righteous judgment had given better testimony of their righteous intentions but our authors impudence appears in the highest excess in imputing the death of phocion to the popular state of athens their forces had bin broken in the sicilian war the city taken and the principal men slain by lysander the remains of the most worthy destroyed by the thirty tyrants set up by him their illrecoverd liberty overthrown by the macedonians and the death of phocion compast by polyperchon who with foreign soldiers slaves vagabonds and outlaws overpowered the people  the proceedings of rome may be more completely justified coriolanus was duly condemned he set too great a price upon his own valor and arrogated to himself a power in rome which would hardly have bin endured in corioli his violence and pride overbalancd his services and he that would submit to no law was justly driven out from the society which could subsist only by law quintius was not unlike him and manlius capitolinus far worse than either their virtues were not to be considered when they departed from them consideration ought to be had of human frailty and some indulgence may be extended to those who commit errors after having done important services but a state cannot subsist which compensating evil actions with good gives impunity to the most dangerous crimes in remembrance of any services whatever he that dos well performs his duty and ought always to do so justice and prudence concur in this and it is no less just than profitable that every action be considered by it self and such a reward or punishment allotted to it as in nature and proportion it best deserves  this as i suppose is enough for their cases but relates not to those of mamercus camillus livius salinator and emylius paulus their virtue was complete they were wrongfully sentenced but the best princes senate or people that ever was in the world by the deceit of evil men may and have bin drawn out of the way of justice yet of all the states that are known to us none was ever so free from crimes of malice and wilful injustice none was ever guilty of so few errors as that of rome and none did ever give better testimonys of repentance when they were discovered than the romans did by the veneration they showed to those worthy persons and the honors they conferred upon them afterward  live mamercus was made dictator to repair the unjust mark of infamy laid upon him by the censors camillus being recalled from his banishment often enjoyed the same honor and died the most reverenced man that had ever bin in that city livius salinator was not only made consul after he had bin fined but the people as it were to expiate the guilt of having condemned him suffered that asperity of speech and manners which might have persuaded such as had bin less confident of his virtue and their own that he desired to be revenged tho it were with the ruin of the city they dealt in the like manner with paulus emylius repairing the injury of a fine unduly imposed their generosity in leaving the tribuns in the forum with their accusation against scipio africanus and following him to celebrate an annual sacrifice in the capitol in commemoration of his victory against hannibal was no less admirable than the greatness of his mind who thought his virtue should be so well known that no account ought to be expected from him which was an error proceeding from a noble root but not to be born in a wellgoverned commonwealth the laws that aim at the public good make no distinction of persons and none can be exempted from the penaltys of them otherwise than by approved innocence which cannot appear without a trial he that will not bend his mind to them shakes off the equality of a citizen and usurps a power above the law to which no man submits upon any other condition than that none should be exempted from the power of it and scipio being the first roman that thus disdained the power of the law i do not know whether the prejudice brought upon the city by so dangerous an example did not outweigh all the services he had done nevertheless the people contented with his retirement to his own house and afterward convinced of his innocence would probably if he had not died in a few months have brought him back with the honors that fate reserved for his ashes  i do not at present remember any other eminent men who can be said in any respect to have thrived ill whilst the people and senate of rome acted freely and if this be not sufficient to clear the point i desire to know the names of those worst men that thrived best if they may have bin judged to thrive who were frequently advanced to the supreme magistracys and enjoyed the chief honors i find no men so eminent as brutus publicola quintius cincinnatus and capitolinus the two fabii sirnamd maximi corvinus torquatus camillus and the like and if these were the worst men that rome produced in those ages valor wisdom industry in the service of their country and a most entire love to it must have bin the worst of qualitys and i presume our author may have thought them so since they were invincible obstacles to the introduction of that divine monarchy which appius claudius the decemvir manlius capitolinus spurius cassius sp melius and some others may be thought to have affected  however these instances are not to be understood as they are simply in themselves but comparatively with what has happened in other places under absolute monarchys for our inquiry is not after that which is perfect well knowing that no such thing is found among men but we seek that human constitution which is attended with the least or the most pardonable inconveniences and if we find that in the space of three hundred years while the senate people and legally created magistrates governed rome not one worthy man was put to death not above five or six condemned to fines by the beguiled people and those injurys repaired by the most honorable satisfaction that could be given so that virtue continued ever flourishing the best men that could be found were put into the chief commands and the city was filled with more excellent men than were ever known to be in any other place and on the other side if the emperors so soon as the government was changed made it their business to destroy the best and so far succeeded in their design that they left none and never failed to advance the worst unless it fell out as to queen katherine de medicis who is said never to have done any good but by mistake and some few may have proved better than was intended it will appear that our authors assertions are in the utmost degree false of this we need no better witness than tacitus the civil wars and the proscriptions upon which he touches are justly to be attributed to that monarchy which was then setting up the only question being who should be the monarch when the liberty was already overthrown and if any eminent men escaped it was much against the will of those who had usurped the power he acknowledges his historys to be a continued relation of the slaughter of the most illustrious persons and that in the times of which he writes virtue was attended with certain destruction after the death of germanicus and his eldest children valerius asiaticus seneca corbulo and an infinite number more who were thought most to resemble them found this to be true at the expense of their lives nero in pursuance of the same tyrannical design murdered helvidius and thraseas that he might ipsam exscindere virtutem tacit tear up virtue by the roots domitian spared none willingly that had either virtue or reputation and tho trajan with perhaps some other might grow up under him in the remote provinces yet no good man could escape who came under his eye and was so eminent as to be observed by him whilst these who were thought to be the best men that appeared in the roman empire did thrive in this manner sejanus macro narcissus pallas tigellinus icetus vinnius laco and others like to em had the power of the empire in their hands therefore unless mankind has bin mistaken to this day and that these who have hitherto bin accounted the worst of villains were indeed the best men in the world and that those destroyed by them who are thought to have bin the best were truly the worst it cannot be denied that the best men during the liberty of rome thrived best that good men suffered no indignity unless by some fraud imposed upon the wellmeaning people and that so soon as the liberty was subverted the worst men thrived best the best men were exposed to so many calamitys and snares that it was thought a matter of great wonder to see a virtuous man die in his bed and if the account were well made i think it might appear that every one of the emperors before titus shed more noble and innocent blood than rome and all the commonwealths in the world have done whilst they had the free enjoyment of their own liberty but if any man in favor of our author seeks to diminish the vast disproportion between the two differing sorts of government and imputes the disorders that happened in the time of the gracchi and others whilst rome was struggling for her liberty to the government of a commonwealth he will find them no more to be compared with those that fell out afterward than the railings of a turbulent tribune against the senate to the villanys and crueltys that corrupted and dispeopld the provinces from babylon to scotland and whereas the state never failed to recover from any disorders as long as the root of liberty remained untouched and became more powerful and glorious than ever even after the wars of marius and sylla when that was destroyed the city fell into a languishing condition and grew weaker and weaker till that and the whole empire was ruined by the barbarians    our author to show that his memory is as good as his judgment having represented rome in the times of liberty as a public slaughterhouse soon after blames the clemency of their laws whereas it is impossible that the same city could at the same time be guilty of those contrary extremitys and no less certain that it was perfectly free from them both sallust bell catilin his assertion seems to be grounded upon cesars speech related by sallust in favor of lentulus and cethegus companions of catiline but tho he there endeavored to put the best color he could upon their cause it signified only thus much that a roman citizen could not be put to death without being heard in public which law will displease none that in understanding and integrity may not be compared to filmer and his followers it is a folly to extend it farther for it is easily proved that there was always a power of putting citizens to death and that it was exercised when occasion required the laws were the same in the time of the kings when that office was executed by consuls excepting such changes as are already mentioned the lex perduellionis cited by livy in the case of horatius who had killed his sister continued in force from the foundation to the end of that government the condemnation was to death the words of the sentence these caput obnubito infelici arbore rest suspendito verberato intra pomaerium vel extra pomaerium he was tried by this law upon an appeal made to the people by his father and absolved admiratione magis virtutis quam jure causae which could not have bin if by the law no citizen might be put to death the sons of brutus were condemned to death in public and executed with the aquilii and vitellii their companions in the same conspiracy manlius capitolinus was put to death by the vote of the people titus manlius by the command of his father torquatus for fighting without order two legions were decimated by appius claudius spurius melius refusing to appear before the dictator was killed by servilius ahala general of the horse and pronounced jure caesum quintus fabius was by papirius the dictator condemned to die and could not have bin saved but by the intercession and authority of the people if this be not so i desire to be informed what the senate meant by condemning nero to be put to death more majorum if more majorum no citizen might be put to death why the consuls dictators military tribuns decemviri caused rods and axes to be carried before them as well within as without the city if no use was to be made of em were they only vain badges of a power never to be executed or upon whom was the supreme power signified by them to be exercised within and without the city if the citizens were not subject to it it is strange that a man who had ever read a book of matters relating to the affairs of rome should fancy these things or hope to impose them upon the world if he knew them to be foolish false and absurd but of all the marks of a most supine stupidity that can be given by a man i know none equal to this of our author who in the same clause wherein he says no citizen could be put to death or banished adds that the magistrates were upon pain of death forbidden to do it for if a magistrate might be put to death for banishing a citizen or causing him to be executed a citizen might be put to death for the magistrates were not strangers but citizens if this was not so he must think that no crime was capital but the punishment of capital crimes or that no man was subject to the supreme power but he that was created for the execution of it yet even this will not stop the gap for the law that condemned the magistrate to die could be of no effect if there were no man to execute it and there could be none if the law prohibited it or that he who did it was to die for it and this goes on to infinity for if a magistrate could not put a citizen to death i suppose a citizen could not put to death a magistrate for he also is a citizen so that upon the whole matter we may conclude that malice is blind and that wickedness is madness it is hard to say more in praise of popular governments than will result from what he says against them his reproaches are praises and his praises reproaches as government is instituted for the preservation of the governed the romans were sparing of blood and are wisely commended by livy for it nulli unquam populo mitiores placuere poenae which gentleness will never be blamed unless by those who are pleased with nothing so much as the fury of those monsters who with the ruin of the best part of mankind usurped the dominion of that glorious city but if the romans were gentle in punishing offenses they were also diligent in preventing them the excellence of their discipline led the youth to virtue and the honors they received for recompense confirmed them in it by this means many of em became laws to themselves and they who were not the most excellent were yet taught so much of good that they had a veneration for those they could not equal which not only fervd to incite them to do well according to their talents but kept them in such a w as to fear incurring their ill opinion by any bad action as much as by the penalty of the law this integrity of manners made the laws as it were useless and whilst they seemed to sleep ignorant persons thought there were none but their discipline being corrupted by prosperity those vices came in which made way for the monarchy and wickedness being placed in the throne there was no safety for any but such as would be of the same spirit and the empire was ruined by it  sect xix that corruption and venality which is natural to courts is seldom found in popular governments our authors next work is with that modesty and truth which is natural to him to impute corruption and venality to commonwealths he knows that monarchys are exempted from those evils and has discovered this truth from the integrity observed in the modern courts of england france and spain or the more ancient of rome and persia but after many falsehoods in matter of fact and misrepresentations of that which is true he shows that the corruption venality and violence he blames were neither the effects of liberty nor consistent with it cneius manlius who with his asiatic army brought in the luxury that gave birth to those mischiefs did probably follow the looseness of his own disposition yet the best and wisest men of that time knew from the beginning that it would ruin the city unless a stop might be put to the course of that evil but they who had seen kings under their feet and could no longer content themselves with that equality which is necessary among citizens fomented it as the chief means to advance their ambitious designs tho marius was rigid in his nature and cared neither for money nor sensual pleasures yet he favored those vices in others and is said to be the first that made use of em to his advantage catiline was one of the leudest men in the world and had no other way of compassing his designs than by rendering others as bad as himself and caesar set up his tyranny by spreading that corruption farther than the others had bin able to do and tho he caligula and some others were slain yet the best men found it as impossible to restore liberty to the city when it was corrupted as the worst had done to set up a tyranny whilst the integrity of their manners did continue men have a strange propensity to run into all manner of excesses when plenty of means invite and there is no power to deter of which the succeeding emperors took advantage and knowing that even their subsistence depended upon it they thought themselves obliged by interest as well as inclination to make honors and preferments the rewards of vice and tho it be not always true in the utmost extent that all men follow the example of the king yet it is of great efficacy tho some are so good that they will not be perverted and others so bad that they will not be corrected yet a great number dos always follow the course that is favored and rewarded by those that govern there were idolaters doubtless among the jews in the days of david and hezekiah but they prosperd better under jeroboam and ahab england was not without papists in the time of queen elizabeth but they thrived much better during the reign of her furious sister false witnesses and accusers had a better trade under tiberias who called them custodes legum than under trajan who abhorred them and whores players and fiddlers with other such vermin abounded certainly more when encouraged by nero than when despised by antoninus and marcus aurelius but as every one of these manifested what he was by those he favored or punished and that a man can only be judged by his principles or practices he that would know whether absolute monarchys or mixed governments do most foment or punish venality and corruption ought to examine the principle and practice of both and compare them one with the other  as to the principle the abovementioned vices may be profitable to ptivate men but they can never be so to the government if it be popular or mixed no people was ever the better for that which renders them weak or base and a duly created magistracy governing a nation with their consent can have no interest distinct from that of the public or desire to diminish the strength of the people which is their own and by which they subsist on the other side the absolute monarch who governs for himself and chiefly seeks his own preservation looks upon the strength and bravery of his subjects as the root of his greatest danger and frequently desires to render them weak base corrupt and unfaithful to each other that they may neither dare to attempt the breaking of the yoke he lays upon them nor trust one another in any generous design for the recovery of their liberty so that the same corruption which preserves such a prince if it were introduced by a people would weaken if not utterly destroy them  again all things have their continuance from a principle in nature suitable to their original all tyrannys have had their beginnings from corruption the historys of greece sicily and italy show that all those who made themselves tyrants in several places did it by the help of the worst and the slaughter of the best men could not be made subservient to their lusts whilst they continued in their integrity so as their business was to destroy those who would not be corrupted they must therefore endeavor to maintain or increase the corruption by which they attain their greatness if they fail in this point they must fall as tarquin pisistratus and others have done but if they succeed so far that the vicious part do much prevail the government is secure tho the prince may be in danger and the same thing dos in a great measure accidentally conduce to the safety of his person for they who for the most part are the authors of great revolutions not being so much led by a particular hatred to the man as by a desire to do good to the public seldom set themselves to conspire against the tyrant unless he be altogether detestable and intolerable if they do not hope to overthrow the tyranny  the contrary is seen in all popular and wellmixd governments they are ever established by wise and good men and can never be upheld otherwise than by virtue the worst men always conspiring against them they must fall if the best have not power to preserve them wheresoever therefore a people is so governed the magistrates will obviate afar off the introduction of vices which tend as much to the ruin of their persons and government as to the preservation of the prince and his this is evidenced by experience it is not easy to name a monarch that had so many good qualitys as julius caesar till they were extinguished by his ambition which was inconsistent with them he knew that his strength lay in the corruption of the people and that he could not accomplish his designs without increasing it he did not seek good men but such as would be for him and thought none sufficiently addicted to his interests but such as stuck at the performance of no wickedness that he commanded he was a soldier according to cesars heart who said pectore si fratris gladium juguloque parentis condere me jubeas gravidaeve in viscera partu conjugis invita peragam tamen omnia dextra lucan and lest such as were devoted to him should grow faint in villainy he industriously inflamed their fury  vult omnia caesar a se saeva peti vult praemia martis amari ib having spread this poison amongst the soldiers his next work was by corrupting the tribuns to turn that power to the destruction of the people which had bin erected for their preservation and pouring the treasures he had gained by rapine in gaul into the bosom of curio made him an instrument of mischief who had bin a most eminent supporter of the laws tho he was thought to have affected the glory of sparing cato and with trouble to have found that he despised life when it was to be accounted his gift yet in suspecting brutus and cassius he showed he could not believe that virtuous men who loved their country could be his friends such as carry on the like designs with less valor wit and generosity of spirit will always be more bitterly bent to destroy all that are good knowing that the deformity of their own vices is rendered most manifest when they are compared with the good qualitys of those who are most unlike them and that they can never defend themselves against the scorn and hatred they incur by their vices unless such a number can be infected with the same and made to delight in the recompenses of iniquity that foment them as may be able to keep the rest of the people in subjection  the same thing happens even when the usurpation is not so violent as that of agathocles dionysius or the last king of denmark who in one day by the strength of a mercenary soldiery overthrew all the laws of his country and a lawfully created magistrate is forced to follow the same ways as soon as he begins to affect a power which the laws do not confer upon him i wish i could say there were few of these but experience shows that such a proportion of wisdom moderation of spirit and justice is required in a supreme magistrate to render him content with a limited power as is seldom found man is of an aspiring nature and apt to put too high a value upon himself they who are raised above their brethren tho but a little desire to go farther and if they gain the name of king they think themselves wronged and degraded when they are not suffered to do what they sanctitas pietas sides privata bona sunt qua juvat reges eant senec thyest  please in these things they never want masters and the nearer they come to a power that is not easily restrained by law the more passionately they desire to abolish all that opposes it and when their hearts are filled with this fury they never fail to choose such ministers as will be subservient to their will and this is so well known that those only approach them who resolve to be so their interests as well as their inclinations incite them to diffuse their own manners as far as they can which is no less than to bring those who are under their power to all that wickedness of which the nature of man is capable and no greater testimony can be given of the efficacy of these means toward the utter corruption of nations than the accursed effects we see of em in our own and the neighboring countries  it may be said that some princes are so full of virtue and goodness as not to desire more power than the laws allow and are not obliged to choose ill men because they desire nothing but what the best are willing to do this may be and sometimes is the nation is happy that has such a king but he is hard to find and more than a human power is required to keep him in so good a way the strength of his own affections will ever be against him wives children and servants will always join with those enemies that arise in his own breast to pervert him if he has any weak side any lust unsubdud they will gain the victory he has not searched into the nature of man who thinks that any one can resist when he is thus on all sides assaulted nothing but the wonderful and immediate power of gods spirit can preserve him and to alledg it will be nothing to the purpose unless it can be proved that all princes are blessed with such an assistance or that god has promised it to them and their successors for ever by what means soever they came to the crowns they enjoy  nothing is farther from my intention than to speak irreverently of kings and i presume no wise man will think i do so if i profess that having observed as well as i can what history and daily experience teach us concerning the virtues and religions that are or have bin from the beginning of the world encouraged and supported by monarchs the methods they have followed since they have gone under the name of christians their moral as well as theological graces together with what the scriptures tell us of those who in the last days will principally support the throne of antichrist i cannot be confident that they are generally in an extraordinary manner preserved by the hand of god from the vices and frailtys to which the rest of mankind is subject if no man can show that i am in this mistaken i may conclude that as they are more than any other men in the world exposed to temptations and snares they are more than any in danger of being corrupted and made instruments of corrupting others if they are no otherwise defended than the rest of men  this being the state of the matter on both sides we may easily collect that all governments are subject to corruption and decay but with this difference that absolute monarchy is by principle led unto or rooted in it whereas mixed or popular governments are only in a possibility of falling into it as the first cannot subsist unless the prevailing part of the people be corrupted the other must certainly perish unless preserved in a great measure free from vices and i doubt whether any better reason can be given why there have bin and are more monarchys than popular governments in the world than that nations are more easily drawn into corruption than defended from it and i think that monarchy can be said to be natural in no other sense than that our depraved nature is most inclined to that which is worst  to avoid unnecessary disputes i give the name of popular governments to those of rome athens sparta and the like tho improperly unless the same may also be given to many that are usually called monarchys since there is nothing of violence in either the power is conferred upon the chief magistrates of both by the free consent of a willing people and such a part as they think fit is still retained and executed in their own assemblys and in this sense it is that our author seems to speak against them as to popular government in the strictest sense that is pure democracy where the people in themselves and by themselves perform all that belong to government i know of no such thing and if it be in the world have nothing to say for it in asserting the liberty generally as i suppose granted by god to all mankind i neither deny that so many as think fit to enter into a society may give so much of their power as they please to one or more men for a time or perpetually to them and their heirs according to such rules as they prescribe nor approve the disorders that must arise if they keep it entirely in their own hands and looking upon the several governments which under different forms and names have bin regularly constituted by nations as so many undeniable testimonys that they thought it good for themselves and their posterity so to do i infer that as there is no man who would not rather choose to be governed by such as are just industrious valiant and wise than by those that are wicked slothful cowardly and foolish and to live in society with such as are qualified like those of the first sort rather than with those who will be ever ready to commit all manner of villanys or want experience strength or courage to join in repelling the injurys offered by others so there are none who do not according to the measure of their understanding endeavor to set up those who seem to be best qualified and to prevent the introduction of those vices which render the faith of the magistrate suspected or make him unable to perform his duty in providing for the execution of justice and the public defense of the state against foreign or domestic enemies for as no man who is not absolutely mad will commit the care of a flock to a villain that has neither skill diligence nor courage to defend them or perhaps is maliciously set to destroy them rather than to a stout faithful and wise shepherd it is less to be imagined that any would commit the same error in relation to that society which comprehends himself with his children friends and all that is dear to him  the same considerations are of equal force in relation to the body of every nation for since the magistrate tho the most perfect in his kind cannot perform his duty if the people be so base vicious effeminate and cowardly as not to second his good intentions those who expect good from him cannot desire so to corrupt their companions that are to help him as to render it impossible for him to accomplish it tho i believe there have bin in all ages bad men in every nation yet i doubt whether there was one in rome except a catiline or a caesar who designed to make themselves tyrants that would not rather have wished the whole people as brave and virtuous as in the time of the carthaginian wars than vile and base as in the days of nero and domitian but it is madness to think that the whole body would not rather wish to be as it was when virtue flourished and nothing upon earth was able to resist their power than weak miserable base slavish and trampled under foot by any that would invade them and forced as a chattel to become a prey to those that were strongest which is sufficient to show that a people acting according to the liberty of their own will never advance unworthy men unless it be by mistake nor willingly suffer the introduction of vices whereas the absolute monarch always prefers the worst of those who are addicted to him and cannot subsist unless the prevailing part of the people be base and vicious  if it be said that those governments in which the democratical part governs most do more frequently err in the choice of men or the means of preserving that purity of manners which is required for the wellbeing of a people than those wherein aristocracy prevails i confess it and that in rome and athens the best and wisest men did for the most part incline to aristocracy xenophon plato aristotle thucydides livy tacitus cicero and others were of this sort but if our author there seek patrons for his absolute monarchy he will find none but phalaris agathocles dionysius catiline cethegus lentulus with the corrupted crew of mercenary rascals who did or endeavored to set em up these are they quibus ex honesto nulla est spes they abhor the dominion of the law because it curbs their vices and make themselves subservient to the lusts of a man who may nourish them similitude of interests manners and designs is a link of union between them both are enemies to popular and mixed government and those governments are enemies to them and by preserving virtue and integrity oppose both knowing that if they do not they and their governments must certainly perish  sect xx mans natural love to liberty is tempered by reason which originally is his nature that our authors book may appear to be a heap of incongruitys and contradictions it is not amiss to add to what has already bin observed that having asserted absolute monarchy to be the only natural government he now says that the nature of all people is to desire liberty without restraint but if monarchy be that power which above all restrains liberty and subjects all to the will of one this is as much as to say that all people naturally desire that which is against nature and by a wonderful excess of extravagance and folly to assert contrary propositions that on both sides are equally absurd and false for as we have already proved that no government is imposed upon men by god or nature it is no less evident that man being a rational creature nothing can be universally natural to him that is not rational but this liberty without restraint being inconsistent with any government and the good which man naturally desires for himself children and friends we find no place in the world where the inhabitants do not enter into some kind of society or government to restrain it and to say that all men desire liberty without restraint and yet that all do restrain it is ridiculous the truth is man is hereunto led by reason which is his nature every one sees they cannot well live asunder nor many together without some rule to which all must submit this submission is a restraint of liberty but could be of no effect as to the good intended unless it were general nor general unless it were natural when all are born to the same freedom some will not resign that which is their own unless others do the like this general consent of all to resign such a part of their liberty as seems to be for the good of all is the voice of nature and the act of men according to natural reason seeking their own good and if all go not in the same way according to the same form it is an evident testimony that no one is directed by nature but as a few or many may join together and frame smaller or greater societys so those societys may institute such an order or form of government as best pleases themselves and if the ends of government are obtained they all equally follow the voice of nature in constituting them  again if man were by nature so tenacious of his liberty without restraint he must be rationally so the creation of absolute monarchys which entirely extinguishes it must necessarily be most contrary to it tho the people were willing for they thereby abjure their own nature the usurpation of them can be no less than the most abominable and outrageous violation of the laws of nature that can be imagined the laws of god must be in the like measure broken and of all governments democracy in which every mans liberty is least restrained because every man has an equal part would certainly prove to be the most just rational and natural whereas our author represents it as a perpetual spring of disorder confusion and vice this consequence would be unavoidable if he said true but it being my fate often to differ from him i hope to be excused if i do so in this also and affirm that nothing but the plain and certain dictates of reason can be generally applicable to all men as the law of their nature and they who according to the best of their understanding provide for the good of themselves and their posterity do all equally observe it he that inquires more exactly into the matter may find that reason enjoins every man not to arrogate to himself more than he allows to others nor to retain that liberty which will prove hurtful to him or to expect that others will suffer themselves to be restrained whilst he to their prejudice remains in the exercise of that freedom which nature allows he who would be exempted from this common rule must show for what reason he should be raised above his brethren and if he dos it not he is an enemy to them this is not popularity but tyranny and tyrants are said exuisse hominem to throw off the nature of men because they do unjustly and unreasonably assume to themselves that which agrees not with the frailty of human nature and set up an interest in themselves contrary to that of their equals which they ought to defend as their own such as favor them are like to them and we know of no tyranny that was not set up by the worst nor of any that have bin destroyed unless by the best of men the several tyrannys of syracuse were introduced by agathocles dionysius hieronymus hippocrates epicides and others by the help of lend dissolute mercenary villains and overthrown by timoleon dion theodorus and others whose virtues will be remembered in all ages these and others like to them never sought liberty without restraint but such as was restrained by laws tending to the public good that all might concur in promoting it and the unruly desires of those who affected power and honors which they did not deserve might be represt  the like was seen in rome when brutus valerius and other virtuous citizens had thrown out the lewd tarquins they trusted to their own innocence and reputation and thinking them safe under the protection of the law contented themselves with such honors as their countrymen thought they deserved this would not satisfy the dissolute crew that used to be sodales adolescentium tarquiniorum assueti more regio vivere eam tum aequato jure omnium licentiam quaerentes libertatem aliorum in suam vertisse servitutem conquerebantur regem hominem esse a quo impetres ubi jus ubi injuria opus sit esse gratiae locum esse beneiio and irai and ignoscere posse leges rem surdam esse and inexorabilem salubriorem inopi quam potenti nihil laxamenti nec veniae habere si modum excesseris periculosum esse in tot humanis erroribus sola innocentia vivere t live l   companions to the tarquins i cannot say that either of these sought a liberty without restraint for the virtuous were willing to be restrained by the law and the vicious to submit to the will of a man to gain impunity in offending but if our author says true the licentious fury of these lewd young men who endeavored to subvert the constitution of their country to procure the impunity of their own crimes would have bin more natural that is more reasonable than the ordinary proceedings of the most virtuous who desired that the law might be the rule of their actions which is most absurd  the like vicious wretches have in all times endeavored to put the power into the hands of one man who might protect em in their villanys and advance em to exorbitant riches or undeserved honors whilst the best men trusting in their innocence and desiring no other riches or preferments than what by their equals they were thought to deserve were contented with a due liberty under the protection of a just law and i must transcribe the historys of the world or at least so much of them as concerns the tyrannys that have bin set up or cast down if i should here insert all the proofs that might be given of it but i shall come nearer to the point which is not to compare democracy with monarchy but a regular mixed government with such an absolute monarchy as leaves all to the will of that man woman or child who happens to be born in the reigning family how ill soever they may be qualified i desire those who are lovers of truth to consider whether the wisest best and bravest of men are not naturally led to be pleased with a government that protects them from receiving wrong when they have not the least inclination to do any whether they who desire no unjust advantage above their brethren will not always desire that a people or senate constituted as that of rome from the expulsion of tarquin to the setting up of caesar should rather judge of their merit than tarquin caesar or his successors or whether the lewd or corrupted pretorian bands with macro sejanus tigellinus and the like commanding them will not ever like brutus his sons abhor the inexorable power of the laws with the necessity of living only by their innocence and favor the interest of princes like to those that advanced them if this be not sufficient they may be pleased a little to reflect upon the affairs of our own country and seriously consider whether h  de cl  f  d flm th arlngn and d  nby could have pretended to the chief places if the disposal of them had bin in a free and wellregulated parliament whether they did most resemble brutus publicola and the rest of the valerii the fabii quintii cornelii etc or narcissus pallas icetus laco vinnius and the like whether all men good and bad do not favor that state of things which favors them and such as they are whether clvld prtsmth and others of the same trade have attained to the riches and honors they enjoy by services done to the commonwealth and what places chiffinch f  x and jenkins could probably have attained if our affairs had bin regulated as good men desire whether the old arts of begging stealing and bawding or the new ones of informing and trepanning thrive best under one man who may be weak or vicious and is always subject to be circumvented by flatterers or under the severe scrutinys of a senate or people in a word whether they who live by such arts and know no other do not always endeavor to advance the government under which they enjoy or may hope to obtain the highest honors and abhor that in which they are exposed to all manner of scorn and punishment which being determined it will easily appear why the worst men have ever bin for absolute monarchy and the best against it and which of the two in so doing can be said to desire an unrestrained liberty of doing that which is evil  sect xxi mixed and popular governments preserve peace and manage wars better than absolute monarchys being no way concerned in the defense of democracy and having proved that xenophon thucydides and others of the ancients in speaking against the overgreat power of the common people intended to add reputation to the aristocratical party to which they were addicted and not to set up absolute monarchy which never fell under discourse among them but as an object of scorn and hatred evil in it self and only to be endured by base and barbarous people i may leave our knight like don quixote fighting against the phantasms of his own brain and saying what he pleases against such governments as never were unless in such a place as san marino near sinigaglia in italy where a hundred clowns govern a barbarous rock that no man invades and relates nothing to our question if his doctrine be true the monarchy he extols is not only to be preferred before unruly democracy and mixed governments but is the only one that without a gross violation of the laws of god and nature can be established over any nation but having as i hope sufficiently proved that god did neither institute nor appoint any such to be instituted nor approve those that were that nature dos not incline us to it and that the best as well as the wisest men have always abhorred it that it has bin agreeable only to the most stupid and base nations and if others have submitted to it they have done so only as to the greatest of evils brought upon them by violence corruption or fraud i may now proceed to show that the progress of it has bin in all respects suitable to its beginning  to this end twill not be amiss to examine our authors words thus says he do they paint to the life this beast with many heads let me give the cipher of their form of government as it is begot by sedition so it is nourished by crimes it can never stand without wars either with an enemy abroad or with friends at home and in order to this i will not criticize upon the terms tho the cipher of a form and war with friends may be justly called nonsense but coming to his assertions that popular or mixed governments have their birth in sedition and are ever afterterwards vexed with civil or foreign wars i take liberty to say that whereas there is no form appointed by god or nature those governments only can be called just which are established by the consent of nations these nations may at the first set up popular or mixed governments and without the guilt of sedition introduce them afterward if that which was first established prove unprofitable or hurtful to them and those that have done so have enjoyed more justice in times of peace and managed wars when occasion required with more virtue and better success than any absolute monarchys have done and whereas he says that in popular governments each man has a care of his particular and thinks basely of the common good they look upon approaching mischiefs as they do upon thunder only every man wishes it may not touch his own person i say that men can no otherwise be engaged to take care of the public than by having such a part in it as absolute monarchy dos not allow for under it they can neither obtain the good for themselves posterity and friends that they desire nor prevent the mischiefs they fear which are the principal arguments that persuade men to expose themselves to labors or dangers it is a folly to say that the vigilance and wisdom of the monarch supplies the defect of care in others for we know that no men under the sun were ever more void of both and all manner of virtue required to such a work than very many monarchs have bin and which is yet worse the strength and happiness of the people being frequently dangerous to them they have not so much as the will to promote it nay sometimes set themselves to destroy it ancient monarchys afford us frequent examples of this kind and if we consider those of france and turkey which seem most to flourish in our age the people will appear to be so miserable under both that they cannot fear any change of governor or government and all except a few ministers are kept so far from the knowledge of or power in the management of affairs that if any of them should fancy a possibility of something that might befall them worse than what they suffer or hope for that which might alleviate their misery they could do nothing toward the advancement of the one or prevention of the other tacitus observes that in his time no man was able to write what past inscitia reipublicae ut alienae they tacit an l   neglected the public affairs in which they had no part in the same age it was said that the people who whilst they fought for their own interests had bin invincible being enslaved were grown sordid idle base running after stage plays and shows so as the whole strength of the roman armies consisted of strangers when their spirits were deprest by servitude they had neither courage to defend themselves nor will to fight for their wicked masters and least of all to increase their power which was destructive to themselves the same thing is found in all places tho the turk commands many vast provinces that naturally produce as good soldiers as any yet his greatest strength is in children that do not know their fathers who not being very many in number may perish in one battle and the empire by that means be lost the miserable nations that groan under that tyranny having neither courage power nor will to defend it this was the fate of the mamalukes they had for the space of almost two hundred years domineered in egypt and a great part of asia but the people under them being weak and disaffected they could never recover the defeat they received from selim near tripoli who pursuing his victory in a few months utterly abolished their kingdom  notwithstanding the present pride of france the numbers and warlike inclinations of that people the bravery of the nobility extent of dominion convenience of situation and the vast revenues of their king his greatest advantages have bin gained by the mistaken counsels of england the valor of our soldiers unhappily sent to serve him and the strangers of whom the strength of his armies consists which is so unsteddy a support that many who are well versed in affairs of this nature incline to think he subsists rather by little arts and corrupting ministers in foreign courts than by the power of his own armies and that some reformation in the counsels of his neighbors might prove sufficient to overthrow that greatness which is grown formidable to europe the same misery to which he has reduced his people rendering them as unable to defend him upon any change of fortune as to defend their own rights against him  this proceeds not from any particular defect in the french government but that which is common to all absolute monarchys and no state can be said to stand upon a steady foundation except those whose strength is in their own soldiery and the body of their own people such as serve for wages often betray their masters in distress and always want the courage and industry which is found in those who fight for their own interests and are to have a part in the victory the business of mercenarys is so to perform their duty as to keep their employments and to draw profit from them but that is not enough to support the spirits of men in extreme dangers the shepherd who is a hireling flies when the thief comes and this adventitious help failing all that a prince can reasonably expect from a disaffected and oppressed people is that they should bear the yoke patiently in the time of his prosperity but upon the change of his fortune they leave him to shift for himself or join with his enemies to avenge the injurys they had received thus did alphonso and ferdinand kings of naples and lodovico sforza duke of milan fall in the times of charles the eighth and louis the twelfth kings of france the two first had bin false violent and cruel nothing within their kingdom could oppose their fury but when they were invaded by a foreign power they lost all as guicciardin says without breaking one lance and sforza was by his own mercenary soldiers delivered into the hands of his enemies  i think it may be hard to find examples of such as proceeding in the same way have had better success but if it should so fall out that a people living under an absolute monarchy should through custom or fear of something worse if that can be not only suffer patiently but desire to uphold the government neither the nobility nor commonalty can do any thing toward it they are strangers to all public concernments all things are governed by one or a sew men and others know nothing either of action or counsel filmer will tell us it is no matter the profound wisdom of the prince provides for all but what if this prince be a child a fool a superannuated dotard or a madman or if he dos not fall under any of these extremitys and possesses such a proportion of wit industry and courage as is ordinarily seen in men how shall he supply the office that indeed requires profound wisdom and an equal measure of experience and valor it is to no purpose to say a good council may supply his defects for it dos not appear how he should come by this council nor who should oblige him to follow their advice if he be left to his own will to do what he pleases tho good advice be given to him yet his judgment being perverted he will always incline to the worst if a necessity be imposed upon him of acting according to the advice of his council he is not that absolute monarch of whom we speak nor the government monarchical but aristocratical these are imperfect figleave coverings of nakedness it was in vain to give good counsel to sardanapalus and none could defend the assyrian empire when he lay wallowing amongst his whores without any other thought than of his lusts none could preserve rome when domitians chief business was to kill flies and that of honorius to take care of his hens the monarchy of france must have perished under the base kings they call les roys faineants if the scepter had not bin wrested out of their unworthy hands the world is full of examples in this kind and when it pleases god to bestow a just wise and valiant king as a blessing upon a nation it is only a momentary help his virtues end with him and there being neither any divine promise nor human reason moving us to believe that they shall always be renewed and continued in his successors men cannot rely upon it and to alledg a possibility of such a thing is nothing to the purpose  on the other side in a popular or mixed government every man is concerned every one has a part according to his quality or merit all changes are prejudicial to all whatsoever any man conceives to be for the public good he may propose it in the magistracy or to the magistrate the body of the people is the public defense and every man is armed and disciplined the advantages of good success are communicated to all and every one bears a part in the losses this makes men generous and industrious and fills their hearts with love to their country amor patriae laudisque immensa cupido virg this and the desire of that praise which is the reward of virtue raised the romans above the rest of mankind and wheresoever the same ways are taken they will in a great measure have the same effects by this means they had as many soldiers to fight for their country as there were freemen in it whilst they had to deal with the free nations of italy greece africa or spain they never conquered a country till the inhabitants were exhausted but when they came to fight against kings the success of a battle was enough to bring a kingdom under their power antiochus upon a ruffle received from acilius at thermopylae left all that he possessed in greece and being defeated by scipio nasica he quitted all the kingdoms and territorys of asia on this side taurus paulus emilius became master of macedon by one prosperous fight against perses syphax gentius tigranes ptolomy and others were more easily subdued the mercenary armies on which they relied being broken the citys and countries not caring for their masters submitted to those who had more virtue and better fortune if the roman power had not bin built upon a more sure foundation they could not have subsisted notwithstanding their valor they were often beaten but their losses were immediately repaired by the excellence of their discipline when hannibal had gained the battles of trebia ticinum thrasimene and cannae defeated the romans in many other encounters and slain above two hundred thousand of their men with paulus emilius c servilius sempronius gracchus quintius marcellus and many other excellent commanders when about the same time the two brave scipios had bin cut off with their armies in spain and many great losses had bin sustained in sicily and by sea one would have thought it impossible for the city to have resisted but their virtue love to their country and good government was a strength that increased under all their calamitys and in the end overcame all the nearer hannibal came to the walls the more obstinate was their resistance tho he had killed more great captains than any kingdom ever had others daily stepped up in their place who excelled them in all manner of virtue i know not if at any time that conquering city could glory in a greater number of men fit for the highest enterprises than at the end of that cruel war which had consumed so many of them but i think that the finishing victorys by them obtained are but ill proofs of our authors assertion that they thought basely of the common good and sought only to save themselves we know of none except cecilius metellus who after the battle of cannae had so base a thought as to design the withdrawing himself from the public ruin but scipio afterward sirnamd africanus threatening death to those who would not swear never to abandon their country forced him to leave it this may in general be imputed to good government and discipline with which all were so seasoned from their infancy that no affection was so rooted in them as an ardent love to their country and a resolution to die for it or with it but the means by which they accomplished their great ends so as after their defeats to have such men as carried on their noblest designs with more glory than ever was their annual elections of magistrates many being thereby advanced to the supreme commands and every one by the honors he enjoyed filled with a desire of rendering himself worthy of them  i should not much insist upon these things if they had bin seen only in rome but tho their discipline seems to have bin more perfect better observed and to have produced a virtue that surpast all others the like has bin found tho perhaps not in the same degree in all nations that have enjoyed their liberty and were admitted to such a part of the government as might give them a love to it this was evident in all the nations of italy the sabins volsci aequi tuscans samnites and others were never conquered till they had no men left the samnites alone inhabiting a small and barren province suffered more defeats before they were subdued than all the kingdoms of numidia egypt macedon and asia and as it is expressed in their embassy to hannibal never yielded till they who had brought vast numbers of men into the field and by them defeated some of the roman armies were reduced to such weakness that they could not resist one legion we hear of sew spartans who did not willingly expose their lives for the service of their country and the women themselves were so far inflamed with the same affection that they refused to mourn for their children and husbands who died in the defense of it when the brave brasidas was slain some eminent men went to comfort his mother upon the news of his death and telling her he was the most valiant man in the city she thucyd de bell pelopon answered that he was indeed a valiant man and died as he ought to do but that through the goodness of the gods many others were left as valiant as he  when xerxes invaded greece there was not a citizen of athens able to bear arms who did not leave his wife and children to shift for themselves in the neighboring citys and their houses to be burnt when they embarked with themistocles and never thought of either till they had defeated the barbarians at salamis by sea and at platea by land when men are thus spirited some will ever prove excellent and as none did ever surpass those who are bred under this discipline in all moral military and civil virtues those very countries where they flourished most have not produced any eminent men since they lost that liberty which was the mother and nurse of them  tho i should fill a volume with examples of this kind as i might easily do such as our author will say that in popular governments men look upon mischiefs as thunder and only wish it may not touch themselves but leaving them to the scorn and hatred they deserve by their impudence and folly i conclude this point with the answer that trajano ragion    boccalini puts into the mouth of apollo to the princes who complained that their subjects had not that love to their countries as had bin and was daily seen in those who lived under commonwealths which amounted to no more than to tell them that their ill government was the cause of that defect and that the prejudices incurred by rapine violence and fraud were to be repaired only by liberality justice and such a care of their subjects that they might live happily under them  sect xxii commonwealths seek peace or war according to the variety of their constitutions if i have hitherto spoken in general of popular or mixed governments as if they were all founded on the same principle it was only because our author without distinction has generally blamed them all and generally imputed to every one those faults which perhaps never were many but most certainly are directly opposite to the temper and constitution of many among them malice and ignorance reign so equally in him that it is not easy to determine from which of the two this false representation proceeds but lest any man should thereby be imposed upon it is time to observe that the constitutions of commonwealths have bin so various according to the different temper of nations and times that if some of them seem to have bin principally constituted for war others have as much delighted in peace and many having taken the middle and as some think the best way have so moderated their love to peace as not to suffer the spirits of the people to fall but kept them in a perpetual readiness to make war when there was occasion and every one of those having followed several ways and ends deserve our particular consideration  the citys of rome sparta thebes and all the associations of the etolians achaians sabins latins samnites and many others that anciently flourished in greece and italy seem to have intended nothing but the just preservation of liberty at home and making war abroad all the nations of spain germany and gaul sought the same things their principal work was to render their people valiant obedient to their commanders lovers of their country and always ready to fight for it and for this reason when the senators of rome had killed romulus they persuaded julius proculus to affirm that he had seen him in a most glorious form ascending to heaven and promising great things to the city proinde rem militarem colant the athenians were not less inclined to war but applied themselves to trade as subservient to that end by increasing the number of the people and furnishing them with the means of carrying it on with more vigor and power the phenician citys of which carthage was the most eminent followed the same method but knowing that riches do not defend themselves or scorning slothfully to enjoy what was gained by commerce they so far applied themselves to war that they grew to a power which rome only was able to overthrow venice florence genoa lucca and some other citys of italy seem chiefly to have aimed at trade and placing the hopes of their safety in the protection of more powerful states have unwillingly entered into wars especially by land and when they did they made them by mercenary soldiers  again some of those that intended war desired to enlarge their territorys by conquest others only to preserve their own and to live with freedom and safety upon them rome was of the first sort and knowing that such ends cannot be accomplished without great numbers of men they freely admitted strangers into the city senate and magistracy numa was a sabin tarquinius priscus was the son of a grecian one hundred of those sabins who came with tatius were admitted into the senate appius claudius of the same people came to rome was made a member of the senate and created consul they demolished several citys and brought the inhabitants to their own gave the right of citizens to many others sometimes to whole citys and provinces and cared not how many they received so they could engraft them upon the same interest with the old stock and season them with the same principles discipline and manners on the other side the spartans desiring only to continue free virtuous and safe in the enjoyment of their own territory and thinking themselves strong enough to defend it framed a most severe discipline to which few strangers would submit they banished all those curious arts that are useful to trade prohibited the importation of gold and silver appointed the helotes to cultivate their lands and to exercise such trades as are necessary to life admitted few strangers to live amongst them made none of them free of their city and educated their youth in such exercises only as prepared them for war i will not take upon me to judge whether this proceeded from such a moderation of spirit as placed felicity rather in the fullness and stability of liberty integrity virtue and the enjoyment of their own than in riches power and dominion over others nor which of these two different methods deserves most to be commended but certain it is that both succeeded according to the intention of the founders  rome conquered the best part of the world and never wanted men to defend what was gained sparta lived in such happiness and reputation that till it was invaded by epimanondas an enemies trumpet had not bin heard by those within the town for the space of eight hundred years and never suffered any great disaster till receding from their own institutions they were brought by prosperity to affect the principality of greece and to undertake such wars as could not be carried on without money and greater numbers of men than a small city was able to furnish by which means they were obliged to beg assistance from the barbarians whom they scorned and hated as appears by the storys of callicratidas lysander and agesilaus and fell into such straits as were never recovered  the like variety has bin observed in the constitutions of those northern nations that invaded the roman empire for tho all of them intended war and looked upon those only to be members of their commonwealths who used arms to defend them yet some did immediately incorporate themselves with those of the conquered countries of this number were the franks who presently became one nation with the gauls others kept themselves in a distinct body as the saxons did from the britains and the goths for more than three hundred years that they reigned in spain never contracted marriages or otherwise mixed with the spaniards till their kingdom was overthrown by the moors  these things and others of the like nature being weighed many have doubted whether it were better to constitute a commonwealth for war or for trade and of such as intend war whether those are most to be praised who prepare for defense only or those who design by conquest to enlarge their dominions or if they admit of trade whether they should propose the acquisition of riches for their ultimate end and depend upon foreign or mercenary forces to defend them or to be as helps to enable their own people to carry on those wars in which they may be frequently engaged these questions might perhaps be easily decided if mankind were of a temper to suffer those to live in peace who offer no injury to any or that men who have money to hire soldiers when they stand in need of them could find such as would valiantly and faithfully defend them whilst they apply themselves to their trades but experience teaching us that those only can be safe who are strong and that no people was ever well defended but those who fought for themselves the best judges of these matters have always given the preference to those constitutions that principally intend war and make use of trade as assisting to that end and think it better to aim at conquest rather than simply to stand upon their own defense since he that loses all if he be overcome sights upon very unequal terms and if he obtain the victory gains no other advantage than for the present to repel the danger that threatened him  these opinions are confirmed by the examples of the romans who prosperd much more than the spartans and the carthaginians who made use of trade as a help to war raised their city to be one of the most potent that ever was in the world whereas the venetians having relied on trade and mercenary soldiers are always forced too much to depend upon foreign potentats very often to buy peace with ignominious and prejudicial conditions and sometimes to fear the infidelity of their own commanders no less than the violence of their enemies but that which ought to be valued above all in point of wisdom as well as justice is the government given by god to the hebrews which chiefly fitted them for war and to make conquests moses divided them under several captains into thousands hundreds fiftys and tens this was a perpetual ordinance amongst them in numbering them those only were counted who were able to bear arms every man was obliged to go out to war except such as had married a wife or upon other special occasions were for a time excused and the whole series of the sacred history shows that there were always as many soldiers to fight for their country as there were men able to fight and if this be taken for a picture of a manyheaded beast delighting in blood begotten by sedition and nourished by crimes god himself was the drawer of it  in this variety of constitutions and effects proceeding from them i can see nothing more justly and generally to be attributed to them all than that love to their country which our author impudently affirms to be wanting in all in other matters their proceedings are not only different but contrary to each other yet it cannot be said that any nations have enjoyed so much peace as some republics the venetians too great inclination to peace is accounted to be a mortal error in their constitution and they have not bin less free from domestic seditions than foreign wars the conspiracys of the falerii and tiepoli were extinguished by their punishment and that of la cueva crushed before it was ripe genoa has not bin altogether so happy the factions of the guelphs and ghibelins that spread themselves over all italy infected that city and the malice of the spaniards and french raised others under the fregosi and adorni but they being composed they have for more than a hundred and fifty years rested in quiet  there is another sort of commonwealth composed of many citys associated together and living aequo jure every one retaining and exercising a sovereign power within it self except in some cases expressed in the act of union or league made between them these i confess are more hardly preserved in peace disputes may arise among them concerning limits jurisdiction and the like they cannot always be equally concerned in the same things the injurys offered to one do not equally affect all their neighbors will sow divisions among them and not having a mothercity to decide their controversys by her authority they may be apt to fall into quarrels especially if they profess christianity which having bin split into variety of opinions ever since it was preached and the papists by their cruelty to such as dissent from them showing to all that there is no other way of defending themselves against them than by using the same almost every man is come to think he ought as far as in him lies to impose his belief on others and that he can give no better testimony of his zeal than the excess of his violence on that account nevertheless the cantons of the switzers tho accompanied with all the most dangerous circumstances that can be imagined being thirteen in number independent on each other governed in a high degree popularly professing christianity differing in most important points eight of them much influenced by the jesuits and perpetually excited to war against their brethren by the powerful crowns of spain and france have ever since they cast off the insupportable yoke of the earls of hapsburg enjoyed more peace than any other state of europe and from the most inconsiderable people are grown to such a power that the greatest monarchs do most sollicitously seek their friendship and none have dared to invade them since charles duke of burgundy did it to his ruin and he who for a long time had bin a terror to the great dangerous and subtle king of france gave by the loss of three armies and his own life a lasting testimony of his temerity in assaulting a free and valiant tho a poor people fighting in their own quarrel commines well relates that war but a vast heap of bones remaining to this day at muret with this inscription caroli fortissimi burgundiorum ducis exercitus muretum obsidens ab helvetiis caesus hoc sui monumentum reliquit best shows the success of it since that time their greatest wars have bin for the defense of milan or such as they have undertaken for pay under the ensigns of france or spain that by the use of arms they may keep up that courage reputation and experience which is required for the defense of their own country no government was ever more free from popular seditions the revolts of their subjects have bin few weak and easily suppressed the dissension raised by the jesuits between the cantons of zurich and lucern was as soon composed as the rebellion of the county of vaux against the canton of bern and those few of the like nature that have happened among them have had the like success so that thuanus in the history of his time comprehending about fifty years and relating the horrid domestic and foreign wars that distracted germany france spain italy flanders england scotland poland denmark sweden hungary transylvania muscovy turkey africa and other places has no more to say of them than to show what arts had bin in vain used to disturb their so much envied quiet but if the modest temper of the people together with the wisdom justice and strength of their government could not be discomposed by the measures of spain and france by the industry of their ambassadors or the malicious craft of the jesuits we may safely conclude that their state is as well settled as any thing among men can be and can hardly comprehend what is like to interrupt it as much might be said of the citys of the hanseatick society if they had an entire sovereignty in themselves but the citys of the united provinces in the low countries being every one of them sovereign within themselves and many in number still continuing in their union in spite of all the endeavors that have bin used to divide them give us an example of such steddiness in practice and principle as is hardly to be paralleled in the world and that undeniably prove a temper in their constitutions directly opposite to that which our author imputes to all popular governments and if the death of barnevelt and de wit or the preserment of some most unlike to them be taken for a testimony that the best men thrive worst and the worst best i hope it may be considered that those violences proceeded from that which is most contrary to popularity tho i am not very willing to explain it  if these matters are not clear in themselves i desire they may be compared with what has happened between any princes that from the beginning of the world have bin joined in league to each other whether they were of the same or of different nations let an example be brought of six thirteen or more princes or kings who entered into a league and for the space of one or more ages did neither break it nor quarrel upon the explication of it let the states of the switzers grisons or hollanders be compared with that of france when it was sometimes divided between two three or four brothers of meroveus or pepins races with the heptarchy of england the kingdoms of leon arragon navarr castile and portugal under which the christians in spain were divided or those of cordoua sevil malaga granada and others under the power of the moors and if it be not evident that the popular states have bin remarkable for peace among themselves constancy to their union and fidelity to the leagues made with their associats whereas all the abovementioned kingdoms and such others as are known among men to have bin joined in the like leagues were ever infested with domestic rebellions and quarrels arising from the ambition of princes so as no confederacy could be so cautiously made but they would find ways to elude it or so solemn and sacred but they would in far less time break through it i will confess that kingdoms have sometimes bin as free from civil disturbances and that leagues made between several princes have bin as constantly and religiously observed as by commonwealths but if no such thing dos appear in the world and no man who is not impudent or ignorant dare pretend it i may justly conclude that tho every commonwealth has its action suitable to its constitution and that many associated together are not so free from disturbances as those that wholly depend upon the authority of a mother city yet we know of none that have not bin and are more regular and quiet than any principalitys and as to foreign wars they seek or avoid them according to their various constitutions  sect xxiii that is the best government which best provides for war our author having huddled up all popular and mixed governments into one has in some measure forced me to explain the various constitutions and principles upon which they are grounded but as the wisdom of a father is seen not only in providing bread for his family or increasing his patrimonial estate but in making all possible provision for the security of it so that government is evidently the best which not relying upon what it dos at first enjoy seeks to increase the number strength and riches of the people and by the best discipline to bring the power so improved into such order as may be of most use to the public this comprehends all things conducing to the administration of justice the preservation of domestic peace and the increase of commerce that the people being pleased with their present condition may be filled with love to their country encouraged to fight boldly for the public cause which is their own and as men do willingly join with that which prospers that strangers may be invited to fix their habitations in such a city and to espouse the principles that reign in it this is necessary for several reasons but i shall principally insist upon one which is that all things in their beginning are weak the whelp of a lion newly born has neither strength nor fierceness he that builds a city and dos not intend it should increase commits as great an absurdity as if he should desire his child might ever continue under the same weakness in which he is born if it dos not grow it must pine and perish for in this world nothing is permanent that which dos not grow better will grow worse this increase also is useless or perhaps hurtful if it be not in strength as well as in riches or number for every one is apt to seize upon illguarded treasures and the terror that the city of london was possessed with when a few dutch ships came to chatham shows that no numbers of men tho naturally valiant are able to defend themselves unless they be well armed disciplined and conducted their multitude brings confusion their wealth when it is like to be made a prey increases the fears of the owners and they who if they were brought into good order might conquer a great part of the world being destitute of it durst not think of defending themselves  if it be said that the wise father mentioned by me endeavors to secure his patrimony by law not by force i answer that all defense terminates in force and if a private man dos not prepare to defend his estate with his own force it is because he lives under the protection of the law and expects the force of the magistrate should be a security to him but kingdoms and commonwealths acknowledging no superior except god alone can reasonably hope to be protected by him only and by him if with industry and courage they make use of the means he has given them for their own defense god helps those who help themselves and men are by several reasons suppose to prevent the increase of a suspected power induced to succor an industrious and brave people but such as neglect the means of their own preservation are ever left to perish with shame men cannot rely upon any league the state that is defended by one potentat against another becomes a slave to their protector mercenary soldiers always want fidelity or courage and most commonly both if they are not corrupted or beaten by the invader they make a prey of their masters these are the followers of camps who have neither faith nor piety  ibi fas ubi maxima merces lucan but prefer gain before right they who expose their blood to sale look where they can make the best bargain and never fail of pretenses for following their interests  moreover private familys may by several arts increase their wealth as they increase in number but when a people multiplies as they will always do in a good climat under a good government such an enlargement of territory as is necessary for their subsistence can be acquired only by war this was known to the northern nations that invaded the roman empire but for want of such constitutions as might best improve their strength and valor the numbers they sent out when they were overburdend provided well for themselves but were of no use to the countries they left and whilst those goths vandals franks and normans enjoyed the most opulent and delicious provinces of the world their fathers languishd obscurely in their frozen climats for the like reasons or through the same defect the switzers are obliged to serve other princes and often to employ that valor in advancing the power of their neighbors which might be used to increase their own genoua lucca geneva and other small commonwealths having no wars are not able to nourish the men they breed but sending many of their children to seek their fortunes abroad scarce a third part of those that are born among them die in those citys and if they did not take this course they would have no better than the nations inhabiting near the river niger who sell their children as the increase of their flocks  this dos not less concern monarchys than commonwealths nor the absolute less than the mixed all of them have bin prosperous or miserable glorious or contemptible as they were better or worse armed disciplined or conducted the assyrian valor was irresistible under nabuchodonozor but was brought to nothing under his base and luxurious grandson belshazzar the persians who under cyrus conquered asia were like swine exposed to slaughter when their discipline failed and they were commanded by his proud cruel and cowardly successors the macedonian army overthrown by paulus emilius was not less in number than that with which alexander gained the empire of the east and perhaps had not bin inferior in valor if it had bin as well commanded many poor and almost unknown nations have bin carried to such a height of glory by the bravery of their princes that i might incline to think their government as fit as any other for disciplining a people to war if their virtues continued in their familys or could be transmitted to their successors the impossibility of this is a breach never to be repaired and no account is to be made of the good that is always uncertain and seldom enjoyed this disease is not only in absolute monarchys but in those also where any regard is had to succession of blood tho under the strictest limitations the fruit of all the victorys gained by edward the first and third or henry the fifth of england perished by the baseness of their successors the glory of our arms was turned into shame and we by the loss of treasure blood and territory suffered the punishment of their vices the effects of these changes are not always equally violent but they are frequent and must fall out as often as occasion is presented it was not possible for lewis the thirteenth of france to pursue the great designs of henry the fourth christina of sweden could not supply the place of her brave father nor the present king in his infancy accomplish what the great charles gustavus had nobly undertaken and no remedy can be found for this mortal infirmity unless the power be put into the hands of those who are able to execute it and not left to the blindness of fortune when the regal power is committed to an annual or otherwise chosen magistracy the virtues of excellent men are of use but all dos not depend upon their persons one man finishes what another had begun and when many are by practice rendered able to perform the same things the loss of one is easily supplied by the election of another when good principles are planted they do not die with the person that introduced em and good constitutions remain tho the authors of em perish rome did not fall back into slavery when brutus was killed who had led them to recover their liberty others like to him pursued the same ends and notwithstanding the loss of so many great commanders consumed in their almost continual wars they never wanted such as were fit to execute whatever they could design a wellgovernd state is as fruitful to all good purposes as the sevenheaded serpent is said to have bin in evil when one head is cut off many rise up in the place of it good order being once established makes good men and as long as it lasts such as are fit for the greatest employments will never be wanting by this means the romans could not be surprised no king or captain ever invaded them who did not find many excellent commanders to oppose him whereas they themselves found it easy to overthrow kingdoms tho they had bin established by the bravest princes through the baseness of their successors  but if our author says true it is of no advantage to a popular state to have excellent men and therefore he imposes a necessity upon every people to choose the worst men for being the worst and most like to themselves lest that if virtuous and good men should come into power they should be excluded for being vicious and wicked etc wise men would seize upon the state and take it from the people for the understanding of these words it is good to consider whether they are to be taken simply as usually applied to the devil and some of his instruments or relatively as to the thing in question if simply it must be concluded that valerius brutus cincinnatus capitolinus mamercus paulus emilius nasica and others like to em were not only the worst men of the city but that they were so often advanced to the supreme magistracy because they were so if in the other sense relating to magistracy and the command of armies the worst are the most ignorant unfaithful slothful or cowardly and our author to make good his proposition must prove that when the people of rome carthage athens and other states had the power of choosing whom they pleased they chose camillus corvinus torquatus fabius rullus scipio amilcar hannibal asdrubal pelopidas epaminondas pericles aristides themistocles phocion alcibiades and others like to them for their ignorance infidelity sloth and cowardice and on account of those vices most like to those who chose them but if these were the worst i desire to know what wit or eloquence can describe or comprehend the excellency of the best or of the discipline that brings whole nations to such perfection that worse than these could not be found among them and if they were not so but such as all succeeding ages have justly admired for their wisdom virtue industry and valor the impudence of so wicked and false an assertion ought to be rejected with scorn and hatred  but if all governments whether monarchial or popular absolute or limited deserve praise or blame as they are well or ill constituted for making war and that the attainment of this end dos entirely depend upon the qualifications of the commanders and the strength courage number affection and temper of the people out of which the armies are drawn those governments must necessarily be the best which take the best care that those armies may be well commanded and so provide for the good of the people that they may daily increase in number courage and strength and be so satisfied with the present state of things as to fear a change and fight for the preservation or advancement of the public interest as of their own we have already found that in hereditary monarchys no care at all is taken of the commander he is not chosen but comes by chance and dos not only frequently prove defective but for the most part utterly incapable of performing any part of his duty whereas in popular governments excellent men are generally chosen and there are so many of them that if one or more perish others are ready to supply their places and this discourse having if i mistake not in the whole series shown that the advantages of popular governments in relation to the increase of courage number and strength in a people out of which armies are to be formed and bringing them to such a temper as prepares em bravely to perform their duty are as much above those of monarchys as the prudence of choice surpasses the accidents of birth it cannot be denied that in both respects the part which relates to war is much better performed in popular governments than in monarchys  that which we are by reason led to believe is confirmed to us by experience we every where see the difference between the courage of men fighting for themselves and their posterity and those that serve a master who by good success is often rendered insupportable this is of such efficacy that no king could ever boast to have overthrown any considerable commonwealth unless it were divided within it self or weakened by wars made with such as were also free which was the case of the grecian commonwealths when the macedonians fell in upon them whereas the greatest kingdoms have bin easily destroyed by commonwealths and these also have lost all strength valor and spirit after the change of their government the power and virtue of the italians grew up decayed and perished with their liberty when they were divided into many commonwealths every one of them was able to send out great armies and to suffer many defeats before they were subdued so that their citys were delivered up by the old men women and children when all those who were able to bear arms had bin slain and when they were all brought under the romans either as associats or subjects they made the greatest strength that ever was in the world  alexander of epirus was in valor thought equal and in power little inferior to alexander of macedon but having the fortune to attack those who had bin brought up in liberty taught to hazard or suffer all things for it and to think that god has given to men hands and swords only to defend it he perished in his attempt whilst the other encountering slavish nations under the conduct of proud cruel and for the most part unwarlike tyrants became master of asia  pyrrhus seems to have bin equal to either of them but the victorys he obtained by an admirable valor and conduct cost him so dear that he desired peace with those enemies who might be defeated not subdued  hannibal wanting the prudence of pyrrhus lost the fruits of all his victorys and being torn out of italy where he had nested himself fell under the sword of those whose fathers he had defeated or slain and died a banished man from his ruined country  the gauls did once bring rome when it was small to the brink of destruction but they left their carcases to pay for the mischiefs they had done and in succeeding times their invasions were mentioned as tumults rather than wars  the germans did perhaps surpass them in numbers and strength and were equal to them in fortune as long as rome was free they often entered italy but they continued not long there unless under the weight of their chains whereas the same nations and others like to them assaulting that country or other provinces under the emperors found no other difficulty than what arose upon contests among themselves who should be master of them no manly virtue or discipline remained among the italians those who governed them relied upon tricks and shifts they who could not defend themselves hired some of those nations to undertake their quarrels against others these trinklings could not last the goths scorning to depend upon those who in valor and strength were much inferior to themselves seized upon the city that had commanded the world whilst honorius was so busy in providing for his hens that he could not think of defending it arcadius had the luck not to lose his principal city but passing his time among fiddlers players eunuchs cooks dancers and buffoons the provinces were securely plundered and ransacked by nations that are known only from their victorys against him  it is in vain to say that this proceeded from the fatal corruption of that age for that corruption proceeded from the government and the ensuing desolation was the effect of it and as the like disorder in government has bin ever since in greece and the greatest part of italy those countries which for extent riches convenience of situation and numbers of men are equal to the best in the world and for the wit courage and industry of the natives perhaps justly preferable to any have since that time bin always exposed as a prey to the first invader charles the eighth of france is by guicciardin and other writers represented as a prince equally weak in body mind money and forces but as an ill hare is said to make a good dog he conquered the best part of italy without breaking a lance ferdinand and alphonso of arragon kings of naples had governed by trepanners false witnesses corrupt judges mercenary soldiers and other ministers of iniquity but these could afford no help against an invader and neither the oppressed nobility nor people concerning themselves in the quarrel they who had bin proud fierce and cruel against their poor subjects never durst look an enemy in the face and the father dying with anguish and fear the son shamefully fled from his illgovernd kingdom  the same things are no less evident in spain no people ever defended themselves with more obstinacy and valor than the spaniards did against the carthaginians and romans who surpast them in wealth and skill livy calls them gentem ad bella gerenda and reparanda natam and who generally killed themselves when they were mastered and disarmed nullam sine armis vitam esse rati but tho the mixture of roman blood could not impair their race and the conjunction of the goths had improved their force yet no more was required for the overthrow of them all than the weakness and baseness of the two lewd tyrants witza and rodrigo who disdained all laws and resolved to govern according to their lust they who for more than two hundred years had resisted the romans were entirely subdued by the vile halfnaked moors in one slight skirmish and do not to this day know what became of the king who brought the destruction upon them that kingdom after many revolutions is with many others come to the house of austria and enjoys all the wealth of the indys whereupon they are thought to have affected an universal monarchy sed ut sunt levia aulicorum ingenia this was grounded upon nothing except their own vanity they had money and craft but wanting that solid virtue and strength which makes and preserves conquests their kings have nothing but milan that did not come to them by marriage and tho they have not received any extraordinary disasters in war yet they languish and consume through the defects of their own government and are forced to beg assistance from their mortal and formerly despised enemies these are the best hopes of defense that they have from abroad and the only enemy an invader ought to fear in their desolate territorys is that want and famine which testifys the good order strength and stability of our authors divine monarchy the profound wisdom of their kings in subtly finding out so sure a way of defending the country their paternal care in providing for the good of their subjects and that whatsoever is defective in the prince is assuredly supplied by the sedulity of a good council  we have already said enough to obviate the objections that may be drawn from the prosperity of the french monarchy the beauty of it is false and painted there is a rich and haughty king who is blessed with such neighbors as are not likely to disturb him and has nothing to fear from his miserable subjects but the whole body of that state is full of boils and wounds and putrid sores there is no real strength in it the people are so unwilling to serve him that he is said to have put to death above four score thousand of his own soldiers within the space of fifteen years for flying from their colors and if he were vigorously attacked little help could be expected from a discontented nobility or a starving and despairing people if to diminish the force of these arguments and examples it be said that in two or three thousand years all things are changed the ancient virtue of mankind is extinguished and the love that every one had to his country is turned into a care of his private interests i answer that time changes nothing and the changes produced in this time proceed only from the change of governments the nations which have bin governed arbitrarily have always suffered the same plagues and bin infected with the same vices which is as natural as for animals ever to generate according to their kinds and fruits to be of the same nature with the roots and seeds from which they come the same order that made men valiant and industrious in the service of their country during the first ages would have the same effect if it were now in being men would have the same love to the public as the spartans and romans had if there was the same reason for it we need no other proof of this than what we have seen in our own country where in a few years good discipline and a just encouragement given to those who did well produced more examples of pure complete incorruptible and invincible virtue than rome or greece could ever boast or if more be wanting they may easily be found among the switzers hollanders and others but it is not necessary to light a candle to the sun  sect xxiv popular governments are less subject to civil disorders than monarchys manage them more ably and more easily recover out of them it is in vain to seek a government in all points free from a possibility of civil wars tumults and seditions that is a blessing denied to this life and reserved to complete the felicity of the next but if these are to be accounted the greatest evils that can fall upon a people the rectitude or defects of governments will best appear if we examine which species is more or less exposed to or exempted from them  this may be done two ways    by searching into the causes from whence they may or usually do arise    which kind has actually bin most frequently and dangerously disturbed by them  to the first seditions tumults and wars do arise from mistake or from malice from just occasions or unjust from mistake when a people think an evil to be done or intended which is not done nor intended or take that to be evil which is done tho in truth it be not so well regulated citys may fall into these errors the romans being jealous of their newly recovered liberty thought that valerius publicola designed to make himself king when he built a house in a place that seemed too strong and eminent for a private man the spartans were not less suspicious of lycurgus and a lewd young fellow in a sedition put out one of his eyes but no people ever continued in a more constant affection to their best deserving citizens than both the romans and spartans afterward manifested to those virtuous and wrongfully suspected men  sometimes the fact is true but otherwise understood than was intended when the tarquins were expelled from rome the patricians retained to themselves the principal magistracys but never thought of bringing back kings or of setting up a corrupt oligarchy among themselves as the plebeians imagined and this mistake being discovered the fury they had conceived vanished and they who seemed to intend nothing less than the extirpation of all the patrician familys grew quiet menenius agrippa appeased one of the most violent seditions that ever happened amongst them till civil interests were pursued by armed troops with a fable of the several parts of the body that murmured against the belly and the most dangerous of all was composed by creating tribuns to protect them some of the patrician young men had favored the decemviri and others being unwilling to appear against them the people believed they had all conspired with those new tyrants but valerius and horatius putting themselves at the head of those who sought their destruction they perceived their error and looked upon the patricians as the best defenders of their libertys et inde says livy auram libertatis captare unde servitutem timuissent democratical governments are most liable to these mistakes in aristocracys they are seldom seen and we hear of none in sparta after the establishment of the laws by lycurgus but absolute monarchys seem to be totally exempted from them the mischiefs designed are often dissembled or denied till they are past all possibility of being cured by any other way than force and such as are by necessity driven to use that remedy know they must perfect their work or perish he that draws his sword against the prince say the french ought to throw away the scabbard for tho the design be never so just yet the authors are sure to be ruined if it miscarry peace is seldom made and never kept unless the subject retain such a power in his hands as may oblige the prince to stand to what is agreed and in time some trick is found to deprive them of that benefit  seditions proceeding from malice are seldom or never seen in popular governments for they are hurtful to the people and none have ever willingly and knowingly hurt themselves there may be and often is malice in those who excite them but the people are ever deceived and whatsoever is thereupon done ought to be imputed to error as i said before if this be discovered in time it usually turns to the destruction of the contriver as in the cases of manlius capitolinus spurius melius and sp cassius if not for the most part it produces a tyranny as in those of agathocles dionysius pisistrates and caesar but in absolute monarchys almost all the troubles that arise proceed from malice they cannot be reformed the extinction of them is exceeding difficult if they have continued long enough to corrupt the people and those who appear against em seek only to set up themselves or their friends thus we see that in the civil wars of the east the question was whether artaxerxes or cyrus phraartes or bardanes should reign over the persians and parthians the people suffered equally from both whilst the contests lasted and the decision left em under the power of a proud and cruel master the like is seen in all places after the death of brutus and cassius no war was ever undertaken in the roman empire upon a better account than one mans private concernments the provinces suffered under all and he whom they had assisted to overthrow one wicked tyrant very often proved worse than his predecessor and the only ground of all the dissensions with which france was vexed under the princes of meroveus and pepins races were which of them should reign the people remaining miserable under them all  the case is not much different in mixed monarchys some wars may be undertaken upon a just and public account but the pretenses are commonly false a lasting reformation is hardly introduced an entire change often disliked and tho such kingdoms are frequently and terribly distracted as appears by the beforementioned examples of england spain etc the quarrels are for the most part begun upon personal titles as between henry the first and robert stephen and maud or the houses of lancaster and york and the people who get nothing by the victory which way soever it fall and might therefore prudently leave the competitors to decide their own quarrels like theorestes and polinices with their own swords become cruelly engaged in them  it may seem strange to some that i mention seditions tumults and wars upon just occasions but i can find no reason to retract the term god intending that men should live justly with one another dos certainly intend that he or they who do no wrong should suffer none and the law that forbids injurys were of no use if no penalty might be inflicted on those who will not obey it if injustice therefore be evil and injurys forbidden they are also to be punished and the law instituted for their prevention must necessarily intend the avenging of such as cannot be prevented the work of the magistracy is to execute this law the sword of justice is put into their hands to restrain the fury of those within the society who will not be a law to themselves and the sword of war to protect the people against the violence of foreigners this is without exception and would be in vain if it were not but the magistrate who is to protect the people from injury may and is often known not to have done it he sometimes renders his office useless by neglecting to do justice sometimes mischievous by overthrowing it this strikes at the root of gods general ordinance that there should be laws and the particular ordinances of all societys that appoint such as seem best to them the magistrate therefore is comprehended under both and subject to both as well as private men  the ways of preventing or punishing injurys are judicial or extrajudicial judicial proceedings are of force against those who submit or may be brought to trial but are of no effect against those who resist and are of such power that they cannot be constrained it were absurd to cite a man to appear before a tribunal who can aw the judges or has armies to defend him and impious to think that he who has added treachery to his other crimes and usurped a power above the law should be protected by the enormity of his wickedness legal proceedings therefore are to be used when the delinquent submits to the law and all are just when he will not be kept in order by the legal  the word sedition is generally applied to all numerous assemblys without or against the authority of the magistrate or of those who assume that power athaliah and jezabel were more ready to cry out treason than david and examples of that sort are so frequent that i need not alledg them  tumult is from the disorderly manner of those assemblys where things can seldom be done regularly and war is that decertatio per vim or trial by force to which men come when other ways are ineffectual  if the laws of god and men are therefore of no effect when the magistracy is left at liberty to break them and if the lusts of those who are too strong for the tribunals of justice cannot be otherwise restrained than by sedition tumults and war those seditions tumults and wars are justified by the laws of god and man  i will not take upon me to enumerate all the cases in which this may be done but content my self with three which have most frequently given occasion for proceedings of this kind  the first is when one or more men take upon them the power and name of a magistracy to which they are not justly called  the second when one or more being justly called continue in their magistracy longer than the laws by which they are called do prescribe  and the third when he or they who are rightly called do assume a power tho within the time prescribed that the law dos not give or turn that which the law dos give to an end different and contrary to that which is intended by it  for the first filmer forbids us to examine titles he tells us we must submit to the power whether acquired by usurpation or otherwise not observing the mischievous absurdity of rewarding the most detestable villanys with the highest honors and rendering the veneration due to the supreme magistrate as father of the people to one who has no other advantage above his brethren than what he has gained by injuriously dispossessing or murdering him that was so hobbs fearing the advantages that may be taken from such desperate nonsense or not thinking it necessary to his end to carry the matter so far has no regard at all to him who comes in without title or consent and denying him to be either king or tyrant gives him no other name than hostis and latro and allows all things to be lawful against him that may be done to a public enemy or pyrat which is as much as to say any man may destroy him how he can whatever he may be guilty of in other respects he dos in this follow the voice of mankind and the dictates of common sense for no man can make himself a magistrate for himself and no man can have the de civ l   right of a magistrate who is not a magistrate if he be justly accounted an enemy to all who injures all he above all must be the public enemy of a nation who by usurping a power over them dos the greatest and most public injury that a people can suffer for which reason by an established law among the most virtuous nations every man might kill a tyrant and no names are recorded in history with more honor than of those who did it  these are by other authors called tyranni sine titulo and that name is given to all those who obtain the supreme power by illegal and unjust means the laws which they overthrow can give them no protection and every man is a soldier against him who is a public enemy  the same rule holds tho they are more in number as the magi who usurped the dominion of persia after the death of cambyses the thirty tyrants at athens overthrown by thrasibulus those of thebes slain by pelopidas the decemviri of rome and others for tho the multitude of offenders may sometimes procure impunity yet that act which is wicked in one must be so in ten or twenty and whatsoever is lawful against one usurper is so against them all    if those who were rightly created continue beyond the time limited by the law it is the same thing that which is expired is as if it had never bin he that was created consul for a year or dictator for six months was after that a private man and if he had continued in the exercise of his magistracy had bin subject to the same punishment as if he had usurped it at the first this was known to epaminondas who finding that his enterprise against sparta could not be accomplished within the time for which he was made boeotarches rather chose to trust his countrymen with his life than to desist and was saved merely through an admiration of his virtue assurance of his good intentions and the glory of the action  the roman decemviri tho duly elected were proceeded against as private men usurping the magistracy when they continued beyond their time other magistrates had ceased there was none that could regularly call the senate or people to an assembly but when their ambition was manifest and the people exasperated by the death of virginia they laid aside all ceremonys the senate and people met and exercising their authority in the same manner as if they had bin regularly called by the magistrate appointed to that end they abrogated the power of the decemviri proceeded against them as enemies and tyrants and by that means preserved themselves from utter ruin    the same course is justly used against a legal magistrate who takes upon him tho within the time prescribed by the law to exercise a power which the law dos not give for in that respect he is a private man quia as grotius says eatenus non habet imperium and may be restrained as well as any other because he is not set up to do what he lists but what the law appoints for the good of the people and as he has no other power than what the law allows so the same law limits and directs the exercise of that which he has this right naturally belonging to nations is no way impaired by the name of supreme given to their magistrates for it signifys no more than that they do act sovereignly in the matters committed to their charge thus are the parliaments of france called course souveraines for they judge of life and death determine controversys concerning estates and there is no appeal from their decrees but no man ever thought that it was therefore lawful for them to do what they pleased or that they might not be opposed if they should attempt to do that which they ought not and tho the roman dictators and consuls were supreme magistrates they were subject to the people and might be punished as well as others if they transgrest the law thuanus carrys the word so far that when barlotta giustiniano and others who were but colonels were sent as commanders in chief of three or four thousand men upon an enterprise he always says summum imperium ei delatum grotius explains this point by distinguishing those who have the summum imperium summo modo from those who have it modo non summo i know not where to find an example of this sovereign power enjoyed without restriction under a better title than occupation which relates not to our purpose who seek only that which is legal and just therefore laying aside that point for the present we may de jur bell and pac l   follow grotius in examining the right of those who are certainly limited vbi partem imperii habet rex partem senatus sive populus in which case he says regi in partem non suam involanti vis justa opponi potest in as much as they who have a part cannot but have a right of defending that part quia data facultate datur jus facultatem tuendi without which it could be of no effect  the particular limits of the rights belonging to each can only be judged by the precise letter or general intention of the law the dukes of venice have certainly a part in the government and could not be called magistrates if they had not they are said to be supreme all laws and public acts bear their names the ambassador of that state speaking han l     to pope paul the fifth denied that he acknowledged any other superior than god but they are so well known to be under the power of the law that diverse of em have bin put to death for transgressing it and a marble gallows is seen at the foot of the stairs in st marks palace upon which some of them and no others have bin executed but if they may be duly opposed when they commit undue acts no man of judgment will deny that if one of them by an outrageous violence should endeavor to overthrow the law he might by violence be suppressed and chastisd  again some magistrates are entrusted with a power of providing ships arms ammunition and victuals for war raising and disciplining soldiers appointing officers to command in forts and garrisons and making leagues with foreign princes and states but if one of these should imbezel sell or give to an enemy those ships arms ammunition or provisions betray the forts employ only or principally such men as will serve him in those wicked actions and contrary to the trust reposed in him make such leagues with foreigners as tend to the advancement of his personal interests and to the detriment of the public he abrogates his own magistracy and the right he had perishes as the lawyers say frustratione finis he cannot be protected by the law which he has overthrown nor obtain impunity for his crimes from the authority that was conferred upon him only that he might do good with it he was singulis major on account of the excellency of his office but universis minor from the nature and end of his institution the surest way of extinguishing his prerogative was by turning it to the hurt of those who gave it when matters are brought to this posture the author of the mischief or the nation must perish a flock cannot subsist under a shepherd that seeks its ruin nor a people under an unfaithful magistrate honor and riches are justly heaped upon the heads of those who rightly perform their duty because the difficulty as well as the excellency of the work is great it requires courage experience industry fidelity and wisdom the good shepherd says our savior lays down his life for his sheep the hireling who flies in time of danger is represented under an ill character but he that sets himself to destroy his flock is a wolf his authority is incompatible with their subsistence and whoever disapproves tumults seditions or war by which he may be removed from it if gentler means are ineffectual subverts the foundation of all law exalts the fury of one man to the destruction of a nation and giving an irresistible power to the most abominable iniquity exposes all that are good to be destroyed and virtue to be utterly extinguished  few will allow such a preeminence to the dukes of venice or genoa the advoyers of switzerland or the burgomasters of amsterdam many will say these are rascals if they prove false and ought rather to be hanged than suffered to accomplish the villanys they design but if this be confessed in relation to the highest magistrates that are among those nations why should not the same be in all others by what name soever they are called when did god confer upon those nations the extraordinary privilege of providing better for their own safety than others or was the gift universal tho the benefit accrue only to those who have banished great titles from among them if this be so it is not their felicity but their wisdom that we ought to admire and imitate but why should any think their ancestors had not the same care have not they who retained in themselves a power over a magistrate of one name the like over another is there a charm in words or any name of such efficacy that he who receives it should immediately become master of those that created him whereas all others do remain for ever subject to them would the venetian government change its nature if they should give the name of king to their prince are the polanders less sree since the title of king is conferred upon their dukes or are the moscovites less slaves because their chief magistrate has no other than that of duke if we examine things but a little twill appear that magistrates have enjoyed large powers who never had the name of kings and none were ever more restrained by laws than those of sparta arragon the goths in spain hungary bohemia sweden denmark poland and others who had that title there is therefore no such thing as a right universally belonging to a name but every one enjoys that which the laws by which he is coner upon him the law that gives the power regulates it and they who give no more than what they please cannot be obliged to suffer him to whom they give it to take more than they thought fit to give or to go unpunished if he do the agreements made are always confirmed by oath and the treachery of violating them is consequently aggravated by perjury they are good philosophers and able divines who think this can create a right to those who had none or that the laws can be a protection to such as overthrow them and give opportunity of doing the mischiefs they design if it do not then he that was a magistrate by such actions returns into the condition of a private man and whatever is lawful against a thief who submits to no law is lawful against him  men who delight in cavils may ask who shall be the judge of these occasions and whether i intend to give to the people the decision of their own cause to which i answer that when the contest is between the magistrate and the people the party to which the determination is referred must be the judge of his own case and the question is only whether the magistrate should depend on the judgment of the people or the people on that of the magistrate and which is most to be suspected of injustice that is whether the people of rome should judge tarquin or tarquin judge the people he that knew all good men abhorred him for the murder of his wife brother fatherinlaw and the best of the senate would certainly strike off the heads of the most eminent remaining poppys and having incurred the general hatred of the people by the wickedness of his government he feared revenge and endeavoring to destroy those he feared that is the city he might easily have accomplished his work if the judgment had bin referred to him if the people judge tarquin it is hard to imagine how they should be brought to give an unjust sentence they loved their former kings and hated him only for his villanys they did not fancy but know his cruelty when the best were slain no man that any way resembled them could think himself secure brutus did not pretend to be a fool till by the murder of his brother he found how dangerous a thing it was to be thought wise if the people as our author says be always lewd foolish mad wicked and desirous to put the power into the hands of such as are most like to themselves he and his sons were such men as they sought and he was sure to find favorable judges if virtuous and good no injustice was to be feared from them and he could have no other reason to decline their judgment than what was suggested by his own wickedness caligula nero domitian and the like had probably the same considerations but no man of common sense ever thought that the senate and people of rome did not better deserve to judge whether such monsters should reign over the best part of mankind to their destruction than they to determine whether their crimes should be punished or not  if i mention some of these known cases every mans experience will suggest others of the like nature and whosoever condemns all seditions tumults and wars raised against such princes must say that none are wicked or seek the ruin of their people which is absurd for caligula wished the people had but one neck that he might cut it off at a blow nero set the city on fire and we have known such as have bin worse than either of them they must either be suffered to continue in the free exercise of their rage that is to do all the mischief they design or must be restrained by a legal judicial or extrajudicial way and they who disallow the extrajudicial do as little like the judicial they will not hear of bringing a supreme magistrate before a tribunal when it may be done they will says our author depose their kings why should they not be deposed if they become enemies to their people and set up an interest in their own persons inconsistent with the public good for the promoting of which they were erected if they were created by the public consent for the public good shall they not be removed when they prove to be of public damage if they set up themselves may they not be thrown down shall it be lawful for them to usurp a power over the liberty of others and shall it not be lawful for an injured people to resume their own if injustice exalt it self must it be for ever established shall great persons be rendered sacred by rapine perjury and murder shall the crimes for which private men do justly suffer the most grievous punishments exempt them from all who commit them in the highest excess with most power and most to the prejudice of mankind shall the laws that solely aim at the prevention of crimes be made to patronize them and become snares to the innocent whom they ought to protect has every man given up into the common store his right of avenging the injurys he may receive that the public power which ought to protect or avenge him should be turned to the destruction of himself his posterity and the society into which they enter without any possibility of redress shall the ordinance of god be rendered of no effect or the powers he has appointed to be set up for the distribution of justice be made subservient to the lusts of one or a sew men and by impunity encourage them to commit all manner of crimes is the corruption of mans nature so little known that such as have common sense should expect justice from those who sear no punishment if they do injustice or that the modesty integrity and innocence which is seldom found in one man tho never so cautiously chosen should be constantly found in all those who by any means attain to greatness and continue for ever in their successors or that there can be any security under their government if they have them not surely if this were the condition of men living under government forests would be more safe than citys and twere better for every man to stand in his own defense than to enter into societys he that lives alone might encounter such as should assault him upon equal terms and stand or fall according to the measure of his courage and strength but no valor can defend him if the malice of his enemy be upheld by a public power there must therefore be a right of proceeding judicially or extrajudicially against all persons who transgress the laws or else those laws and the societys that should subsist by them cannot stand and the ends for which governments are constituted together with the governments themselves must be overthrown extrajudicial proceedings by sedition tumult or war must take place when the persons concerned are of such power that they cannot be brought under the judicial they who deny this deny all help against an usurping tyrant or the perfidiousness of a lawfully created magistrate who adds the crimes of ingratitude and treachery to usurpation these of all men are the most dangerous enemies to supreme magistrates for as no man desires indemnity for such crimes as are never committed he that would exempt all from punishment supposes they will be guilty of the worst and by concluding that the people will depose them if they have the power acknowledge that they pursue an interest annexed to their persons contrary to that of their people which they would not bear if they could deliver themselves from it this showing all those governments to be tyrannical lays such a burden upon those who administer them as must necessarily weigh them down to destruction  if it be said that the word sedition implys that which is evil i answer that it ought not then to be applied to those who seek nothing but that which is just and tho the ways of delivering an oppressed people from the violence of a wicked magistrate who having armed a crew of lewd villains and fatted them with the blood and confiscations of such as were most ready to oppose him be extraordinary the inward righteousness of the act dos fully justify the authors he that has virtue and power to save a people can never want a right of doing it valerius asiaticus had no hand in the death of caligula but when the furious guards began tumultuously to inquire who had killed him he appeased them with wishing he had bin the man no wise man ever asked by what authority thrasibulus harmodius aristogiton pelopidas epaminondas dion timoleon lucius brutus publicola horatius valerius marcus brutus c cassius and the like delivered their countries from tyrants their actions carried in them their own justification and their virtues will never be forgotten whilst the names of greece and rome are remembered in the world  if this be not enough to declare the justice inherent in and the glory that ought to accompany these works the examples of moses aaron othniel ehud barac gideon samuel jephtha david jehu jehoiada the maccabees and other holy men raised up by god for the deliverance of his people from their oppressors decide the question they are perpetually renowned for having led the people by extraordinary ways which such as our author express under the names of sedition tumult and war to recover their libertys and avenge the injurys received from foreign or domestic tyrants the work of the apostles was not in their time to set up or pull down any civil state but they so behaved themselves in relation to all the powers of the earth that they gained the name of pestilent seditious fellows disturbers of the people and left it as an inheritance to those who in succeeding ages by following their steps should deserve to be called their successors whereby they were exposed to the hatred of corrupt magistrates and brought under the necessity of perishing by them or desending themselves against them and he that denis them that right dos at once condemn the most glorious actions of the wisest best and holiest men that have bin in the world together with the laws of god and man upon which they were founded  nevertheless there is a sort of sedition tumult and war proceeding from malice which is always detestable aiming only at the satisfaction of private lust without regard to the public good this cannot happen in a popular government unless it be amongst the rabble or when the body of the people is so corrupted that it cannot stand but is most frequent in and natural to absolute monarchys when abimelech desired judge   to make himself king he raised a tumult among the basest of the people he hired light and vain persons some translations call them lewd vagabonds killed his brethren but perished in his design the corrupt party that favored him not having strength enough to subdue the other who were more sincere sp melius sp cassius and manlius attempted the like in rome they acted maliciously their pretenses to procure the public good were false it is probable that some in the city were as bad as they and knew that mischief was intended but the body of the people not being corrupted they were suppressed it appeared says livy nihil esse minus populare quam regnum they who had favored manlius condemned him to death when it was proved that egregias alioqui virtutes foeda regni cupidine maculasset but when the people is generally corrupted such designs seldom miscarry and the success is always the erection of a tyranny nothing else can please vain and profligate persons and no tyranny was ever set up by such as were better qualified the ways of attaining it have always bin by corrupting the manners of the people bribing soldiers entertaining mercenary strangers opening prisons giving liberty to slaves alluring indigent persons with hopes of abolishing debts coming to a new division of lands and the like seditions raised by such men always tend to the ruin of popular governments but when they happen under absolute monarchys the hurt intended is only to the person who being removed the promoters of em set up another and he that is set up subsisting only by the strength of those who made him is obliged to foment the vices that drew them to serve him tho another may perhaps make use of the same against him  the consequence of this is that those who uphold popular governments look upon vice and indigence as mischiefs that naturally increase each other and equally tend to the ruin of the state when men are by vice brought into want they are ready for mischief there is no villainy that men of profligate lives lost reputation and desperate fortunes will not undertake popular equality is an enemy to these and they who would preserve it must preserve integrity of manners sobriety and an honest contentedness with what the law allows on the other side the absolute monarch who will have no other law than his own will desires to increase the number of those who through leudness and beggary may incline to depend upon him tho the same temper of mind and condition of fortune prepare them also for such seditions as may bring him into danger and the same corruption which led them to set him up may invite them to sell him to another that will give them better wages  i do not by this conclude that all monarchs are vicious men but that whoever will set up an absolute power must do it by these means and that if such a power be already established and should fall into the hands of a person who by his virtue and the gentleness of his nature should endeavor to render the yoke so easy that a better disciplined people might be contented to bear it yet this method could last no longer than his life and probably would be a means to shorten it that which was at first established by evil arts always returning to the same that which was vicious in the principle can never be long upheld by virtue and we see that the worst of the roman emperors were not in greater danger from such good men as remained undestroyd than the best from the corrupt party that would not be corrected and sought such a master as would lay no restriction upon their vices those few who escaped the rage of these villains only gave a little breathing time to the afflicted world which by their children or successors was again plunged into that extremity of misery from which they intended to deliver it an extraordinary virtue was required to keep a prince in a way contrary to the principles of his own government which being rarely found and never continuing long in a family or succession of men the endeavors of the best became ineffectual and either they themselves perished in them or after their death all things returned into the old polluted channel  tho the power of the hebrew kings was not unlimited yet it exceeded the rules set by god and was sufficient to increase the number of the worst of men and to give them opportunitys of raising perpetual disturbances on the kings side there were flatterers and instruments of mischief on the other side there were indebted and discontented persons notwithstanding the justice of davids cause the wisdom valor and piety of his person none would follow him except a few of his own kindred who knew what god had promised to him and such as were uneasy in their worldly circumstances after the death of saul there was a long and bloody war between ishbosheth and david the former being killed the slightest matters were sufficient to put the whole nation into blood absalom with a few fair words was able to raise all israel against his father sheba the son of bichri with as much ease raised a more dangerous tumult david by wisdom valor and the blessing of god surmounted these difficultys and prepared a peaceable reign for solomon but after his death they broke out into a flame that was never quenched till the nation was so dispersed that no man knew where to find his enemies solomon by his magnificence had reduced israel to such poverty as inclined them to revolt upon the first offer of an opportunity by jeroboam from that time forward israel was perpetually vexed with civil seditions and conspiracys or wars with their brethren of judah nine kings with their familys were destroyed by the first and the latter brought such slaughters upon the miserable people as were never suffered by any who were not agitated by the like fury and the course of these mischiefs was never interrupted till they had brought the nation into captivity and the country to desolation tho god according to his promise did preserve a light in the house of david yet the tribe of judah was not the more happy joash was slain by a private conspiracy and amaziah as is most probable by public authority for having foolishly brought a terrible slaughter upon judah athaliah destroyed the kings race and was killed her self by jehoiada who not having learned from our author to regard the power only and not the ways by which it was obtained caused her to be dragged out of the temple and put to a welldeservd death the whole story is a tragedy and if it be pretended that this proceeded rather from the wrath of god against his people for their idolatry than from such causes as are applicable to other nations i answer that this idolatry was the production of the government they had set up and most suitable to it and choosing rather to subject themselves to the will of a man than to the law of god they deservedly suffered the evils that naturally follow the worst counsels we know of none who taking the like course have not suffered the like miserys notwithstanding the admirable virtue and success of alexander his reign was full of conspiracys and his knowledge of them prompted him to destroy parmenio philotas clitus calisthenes hermolaus and many more of his best friends if he escaped the sword he fell by poison the murder of his wives mother and children by the rage of his own soldiers the fury of his captains employed in mutual slaughters till they were consumed his paternal kingdom after many revolutions transferred to cassander his most mortal enemy the utter extinction of his conquering army and particularly the famous argyraspides who being grown faithless and seditious after the death of eumenes were sent to perish in unknown parts of the east abundantly testify the admirable stability good order peace and quiet that is enjoyed under absolute monarchy the next government of the like nature that appeared upon the stage of the world was that of rome introduced by wars that consumed two thirds of the people confirmed by proscriptions in which all that were eminent for nobility riches or virtue perished the peace they had under augustus was like that which the devil allowed to the child in the gospel whom he rent mark      sorely and left as dead the miserable city was only cast into a swound after long and violent vexations by seditions tumults and wars it lay as dead and finding no helper like to him who cured the child it was delivered to new devils to be tormented till it was utterly destroyed tiberius was appointed as a fit instrument for such a purpose it was thought that those who should feel the effects of his pride cruelty and lust would look upon the death of augustus as a loss he performed the work for which he was chosen his reign was an uninterrupted series of murders subornations perjurys and poisonings intermixed with the most detestable impuritys the revolts of provinces and mutinys of armies the matter was not mended by his successors caligula was killed by his own guards claudius poisoned by his wife spain gaul germany pannonia maesia syria and egypt revolted at once from nero the people and senate followed the example of the provinces this i think was in our authors sense sedition with a witness nero being dead by the hand of a slave or his own to prevent that of the hangman galba entered the city with blood and slaughter but when his own soldiers found he would not give the money for which they intended to sell the empire they killed him and to show the stability of absolute monarchy it may be observed that this was not done by the advice of the senate or by a conspiracy of great men suscepere duo manipulares c tacit hist l   populi romani imperium transferendum and transtulerunt two rascals gave the empire to otho and the whole senate was like to be butchered for not being so ready to follow their venerable authority as they ought to have bin and hardly escaped the fury of their mad and drunken companions as a farther testimony that these monarchys are not subject to seditions and tumults he had at once only two competitors against whom he was to defend the wellacquird empire his army was deseated at brescia he killed himself and his successor vitellius was soon after thrown into the commonshore the same method still continued rome was filled with blood and ashes and to recite all the public mischiefs would be to transcribe the history for as pyrrhus being asked who should succeed him answered he who has the sharpest sword that was the only law that governed in the following ages whoever could corrupt two or three legions thought he had a good title to the empire and unless he happened to be killed by treachery or another tumult of his own soldiers he seldom receded from it without a battle wherein he that was most successful had no other security than what the present temper of the soldiers afforded him and the miserable provinces having neither virtue nor force were obliged slavishly to follow the fury or fortune of those villains in this state did rome dedicate to constantine the triumphal arch that had bin prepared for maxentius and those provinces which had set up albinus and niger submitted to septimius severus in the vast variety of accidents that in those ages disturbed the world no emperor had a better title than what he purchased by money or violence and enjoyed it no longer than those helps continued which of all things were the most uncertain by this means most of the princes perished by the sword italy was made desolate and rome was several times sacked and burnt the mistress of the world being made a slave the provinces which had bin acquired by the blood of her ancient virtuous citizens became part of an usurpers patrimony who without any regard to the public good distributed em to his children according to their number or his passion these either destroyed one another or fell under the sword of a third who had the fortune of their father the greatest part most commonly falling to the share of the worst if at any time the contrary happened the government of the best was but a lucid interval and wellwishing men grew more extremely to abhor the darkness that followed when they were gone the best of em could do no more than suspend mischief for a while but could not correct the corrupt principle of their government and some of em were destroyed as soon as they were thought to intend it others who finished their days in peace left the empire to such persons of their relations as were most unlike to them domitian came in as brother to titus commodus and heliogabalus were recommended by the memory of those virtues that had bin found in antoninus and aurelius honorius and arcadius who by their baseness brought utter ruin upon the western and eastern empires were the sons of the brave theodosius they who could keep their hands free from blood and their hearts from malice covetousness and pride could not transmit their virtues to their successors nor correct the perverseness that lay at the root and foundation of their government the whole mass of blood was vitiated the body was but one vast sore which no hand but that of the almighty could heal and he who from an abhorrence of iniquity had declared he would not hear the cries of his own people when they had chosen the thing that was not good would not show mercy to strangers who had done the same thing  i have insisted upon the hebrew macedonian and roman historys because they are the most eminent and best known to us we are in the dark concerning the babylonian assyrian chaldean bactrian and egyptian monarchys we know little more of them than the scripture occasionally relates concerning their barbarous cruelty bestial pride and extravagant folly others have bin like to them and i know not where to find a peaceable monarchy unless it be in peru where the ynca garilasso de la vega says that a man and a woman children of the sun and the moon appearing amongst a barbarous people living without any religion or law established a government amongst them which continued in much peace and justice for twelve generations but this seeming to be as fabulous as their birth we may pass it over and fix upon those that are better known of which there is not one that has not suffered more dangerous and mischievous seditions than all the popular governments that have bin in the world and the condition of those kingdoms which are not absolute and yet give a preference to birth without consideration of merit or virtue is not much better  this is proved by the reasons of those seditions and tumults as well as from the fact it self  the reasons arise from the violence of the passions that incite men to them and the intricacy of the questions concerning succession  every man has passions few know how to moderate and no one can wholly extinguish them as they are various in their nature so they are governed by various objects and men usually follow that which is predominant in them whether it proceed from anger or desire and whether it terminate in ambition covetousness lust or any other more or less blamable appetite every manner of life furnishes something that in some measure may foment these but a crown comprehends all that can be grateful to the most violent and vicious he who is covetous has vast revenues besides what he may get by fraud and rapine to satisfy his appetite if he be given to sensuality the variety of pleasures and the facility of accomplishing whatever he desires tends farther to inflame that passion such as are ambitious are incited by the greatness of their power to attempt great matters and the most sottish or lazy may discharge themselves of cares and hope that others will be easily hired to take the burden of business upon them whilst they lie at ease they who naturally incline to pride and cruelty are more violently tempted to usurp dominion and the wicked advices of flatterers always concurring with their passions incite them to exercise the power they have gotten with the utmost rigor to satiate their own rage and to secure themselves against the effects of the public hatred which they know they have deserved if there be as our author says no other rule than force and success and that he must be taken for the father of a people who is in possession of a power over them whoever has the one may put the other to a trial nay even those who have regard to justice will seldom want reasons to persuade them that it is on their side something may be amiss in the state injurys may be done to themselves and their friends such honors may be denied as they think they deserve or others of less merit as they suppose may be preferred before them men do so rarely make a right estimate of their own merits that those who mean well may be often deceived and if nothing but success be required to make a monarch they may think it just to attempt whatever they can hope to accomplish this was the case of julius caesar he thought all things viribus utendum est quas fecimus arma cenenti omnia dat qui justa negat luan  lawful when the consulat which he supposed he had deserved was denied these enterprises seem to belong to men of great spirits but there are none so base not to be capable of undertaking and as things may stand of bringing em to perfection history represents no man under a more contemptible character of sottis laziness cowardice and drunkenness than vitellius no one more impure and sordid than galba otho was advanced for being in his manners like to nero vespasian was scorned for his avarice till the power fell into such hands as made the world believe none could be unworthy of the empire and in the following ages the worst men by the worst means most frequently obtained it  these wounds are not cured by saying that the law of god and nature prevents this mischief by annexing the succession of crowns to proximity of blood for mankind had not bin continually afflicted with them if there had bin such a law or that they could have bin prevented by it and tho there were such a law yet more questions would arise about that proximity than any wise man would dare to determine the law can be of no effect unless there be a power to decide the contests arising upon it but the fundamental maxim of the great monarchys is that there can be no interregnum the heir of the crown is in possession as soon as he who did enjoy it is dead le mort as the french say saisit le vif there can be therefore no such law or it serves for nothing if there be judges to interpret the law no man is a king till judgment be given in his favor and he is not king by his own title but by the sentence given by them if there be none the law is merely imaginary and every man may in his own case make it what he pleases he who has a crown in his view and arms in his hand wants nothing but success to make him a king and if he prospers all men are obliged to obey him  it is a folly to say the matter is clear and needs no decision for every man knows that no law concerning private inheritances can be so exactly drawn but many controversys will arise upon it that must be decided by a power to which both partys are subject and the disputes concerning kingdoms are so much the more difficult because this law is no where to be found and the more dangerous because the competitors are for the most part more powerful  again this law must either be general to all mankind or particular to each nation if particular a matter of such importance requires good proof when where how and by whom it was given to every one but the scriptures testifying to the contrary that god gave laws to the jews only and that no such thing as hereditary monarchy according to proximity of blood was prescribed by them we may safely say that god never gave any such law to every particular nor to any nation if he did not give it to any one he did not give it to all for every one is comprehended in all and if no one has it it is impossible that all can have it or that it should be obligatory to all when no man knows or can tell when where and by what hand it was given nor what is the sense of it all which is evident by the various laws and customs of nations in the disposal of hereditary successions and no one of them that we know has to this day bin able to show that the method followed by them is more according to nature than that of others  if our author pretends to be gods interpreter and to give the solution of these doubts i may ask which of the five following ways are appointed by god and then we may examine cases resulting from them    in france turkey and other places the succession comes to the next male in the straight eldest line according to which the son is preferred before the brother of him who last enjoyed the crown as the present king of france before his uncle the duke of orleans and the son of the eldest before the brothers of the eldest as in the case of richard the second of england who was advanced preferably to all the brothers of the black prince his father    others keep to the males of the reigning family yet have more regard to the eldest man than to the eldest line and representation taking no place among them the eldest man is thought to be nearest to the first king and a second son of the person that last reigned to be nearer to him than his grandchild by the eldest son according to which rule any one of the sons of edward the third remaining after his death should have bin preferred before richard the second who was his grandchild    in the two cases beforementioned no manner of regard is had to females who being thought naturally incapable of commanding men or performing the functions of a magistrate are together with their descendents utterly excluded from the supreme as well as from the inferior magistracys and in turkey france and other great kingdoms have no pretense to any title but in some places and particularly in england the advantages of proximity belong to them as well as to males by which means our crown has bin transported to several familys and nations    as in some places they are utterly rejected and in others received simply without any condition so those are not wanting where that of not marrying out of the country or without the consent of the estates is imposed of which sweden is an example    in some places proximity of blood is only regarded whether the issue be legitimate or illegitimate in others bastards are wholly excluded  by this variety of judgments made by several nations upon this point it may appear that tho it were agreed by all that the next in blood ought to succeed yet such contests would arise upon the interpretation and application of the general rule as must necessarily be a perpetual spring of irreconcilable and mortal quarrels  if any man say the rule observed in england is that which god gave to mankind i leave him first to dispute that point with the kings of france and many others who can have no right to the crowns they wear if it be admitted and in the next place to prove that our ancestors had a more immediate communication with god and a more certain knowledge of his will than others who for any thing we know may be of authority equal to them but in the mean time we may rationally conclude that if there be such a rule we have had no king in england for the space of almost a thousand years having not had one who did not come to the crown by a most manifest violation of it as appears by the forecited examples of william the first and second henry the first henry the second and his children john edward the third henry the fourth edward the fourth and his children henry the seventh and all that claim under any of them and if possession or success can give a right it will i think follow that jack straw wat tyler perkin warbeck or any other rascal might have had it if he had bin as happy as bold in his enterprise this is no less than to expose crowns to the first that can seize them to destroy all law and rule and to render right a slave to fortune if this be so a late earl of pembroke whose understanding was not thought great judged rightly when he said his grandfather was a wise man tho he could neither write nor read in as much as he resolved to follow the crown tho it were upon a coalstaff but if this be sufficient to make a wise man it is pity the secret was no sooner discovered since many who for want of it lived and died in all the infamy that justly accompanys knavery cowardice and folly might have gained the reputation of the most excellent men in their several ages the bloody factions with which all nations subject to this sort of monarchy have bin perpetually vexed might have bin prevented by throwing up cross or pile or by battle between the competitors body to body as was done by corbis and orsua cleorestes and polinices ironside and canutus it being most unreasonable or rather impiously absurd for any to venture their lives and fortunes when their consciences are not concerned in the contest and that they are to gain nothing by the victory  if reason teaches that till this expeditious way of ending controversys be received the ambition of men will be apt to imbroil nations in their quarrels and others judging variously of those matters which can be reduced to no certain rule will think themselves in conscience obliged to follow the party that seems to them to be most just experience manifests the same and that ambition has produced more violent mischiefs than all the other desires and passions that have ever possessed the hearts of men that this may appear it will not be amiss to divide these mischiefs into such as proceed from him who is in possession of the power through jealousy of state as they call it to prevent the enterprises of those who would dispossess him and such as arise between competitors contending for it  tarquins counsel concerning the poppys and perianders heads of corn are of the first sort the most eminent are always most feared as the readiest to undertake and most able to accomplish great designs this eminence proceeds from birth riches virtue or reputation and is sometimes wrought up to the greatest height by a conjunction of all these but i know not where to find an example of such a man who could long subsist under absolute monarchy if he be of high birth he must like brutus conceal his virtue and gain no reputation or resolve to perish if he do not prevent his own death by that of the tyrant all other ways are ineffectual the suspicions fears and hatred thereupon arising are not to be removed personal respects are forgotten and such services as cannot be sufficiently valued must be blotted out by the death of those who did them various ways may be taken and pretenses used according to the temper of times and nations but the thing must be done and whether it be colored by a trick of law or performed by a mute with a bowstring imports little henry the fourth was made king by the earl of northumberland and his brave son hotspur edward the fourth by the valiant earl of warwick henry the seventh by stanley but neither of em could think himself safe till his benefactor was dead no continued fidelity no testimonys of modesty and humility can prevent this the modesty of germanicus in rejecting the honors that were offered to him and his industry in quieting the mutinyd legions accelerated his ruin when twas evident he might be emperor if he pleased he must be so or die there was no middle station between the throne and the grave it is probable that caligula nero and other beasts like to them might hate virtue for the good which is in it but i cannot think that either they their predecessors or successors would have put themselves upon the desperate design of extirpating it if they had not found it to be inconsistent with their government and that being once concluded they spared none of their nearest relations artaxerxes killed his son darius herod murdered the best of his wives and all his sons except the worst tiberius destroyed agrippa postuhmus and germanicus with his wife and two sons how highly soever constantine the great be commended he was polluted with the blood of his fatherinlaw wife and son philip the second of spain did in like manner deliver himself from his fears of don carlos and it is not doubted that philip the fourth for the same reasons dispatched his brother don carlos and his son balthazar the like cases were so common in england that all the plantagenets and the noble familys allied to them being extinguished our ancestors were sent to seek a king in one of the meanest in wales  this method being known those who are unwilling to die so tamely endeavor to find out ways of defending themselves and there being no other than the death of the person who is in the throne they usually seek to compass it by secret conspiracy or open violence and the number of princes that have bin destroyed and countries disturbed by those who through fear have bin driven to extremitys is not much less than of those who have suffered the like from men following the impulse of their own ambition  the disorders arising from contests between several competitors before any one could be settled in the possession of kingdoms have bin no less frequent and bloody than those abovementioned and the miserys suffered by them together with the ruin brought upon the empires of macedon and rome may be sufficient to prove it however to make the matter more clear i shall alledg others but because it may be presumption in me to think i know all the historys of the world or tedious to relate all those i know i shall content my self with some of the most eminent and remarkable and if it appears they have all suffered the same mischiefs we may believe they proceed not from accidents but from the power of a permanent cause that always produces the same or the like effects  to begin with france the succession not being well settled in the time of meroveus who had dispossessed the grandchildren of pharamond he was no sooner dead than gillon set up himself and with much slaughter drove his son chilperic out of the kingdom who after a little time returning with like fury is said to have seen a vision first of lions and leopards then of bears and wolves and lastly of dogs and cats all tearing one another to pieces this has bin always accounted by the french hist de france en la vie de chilperic   to be a representation of the nature and fortune of the three races that were to command them and has bin too much verified by experience clovis their first christian and most renowned king having by good means or evil exceedingly enlarged his territorys but chiefly by the murders of alaric and ragnacaire with his children and suborning mezeray and de serres sigismond of metz to kill his father sigebert left his kingdom to be torn in pieces by the rage of his four sons each of em endeavoring to make himself master of the whole and when according to the usual fate of such contests success had crowned clothair who was the worst of em all by the laughter of his brothers and nephews with all the flower of the french and gaulish nobility the advantages of his fortune only resulted to his own person for after his death the miserable nations suffered as much srom the madness of his sons as they had done by himself and his brothers they had learned from their predecessors not to be slow in doing mischief but were farther incited by the rage of two infamous strumpets fredegonde and brunehaud which is a sort of vermin that i am inclined to think has not usually governed senats or popular assemblys chilperic the second who by the slaughter of many persons of the royal blood with infinite numbers of the nobility and people came to be master of so much of the country as procured him the name of king of france killed his eldest son on suspicion he was excited against him by brunehaud and his second lest he should revenge the death of his brother he married fredegonde and was soon after killed by her adulterer landry the kingdom continued in the same misery through the rage of the surviving princes and found no relief tho most of em fell by the sword and that brunehaud who had bin a principal cause of those tragedys was tied to the tails of four wild horses and suffered a death as foul as her life these were lions and leopards they involved the kingdom in desperate troubles but being men of valor and industry they kept up in some measure the reputation and power of the nation and he who attained to the crown defended it but they being fallen by the hands of each other the poisonous root put forth another plague more mortal than their fury the vigor was spent and the succession becoming more settled ten base and slothful kings by the french called les roys faineans succeeded some may say they who do nothing do no hurt but the rule is false in relation to kings he that takes upon him the government of a people can do no greater evil than by doing nothing nor be guilty of a more unpardonable crime than by negligence cowardice voluptuousness and sloth to desert his charge virtue and manhood perish under him good discipline is forgotten justice slighted the laws perverted or rendered useless the people corrupted the public treasures exhausted and the power of the government always falling into the hands of flatterers whores favorites bauds and such base wretches as render it contemptible a way is laid open for all manner of disorders the greatest cruelty that has bin known in the world if accompanied with wit and courage never did so much hurt as this slothful bestiality or rather these slothful beasts have ever bin most cruel the reigns of septimius severus mahomet the second or selim the second were cruel and bloody but their fury was turned against foreigners and some of their near relations or against such as fell under the suspicion of making attempts against them the condition of the people was tolerable those who would be quiet might be safe the laws kept their right course the reputation of the empire was maintained the limits defended and the public peace preserved but when the sword past into the hands of lewd slothful foolish and cowardly princes it was of no power against foreign enemies or the disturbers of domestic peace tho always sharp against the best of their own subjects no man knew how to secure himself against them unless by raising civil wars which will always be srequent when a crown defended by a weak hand is proposed as a prize to any that dare invade it this is a perpetual spring of disorders and no nation was ever quiet when the most eminent men found less danger in the most violent attempts than in submitting patiently to the will of a prince that suffers his power to be managed by vile persons who get credit by flattering him in his vices but this is not all such princes naturally hate and fear those who excel them in virtue and reputation as much as they are inferior to them in fortune and think their persons cannot be secured nor their authority enlarged except by their destruction it is ordinary for them inter scorta and ganeas principibus c tacit viris perniciem machinare and to make cruelty a cover to ignorance and cowardice besides the mischiefs brought upon the public by the loss of eminent men who are the pillars of every state such reigns are always accompanied with tumults and civil wars the great men striving with no less violence who shall get the weak prince into his power when such regard is had to succession that they think it not fit to divest him of the title than when with less respect they contend for the sovereignty it self and whilst this sort of princes reigned france was not less afflicted with the contests between grimbauld ebroin grimoald and others for the mayoralty of the palace than they had bin before by the rage of those princes who had contested for the crown the issue also was the same after many revolutions charles martel gained the power of the kingdom which he had so bravely defended against the saracens and having transmitted it to his son pepin the general assembly of estates with the approbation of mankind conferred the title also upon him this gave the nation ease for the present but the deeprooted evil could not be so cured and the kingdom that by the wisdom valor and reputation of pepin had bin preserved from civil troubles during his life fell as deeply as ever into them so soon as he was dead his sons carloman and charles divided the dominions but in a little time each of them would have all carloman filled the kingdom with tumult raised the lombards and marched with a great army against his brother till his course was interrupted by death caused as is supposed by such helps as princes liberally afford to their aspiring relations charles deprived his two sons of their inheritance put them in prison and we hear no more of them his third brother griffon was not more quiet nor more successful and there could be no peace in gascony italy or germany till he was killed but all the advantages which charles by an extraordinary virtue and fortune had purchased for his country ended with his life he left his son lewis the gentle in possession of the empire and kingdom of france and his grandson bernard king of italy but these two could not agree and bernard falling into the hands of lewis was deprived of his eyes and some time after killed this was not enough to preserve the peace lothair lewis and pepin all three sons to lewis rebeld against him called a council at lions deposed him and divided the empire amongst themselves after five years he escaped from the monastery where he had bin kept renewed the war and was again taken prisoner by lothair when he was dead the war broke out more fiercely than ever between his children lothair the fmperor assaulted lewis king of bavaria and charles king of rhetia was defeated by them and confined to a monastery where he died new quarrels arose between the two brothers upon the division of the countries taken from him and lorrain only was lest to his son lewis died soon after and charles getting possession of the empire and kingdom ended an inglorious reign in an unprosperous attempt to deprive hermingrade daughter to his brother lewis of the kingdom of arles and other places left to her by her father lewis his son called the stutterer reigned two years in much trouble and his only legitimate son charles the simple came not to the crown till after the death of his two bastard brothers lewis and carloman charles le gros and eudes duke of anjou charles le gros was deposed from the empire and kingdom stripped of his goods and left to perish through poverty in an obscure village charles the simple and the nations under him thrived no better robert duke of anjou raised war against him and was crowned at rheims but was himself slain soon after in a bloody battle near soissons his soninlaw hebert earl of vermandois gathered up the remains of his scattered party got charles into his power and called a general assembly of estates who deposed him and gave the crown to raoul duke of burgundy tho he was no otherwise related to the royal blood than by his mother which in france is nothing at all he being dead lewis son to the deposed charles was made king but his reign was as inglorious to him as miserable to his subjects this is the peace which the french enjoyed for the space of five or six ages under their monarchy and it is hard to determine whether they suffered most by the violence of those who possessed or the ambition of others who aspired to the crown and whether the fury of active or the baseness of slothful princes was most pernicious to them but upon the whole matter through the defects of those of the latter sort they lost all they had gained by sweat and blood under the conduct of the former henry and otho of saxony by a virtue like that of charlemagne deprived them of the empire and settled it in germany leaving france only to lewis sirnamd outremer and his son lothair these seemed to be equally composed of treachery cruelty ambition and baseness they were always mutinous and always beaten their frantic passions put em always upon unjust designs and were such plagues to their subjects and neighbors that they became equally detested and despised these things extinguished the veneration due to the memory of pepin and charles and obliged the whole nation rather to seek relief from a stranger than to be ruined by their worthless descendents they had tried all ways that were in their power deposed four crowned kings within the space of a hundred and fifty years crowned five who had no other title than the people conferred upon them and restored the descendents of those they had rejected but all was in vain their vices were incorrigible the mischiefs produced by them intolerable they never ceased from murdering one another in battle or by treachery and bringing the nation into civil wars upon their wicked or foolish quarrels till the whole race was rejected and the crown placed upon the head of hugh capet these mischiess raged not in the same extremity under him and his descendents but the abatement proceeded from a cause no way advantageous to absolute monarchy the french were by their calamitys taught more strictly to limit the regal power and by turning the dukedoms and earldoms into patrimonys which had bin offices gave an authority to the chief of the nobility by which that of kings was curbed and tho by this means the commonalty were exposed to some pressures yet they were small in comparison of what they had suffered in sormer times when many great men had estates of their own that did not depend upon the will of kings they grew to love their country and tho they cheerfully served the crown in all cases of public concernment they were not easily engaged in the personal quarrels of those who possessed it or had a mind to gain it to preserve themselves in this condition they were obliged to use their vassals gently and this continuing in some measure till within the last fifty years the monarchy was less tumultuous than when the kings will had bin less restrained nevertheless they had not much reason to boast there was a root still remaining that from time to time produced poisonous fruit civil wars were frequent among them tho not carried on with such desperate madness as formerly and many of them upon the account of disputes between competitors for the crown all the wars with england since edward the second married isabella daughter and as he pretended heir of philip le bell were of this nature the defeats of crecy poitiers and agincourt with the slaughters and devastations suffered from edward the third the black prince and henry the fifth were merely upon contests for the crown the factions of orleans and burgundy orleans and armagnac proceeded from the same spring and the murders that seem to have bin the immediate causes of those quarrels were only the effects of the hatred growing from their competition the more odious tho less bloody contests between lewis the    th and his father charles the   th with the jealousy of the former against his son charles the   th arose from the same principle charles of bourbon prepared to fill france with fire and blood upon the like quarrel when his designs were overthrown by his death in the assault of rome if the dukes of guise had bin more fortunate they had soon turned the cause of religion into a claim to the crown and repaired the injury done as they pretended to pepins race by destroying that of capet and henry the third thinking to prevent this by the slaughter of henry le balafre and his brother the cardinal de guise brought ruin upon himself and cast the kingdom into a most horrid confusion our own age furnishes us with more than one attempt of the same kind attended with the like success the duke of orleans was several times in arms against lewis the    th his brother the queen mother drew the spaniards to favor him montmorency perished in his quarrel fontrailles revived it by a treaty with spain which struck at the kings head as well as the cardinals and was suppressed by the death of cinq mars and de thou those who understand the affairs of that kingdom make no doubt that the count de soissons would have set up for himself and bin followed by the best part of france if he had not bin killed in the pursuit of his victory at the battle of sedan since that time the kingdom has suffered such disturbances as show that more was intended than the removal of mazarin and the marechal de turenne was often told that the check he gave to the prince of conde at gien after he had defeated hocquincourt had preserved the crown upon the kings head and to testify the stability good order and domestic peace that accompanys absolute monarchy we have in our own days seen the house of bourbon often divided within it self the duke of orleans the count de soissons and the princes of conde and conti in war against the king the dukes of angoulesme vendome longueville the count de moret and other bastards of the royal family following their example the houses of guise d elbeuf bouillon nemours rochefocault and almost all the most eminent in france with the parliaments of paris bourdeaux and some others joining with them i might alledg many more examples to show that this monarchy as well as all others has from the first establishment bin full of blood and slaughter through the violence of those who possessed the crown and the ambition of such as aspired to it and that the end of one civil war has bin the beginning of another but i presume upon the whole these will be thought sufficient to prove that it never enjoyed any permanent domestic quiet  the kingdoms of spain have bin no less disturbed by the same means but especially that of castile where the kings had more power than in other places to cite all the examples were to transcribe their historys but whoever has leisure to examine them will find that after many troubles alphonso the second notwithstanding his glorious surname of wise was deposed by means of his ambitious son don alonso sirnamd el desheredado supplanted by his uncle don sancho el bravo peter the cruel cast from the throne and killed by his bastard brother the conde de trastamara from the time of the abovenamed alphonso to that of ferdinand and isabella containing about two hundred years so few of them past without civil wars that i hardly remember two together that were free from them and whosoever pretends that of late years that monarchy has bin more quiet must if he be ingenuous confess their peace is rather to be imputed to the dexterity of removing such persons as have bin most likely to raise disturbances of which number were don john of austria don carlos son to philip the second another of the same name son to philip the third and don belthazar son to philip the fourth than to the rectitude of their constitutions  he that is not convinced of these truths by what has bin said may come nearer home and see what mischiefs were brought upon scotland buchan de reb scot by the contests between baliol and bruce with their consequences till the crown came to the stuart family the quiet reigns and happy drummond melvil deaths of the five jamess together with the admirable stability and peace of the government under queen mary and the perfect union in which she lived with her husband son and people as well as the happiness of the nation whilst it lasted  but the miserys of england upon the like occasions surpass all william the norman was no sooner dead but the nation was rent in pieces by his eldest son robert contesting with his younger sons william and henry for the crown they being all dead and their sons the like happened between stephen and maud henry the second was made king to terminate all disputes but it proved a fruitless expedient such as were more scandalous and not less dangerous did soon arise between him and his sons who besides the evils brought upon the nation vexed him to death by their rebellion the reigns of john and henry the third were yet more tempestuous edward the seconds lewd foolish infamous and detestable government ended in his deposition and death to which he was brought by his wife and son edward the third employed his own and his subjects valor against the french and scots but whilst the foundations were out of order the nation could never receive any advantage by their victorys all was calculated for the glory and turned to the advantage of one man he being dead all that the english held in scotland and in france was lost through the baseness of his successor with more blood than it had bin gained and the civil wars raised by his wickedness and madness ended as those of edward the second had done the peace of henry the fourths reign was interrupted by dangerous civil wars and the victory obtained at shrewsbury had not perhaps secured him in the throne if his death had not prevented new troubles henry the fisth acquired such reputation by his virtue and victorys that none dared to invade the crown during his life but immediately after his death the storms prepared against his family broke out with the utmost violence his sons weakness encouraged richard duke of york to set up a new title which produced such mischiefs as hardly any people have suffered unlefs upon the like occasion for besides the slaughter of many thousands of the people and especially of those who had bin accustomed to arms the devastation of the best parts of the kingdom and the loss of all that our kings had inherited in france or gained by the blood of their subjects fourscore princes of the blood as philip de commines calls them died in battle or under the hand of the hangman many of the most noble familys were extinguished others lost their most eminent men three kings and two presumptive heirs of the crown were murdered and the nation brought to that shameful exigence to set up a young man to reign over them who had no better cover for his sordid extraction than a welsh pedigree that might show how a tailor was descended from prince arthur cadwallader and brutus but the wounds of the nation were not to be healed with such a plaster he could not rely upon a title made up of such stuff and patched with a marriage to a princess of a very questionable birth his own meanness inclined him to hate the nobility and thinking it to be as easy for them to take the crown from him as to give it to him he industriously applied himself to glean up the remainders of the house of york from whence a competitor might arise and by all means to crush those who were most able to oppose him this exceedingly weakened the nobility who held the balance between him and the commons and was a great step toward the dissolution of our ancient government but he was so far from settling the kingdom in peace that such rascals as perkin warbeck and simnel were able to disturb it the reign of henry the eighth was turbulent and bloody that of mary furious and such as had brought us into subjection to the most powerful proud and cruel nation at that time in the world if god had not wonderfully protected us nay edward the sixth and queen elizabeth notwithstanding the natural excellency of their dispositions and their knowledge of the truth in matters of religion were forced by that which men call jealousy of state to foul their hands so often with illustrious blood that if their reigns deserve to be accounted amongst the most gentle of monarchys they were more heavy than the government of any commonwealth and yet their lives were never secure against such as conspired against them upon the account of title  having in some measure showed what miserys have bin usually if not perpetually brought upon nations subject to monarchys by the violence of some princes and the baseness folly and cowardice of others together with what they have suffered in contests for the several crowns whilst men divided into diverse factions strive with as much vehemence to advance the person they favor as if they or their country were interested in the quarrel and fight as fiercely for a master as they might reasonably do to have none i am not able to determine which of the two evils is the most mortal it is evident the vices of princes result to the damage of the people but whether pride and cruelty or stupidity and sloth be the worst i cannot tell all monarchys are subject to be afflicted with civil wars but whether the most frequent and bloody do arise from the quarrels of diverse competitors for crowns before any one gain the possession of them or afterward through the fears of him that would keep what he has gained or the rage of those who would wrest it from him is not so easily decided but commonwealths are less troubled with those distempers women children or such as are notoriously foolish or mad are never advanced to the supreme power whilst the laws and that discipline which nourishes virtue is in force men of wisdom and valor are never wanting and every man desires to give testimony of his virtue when he knows twill be rewarded with honor and power if unworthy persons creep into magistracys or are by mistake any way preferred their vices for the most part turn to their own hurt and the state cannot easily receive any great damage by the incapacity of one who is not to continue in office above a year and is usually encompast with those who having born or are aspiring to the same are by their virtue able to supply his defects cannot hope for a reward from one unable to corrupt em and are sure of the favor of the senate and people to support em in the defense of the public interest as long as this good order continues private quarrels are suppressed by the authority of the magistrate or prove to be of little effect such as arise between the nobles and commons frequently produce good laws for the maintenance of liberty as they did in rome for above three hundred years after the expulsion of tarquin and almost ever terminate with little or no blood sometimes the errors of one or both partys are discovered by the discourse of a wise and good man and those who have most violently opposed one another become the best friends every one joining to remove the evil that causes the division when the senate and people of rome seemed to be most furiously incensed against each other the creation of tribuns communication of honors and marriages between the patrician and plebeian familys or the mitigation of usury composed all and these were not only harmless things but such as gave opportunitys of correcting the defects that had bin in the first constitution of the government without which they could never have attained to the greatness glory and happiness they afterward enjoyed such as had seen that people meeting in tumult running through the city crying out against the kings consuls senate or decemviri might have thought they would have filled all with blood and slaughter but no such thing happened they desired no more than to take away the kingdom which tarquin had wickedly usurped and never went about so much as to punish one minister of the mischiefs he had done or to take away his goods till upon pretense of treating his ambassadors by a new treachery had cast the city into greater danger than ever tho the decemviri had by the like villanys equally provoked the people they were used with the like gentleness appius t live l   claudius and oppius having by voluntary death subtracted themselves from public punishment their colleagues were only banished and the magistracys of the city reduced to the former order without the effusion of more blood they who contended for their just rights were satisfied with the recovery of them whereas such as follow the impulse of an unruly ambition never think themselves safe till they have destroyed all that seem able to disturb them and satiated their rage with the blood of their adversarys this makes as well as shows the difference between the tumults of rome or the secession of the common people to mount aventine and the battles of towton teuxbury eveshal jews hexham barnet st albans and bosworth it is in vain to say these ought rather to be compared to those of pharsalia actium or philippi sor when the laws of a commonwealth are abolished the name also ceases whatever is done by force or fraud to set up the interests and lusts of one man in opposition to the laws of his country is purely and absolutely monarchical whatsoever past between marius sylla cinna catiline caesar pompey crassus augustus antonius and lepidus is to be imputed to the contests that arise between competitors for monarchy as well as those that in the next age happened between galba otho vitellius and vespasian or which is worse whereas all men in commonwealths fight for themselves when there is occasion and if they succeed enjoy the fruits of their victory so as even those who remain of the vanquished party partake of the liberty thereby established or the good laws thereupon made such as followed the ensigns of those men who sought to set up themselves did rather like beasts than men hazard and suffer many unspeakable evils to purchase misery to themselves and their posterity and to make one their master who increasing in pride avarice and cruelty was to be thrown down again with as much blood as he had bin set up  these things if i mistake not being in the last degree evident i may leave to our author all the advantages he can gain by his rhetorical description of the tumults of rome when blood was in the marketplace sucked up with sponges and the jakes stuffed with carcases to which he may add the crimes of syllas life and the miserys of his death but withal i desire to know what number of sponges were sufficient to suck up the blood of five hundred thousand men slain in one day when the houses of david and jeroboam contended for the crown of israel or of four hundred thousand who fell in one battle between joash and amaziah on the same occasion what jakes were capacious enough to contain the carcases of those that perished in the quarrels between the successors of alexander the several competiors for the roman empire or those which happened in france spain england and other places upon the like occasions if sylla for some time acted as an absolute monarch it is no wonder that he died like one or that god punished him as herod philip the second of spain and some others because the hand of his fellowcitizens had unjustly spared him if when he was become detestable to god and man he became also miserable his example ought to deter others srom the crimes that are avenged by a power which none can escape and to encourage those who defend or endeavor to recover their violated libertys to act vigorously in a cause that god dos evidently patronize  sect xxv courts are more subject to venality and corruption than popular governments tho courtflatterers impute many evils to popular governments they no way deserve i could not think any so impudent as to lay corruption and venality to their charge till i found it in our author they might in my opinion have taken those faults upon themselves since they certainly abound most where bawds whores buffoons players slaves and other base people who are naturally mercenary are most prevalent and whosoever would know whether this dos more frequently befall commonwealths than monarchys especially if they are absolute need only to inquire whether the cornelii junii fabii valerii quintii curii fabritii and others who most prevailed in rome after the expulsion of the kings or sejanus macro narcissus pallas icetus tigellinus vinnius laco agrippina messalina lollia poppaea and the like were most subject to those base vices whether it were more easy to corrupt one or two of those villains and strumpets or the senats and people of rome carthage athens and sparta and whether that sort of rabble had more power over the princes they served than such as most resembled them had whilst the popular government continued it is in vain to say those princes were wicked and vile for many others are so likewise and when the power is in the hands of one man there can be no assurance he will not be like them nay when the power is so placed ill men will always find opportunitys of compassing their desires bonus cautus optimus imperator venditur said dioclesian and tho he was no unwise man yet that which principally induced him to renounce the empire was the impossibility he found of defending himself against those that were in credit with him who daily betrayed and sold him they see with the eyes of other men and cannot resist the frauds that are perpetually put upon them antoninus pius and marcus aurelius seem to have bin the best and wisest of all the roman emperors but the two faustinas had such an ascendent over them as was most shameful to their persons and mischievous to the empire and the best men in it such as these may gain too much upon the affections of one man in the best regulated government but that could be of no great danger to the public when many others equal or not much inferior to him in authority are ready to oppose whatever he should endeavor to promote by their impulse but there is no remedy when all depends upon the will of a single person who is governed by them there was more of acuteness and jest than of truth in that saying of themistocles that his little boy had more power than any man in greece for he governed his mother she him he athens and athens greece for he himself was found to have little power when for private passions and concernments he departed from the interest of the public and the like has bin found in all places that have bin governed in the like manner  again corruption will always reign most where those who have the power do most favor it where the rewards of such crimes are greatest easiest and most valued and where the punishment of them is least seared    for the first we have already proved that liberty cannot be preserved if the manners of the people are corrupted nor absolute monarchy introduced where they are sincere which is sufficient to show that those who manage free governments ought always to the utmost of their power to oppose corruption because otherwise both they and their government must inevitably perish and that on the other hand the absolute monarch must endeavor to introduce it because he cannot subsist without it it is also so natural for all such monarchs to place men in power who pretend to love their persons and will depend upon their pleasure that possibly twould be hard to find one in the world who has not made it the rule of his government and this is not only the way to corruption but the most dangerous of all for tho a good man may love a good monarch he will obey him only when he commands that which is just and no one can engage himself blindly to do whatever he is commanded without renouncing all virtue and religion because he knows not whether that which shall be commanded is consistent with either or directly contrary to the laws of god and man but if such a monarch be evil and his actions such as they are too osten found to be whoever bears an affection to him and seconds his designs declares himself an enemy to all that is good and the advancement of such men to power dos not only introduce foment and increase corruption but fortifys it in such a manner that without an entire renovation of that state it cannot be removed ill men may possibly creep into any government but when the worst are placed nearest to the throne and raised to honors for being so they will with that force endeavor to draw all men to a conformity of spirit with themselves that it can no otherwise be prevented than by destroying them and the principle in which they live    to the second man naturally follows that which is good or seems to him to be so hence it is that in wellgoverned states where a value is put upon virtue and no one honored unless for such qualitys as are beneficial to the public men are from the tenderest years brought up in a belief that nothing in this world deserves to be sought after but such honors as are acquired by virtuous actions by this means virtue it self becomes popular as in sparta rome and other places where riches which with the vanity that follows them and the honors men give to them are the root of all evil were either totally banished or little regarded when no other advantage attended the greatest riches than the opportunity of living more sumptuously or deliciously men of great spirits slighted them when aristippus told cleanthes that if he would go to court and flatter the tyrant he need not seek his supper under a hedge the philosopher answered that he who could content himself with such a supper neednot go to court or flatter the tyrant epaminondas aristides phocion and even the lacedemonian kings found no inconvenience in poverty whilst their virtue was honored and the richest princes in the world feared their valor and power it was not difficult for curious fabricius cincinnatus or emilius paulus to content themselves with the narrowest fortune when it was no obstacle to them in the pursuit of those honors which their virtues deserved twas in vain to think of bribing a man who supped upon the coleworts of his own garden he could not be gained by gold who did not think it necessary he that could rise from the plow to the triumphal chariot and contentedly return thither again could not be corrupted and he that left the sense of his poverty to his executors who found not wherewith to bury him might leave macedon and greece to the pillage of his soldiers without taking to himself any part of the booty but when luxury was brought into fashion and they came to be honored who lived magnificently tho they had in themselves no qualitys to distinguish them from the basest of slaves the most virtuous men were exposed to scorn if they were poor and that poverty which had bin the mother and nurse of their virtue grew insupportable the poet well understood what effect this change had upon the world who said nullum crimen abest facinusque libidinis ex quo paupertas romana perit juven when riches grew to be necessary the desire of them which is the spring of all mischief followed they who could not obtain honors by the noblest actions were obliged to get wealth or purchase them from whores and villains who exposed them to sale and when they were once entered into this track they soon learned the vices of those from whom they had received their preferment and to delight in the ways that had brought them to it when they were come to this nothing could stop them all thought and remembrance of good was extinguished they who had bought the commands of armies or provinces from icetus or narcissus sought only how to draw money from them to enable them to purchase higher dignitys or gain a more assured protection from those patrons this brought the government of the world under a most infamous traffic and the treasures arising from it were for the most part dissipated by worse vices than the rapine violence and fraud with which they had bin gotten the authors of those crimes had nothing left but their crimes and the necessity of committing more through the indigence into which they were plunged by the extravagance of their expenses these things are inseparable from the life of a courtier for as servile natures are guided rather by sense than reason such as addict themselves to the service of courts find no other consolation in their misery than what they receive from sensual pleasures or such vanitys as they put a value upon and have no other care than to get money for their supply by begging stealing bribing and other infamous practices their offices are more or less esteemed according to the opportunitys they afford for the exercise of these virtues and no man seeks them for any other end than for gain nor takes any other way than that which conduces to it the usual means of attaining them are by observing the princes humor flattering his vices serving him in his pleasures fomenting his pasions and by advancing his worst designs to create an opinion in him that they love his person and are entirely addicted to his will when valor industry and wisdom advanced men to offices it was no easy matter for a man to persuade the senate he had such qualitys as were required if he had them not but when princes seek only such as love them and will do what they command it is easy to impose upon them and because none that are good will obey them when they command that which is not so they are always encompast by the worst those who follow them only for reward are most liberal in professing affection to them and by that means rise to places of authority and power the fountain being thus corrupted nothing that is pure can come from it these mercenary wretches having the management of affairs justice and honors are set at a price and the most lucrative traffic in the world is thereby established  nunc uberiore rapina pecct in orb manus claud  eutropius when he was a slave used to pick pockets and locks but being made a minister he sold citys armies and provinces and some have undertaken to give probable reasons to believe that pallas one of claudiuss manumisd slaves by these means brought together more wealth in six years than all the roman dictators and consuls had done from the expulsion of the kings to their passage into asia the rest walked in the same way used the same arts and many of them succeeded in the same manner their riches consisted not os spoils taken from enemies but were the base product of their own corruption they valued nothing but money and those who could bribe them were sure to be advanced to the highest offices and whatever they did feared no punishment like effects will ever proceed from the like causes when vanity luxury and prodigality are in fashion the desire of riches must necessarily increase in proportion to them and when the power is in the hands of base mercenary persons they will always to use the courtiers phrase make as much profit of their places as they can not only matters of favor but of justice too will be exposed to sale and no way will be open to honors or magistracys but by paying largely for them he that gets an office by these means will not execute it gratis he thinks he may sell what he has bought and would not have entered by corrupt ways if he had not intended to deal corruptly nay if a wellmeaning man should suffer himself to be so far carried away by the stream of a prevailing custom as to purchase honors of such villains he would be obliged to continue in the same course that he might gain riches to procure the continuance of his benefactors protection or to obtain the favor of such as happen to succeed them and the corruption thus beginning in the head must necessarily diffuse it self into all the members of the commonwealth or if any one which is not to be expected after having bin guilty of one villainy should resolve to commit no more it could have no other effect than to bring him to ruin and he being taken away all things would return to their former channel  besides this whosoever desires to advance himself must use such means as are suitable to the time in which he lives and the humor of the persons with whom he is to deal it had bin as absurd for any man void of merit to set himself up against junius brutus cincinnatus papirius cursor camillus fabius maximus or scipio and by bribing the senate and people of rome think to be chosen captain against the tarquins tuscans latins samnites gauls or carthaginians as for the most virtuous men by the most certain proofs of their wisdom experience integrity and valor to expect advancement from caligula claudius and nero or the lewd wretches that governed them they hated and feared all those that excelled in virtue and setting themselves to destroy the best for being the best they placed the strength of the government in the hands of the worst which produced the effects beforementioned this seems to have bin so well known that no man pretended to be great at court but those who had cast off all thoughts of honor and common honesty revertar cum leno meretrix scurra cinaedus ero said one who saw what manners prevailed there and wheresoever they do prevail such as will rise must render themselves conformable in all corruption and venality and it may be observed that a noble person now living amongst us who is a great enemy to bribery was turned out from a considerable office as a scandal to the court for said the principal minister he will make no profit of his place and by that means casts a scandal upon those that do  if any man say this is not generally the fate of all courts i confess it and that if the prince be just virtuous wise of great spirit and not pretending to be absolute he may choose such men as are not mercenary or take such a course as may render it hard for them to deserve bribes or to preserve themselves from punishment if they should deflect from his intention and a prince of this age speaking familiarly with some great men about him said he had heard much of vast gains made by those who were near to princes and asked if they made the like one of them answered that they were as willing as others to get something but that no man would give them a farthing for every one finding a free admittance to his majesty no man needed a solicitor and it was no less known that he did of himself grant those things that were just than that none of them had so much credit as to promote such as were not so i will not say such a king is a phoenix perhaps more than one may be found in an age but they are certainly rare and all that is good in their government proceeding from the excellency of their personal virtues it must fail when that virtue fails which was the root of it experience shows how little we can rely upon such a help for where crowns are hereditary children seldom prove like to their fathers and such as are elective have also their defects many seem to be modest and innocent in private fortunes who prove corrupt and vicious when they are raised to power the violence pride and malice of saul was never discovered till the people had placed him in the throne but where the government is absolute or the prince endeavors to make it so this integrity can never be found he will always seek such as are content to depend upon his will which being always unruly good men will never comply ill men will be paid for it and that opens a gap to all manner of corruption something like to this may befall regular monarchys or popular governments they who are placed in the principal offices of trust may be treacherous and when they are so they will always by these means seek to gain partisans and dependents upon themselves their designs being corrupt they must be carried on by corruption but such as would support monarchy in its regularity or popular governments must oppose it or be destroyed by it and nothing can better manifest how far absolute monarchys are more subject to this venality and corruption than the regular and popular governments than that they are rooted in the principle of the one which cannot subsist without them and are so contrary to the others that they must certainly perish unless they defend themselves from them  if any man be so far of another opinion as to believe that brutus camillus scipio fabius hannibal pericles aristides agesilaus epaminondas or pelopidas were as easily corrupted as sejanus tigellinus vinnius or laco that the senate and people of rome carthage athens sparta or thebes were to be bought at as easy rates as one profligate villain a slave an eunuch or a whore or tho it was not in former ages yet it is so now he may be pleased to consider by what means men now rise to places of judicature churchpreferment or any offices of trust honor or profit under those monarchys which we know that either are or would be absolute let him examine how all the offices of justice are now disposed in france how mazarin came to be advanced what traffic he made of abbys and bishoprics and what treasures he gained by that means whether the like has not continued since his death and as a laudable example bin transmitted to us since his majestys happy restoration whether bauds whores thieves buffoons parasites and such vile wretches as are naturally mercenary have not more power at whitehall versailles the vatican and the escurial than in venice amsterdam and switzerland whether hde arlngtn dnby their graces of cleveland and portsmouth sndrlnd jenkins or chiffinch could probably have attained such power as they have had amongst us if it had bin disposed by the suffrages of the parliament and people or lastly whether such as know only how to work upon the personal vices of a man have more influence upon one who happens to be born in a reigning family or upon a senate consisting of men chosen for their virtues and quality or the whole body of a nation  but if he who possesses or affects an absolute power be by his interest led to introduce that corruption which the people senate and magistrates who uphold popular governments abhor as that which threatens them with destruction if the example arts and means used by him and his dependents be of wonderful efficacy toward the introduction of it if nothing but an admirable virtue which can hardly be in one that enjoys or desires such a power can divert him from that design and if such virtue never did nor probably ever will continue long in any one family we cannot rationally believe there ever was a race of men invested with or possessing such a power or that there will ever be any who have not and will not endeavor to introduce that corruption which is so necessary for the defense of their persons and most important concernments and certainly accomplish their great design unless they are opposed or removed  sect xxvi civil tumults and wars are not the greatest evils that befall nations but skin for skin says our author and all that a man has will he give for his life and since it was necessary to grace his book with some scripturephrases none could be fitter for that purpose than those that were spoken by the devil but they will be of little use to him for tho i should so far recede from truth as to avow those words to be true i might safely deny the conclusions he draws from them that those are the worst governments under which most men are slain or that more are slain in popular governments than in absolute monarchys for having proved that all the wars and tumults that have happened in commonwealths have never produced such slaughters as were brought upon the empires of macedon and rome or the kingdoms of israel judah france spain scotland or england by contests between several competitors for those crowns if tumult war and slaughter be the point in question those are the worst of all governments where they have bin most frequent and cruel but tho these are terrible scourges i deny that government to be simply the worst that has most of them it is ill that men should kill one another in seditions tumults and wars but it is worse to bring nations to such misery weakness and baseness as to have neither strength nor courage to contend for any thing to have nothing left worth defending and to give the name of peace to desolation i take greece to have bin happy and glorious when it was full of populous citys flourishing in all the arts that deserve praise among men when they were courted and feared by the greatest kings and never assaulted by any but to his own loss and confusion when babylon and susa trembled at the motion of their arms and their valor exercised in these wars and tumults which our author looks upon as the greatest evils was raised to such a power that nothing upon earth was found able to resist them and i think it now miserable when peace reigns within their empty walls and the poor remains of those exhausted nations sheltering themselves under the ruins of the desolated citys have neither any thing that deserves to be disputed amongst them nor spirit or force to repel the injurys they daily suffer from a proud and insupportable master  the like may be said of italy whilst it was inhabited by nations governing themselves by their own will they fell sometimes into domestic seditions and had frequent wars with their neighbors when they were free they loved their country and were always ready to fight in its defense such as succeeded well increased in vigor and power and even those that were the most unfortunate in one age found means to repair their greatest losses if their government continued whilst they had a propriety in their goods they would not suffer the country to be invaded since they knew they could have none if it were lost this gave occasion to wars and tumults but it sharpened their courage kept up a good discipline and the nations that were most exercised by them always increased in power and number so that no country seems ever to have bin of greater strength than italy was when hannibal invaded it and after his defeat the rest of the world was not able to refist their valor and power they sometimes killed one another but their enemies never got any thing but buryingplaces within their territorys all things are now brought into a very different method by the blessed governments they are under the fatherly care of the king of spain the pope and other princes has established peace amongst them we have not in many ages heard of any sedition among the latins sabins volsci equi samnites or others the thin halfstarvd inhabitants of walls supported by ivy sear neither popular tumults or foreign alarms and their sleep is only interrupted by hunger the cries of their children or the howling of wolves instead of many turbulent contentious citys they have a few scattered silent cottages and the fierceness of those nations is so tempered that every rascally collector of taxes extorts without fear from every man that which should be the nourishment of his family and if any of those countries are free from that pernicious vermin it is through the extremity of their poverty even in rome a man may be circumvented by the fraud of a priest or poisoned by one who would have his estate wife whore or child but nothing is done that looks like tumult or violence the governors do as little fear gracchus as hannibal and instead of wearying their subjects in wars they only seek by perverted laws corrupt judges false witnesses and vexatious suits to cheat them of their money and inheritance this is the best part of their condition where these arts are used there are men and they have something to lose but for the most part the lands ly wast and they who were sormerly troubled with the disorders incident to populous citys now enjoy the quiet and peaceable estate of a wilderness  again there is a way of killing worse than that of the sword for as tertullian says upon a different occasion prohibere nasci est occidere those governments are in the highest degree guilty of blood which by taking from men the means of living bring some to perish through want drive others out of the country and generally dissuade men from marriage by taking from them all ways of subsisting their familys notwithstanding all the seditions of florence and other citys of tuscany the horrid factions of guelphs and gibelins neri and bianchi nobles and commons they continued populous strong and exceeding rich but in the space of less than a hundred and fifty years the peaceable reign of the medices is thought to have destroyed nine parts in ten of the people of that province amongst other things it is remarkable that when philip the second of spain gave sienna to the duke of florence his ambassador then at rome sent him word that he had given away more than six hundred and fifty thousand subjects and it is not believed there are now twenty thousand souls inhabiting that city and territory pisa pistoia arezzo cortona and other towns that were then good and populous are in the like proportion diminished and florence more than any when that city had bin long troubled with seditions tumults and wars for the most part unprosperous they still retained such strength that when charles the eighth of france being admitted as a friend with his whole army which guicciard soon after conquered the kingdom of naples thought to master them the people taking up arms struck such a terror into him that he was glad to depart upon such conditions as they thought fit to impose machiavel reports that in that time florence alone with the vald arno a small territory belonging to that city could in a few hours by the sound of a bell bring together a hundred and thirty five thousand well armed men whereas now that city with all the others in that province are brought to such despicable weakness emptiness poverty and baseness that they can neither resist the oppressions of their own prince nor defend him or themselves if they were assaulted by a foreign enemy the people are dispersed or destroyed and the best familys sent to seek habitations in venice genoa rome and lucca this is not the effect of war or pestilence they enjoy a perfect peace and suffer no other plague than the government they are under but he who has thus cured em of disorders and tumults dos in my opinion deserve no greater praise than a physician who should boast there was not a sick person in a house committed to his care when he had poisoned all that were in it the spaniards have established the like peace in the kingdoms of naples and sicily the westindys and other places the turks by the same means prevent tumults in their dominions and they are of such efficacy in all places that mario chigi brother to pope alexander the seventh by one sordid cheat upon the sale of corn is said within eight years to have destroyed above a third part of the people in the ecclesiastical state and that country which was the strength of the romans in the time of the carthaginian wars suffered more by the covetousness and fraud of that villain than by all the defeats received from hannibal  twere an endless work to mention all the places where this peaceable solitude has bin introduced by absolute monarchy but popular and regular governments have always applied themselves to increase the number strength power riches and courage of their people by providing comfortable ways of subsistence for their own citizens inviting strangers and filling them all with such a love to their country that every man might look upon the public cause as his own and be always ready to defend it this may sometimes give occasion to tumults and wars as the most vigorous bodies may fall into distempers when every one is solicitous for the public there may be difference of opinion and some by mistaking the way may bring prejudice when they intend profit but unless a tyrant dos arise and destroy the government which is the root of their felicity or they be overwhelmed by the irresistible power of a virtue or fortune greater than their own they soon recover and for the most part rise up in greater glory and prosperity than before this was seen in the commonwealths of greece and italy which for this reason were justly called nurserys of virtue and their magistrates preservers of men whereas our authors peacemaking monarchs can deserve no better title than that of enemies and destroyers of mankind  i cannot think him in earnest when he exaggerates syllas crueltys as a proof that the mischiefs suffered under free states are more universal than under kings and tyrants for there never was a tyrant in the world if he was not one tho through weariness infirmity of body fear or perhaps the horror of his own wickedness he at length resigned his power but the evil had taken root so deep that it could not be removed there was nothing of liberty remaining in rome the laws were overthrown by the violence of the sword the remaining contest was who should be lord and there is no reason to believe that if pompey had gained the battle of pharsalia he would have made a more modest use of his victory than caesar did or that rome would have bin more happy under him than under the other his cause was more plausible because the senate followed him and caesar was the invader but he was no better in his person and his designs seem to have bin the same he had bin long before suarum legum auctor and eversor he gave the beginning to the first triumvirat and twere folly to think that he who had bin insolent when he was not come to the highest pitch of fortune would have proved moderate if success had put all into his hands the proceedings of marius cinna catiline octavius and antonius were all of the same nature no laws were observed no public good intended the ambition of private persons reigned and whatsoever was done by them or for their interests can no more be applied to popular aristocratical or mixed governments than the furys of caligula and nero  sect xxvii the mischiefs and crueltys proceeding from tyranny are greater than any that can come from popular or mixed governments it is now time to examine the reasons of our authors general maxims the crueltys says he of a tyrant extend ordinarily no farther than some particular men that offend him and not to the whole kingdom it is truly said of his late majesty king james a king can never be so notoriously vicious but he will generally favor justice and maintain some order even cruel domitian dionysius the tyrant and many others are commended in historys as great observers of justice except in particular cases wherein his inordinate lusts may carry him away it may be said of popular governments that tho a people through error do sometimes hurt a private person and that injury may possibly result to the public damage because the man that is offended or destroyed might have bin useful to the society yet they never do it otherwise than by error for having the government in themselves whatever is prejudicial to it is so to them and if they ruin it they ruin themselves which no man ever did willingly and knowingly but in absolute monarchys the matter is quite otherwise a prince that sets up an interest in himself becomes an enemy to the public in following his own lusts he offends all except a few of his corrupt creatures by whose help he oppresses others with a yoke they are unwilling to bear and thereby incurs the universal hatred this hatred is always proportionable to the injurys received which being extreme that must be so too and every people being powerful in comparison to the prince that governs he will always fear those that hate him and always hate those he fears when luigi farnese first duke of parma had by his tyranny incensed the people of that small city their hatred was not less mortal to him than that of the whole empire had bin to nero and as the one burnt rome the other would have destroyed parma if he had not bin prevented the like has bin and will be every where in as much as every man endeavors to destroy those whom he hates and fears and the greatness of the danger often drives this cuncta serit dum cuncta timet lucan fear to rage and madness for this reason caligula wished but one neck to all the people and nero triumphed over the burning city thinking by that ruin he had prevented his own danger i know not who the good authors are that commend domitian for his justice but tacitus calls him principem virtutibus infestum tacit in vit agric and it is hard to find out how such a man can be an observer of justice unless it be just that whoever dares to be virtuous under a vicious and base prince should be destroyed another cum jam semianimem laceraret flavius orbem tertius and calvo serviret roma tyranno juvenal  author of the same time speaking of him dos not say he was unjust but gives us reason to think he was so unless it were just for him who had a power over the best part of the world to destroy it and that he who by his cruelty had brought it to the last gasp would have finished the work if his rage had not bin extinguished  many princes not having in themselves power to destroy their people have stirred up foreign nations against them and placed the only hopes of their safety in the public calamity and lawful kings when they have fall n unto the first degree of madness so as to assume a power above that which was allowed by the law have in fury proved equal to the worst usurpers cleonymus of sparta was of this sort he became says plutarch an enemy to the city because they would not allow him the absole plut vit pyrrh power he affected and brought pyrrhus the fiercest of their enemies with a mighty and excellently well disciplined army to destroy them vortigern the britan called in the saxons with the ruin of his own mat westminster people who were incensed against him for his leudness cruelty and baseness king john for the like reasons offered the kingdom of england to the moors and to the pope peter the cruel and other kings of castile brought vast armies of moors into spain to the ruin of their own people who detested their vices and would not part with their privileges many other examples of the like nature might be alleged and i wish our own experience did not too well prove that such designs are common let him that doubts this examine the causes of the wars with scotland in the years         0 the slaughters of the protestants in ireland      the whole course of alliances and treatys for the space of fourscore years the friendship contracted with the french frequent quarrels with the dutch together with other circumstances that are already made too public if he be not convinced by this he may soon see a man in the throne who had rather be a tributary to france than a lawful king of england whilst either parliament or people shall dare to dispute his commands insist upon their own rights or defend a religion inconsistent with that which he has espoused and then the truth will be so evident as to require no proof  grotius was never accused of dealing hardly with kings or laying too much weight upon imaginary cases nevertheless amongst other reasons that in his opinion justify subjects in taking arms against their princes he de jur bell alleges this propter immanem saevitiam and quando rex in populi exitium fertur in as much as it is contrary to and inconsistent with the ends for which governments are instituted which were most impertinent if no such thing could be for that which is not can have no effect there are therefore princes who seek the destruction of their people or none could be justly opposed on that account  if king james was of another opinion i could wish the course of his government had bin suited to it when he said that whilst he had the power of making judges and bishops he would make that to be law and gospel which best pleased him and accordingly filled those places with such as turned both according to his will and interests i must think that by overthrowing justice which is the rule of civil and moral actions and perverting the gospel which is the light of the spiritual man he left nothing unattempted that he durst attempt by which he might bring the most extensive and universal evils upon our nation that any can suffer this would stand good tho princes never erred unless they were transported with some inordinate lusts for it is hard to find one that dos not live in the perpetual power of them they are naturally subject to the impulse of such appetites as well as others and whatever evil reigns in their nature is fomented by education it is the handle by which their flatterers lead them and he that discovers to what vice a prince is most inclined is sure to govern him by rendering himself subservient in this consists the chief art of a courtier and by this means it comes to pass that such lusts as in private men are curbed by fear do not only rage as in a wild beast but are perpetually inflamed by the malice of their own servants their hatred to the laws of god or men that might restrain them increases in proportion with their vices or their fears of being punished for them when they are come to this they can set no limits to their sury and there is no extravagance into which they do not frequently fall but many of em do not expect these violent motives the perversity of their own nature carrys them to the extremitys of evil they hate virtue for its own sake and virtuous men for being most unlike to themselves virtue is the dictate of reason or the remains of divine light by which men are made beneficent and beneficial to each other religion proceeds from the same spring and tends to the same end and the good of mankind so entirely depends upon these two that no people ever enjoyed any thing worth desiring that was not the product of them and whatsoever any have suffered that deserves to be abhorred and feared has proceeded either from the defect of these or the wrath of god against them if any prince therefore has bin an enemy to virtue and religion he must also have bin an enemy to mankind and most especially to the people under him whatsoever he dos against those that excel in virtue and religion tends to the destruction of the people who subsist by them i will not take upon me to define who they are or to tell the number of those that do this but it is certain there have bin such and i wish i could say they were few in number or that they had lived only in past ages tacitus dos not fix this upon one prince but upon all that he writes of and to give his readers a taste of what he was to write he says that nobility and honors were dangerous but that virtue tacit hst l   brought most certain destruction and in another place that after the slaughter of many excellent men nero resolved to cut down virtue it self and annal l   therefore killed thraseas paetus and bareas soranus and whosoever examins the christian or ecclesiastical historys will find those princes to have bin no less enemies to virtue and religion than their predecessors and consequently enemies to the nations under them unless religion and virtue be things prejudicial or indifferent to mankind  but our author may say these were particular cases and so was the slaughter of the prophets and apostles the crucifixion of christ and all the villanys that have ever bin committed yet they proceeded from a universal principle of hatred to all that is good exerting it self as far as it could to the ruin of mankind and nothing but the overruling power of god who resolved to preserve to himself a people could set bounds to their rage which in other respects had as full success as our author or the devil could have wished  dionysius his other example of justice deserves observation more falsehood leudness treachery ingratitude cruelty baseness avarice impudence and hatred to all manner of good was hardly ever known in in a mortal creature for this reason diogenes seeing him at corinth tho in a poor and contemptible condition said he rather deserved to have continued in the misery fears and villanys of his tyranny than to be suffered peaceably to converse with honest men and if such as these are to be called observers of justice it must be concluded that the laws of god and of men are either of no value or contrary to it and that the destruction of nations is a better work than their preservation no faith is to be observed temples may be justly sacked the best men slain for daring to be better than their masters and the whole world if it were in the power of one man rightly torn in pieces and destroyed  his reasons for this are as good as his doctrine it is says he the multitude of people and abundance of riches that are the glory and strength of every prince the bodies of his subjects do him service in war and their goods supply his wants therefore if not out of affection to his people yet out of natural love unto himself every tyrant desires to preserve the lives and goods of his subjects i should have thought that princes tho tyrants being gods vicegerents and fathers of their people would have sought their good tho no advantage had thereby redounded to themselves but it seems no such thing is to be expected from them they consider nations as grasiers do their herds and flocks according to the profit that can be made of them and if this be so a people has no more security under a prince than a herd or flock under their master tho he desire to be a good husband yet they must be delivered up to the slaughter when he finds a good market or a better way of improving his land but they are often foolish riotous prodigal and wantonly destroy their stock tho to their own prejudice we thought that all princes and magistrates had bin set up that under them we might live quietly and peaceably in all godliness and honesty but our author teaches us that they only seek what they can make of our bodies and goods and that they do not live and reign for us but for themselves if this be true they look upon us not as children but as beasts nor do us any good for our own sakes or because it is their duty but only that we may be useful to them as oxen are put into plentiful pastures that they may be strong for labor or fit for slaughter this is the divine model of government that he offers to the world the just magistrate is the minister of god for our good but this absolute monarch has no other care of us than as our riches and multitude may increase his own glory and strength we might easily judge what would be the issue of such a principle when the being of nations depending upon his will must also depend upon his opinion whether the strength multitude and riches of a people do conduce to the increase of glory and power or not tho historys were silent in the case for these things speak of themselves the judgment of a single man is not to be relied upon the best and wisest do osten err the foolish and perverse always and our discourse is not of what moses or samuel would do but what may come into the fancy of a furious or wicked man who may usurp the supreme power or a child a woman or a fool that may inherit it besides the proposition upon which he builds his conclusion proves often false for as the riches power number and courage of our friends is for our advantage and that of our enemies threatens us with ruin those princes only can reasonably believe the strength of their subjects beneficial to them who govern so as to be assured of their affection and that their strength will be employed for them but those who know they are or justly deserve to be hated cannot but think it will be employed against them and always seek to diminish that which creates their danger this must certainly befall as many as are lewd foolish negligent imprudent cowardly wicked vicious or any way unworthy the places they obtain for their reign is a perpetual exercise of the most extreme and ruinous injustice every man that follows an honest interest is prejudiced every one who finds the power that was ordained for his good to be turned to his hurt will be angry and hate him that dos it if the people be of uncorrupted manners this hatred will be universal because every one of them desires that which is just if composed of good and evil the first will always be averse to the evil government and the others endeavoring to uphold it the safety of the prince must depend upon the prevalence of either party if the best prove to be the strongest he must perish and knowing himself to be supported only by the worst he will always destroy as many of his enemies as he can weaken those that remain enrich his creatures with their spoils and confiscations by fraud and rapine accumulate treasures to increase the number of his party and advance them into all places of power and trust that by their assistance he may crush his adversarys and every man is accounted his adversary who has either estate honor virtue or reputation this naturally casts all the power into the hands of those who have no such dangerous qualitys nor any thing to recommend them but an absolute resignation of themselves to do whatever they are commanded these men having neither will nor knowledge to do good as soon as they come to be in power justice is perverted military discipline neglected the public treasures exhausted new projects invented to raise more and the princes wants daily increasing through their ignorance negligence or deceit there is no end of their devices and tricks to gain supplys to this end swarms of spys informers and false witnesses are sent out to circumvent the richest and most eminent men the tribunals are filled with courtparasites of profligate consciences fortunes and reputation that no man may escape who is brought before them if crimes are wanting the diligence of wellchosen officers and prosecutors with the favor of the judges supply all defects the law is made a snare virtue suppressed vice fomented and in a short time honesty and knavery sobriety and leudness virtue and vice become badges of the several factions and every mans conversation and manners showing to what party he is addicted the prince who makes himself head of the worst must favor them to the overthrow of the best which is so straight a way to an universal ruin that no state can prevent it unless that course be interrupted  these things considered no general judgment can be made of a magistrates counsels from his name or duty he that is just and become grateful to the people by doing good will find his own honor and security in increasing their number riches virtue and power if on the other side by doing evil he has drawn upon himself the public hatred he will always endeavor to take from them the power of doing him any hurt by bringing them into the utmost weakness poverty and baseness and whoever would know whether any particular prince desires to increase or destroy the bodies and goods of his subjects must examine whether his government be such as renders him grateful or odious to them and whether he dos pursue the public interest or for the advancement of his own authority set up one in himself contrary to that of his people which can never befall a popular government and consequently no mischief equal to it can be produced by any such unless something can be imagined worse than corruption and destruction  sect xxviii men living under popular or mixed governments are more careful of the public good than in absolute monarchys our author delighting in strange things dos in the next place with an admirable sagacity discover two faults in popular governments that were never found by any man before him and these are no less than ignorance and negligence speaking of the care of princes to preserve their subjects he adds on the contrary in a popular state every man knows the public good does not wholly depend upon his care but the commonwealth may be well enough governed by others tho he only tend his private business and a little below nor are they much to be blamed for their negligence since it is an even wager their ignorance may be as great the magistrates amongst the people being for the most part annual do always lay down their office before they understand it so as a prince of a duller understanding must needs excel them this is bravely determined and the world is beholden to filmer for the discovery of the errors that have hitherto bin epidemical most men had believed that such as live in free states are usually pleased with their condition desire to maintain it and every man finding his own good comprehended in the public as those that sail in the same ship employs the talent he has in endeavoring to preserve it knowing that he must perish if that miscarry this was an encouragement to industry and the continual labors and dangers to which the romans and other free nations exposed themselves have bin taken for testimonys that they thought themselves concerned in the businesses that past among them and that every one did not neglect them through an opinion that they would be done well enough by others it was also thought that free citys by frequent elections of magistrates became nurserys of great and able men every man endeavoring to excel others that he might be advanced to the honor he had no other title to than what might arise from his merit or reputation in which they succeeded so well that one of them may be justly said to have produced more eminent men than all the absolute monarchys that have bin in the world but these were mistakes perhaps brutus valerius and other roman senators or magistrates for the space of three hundred years might have taken some care of the commonwealth if they had thought it wholly depended upon one of them but believing it would be well enough governed by others they neglected it camillus cincinnatus papirius fabius rullus and maximus scipio africanus amilcar hannibal pericles themistocles alcibiades epaminondas philopemen and others might have proved able men in affairs of war or government but they were removed from their offices before they understood them and must needs be excelled in both by princes tho of duller understanding this may be enough to excuse them for performing their duty so slackly and meanly but it is strange that tacitus and others should so far overlook the reason and so grossly mistake the matter of fact as not only to say that great and excellent spirits failed when liberty was lost and all preferments given to those who were most propense to slavery but that there wanted men tacit annal l   even to write the history inscitia reipublicae ut alienae they never applied themselves to understand affairs depending upon the will of one man in whom they were no otherwise concerned than to avoid the effects of his rage and that was chiefly to be done by not falling under the suspicion of being virtuous this was the study then in request and the most cunning in this art were called scientes temporum no other wisdom was esteemed in that and the ensuing ages and no more was required since the paternal care deep wisdom and profound judgment of the princes provided for all and tho they were of duller understandings they must needs excel other magistrates who having bin created only for a year left their offices before they could understand the dutys of them this was evidenced by that tenderness and sincerity of heart as well as the great purity of manners observed in tiberius the clemency justice solid judgment and frugality of caligula the industry courage and sobriety of claudius the good nature and prudent government of nero the temperance vivacity and diligence of vitellius the liberality of galba and vespasian together with the encouragement given by domitian commodus heliogabalus and many others to all manner of virtues and favors conferred upon those that excelled in them ou author giving such infallible proof of his integrity and understanding by teaching us these things that would never have come into our heads ought surely to be credited tho that which he proposes seems to be most absurd but if we believe such as lived in those times or those who in later ages have perused their writings we cannot but think the princes beforementioned and the greatest part of those who possessed the same places not only to have bin void of all virtue and to have suffered none to grow up under them but in baseness sottishness and malice to have bin equal to the worst of all beasts whilst one prince polluted with ust and blood sat in his grotto at capreae surrounded with an infamous troop of astrologers and others were governed by whores bardaches manumisd slaves and other villains the empire was ruined through their negligence incapacity and wickedness and the city that had flourished in all manner of virtue as much or more than any that has bin yet known in the world produced no more the discipline was dissolved that nourished it no man could hope to advance a public good or obviate an evil by his diligence and valor and he who acquired reputation by either could expect no other reward than a cruel death if germanicus and corbulo who were born when liberty was expiring be brought for examples against the first part of my assertion their ends will justify the latter and no eminent roman family is known to have brought forth a man that deserved to be named in history since their time this is as probable in reason as true in fact men are valiant and industrious when they fight for themselves and their country they prove excellent in all the arts of war and peace when they are bred up in virtuous exercises and taught by their fathers and masters to rejoice in the honors gained by them they love their country when the good of every particular man is comprehended in the public prosperity and the success of their achievements is improved to the general advantage they undertake hazards and labors for the government when it is justly administered when innocence is safe and virtue honored when no man is distinguished from the vulgar but such as have distinguished themselves by the bravery of their actions when no honor is thought too great for those who do it eminently unless it be such as cannot be communicated to others of equal merit they do not spare their persons purses or friends when the public powers are employed for the public benefit and imprint the like affections in their children from their infancy the discipline of obedience in which the romans were bred taught them to command and few were admitted to the magistracys of inferior rank till they had given such proof of their virtue as might deserve the supreme cincinnatus camillus papirius mamercus fabius maximus were not made dictators that they might learn the dutys of the office but because they were judged to be of such wisdom valor integrity and experience that they might be safely trusted with the highest powers and whilst the law reigned not one was advanced to that honor who did not fully answer what was expected from him by this means the city was so replenished with men fit for the greatest employments that even in its infancy when three hundred and six of the fabii quorum neminem says livy ducem sperneret quibuslibet temporibus senatus were killed in one day the city did lament the loss but was not so weakened to give any advantage to their enemies and when every one of those who had bin eminent before the second punic war fabius maximus only excepted had perished in it others arose in their places who surpast them in number and were equal to them in virtue the city was a perpetual spring of such men as long as liberty lasted but that was no sooner overthrown than virtue was torn up by the roots the people became base and sordid the small remains of the nobility slothsul and effeminate and their italian associats becoming like to them the empire whilst it stood was only sustained by the strength os foreigners  the grecian virtue had the same fate and expired with liberty instead of such soldiers as in their time had no equals and such generals of armies and fleets legislators and governors as all succeeding ages have justly admired they sent out swarms of fiddlers jesters chariotdrivers players bawds flatterers ministers of the most impure lusts or idle babbling hypocritical philosophers not much better than they the emperors courts were always crowded with this vermin and notwithstanding the necessity our author imagins that princes must needs understand matters of government better than magistrates annually chosen they did for the most part prove so brutish as to give themselves and the world to be governed by such as these and that without any great prejudice since none could be found more ignorant lewd and base than themselves  it is absurd to impute this to the change of times for time changes nothing and nothing was changed in those times but the government and that changed all things this is not accidental but according to the rules given to nature by god imposing upon all things a necessity of perpetually following their causes fruits are always of the same nature with the seeds and roots from which they come and trees are known by the fruits they bear as a man begets a man and a beast a beast that society of men which constitutes a government upon the foundation of justice virtue and the common good will always have men to promote those ends and that which intends the advancement of one mans desires and vanity will abound in those that will foment them men follow that which seems advantageous to themselves such as are bred under a good discipline and see that all benefits procured to their country by virtuous actions redound to the honor and advantage of themselves their children friends and relations contract from their infancy a love to the public and look upon the common concernments as their own when they have learnt to be virtuous and see that virtue is in esteem they seek no other preferments than such as may be obtained that way and no country ever wanted great numbers of excellent men where this method was established on the other side when it is evident that the best are despised hated or marked out for destruction all things calculated to the humor or advantage of one man who is often the worst or governed by the worst honors riches commands and dignitys disposed by his will and his favor gained only by a most obsequious respect or a pretended affection to his person together with a servile obedience to his commands all applications to virtuous actions will cease and no man caring to render himself or his children worthy of great employments such as desire to have them will by little intrigues corruption scurrility and flattery endeavor to make way to them by which means true merit in a short time comes to be abolished as fell out in rome as soon as the caesars began to reign  he who dos not believe this may see whether the like did not happen in all the other commonwealths of italy and greece or if modern examples are thought to be of more value let him examine whether the noblemen of venice who are born and bred in familys that never knew a master who act for themselves and have a part in all the good or evil that befalls the commonwealth and know that if it be destroyed the must perish or at least that all changes are to their prejudice do neglect the public interests as thinking that the whole not depending upon any one of them things will be well enough governed tho they attend only their private benefit let it be observed whether they do better understand the common concernments than the great men of france or spain who never come to the knowledge of any thing unless they happen to be favored by the king or his ministers and know themselves never to be more miserable than when their master is most prosperous for my own part i cannot think it necessary to alledg any other proo of this point than that when maximilian the emperor lewis the twelfth of france the fierce pope julius the second and ferdinand the subtle and powerful king of spain had by the league of cambray combined against the venetians gained the battle of la ghiradadda taken alviano their paol paruta hist venet guicciard general prisoner deprived them of all their dominion on the terra firma and prepared to assault the city it was under god solely preserved by the vigor and wisdom of their nobility who tho no way educated to war unless by sea sparing neither persons nor purses did with admirable industry and courage first recover padoua and then many other citys o as at the end of that terrible war they came off without any diminution of their territorys whereas portugal having in our age revolted from the house of austria no one doubts that it had bin immediately reduced if the great men of spain had not bin pleased with such a lessening of their masters power and resolved not to repair it by the recovery of that kingdom or to deprive themselves of an easy retreat when they should be oppressed by him or his favorites the like thought was more plainly expressed by the marshall de bassompierre who seeing how hardly rochel was pressed by lewis the    th said je croy quenfin nous serons assez fous pour prendre la rochelle mem de bassomierre he thought they should be such fools to take it but it is believed they would never have bin such fools and the treachery only of our countrymen did enable the cardinal richlieu to do it as for his own glory and the advancement of the popish cause he really intended and nothing is to this day more common in the mouths of their wisest and best men tho papists than the acknowledgment of their own folly in suffering that place to fall the king having by that means gotten power to proceed against them at his pleasure the brave monsieur de turenne is said to have carried this to a greater height in his last discourse to the present king of france you think said he you have armies but you have none the one half of the officers are the bawdy house companions of monsieur de xxx or the creatures of his whore madam de xxx the other half may be men of experience and fit for their employments but they are such as would be pleased with nothing more than to see you lose two or three battles that coming to stand in need of them you might cause them to be better used by your ministers than of late they have bin it may easily be imagined how men in such sentiments do serve their master and nothing is more evident than that the french in this age have had so great advantages that they might have brought europe and perhaps asia under their power if the interest of the nation had bin united to that of the government and the strength vigor and bravery of the nobility employed that way but since it has pleased god to suffer us to fall into a condition of being little able to help our selves and that they are in so good terms with the turk as not to attack him it is our happiness that they do not know their own strength or cannot without ruin to themselves turn it to our prejudice  i could give yet more pregnant testimonys of the difference between men fighting for their own interests in the offices to which they had bin advanced by the votes of numerous assemblys and such as serve for pay and get preferments by corruption or favor if i were not unwilling to stir the spleen of some men by obliging them to reflect upon what has past in our own age and country to compare the justice of our tribunals within the time of our memory and the integrity of those who for a while managed the public treasure the discipline valor and strength of our armies and fleets the increase of our riches and trade the success of our wars in scotland ireland and at sea the glory and reputation not long since gained with that condition into which we are of late fallen but i think i shall offend no wise or good man if i say that as neither the romans nor grecians in the time of their liberty ever performed any actions more glorious than freeing the country from a civil war that had raged in every part the conquest of two such kingdoms as scotland and ireland and crushing the formidable power of the hollanders by sea nor ever produced more examples of valor industry integrity and in all respects complete disinterested unmovable and incorruptible virtue than were at that time seen in our nation so neither of them upon the change of their affairs did exceed us in weakness cowardice baseness venality leudness and all manner of corruption we have reason therefore not only to believe that all princes do not necessarily understand the affairs of their people or provide better for them than those who are otherwise chosen but that as there is nothing of greatness power riches strength and happiness which we might not reasonably have hoped for if we had rightly improved the advantages we had so there is nothing of shame and misery which we may not justly fear since we have neglected them  if any man think that this evil of advancing officers for personal respects favor or corruption is not of great extent i desire him to consider that the officers of state courts of justice church armies fleets and corporations are of such number and power as wholly to corrupt a nation when they themselves are corrupted and will ever be corrupt when they attain to their offices by corruption the good management of all affairs civil military and ecclesiastical necessarily depends upon good order and discipline and it is not in the power of common men to reform abuses patronized by those in authority nor to prevent the mischiefs thereupon ensuing and not having power to direct public actions to the public good they must consequently want the industry and affection that is required to bring them to a good issue the romans were easily beaten under the decemviri tho immediately before the erection and after the extinction of that power none of their neighbors were able to resist them the goths who with much glory had reigned in spain for about three hundred years had neither strength nor courage under their lewd and odious king rodrigo and were in one day subdued with little loss of blood by the saracens and could not in less than eight hundred years free their country from them that brave nation having of late fallen under as base a conduct has now as little heart or power to defend it self courtparasites have rendered valor ridiculous and they who have ever showed themselves as much inclined to arms as any people of the world do now abhor them and are sent to the wars by force laid in carts bound like calves brought to the shambles and left to starve in flanders as soon as they arrive it may easily be judged what service can be expected from such men tho they should happen to be well commanded but the great officers by the corruption of the court think only of enriching themselves and increasing the misery of the soldiers by their frauds both become equally useless to the state  notwithstanding the seeming prosperity of france matters there are not much better managed the warlike temper of that people is so worn out by the frauds and crueltys of corrupt officers that few men list themselves willingly to be soldiers and when they are engaged or forced they are so little able to endure the miserys to which they are exposed that they daily run away from their colors tho they know not whither to go and expect no mercy if they are taken the king has in vain attempted to correct this humor by the severity of martial law but mens minds will not be forced and tho his troops are perfectly well armed clothed and exercised they have given many testimonys of little worth when the prince of conde had by his own valor and the strength of the kings guards broken the first line of the prince of oranges army at the battle of seneff he could not make the second and third line of his own army to advance and reinforce the first by which means he lost all the fair hopes he had conceived of an entire victory not long after the marshall de crequi was abandoned by his whole army near trier who ran away hardly striking a stroke and left him with sixteen horse to shift for himself when monsieur de turenne by the excellency of his conduct and valor had gained such a reputation amongst the soldiers that they thought themselves secure under him he did not suffer such disgraces but he being killed they returned to the usual temper of forced and illusd soldiers half the army was lost in a retreat little differing from a flight and the rest as they themselves confess saved by the bravery of two english regiments the prince of conde was soon after sent to command but he could not with all his courage skill and reputation raise their fallen spirits nor preserve his army any other way than by lodging them in a camp near schlestadt so fortified by art and nature that it could not be forced  to these we may add some examples of our own in our late war the scots foot whether friends or enemies were much inferior to those of the parliament and their horse esteemed as nothing yet in the year      and    0 the kings army tho very numerous excellently armed and mounted and in appearance able to conquer many such kingdoms as scotland being under the conduct of courtiers and affected as men usually are toward those that use them ill and seek to destroy them they could never resist a wretched army commanded by leven but were shamefully beaten at newborn and left the northern countys to be ravaged by them  when van tromp set upon blake in folestonbay the parliament had not above thirteen ships against threescore and not a man that had ever seen any other fight at sea than between a merchantship and a pirat to oppose the best captain in the world attended with many others in valor and experience not much inserior to him many other difficultys were observed in the unsettled state few ships want of money several factions and some who to advance particular interests betrayed the public but such was the power of wisdom and integrity in those that sat at the helm and their diligence in choosing men only for their merit was blessed with such success that in two years our fleets grew to be as famous as our land armies the reputation and power of our nation rose to a greater height than when we possessed the better half of france and the kings of france and scotland were our prisoners all the states kings and potentates of europe most respectfully not to say submissively sought our friendship and rome was more afraid of blake and his fleet than they had bin of the great king of sweden when he was ready to invade italy with a hundred thousand men this was the work of those who if our author says true thought basely of the public concernments and believing things might be well enough managed by others minded only their private affairs these were the effects of the negligence and ignorance of those who being suddenly advanced to offices were removed before they understood the dutys of them these diseases which proceed from popular corruption and irregularity were certainly cured by the restitution of that integrity good order and stability that accompany divine monarchy the justice of the war made against holland in the year      the probity of the gentleman who without partiality or bribery chose the most part of the officers that carried it on the wisdom diligence and valor manifested in the conduct and the glory with which it was ended justifys all that our author can say in its commendation if any doubt remains the subtilty of making the king of france desire that the netherlands might be an accession to his crown the ingenious ways taken by us to facilitate the conquest of them the industry of our ambassadors in diverting the spaniards from entering into the war till it was too late to recover the losses sustained the honorable design upon the smyrna fleet and our frankness in taking the quarrel upon our selves together with the important figure we now make in europe may wholly remove it and in confirmation of our authors doctrine show that princes do better perform the offices that require wisdom industry and valor than annual magistrates and do more seldom err in the choice of officers than senats and popular assemblys  sect xxix there is no assurance that the distempers of a state shall be cured by the wisdom of a prince but says our author the virtue and wisdom of a prince supplys all tho he were of a duller understanding by use and experience he must needs excel all nature age or sex are as it seems nothing to the case a child as soon as he comes to be a king has experience the head of a fool is filled with wisdom as soon as a crown is set upon it and the most vicious do in a moment become virtuous this is more strange than that an ass being trained to a course should outrun the best arabian horse or a hare bred up in an army become more strong and fierce than a lion for fortune dos not only supply all natural defects in princes and correct their vices but gives them the benefit of use and experience when they have none some reasons and examples might have bin expected to prove this extraordinary proposition but according to his laudable custom he is pleased to trouble himself with neither and thinks that the impudence of an assertion is sufficient to make that to pass which is repugnant to experience and common sense as may appear by the following discourse  i will not insist upon terms for tho duller understanding signisys nothing in as much as no understanding is dull and a man is said to be dull only because he wants it but presuming he means little understanding i shall so take it this defect may possibly be repaired in time but to conclude it must be so is absurd for no one has this use and experience when he begins to reign at that ime many errors may be committed to the ruin of himself or people and many have perished even in their beginning edward the fifth and sixth of england francis the second of france and diverse other kings have died in the beginning of their youth charles the ninth lived only to add the furys of youth to the follys of his childhood and our henry the second edward the second richard the second and henry the sixth seem to have bin little wiser in the last than in the first year of their reign or life the present kings of spain france and sweden came to the crowns they wear before the sixth year of their age and if they did then surpass all annual magistrates in wisdom and valor it was by a peculiar gift of god which for any thing we know is not given to every king and it was not use and experience that made them to excel if it be pretended that this experience with the wisdom that it gives comes in time and by degrees i may modestly ask what time is required to render a prince excellent in wisdom who is a child or a fool and who will give security that he shall live to that time or that the kingdom shall not be ruined in the time of his folly i may also doubt how our author who concludes that every king in time must needs become excellent in wisdom can be reconciled to solomon who in preferring a wise child before an old and foolish king that will not be advised shows that an old king may be a fool and he that will not be advised is one some are so naturally brutish and stupid that neither education nor time will mend them it is probable that solomon took what care he could to instruct his only son rehoboam but he was certainly a fool at forty years of age and we have no reason to believe that he deserved a better name he seems to have bin the very fool his father intended who tho brayed in a mortar would never leave his folly he would not be advised tho the hand of god was against him ten tribes revolted from him and the city and temple was pillaged by the egyptians neither experience nor afflictions could mend him and he is called to this day by his own countrymen stultitia gentium i might offend tender ears if i should alledg all the examples of princes mentioned in history or known in our own age who have lived and died as foolish and incorrigible as he but no man i presume will be scandalized if i say that the ten last kings of meroveus his race whom the french historians call les roys faineants were so far from excelling other men in understanding that they lived and died more like beasts than men nay the wisdom and valor of charles martel expired in his grandchild charles the great and his posterity grew to be so sottish that the french nation must have perished under their conduct if the nobility and people had not rejected them and placed the crown upon a more deserving head  this is as much as is necessary to be said to the general proposition for it is false if it be not always true and no conclusion can be made upon it but i need not be so strict with our author there being no one fou d part in his assertion many children come to be kings when they he no experience and die or are deposed before they can gain any many are by nature so sottish that they can learn nothing others falling under the power of women or corrupt favorites and ministers are persuaded and seduced from the good ways to which their own natural understanding or experience might lead them the evils drawn upon themselves or their subjects by the errors committed in the time of their ignorance are often grievous and sometimes irreparable tho they should be made wise by time and experience a person of royal birth and excellent wit was so sensible of this as to tell me that the condition of kings was most miserable in as much as they never heard truth till they were ruined by lies and then every one was ready to tell it to them not by way of advice but reproach and rather to vent their own spite than to seek a remedy to the evils brought upon them and the people others attain to crowns when they are of full age and have experience as men tho none as kings and therefore are apt to commit as great mistakes as children and upon the whole matter all the historys of the world show that instead of this profound judgment and incomparable wisdom which our author generally attributes to all kings there is no sort of men that do more frequently and entirely want it  but tho kings were always wise by nature or made to be so by experience it would be of little advantage to nations under them unless their wisdom were pure perfect and acompanyd with clemency magnanimity justice valor and piety our author himself durst hardly have said that these virtues or graces are gained by experience or annexed by god to any rank of men or familys he gives them where he pleases without distinction we sometimes see those upon thrones who by god and nature seem to have bin designed for the most sordid offices and those have bin known to pass their lives in meanness and poverty who had all the qualitys that could be desired in princes there is likewise a kind of ability to dispatch some sort of affairs that princes who continue long in a throne may to a degree acquire or increase some men take this for wisdom but k james more rightly called it by the name of kingcraft and as it principally consists in dissimulation and the arts of working upon mens passions vanitys private interests or vices to make them for the most part instruments of mischief it has the advancement or security of their own persons for its object is frequently exercised with all the excesses of pride avarice treachery and cruelty and no men have bin ever found more notoriously to deflect from all that deserves praise in a prince or a gentleman than those that have most excelled in tacit an l       it pharasmenes king of iberia is recorded by tacitus to have bin well versed in this science his brother mithradates king of armenia had married his daughter and given his own daughter to rhadamistus son of pharasmenes he had some contests with mithradates but by the help of these mutual alliances nearness of blood the diligence of rhadamistus and an oath strengthened with all the ceremonys that amongst those nations were esteemed most sacred not to use arms or poison against him all was composed and by this means getting him into his power he stifled him with a great weight of clothes thrown upon him killed his children and not long after his own son rhadamistus also louis the eleventh of france james the third of scotland henry the seventh of england were great masters of these arts and tose who are acquainted with history will easily judge how happy nations would be if all kings did in time certainly learn them  our author as a farther testimony of his judgment having said that kings must needs excel others in understanding and grounded his doctrine upon their profound wisdom imputes to them those base and panick sears which are inconsistent with it or any royal virtue and to carry the point higher tells us there is no tyrant so barbarously wicked but his own reason and sense will tell him that tho he be a god yet he must die like a man and that there is not the meanest of his subjects but may find a means to revenge himself of the injurys offered him and from thence concludes that there is no such tyranny as that of a multitude which is subject to no sach fears but if there be such a thing in the world as a barbarous and wicked tyrant he is something different from a king or the same and his wisdom is consistent or inconsistent with barbarity wickedness and tyranny if there be no difference the praises he gives and the rights he ascribes to the one belong also to the other and the excellency of wisdom may consist with barbarity wickedness tyranny and the panick fears that accompany them which hitherto have bin thought to comprehend the utmost excesses of folly and madness and i know no better testimony of the truth of that opinion than that wisdom always distinguishing good from evil and being seen only in the rectitude of that distinction in following and adhering to the good rejecting that which is evil preferring safety before danger happiness before misery and in knowing rightly how to use the means of attaining or preserving the one and preventing or avoiding the other there cannot be a more extravagant deviation from reason than for a man who in a private condition might live safely and happily to invade a principality or if he be a prince who by governing with justice and clemency might obtain the inward satisfaction of his own mind hope for the blessing of god upon his just and virtuous actions acquire the love and praises of men and live in safety and happiness amongst his safe and happy subjects to fall into that barbarity wickedness and tyranny which brings upon him the displeasure of god and detestation of men and which is always attended with those base and panick fears that comprehend all that is shameful and miserable this being perceived by machiavel he could not think discors sopra t live l   c  0 that any man in his senses would not rather be a scipio than a caesar or if he came to be a prince would not rather choose to imitate agesilaus timoleon or dion than nabis phalaris or dionysius and imputes the contrary choice to madness nevertheless it is too well known that many of our authors profound wise men in the depth of their judgment made perfect by use and experience have fallen into it  if there be a difference between this barbarous wicked tyrant and a king we are to examine who is the tyrant and who the king for the name conferred or assumed cannot make a king unless he be one he who is not a king can have no title to the rights belonging to him who is truly a king so that a people who find themselves wickedly and barbarously oppressed by a tyrant may destroy him and his tyranny without giving offense to any king  but it is strange that filmer should speak of the barbarity and wickedness of a tyrant who looks upon the world to be the patrimony of one man and for the foundation of his doctrine asserts such a power in every one that makes himself master of any part as cannot be limited by any law his title is not to be questioned usurpation and violence confer an incontestable right the exercise of his power is no more to be disputed than the acquisition his will is a law to his subjects and no law can be imposed by them upon his conduct for if these things be true i know not how any man could ever be called a tyrant that name having never bin given to any unless for usurping a power that did not belong to him or an unjust exercise of that which had bin conferred upon him and violating the laws which ought to be a rule to him it is also hard to imagine how any man can be called barbarous and wicked if he be obliged by no law but that of his own pleasure for we have no other notion of wrong than that it is a breach of the law which determins what is right if the lives and goods of subjects depend upon the will of the prince and he in his profound wisdom preserve them only to be beneficial to himself they can have no other right than what he gives and without injustice may retain when he thinks fit if there be no wrong there can be no just revenge and he that pretends to seek it is not a free man vindicating his right but a perverse slave rising up against his master but if there be such a thing as a barbarous and wicked tyrant there must be a rule relating to the acquisition and exercise of the power by which he may be distinguished from a just king and a law superior to his will by the violation of which he becomes barbarous and wicked  tho our author so sar forgets himself to confess this to be true he seeks to destroy the fruits of it by such flattery as comprehends all that is most detestable in profaneness and blasphemy and gives the name of gods to the most execrable of men he may by such language deserve the name of heylins disciple but will find few among the heathens so basely servile or so boldly impious tho claudius caesar was a drunken sot and transported with the extravagance of his fortune he detested the impudence of his predecessor caligula who affected that title and in his rescript to the procurator of judea gives it no better name than turpem caii insaniam for this reason it was rejected by all his pagan successors who were not as furiously wicked as he yet filmer has thought fit to renew it for the benefit of mankind and the glory of the christian religion  i know not whether these extreme and barbarous errors of our author are to be imputed to wickedness or madness or whether to save the pains of a distinction they may not rightly be said to be the same thing but nothing less than the excess of both could induce him to attribute any thing of good to the fears of a tyrant since they are the chief causes of all the mischiefs he dos tertullian says they are metu quam furore saeviores and tacitus speaking of a most wicked king says that he did saevitiam ignaviae obtendere and we do not more certainly find that cowards are the cruellest of men than that wickedness makes them cowards that every mans fears bear a proportion with his guilt and with the number virtue and strength of those he has offended he who usurps a power over all or abuses a trust reposed in him by all in the highest measure offends all he fears and hates those he has offended and to secure himself aggravates the former injurys when these are public they beget a universal hatred and every man desires to extinguish a mischief that threatens ruin to all this will always be terrible to one that knows he has deserved it and when those he dreads are the body of the people nothing but a public destruction can satisfy his rage and appease his fears  i wish i could agree with filmer in exempting multitudes from fears for they having seldom committed any injustice unless through fear would as far as human fragility permits be free from it tho the attick ostracism was not an extreme punishment i know nothing usually practiced in any commonwealth that did so much savor of injustice but it proceeded solely from a fear that one man tho in appearance virtuous when he came to be raised too much above his fellowcitizens might be tempted to invade the public liberty we do not find that the athenians or any other free citys ever injured any man unless through such a jealousy or the perjury of witnesses by which the best tribunals that ever were or can be established in the world may be misled and no injustice could be apprehended from any if they did not fall into such fears  but tho multitudes may have fears as well as tyrants the causes and effects of them are very different a people in relation to domestic affairs can desire nothing but liberty and neither hate or fear any but such as do or would as they suspect deprive them of that happiness their endeavors to secure that seldom hurt any except such as invade their rights and if they err the mistake is for the most part discovered before it produce any mischief and the greatest that ever came that way was the death of one or a few men their hatred and desire of revenge can go no farther than the sense of the injury received or feared and is extinguished by the death or banishment of the persons as may be gathered from the examples of the tarquins decemviri cassius melius and manlius capitolinus he therefore that would know whether the hatred and fear of a tyrant or of a people produces the greater mischiefs needs only to consider whether it be better that the tyrant destroy the people or that the people destroy the tyrant or at the worst whether one that is suspected of affecting the tyranny should perish or a whole people amongst whom very many are certainly innocent and experience shows that such are always first sought out to be destroyed for being so popular furys or fears how irregular or unjust soever they may be can extend no farther general calamitys can only be brought upon a people by those who are enemies to the whole body which can never be the multitude for they are that body in all other respects the fears that render a tyrant cruel render a people gentle and cautious for every single man knowing himself to be of little power not only fears to do injustice because it may be revenged upon his person by him or his friends kindred and relations that suffers it but because it tends to the overthrow of the government which comprehends all public and private concernments and which every man knows cannot subsist unless it be so easy and gentle as to be pleasing to those who are the best and have the greatest power and as the public considerations divert them from doing those injurys that may bring immediate prejudice to the public so there are strict laws to restrain all such as would do private injurys if neither the people nor the magistrates of venice switzerland and holland commit such extravagances as are usual in other places it dos not perhaps proceed from the temper of those nations different from others but from a knowledge that whosoever offers an injury to a private person or attempts a public mischief is exposed to the impartial and inexorable power of the law whereas the chief work of an absolute monarch is to place himself above the law and thereby rendering himself the author of all the evils that the people suffer it is absurd to expect that he should remove them  sect xxx a monarchy cannot be well regulated unless the powers of the monarch are limited by law our authors next step is not only to reject popular governments but all such monarchys as are not absolute for if the king says he admits the people to be his companions he leaves to be a king this is the language of french lackeys valet de chambres tailors and others like them in wisdom learning and policy who when they fly to england for fear of a well deserved gally gibbet or wheel are ready to say il faut que le roy soit absolu autrement il nest point roy and finding no better men to agree with filmer in this sublime philosophy i may be pardoned if i do not follow them till i am convinced in these ensuing points    it seems absurd to speak of kings admitting the nobility or people to part of the government for tho there may be and are nations without kings yet no man can conceive a king without a people these must necessarily have all the power originally in themselves and tho kings may and often have a power of granting honors immunitys and privileges to private men or corporations he dos it only out of the public stock which he is entrusted to distribute but can give nothing to the people who give to him all that he can rightly have    it is strange that he who frequently cites aristotle and plato should unluckily acknowledge such only to be kings as they call tyrants and deny the name of king to those who in their opinion are the only kings    i cannot understand why the scripture should call those kings whose powers were limited if they only are kings who are absolute deuteronomy    or why moses did appoint that the power of kings in israel should be limited if they resolved to have them if that limitation destroyed the being of a king    and lastly how he knows that in the kingdoms which have a show of popularity the power is wholly in the king  the first point was proved when we examined the beginning of monarchys and found it impossible that there could be any thing of justice in them unless they were established by the common consent of those who were to live under them or that they could make any such establishment unless the right and power were in them  secondly neither plato nor aristotle acknowledge either reason or justice in the power of a monarch unless he has more of the virtues conducing to the good of the civil society than all those who compose it and employ them for the public advantage and not to his own pleasure and profit as being set up by those who seek their own good for no other reason than that he should procure it to this end a law is set as a rule to him and the best men that is such as are most like to himself plat de leg arist polit made to be his assistants because say they lex est mens sine affectu and quasi deus whereas the best of men have their affections and passions and are subject to be misled by them which shows that as the monarch is not for himself nor by himself he dos not give but receive power nor admit others to the participation of it but is by them admitted to what he has whereupon they conclude that to prefer the absolute power of a man as in those governments which they call barbarorum regna before the regular government of kings justly exercising a power instituted by law and directed to the public good is to choose rather to be subject to the lust of a beast than to be governed by a god and because such a choice can only be made by a beast i leave our author to find a description of himself in their books which he so often cites  but if aristotle deserves credit the princes who reign for themselves and not for the people preferring their own pleasure or profit before the public become tyrants which in his language is enemies to god and man on this account boccalini introduces the princes of europe raising a mutiny against him in parnassus for giving such definitions of tyrants as they said comprehended them all and forcing the poor philosopher to declare by a new definition that che i tiranni furono ceti h omini del tempo antico de i quali hoggidi si e perdu la razz occal rag d parn tyrants were certain men of ancient times whose race is now extinguished but with all his wit and learning he could not give a reason why those who do the same things that rendered the ancient tyrants detestable should not be so also in our days  in the third place the scriptures declare the necessity of setting bounds to those who are placed in the highest dignitys moses seems to have had as great abilitys as any man that ever lived in the world but he alone was not able to bear the weight of the government and therefore god appointed seventy chosen men to be his assistants this was a perpetual law to israel and as no king was to have more power than moses or more abilitys to perform the dutys of his office none could be exempted from the necessity of wanting the like helps our author therefore must confess that they are kings who have them or that kingly government is contrary to the scriptures when god by moses gave liberty to his people to make a king he did it under these conditions he must be one deuteronomy    of their brethren they must choose him he must not multiply gold silver wives or horses he must not lift up his heart above his brethren and josephus paraphrasing upon the place says he shall do nothing without the antiq jud advice of the sanhedrin or if he do they shall oppose him this agrees with the confession of zedekiah to the princes which was the sanhedrin the king can do nothing without you and seems to have bin in pursuance of the law of the kingdom which was written in a book and laid up jer   before the lord and could not but agree with that of moses unless they spoke by different spirits or that the spirit by which they did speak was subject to error or change and the whole series of gods law shows that the pride magnificence pomp and glory usurped by their kings was utterly contrary to the will of god they did lift up their hearts above their brethren which was forbidden by the law all the kings of israel and most of the kings of judah utterly rejected it and every one of them did very much depart from the observation of it i will not deny that the people in their institution of a king intended they should do so they had done it themselves and would have a king that might uphold them in their disobedience they were addicted to the idolatry of their accursed neighbors and desired that government by which it was maintained amongst them in doing this they did not reject samuel but they rejected god that he should not reign over them they might perhaps believe that unless their king were such as the law did not permit he would not perform what they intended or that the name of king did not belong to him unless he had a power that the law denied but since god and his prophets give the name of king to the chief magistrate endowed with a power that was restrained within very narrow limits whom they might without offense set up we also may safely give the same to those of the same nature whether it please filmer or not    the practice of most nations and i may truly say of all that deserve imitation has bin as directly contrary to the absolute power of one man as their constitutions or if the original of many governments lie hid in the impenetrable darkness of antiquity their progress may serve to show the intention of the founders aristotle seems to think that the first monarchs having bin chosen for their virtue were little restrained in the exercise of their power but that they or their children falling into corruption and pride grew odious and that nations did on that account either abolish their authority or create senats and other magistrates who having part of the power might keep them in order the spartan kings were certainly of this nature and the persian till they conquered babylon nay i may safely say that neither the kings which the frantic people set up in opposition to the law of god nor those of the bordering nations whose example they chose to follow had that absolute power which our author attributes to all kings as inseparable from the name achish the philistin loved and admired david he looked upon him as an angel of god and promised that he should be the keeper of   samuel    his head for ever but when the princes suspected him and said he shall not go down with us to battle he was obliged to dismiss him this was not the language of slaves but of those who had a great part in the government and the kings submission to their will shows that he was more like to the kings of sparta than to an absolute monarch who dos whatever pleases him i know not whether the spartans were descended from the hebrews as some think but their kings were under a regulation much like that of the    th of deuter tho they had two their senate of twenty eight and the ephori had a power like to that of the sanhedrin and by them kings were condemned to fines imprisonment banishment and death as appears by the examples of pausanias cleonymus leonidas agis and others the hebrew discipline was the same more nevochim reges davidicae stirpis says maimonides judicabant and judicabantur they gave testimony in judgment when they were called and testimony was given against them whereas the kings of israel as the same author ibid says were superbi cord elati and spertores legis nec judicabant nec judicabantur proud insolent and contemners of the law who would neither judge nor submit to judgment as the law commanded but the fruits they gathered were suitable to the seed they had sown and their crimes were not left unpunished they who despised the law were destroyed without law and when no ordinary course could be taken against them for their excesses they were overthrown by force and the crown within the space of few years was transported into nine several familys with the utter extirpation of those that had possessed it on the other hand there never was any sedition against the spartan kings and after the moderate discipline according to which they lived was established none of them died by the hands of their subjects except only two who were put to death in a way of justice the kingdom continued in the same races till cleomenes was defeated by antigonus and the government overthrown by the macedonians this gave occasion to those bestial tyrants nabis and machanidas to set up such a government as our author recommends to the world which immediately brought destruction upon themselves and the whole city the germans who pretended to be descended from the spartans had the like government their  de  germ princes according to their merit had the credit of persuading not the power of commanding and the question was not what part of the government they would allow to the nobility and people but what the nobility and people would give to their princes and it is not much material to our present dispute whether they learnt this from ome obscure knowledge of the law which god gave to his people or whether led by the light of reason which is also from god they discovered what was altogether conformable to that law whoever understands the affairs of germany knows that the present emperors notwithstandiug their haughty title have a power limited as in the days of tacitus if they are good and wise they may persuade but they can command no farther than the law allows they do not admit the princes noblemen and citys to the power which they all exercise in their general diets and each of them within their own precincts but they exercise that which has bin by public consent bestowed upon them all the kingdoms peopled from the north observed the same rules in all of them the powers were divided between the kings the nobility clergy and commons and by the decrees of councils diets parliaments cortez and assemblys of estates authority and liberty were so balanced that such princes as assumed to themselves more than the law did permit were severely punished and those who did by force or fraud invade thrones were by force thrown down from them  this was equally beneficial to kings and people the powers as theopompus king of sparta said were most safe when they were least envied and hated lewis the    th of france was one of the first that broke this golden chain and by more subtle arts than had bin formerly known subverted the laws by which the fury of kings had bin restrained and taught others to do the like tho all of them have not so well saved themselves from punishment james the third of scotland was one of his most apt scholars and ab hominibus infimae sortis in omnia simul vitia est praeceps datus tempora etiam corrupta and vicinorum regum exempla non parum ad eum evertendum juverunt nam and edvardus in aglia carlus in burgundia ludovicus undecimus in gallia joannes secundus in lusitania tyranidis fundamenta jecrunt richardus tertius in aglia eam immanissime exercuit hist scot l    buchanan in his life says that he was precipitated into all manner of infamy by men of the most abject condition that the corruption of those times and the ill example of neighboring princes were considerable motives to pervert him for edward the fourth of england charles of burgundy lewis the    th of france and john the second of portugal had already laid the foundations of tyranny in those countries and richard the third was then most cruelly exercising the same in the kingdom of england  this could not have bin if all the power had always bin in kings and neither the people nor the nobility had ever had any for no man can be said to gain that which he and his predecessors always possessed or to take from others that which they never had nor to set up any sort of government if it had bin always the same but the aforesaid lewis the    th did assume to himself a power above that of his predecessors and philip de commines shows the ways by which he acquired it with the miserable effects of his acquisition both to himself and to his people modern authors observe that the change was made by him and for that reason he is said by mezeray and others to have brought those kings out of davoir mi les roys hor de page guardianship they were not therefore so till he emancipated them nevertheless this emancipation had no resemblance to the unlimited power of which our author dreams the general assemblys of estates were often held long after his death and continued in the exercise of the sovereign power of the nation davila speaking of the general assembly hist delle guerre civ held at orleans in the time of francis the second asserts the whole thuan hist l   power of the nation to have bin in them monsieur de thou says the same thing and adds that the king dying suddenly the assembly continued even at the desire of the council in the exercise of that power till they had settled the regency and other affairs of the highest importance according to their own judgment hottoman a lawyer of that hottom francogallia time and nation famous for his learning judgment and integrity having diligently examined the ancient laws and historys of that kingdom distinctly proves that the french nation never had any kings but of their own choosing that their kings had no power except what was conferred upon them and that they had bin removed when they excessively abused or rendered themselves unworthy of that trust this is sufficiently clear by the forecited examples of pharamonds grandchildren and the degenerated races of meroveus and pepin of which many were deposed some of the nearest in blood excluded and when their vices seemed to be incorrigible they were wholly rejected all this was done by virtue of that rule which they call the salique law and tho some of our princes pretending to the inheritance of that crown by marrying the heirs general denied that there was any such thing no man can say that for the space of above twelve hundred years females or their descendents who are by that law excluded have ever bin thought to have any right to the crown and no law unless it be explicitly given by god can be of greater authority than one which has bin in force for so many ages what the beginning of it was is not known but charles the sixth receding from this law and thinking to dispose of the succession otherwise than was ordained by it was esteemed mad and all his acts rescinded and tho the reputation strength and valor of the english commanded by henry the fifth one of the bravest princes that have ever bin in the world was terrible to the french nation yet they opposed him to the utmost of their power rather than suffer that law to be broken and tho our success under his conduct was great and admirable yet soon after his death with the expense of much blood and treasure we lost all that we had on that side and suffered the penalty of having unadvisedly entered into that quarrel by virtue of the same law the agreement made by king john when he was prisoner at london by which he had alienated part of that dominion as well as that of francis the first concluded when he was under the same circumstances at madrid were reputed null and upon all occasions that nation has given sufficient testimony that the laws by which they live are their own made by themselves and not imposed upon them and it is as impossible for them who made and deposed kings exalted or deprest reigning familys and prescribed rules to the succession to have received from their own creatures the power or part of the government they had as for a man to be begotten by his own son nay tho their constitution was much changed by lewis the    th yet they retained so much of their ancient liberty that in the last age when the house of valois was as much depraved as those of meroveus and pepin had bin and henry the third by his own leudness hypocrisy cruelty and impurity together with the baseness of his minions and favorites had rendered himself odious and contemptible to the nobility and people the great citys parliaments the greater and in political matters the sounder part of the nation declared him to be fallen from the crown and pursued him to the death tho the blow was given by the hand of a base and halfdistracted monk  henry of bourbon was without controversy the next heir but neither the nobility nor the people who thought themselves in the government would admit him to the crown till he had given them satisfaction that he would govern according to their laws by abjuring his religion which they judged inconsistent with them  the later commotions in paris bourdeaux and other places together with the wars for religion show that tho the french do not complain of every grievance and cannot always agree in the defense and vindication of their violated libertys yet they very well understand their rights and that as they do not live by or for the king but he reigns by and for them so their privileges are not from him but that his crown is from them and that according to the true rule of their government he can do nothing against their laws or if he do they may oppose him  the institution of a kingdom is the act of a free nation and whoever denies them to be free denies that there can be any thing of right in what they set up that which was true in the beginning is so and must be so for ever this is so far acknowledged by the highest monarchs that in a treatise published in the year      by authority of the present king of france to justify his pretensions to some part of the low countries notwithstanding all the acts of himself and the king of spain to extinguish them it is said que les roys ont certe bienheureuse impuissance de ne pouvoir rien fair contre les loix de leut pays traite des dro de la reyne that kings are under the happy inability to do any thing against the laws of their country and tho perhaps he may do things contrary to law yet he grounds his power upon the law and the most able and most trusted of his ministers declare the same about the year    0 the count d aubijoux a man of eminent quality in languedoc but averse to the court and hated by cardinal mazarin had bin tried by the parliament of toulouse for a duel in which a gentleman was killed and it appearing to the court then in that city that he had bin acquitted upon forged letters of grace false witnesses powerful friends and other undue means mazarin desired to bring him to a new trial but the chancellor seguier told the queen mother it could not be for the law did not permit a man once acquitted to be again questioned for the same fact and that if the course of the law were interrupted neither the salique law nor the succession of her children or any thing else could be secure in france  this is farther proved by the historys of that nation the kings of meroveus and pepins races were suffered to divide the kingdom amongst their sons or as hottoman says the estates made the division and allotted to each such a part as they thought fit but when this way was found to be prejudicial to the public an act of state was made in the time of hugh capet by which it was ordained that for the future the kingdom should not be dismembered which constitution continuing in force to this day the sons or brothers of their kings receive such an apannage they call it as is bestowed on them remaining subject to the crown as well as other men and there has bin no king of france since that time except only charles the sixth who has not acknowledged that he cannot alienate any part of their dominion  whoever imputes the acknowledgment of this to kingcraft and says that they who avow this when it is for their advantage will deny it on a different occasion is of all men their most dangerous enemy in laying such fraud to their charge he destroys the veneration by which they subsist and teaches subjects not to keep faith with those who by the most malicious deceits show that they are tied by none human societys are maintained by mutual contracts which are of no value if they are not observed laws are made and magistrates created to cause them to be performed in public and private matters and to punish those who violate them but none will ever be observed if he who receives the greatest benefit by them and is set up to oversee others give the example suarum legum lator and eversor tacit to those who of themselves are too much inclined to break them the first step that pompey made to his own ruin was by violating the laws he himself had proposed but it would be much worse for kings to break those that are established by the authority of a whole people and confirmed by the succession of many ages  i am far from laying any such blemishes on them or thinking that they deserve them i must believe the french king speaks sincerely when he says he can do nothing against the laws of his country and that our king james did the like when he acknowledged himself to be the servant of the commonwealth and the rather because it is true and that he is placed in the throne to that end nothing is more essential and fundamental in the constitutions of kingdoms than that diets parliaments and assemblys of estates should see this performed it is not the king that gives them a right to judge of matters of war or peace to grant supplys of men and money or to deny them and to make or abrogate laws at their pleasure all the powers rightly belonging to kings or to them proceed from the same root the northern nations seeing what mischiefs were generally brought upon the eastern by referring too much to the irregular will of a man and what those who were more generous had suffered when one man by the force of a corrupt mercenary soldiery had overthrown the laws by which they lived feared they might fall into the same misery and therefore retained the greater part of the power to be exercised by their general assemblys or by delegates when they grew so numerous that they could not meet these are the kingdoms of which grotius speaks where the king has his part and the senate or people their part of the supreme authority and where the law prescribes such limits that if the king attempts to seize that part which is not his he may justly be opposed which is as much as to say that the law upholds the power it gives and turns against those who abuse it  this doctrine may be displeasing to courtparasites but is no less profitable to such kings as follow better counsels than to the nations that live under them the wisdom and virtue of the best is always fortified by the concurrence of those who are placed in part of the power they always do what they will when they will nothing but that which is good and it is a happy impotence in those who through ignorance or malice desire to do evil not to be able to effect it the weakness of such as by defects of nature sex age or education are not able of themselves to bear the weight of a kingdom is thereby supported and they together with the people under them preserved from ruin the furious rashness of the insolent is restrained the extravagance of those who are naturally lewd is awed and the bestial madness of the most violently wicked and outrageous suppressed when the law provides for these matters and prescribes ways by which they may be accomplished every man who receives or fears any injury seeks a remedy in a legal way and vents his passions in such a manner as brings no prejudice to the commonwealth if his complaints against a king may be heard and redrest by courts of justice parliaments and diets as well as against private men he is satisfied and looks no farther for a remedy but if kings like those of israel will neither judge nor be judged and there be no power orderly to redress private or public injurys every man has recourse to force as if he lived in a wood where there is no law and that force is generally mortal to those who provoke it no guards can preserve a hated prince from the vengeance of one resolute hand and they as often fall by the swords of their own guards as of others wrongs will be done and when they that do them cannot or will not be judged publicly the injured persons become judges in their own case and executioners of their own sentence if this be dangerous in matters of private concernment it is much more so in those relating to the public the lewd extravagances of edward and richard the seconds whilst they acknowledged the power of the law were gently reproved and restrained with the removal of some profligate favorites but when they would admit of no other law than their own will no relief could be had but by their deposition the lawful spartan kings who were obedient to the laws of their country lived in safety and died with glory whereas it is a strange thing to see a lawless tyrant die without such infamy and misery as held a just proportion with the wickedness of his life they did as plutarch says of dionysius many mischiefs and suffered vit timoleon more this is confirmed by the examples of the kingdom of israel and of the empires of rome and greece they who would submit to no law were destroyed without any i know not whether they thought themselves to be gods as our author says they were but i am sure the most part of them died like dogs and had the burial of asses rather than of men  this is the happiness to which our author would promote them all if a king admits a people to be his companions he ceases to be a king and the state becomes a democracy and a little farther if in such assemblys the king nobility and people have equal shares in the sovereignty then the king has but one voice the nobility likewise one and the people one and then any two of these voices should have power to overrule the third thus the nobility and commons should have a power to make a law to bridle the king which was never seen in any kingdom we have heard of nations that admitted a man to reign over them that is made him king but of no man that made a people the hebrews made saul david jeroboam and other kings when they returned from captivity they conferred the same title upon the asmonean race as a reward of their valor and virtue the romans chose romulus numa hostilius and others to be their kings the spartans instituted two one of the heraclidae the other of the aeacide other nations set up one a few or more magistrates to govern them and all the world agrees that qui dat esse dat modum esse he that makes him to be makes him to be what is and nothing can be more absurd than to say that he who has nothing but what is given can have more than is given to him if saul and romulus had no other title to be kings than what the people conferred upon them they could be no otherwise kings than as pleased the people they therefore did not admit the people to be partakers of the government but the people who had all in themselves and could not have made a king if they had not had it bestowed upon him what they thought fit and retained the rest in themselves if this were not so then instead of saying to the multitude will ye have this man to reign they ought to say to the man will thou have this multitude to be a people and whereas the nobles of arragon used to say to their new made king we who are as good as you make you our king on condition you keep and maintain our rights and libertys and if not not he should have said to them i who am better than you make you to be a people and will govern you as i please but i doubt whether he would have succeeded till that kingdom was joined to others of far greater strength from whence a power might be drawn to force them out of their usual method  that which has bin said of the governments of england france and other countries shows them to be of the same nature and if they deserve not the name of kingdoms and that their princes will by our authors arguments be persuaded to leave them those nations perhaps will be so humble to content themselves without that magnificent title rather than resign their own libertys to purchase it and if this will not please him he may seek his glorious sovereign monarchy among the wild arabs or in the island of ceylon for it will not be found among civilized nations  however more ignorance cannot be expressed than by giving the name of democracy to those governments that are composed of the three simple species as we have proved that all the good ones have ever bin for in a strict sense it can only suit with those where the people retain to themselves the administration of the supreme power and more largely when the popular part as in athens greatly overbalances the other two and that the denomination is taken from the prevailing part but our author if i mistake not is the first that ever took the ancient governments of israel sparta and rome or those of england france germany and spain to be democracys only because every one of them had senats and assemblys of the people who in their persons or by their deputys did join with their chief magistrates in the exercise of the supreme power that of israel to the time of saul is called by josephus an aristocracy the same name is ven to that of sparta by all the greek authors and the great contest in the peloponnesian war was between the two kinds of government the citys that were governed aristocratically or desired to be so following the lacedaemonians and such as delighted in democracy taking part with the athenians in like manner rome england and france were said to be under monarchys not that their kings might do what they pleased but because one man had a preeminence above any other yet if the romans could take romulus the son of a man that was never known numa a sabin hostilius and ancus martius private men and tarquinius priscus the son of a banished corinthian who had no title to a preference before others till it was bestowed upon them it is ridiculous to think that they who gave them what they had could not set what limits they pleased to their own gift  but says our author the nobility will then have one voice and the people another and they joining may overrule the third which was never seen in any kingdom this may perhaps be one way of regulating the monarchical power but it is not necessary nor the only one there may be a senate tho the people be excluded that senate may be composed of men chosen for their virtue as well as for the nobility of their birth the government may consist of king and people without a senate or the senate may be composed only of the peoples delegates but if i should grant his assertion to be true the reasonableness of such a constitution cannot be destroyed by the consequences he endeavors to draw from it for he who would instruct the world in matters of state must show what is or ought to be not what he fancys may thereupon ensue besides it dos not follow that where there are three equal votes laws should be always made by the plurality for the consent of all the three is in many places required and it is certain that in england and other parts the king and one of the estates cannot make a law without the concurrence of the other but to please filmer i will avow that where the nobles and commons have an equal vote they may join and overruled or limit the power of the king and i leave any reasonable man to judge whether it be more safe and fit that those two estates comprehending the whole body of the nation in their persons or by representation should have a right to overruled or limit the power of that man woman or child who sits in the throne or that he or she young or old wise or foolish good or bad should over rule them and by their vices weakness folly impertinence incapacity or malice put a stop to their proceedings and whether the chief concernments of a nation may more safely and prudently be made to depend upon the votes of so many eminent persons amongst whom many wise and good men will always be found if there be any in the nation and who in all respects have the same interest with them or upon the will of one who may be and often is as vile ignorant and wretched as the meanest slave and either has or is for the most part made to believe he has an interest so contrary to them that their suppression is his advancement common sense so naturally leads us to the decision of this question that i should not think it possible for mankind to have mistaken tho we had no examples of it in history and it is in vain to say that all princes are not such as i represent for if a right were annexed to the being of a prince and that his single judgment should overbalance that of a whole nation it must belong to him as a prince and be enjoyed by the worst and basest as well as by the wisest and best which would inevitably draw on the absurditys above mentioned but that many are and have bin such no man can deny or reasonably hope that they will not often prove to be such as long as any preference is granted to those who have nothing to recommend them but the familys from whence they derive a continual succession of those who excel in virtue wisdom and experience being promised to none nor reasonably to be expected from any such a right therefore cannot be claimed by all and if not by all then not by any unless it proceed from a particular grant in consideration of personal virtue ability and integrity which must be proved and when any one goes about to do it i will either acknowledge him to be in the right or give the reasons of my denial  however this is nothing to the general proposition nay if a man were to be found who had more of the qualitys required for making a right judgment in matters of the greatest importance than a whole nation or an assembly of the best men chosen out of it which i never heard to have bin unless in the persons of moses joshua or samuel who had the spirit of god for their guide it would be nothing to our purpose for even he might be biased by his personal interests which governments are not established to promote  i may go a step farther and truly say that as such vast powers cannot be generally granted to all who happen to succeed in any familys without evident danger of utter destruction when they come to be executed by children women fools vicious incapable or wicked persons they can be reasonably granted to none because no man knows what any one will prove till he be tried and the importance of the affair requires such a trial as can be made of no man till he be dead he that resists one temptation may fall under the power of another and nothing is more common in the world than to see those men fail grossly in the last actions of their lives who had passed their former days without reproach wise and good men will with moses say of themselves i cannot bear the burden and every man who is concerned for the public good ought to let fools know they are not fit to undergo it and by law to restrain the fury of such as will not be guided by reason this could not be denied tho governments were constituted for the good of the governor it is good for him that the law appoints helps for his infirmitys and restrains his vices but all nations ought to do it tho it were not so in as much as kingdoms are not established for the good of one man but of the people and that king who seeks his own good before that of the people departs from the end of his institution  this is so plain that all nations who have acted freely have some way or other endeavored to supply the defects or restrain the vices of their supreme magistrates and those among them deserve most praise who by appointing means adequate to so great a work have taken care that it might be easily and safely accomplished such nations have always flourished in virtue power glory and happiness whilst those who wanted their wisdom have suffered all manner of calamitys by the weakness or injustice of their princes or have had their hands perpetually in blood to preserve themselves from their fury we need no better example of the first than that of the spartans who by appointing such limits to the power of their kings as could hardly be transgrest continued many ages in great union with them and were never troubled with civil tumults the like may be said of the romans from the expulsion of the tarquins till they overthrew their own orders by continuing marius for five years in the consulat whereas the laws did not permit a man to hold the same office two years together and when that rule was broken their own magistrates grew too strong for them and subverted the commonwealth when this was done and the power came into the hands of one man all manner of evils and calamitys broke in like a flood it is hard to judge whether the mischiefs he did or those he suffered were the greater he who set up himself to be lord of the world was like to a beast crowned for the slaughter and his greatness was the forerunner of his ruin by this means some of those who seem not to have bin naturally prone to evil were by their fears put upon such courses to preserve themselves as being rightly estimated were worse than the death they apprehended and the so much celebrated constantine the great died no less polluted with the blood of his nearest relations and friends than nero himself but no place can show a more lively  de  de  picture of this than the kingdoms of granada and others possessed by the moors in spain where there being neither senate nor assemblys of the nobility and people to restrain the violence and fury of their kings they had no other way than to kill them when their vices became insupportable which happening for the most part they were almost all murdered and things were brought to such extremity that no man would accept a crown except he who had neither birth nor virtue to deserve it  if it be said that kings have now found out more easy ways of doing what they please and securing themselves i answer that they have not proved so to all and it is not yet time for such as tread in the same steps to boast of their success many have fallen when they thought their designs accomplished and no man as long as he lives can reasonably assure himself the like shall not befall him but if in this corrupted age the treachery and perjury of princes be more common than formerly and the number of those who are brought to delight in the rewards of injustice be so increased that their partys are stronger than formerly this rather shows that the balance of power is broken or hard to be kept up than that there ought to be none and it is difficult for any man without the spirit of prophecy to tell what this will produce whilst the ancient constitutions of our northern kingdoms remained entire such as contested with their princes sought only to reform the governments and by redressing what was amiss to reduce them to their first principles but they may not perhaps be so modest when they see the very nature of their government changed and the foundations overthrown i am not sure that they who were well pleased with a moderate monarchy will submit to one that is absolute and it is not improbable that when men see there is no medium between tyranny and popularity they who would have bin contented with the reformation of their government may proceed farther and have recourse to force when there is no help in the law this will be a hard work in those places where virtue is wholly abolished but the difficulty will lie on the other side if any sparks of that remain if vice and corruption prevail liberty cannot subsist but if virtue has the advantage arbitrary power cannot be established those who boast of their loyalty and think they give testimonys of it when they addict themselves to the will of one man tho contrary to the law from whence that quality is derived may consider that by putting their masters upon illegal courses they certainly make them the worst of men and bring them into danger of being also the most miserable few or no good princes have fallen into disasters unless through an extremity of corruption introduced by the most wicked and cannot properly be called unhappy if they perished in their innocence since the bitterness of death is assuagd by the tears of a loving people the assurance of a glorious memory and the quiet of a wellsatisfyd mind but of those who have abandoned themselves to all manner of vice followed the impulse of their own fury and set themselves to destroy the best men for opposing their pernicious designs very few have died in peace their lives have bin miserable death infamous and memory detestable  they therefore who place kings within the power of the law and the law to be a guide to kings equally provide for the good of king and people whereas they who admit of no participants in power and acknowledge no rule but their own will set up an interest in themselves against that of their people lose their affections which is their most important treasure and incur their hatred from whence results their greatest danger  sect xxxi the libertys of nations are from god and nature not from kings whatsoever is usually said in opposition to this seems to proceed from a groundless conceit that the libertys enjoyed by nations arise from the concessions of princes this point has bin already treated but being the foundation of the doctrine i oppose it may not be amiss farther to examine how it can be possible for one man born under the same condition with the rest of mankind to have a right in himself that is not common to all others till it be by them or a certain number of them conferred upon him or how he can without the utmost absurdity be said to grant libertys and privileges to them who made him to be what he is  if i had to do with a man that sought after truth i should think he had bin led into this extravagant opinion by the terms ordinarily used in patents and charters granted to particular men and not distinguishing between the proprietor and the dispenser might think kings had given as their own that which they only distribute out of the public treasury and could have had nothing to distribute by parcels if it had not bin given to them in gross by the public but i need not use our author so gently the perversity of his judgment and obstinate hatred to truth is sufficient to draw him into the most absurd errors without any other inducement and it were not charity but folly to think otherwise of one who attributes in general to all princes without any regard to the ways by which they attain to their power such an authority as never justly belonged to any  this will be evident to all those who consider that no man can confer upon others that which he has not in himself if he be originally no more than they he cannot grant to them or any of them more than they to him in the   th   th   th and subsequent sections of the first chapter it has bin proved that there is no resemblance between the paternal right and the absolute power which he asserts in kings that the right of a father whatever it be is only over his children that this right is equally inherited by them all when he dies that every one cannot inherit dominion for the right of one would be inconsistent with that of all others that the right which is common to all is that which we call liberty or exemption from dominion that the first fathers of mankind after the flood had not the exercise of regal power and whatsoever they had was equally devolved to every one of their sons as appears by the examples of noah shem abraham isaac jacob and their children that the erection of nimrods kingdom was directly contrary to and inconsistent with the paternal right if there was any regality in it that the other kingdoms of that time were of the same nature that nimrod not exceeding the age of threescore years when he built babel could not be the father of those that assisted him in that attempt that if the seventy two kings who as our author says went from babylon upon the consusion of languages were not the sons of nimrod he could not govern them by the right of a father if they were they must have bin very voung and could not have children of their own to people the kingdoms they set up that whose children soever they were who out of a part of mankind did within a hundred and thirty two years after the flood divide into so many kingdoms they showed that others in process of time might subdivide into as many as they pleased and kingdoms multiplying in the space of four thousand years since the    in the same proportion they did in one hundred and thirty two years into seventy two there would now be as many kings in the world as there are men that is no man could be subject to another that this equality of right and exemption from the domination of any other is called liberty that he who enjoys it cannot be deprived of it unless by his own consent or by force that no one man can force a multitude or if he did it could confer no right upon him that a multitude consenting to be governed by one man dos confer upon him the power of governing them the powers therefore that he has are from them and they who have all in themselves can receive nothing from him who has no more than every one of them till they do invest him with it this is proved by sacred and profane historys the hebrews in the creation of judges kings or other magistrates had no regard to paternity or to any who by extraction could in the least pretend to the right of fathers god did never direct them to do it nor reprove them for neglecting it if they would choose a king he commanded them to take one of their brethren not one who called himself their father when they did resolve to have one he commanded them to choose him by lot and caused the lot to fall upon a young man of the youngest tribe david and the other kings of israel or judah had no more to say for themselves in that point than saul all the kings of that nation before and after the captivity ordinarily or extraordinarily set up justly or unjustly were raised without regard to any prerogative they could claim or arrogate to themselves on that account all that they had therefore was from their elevation and their elevation from those that elevated them twas impossible for them to confer any thing upon those from whom they received all they had or for the people to give power to kings if they had not had it in themselves which power universally residing in every one is that which we call liberty the method of other nations was much like to this they placed those in the throne who seemed best to deserve so great an honor and most able to bear so great a burden the kingdoms of the heroes were nothing else but the government of those who were most beneficent to the nations amongst whom they lived and whose virtues were thought fit to be raised above the ordinary level of the world tho perhaps there was not any one athenian or roman equal to theseus or romulus in courage and strength yet they were not able to subdue many or if any man should be so vain to think that each of them did at first subdue one man then two and so proceeding by degrees conquered a whole people he cannot without madness ascribe the same to numa who being sent for from a soreign country was immediately made king of a fierce people that had already conquered many of their neighbors and was grown too boisterous even for romulus himself the like may be said of the first tarquin and of servius they were strangers and tho tullus hostilius and ancus martius were romans they had as little title to a dominion over their fellowcitizens or means of attaining to it as if they had come srom the farthest parts of the earth this must be in all places unless one man could prove by a perfect and uninterrupted genealogy that he is the eldest son of the eldest line of noah and that line to have continued perpetually in the government of the world for if the power has bin divided it may be subdivided to infinity if interrupted the chain is broken and can never be made whole but if our author can perform this for the service of any man i willingly surrender my arms and yield up the cause i defend if he fail it is ridiculous to pretend a right that belongs to no man or to go about to retrieve a right which for the space of four thousand years has lain dormant and much more to create that which never had a subsistence this leads us necessarily to a conclusion that all kingdoms are at the first erected by the consent of nations and given to whom they please or else all are set up by force or some by force and some by consent if any are set up by the conent of nations their kings do not confer libertys upon those nations but receive all from them and the general proposition is false if our author therefore or his followers would confute me they must prove that all the kingdoms of the world have their beginning from force and that force dos always create a right or if they recede from the general proposition and attribute a peculiar right to one or more princes who are so absolute lords of their people that those under them have neither liberty privilege property or part in the government but by their concessions they must prove that those princes did by force gain the power they have and that their right is derived from it this force also must have bin perpetually continued for if that force be the root of the right that is pretended another force by the same rule may overturn extinguish or transfer it to another hand if contracts have intervened the force ceases and the right that afterward dos accrue to the persons must proceed from and be regulated according to those contracts  this may be sufficient to my purpose for having already proved that the kingdoms of israel judah rome sparta france spain england and all that we are concerned in or that deserve to be examples to us did arise from the consent of the respective nations and were frequently reduced to their first principles when the princes have endeavored to transgress the laws of their institution it could be nothing to us tho attila or tamerlan had by force gained the dominions they possessed but i dare go a step further and boldly assert that there never was or can be a man in the world that did or can subdue a nation and that the right of one grounded upon force is a mere whimsy it was not agathocles dionysius nabis marius sylla or caesar but the mercenary soldiers and other villains that joined with them who subdued the syracusans spartans or romans and as the work was not performed by those tyrants alone if a right had bin gained by the violence they used it must have bin common to all those that gained it and he that commanded them could have had no more than they thought fit to conser upon him when plut in vt c miltiades desired leave to wear an olive garland in commemoration of the victory obtained at marathon an athenian did in my opinion rightly say if you alone did fight against the persians it is just that you only should be crowned but if others did participate in the victory they ought also to have a part in the honor and the principal difference that i have observed between the most regular proceedings of the wisest senats or assemblys of the people in their persons or delegats and the sury of the most dissolute villains has bin that the first seeking the public good do usually set up such a man and invest him with such powers as seem most conducing to that good whereas the others following the impulse of a bestial rage and aiming at nothing but the satisfaction of their own lusts always advance one from whom they expect the greatest advantages to themselves and give him such powers as most conduce to the accomplishment of their own ends but as to the person it is the same thing caesar and nero did no more make themselves what they were than numa and could no more confer any right liberty or privilege upon the army that gave them all they had than the most regular magistrate could upon the senate or people that chose him  this also is common to the worst as well as the best that they who set up either do as into a public treasury confer upon the person they choose a power of distributing to particular men or numbers of men such honors privileges and advantages as they may seem according to the principles of the government to deserve but there is this difference that the ends of the one being good and those of the other evil the first do for the most part limit the powers that something may remain to reward services done to the public in a manner proportioned to the merit of every one placing other magistrates to see it really performed so as they may not by the weakness or vices of the governor be turned to the public detriment the others think they never give enough that the prince having all in his power may be able to gratify their most exorbitant desires if by any ways they can get his favor and his infirmitys and vices being most beneficial to them they seldom allow to any other magistrate a power of opposing his will or suffer those who for the public good would assume it the world affords many examples of both sorts and every one of them have had their progress suitable to their constitution the regular kingdoms of england france spain poland bohemia denmark sweden and others whether elective or hereditary have had high stewards constables mayors of the palace rixhofmeisters parliaments diets assemblys of estates cortez and the like by which those have bin admitted to succeed who seemed most fit for the public service the unworthy have bin rejected the infirmitys of the weak supplied the malice of the unjust restrained and when necessity required the crown transferred from one line or family to another but in the furious tyrannys that have bin set up by the violence of a corrupted soldiery as in the ancient roman empire the kingdoms of the moors and arabians the tyrannys of ezzelino of padoa those of the visconti and sforzeschi of milan castruccio castraccani of lucca caesar borgia and others there was nothing of all this the will of the prince was a law all power was in him and he kept it till another stepped up and took it from him by the same means that he had gained it this fell out so frequently that tho all the roman emperors endeavored to make their power hereditary it hardly continued three generations in one line from augustus to augustulus unless in that of constantine and that with extreme confusion and disorder they who had madly set up a man to be their head and exposed so much of the world as was under their power to be destroyed by him did by the like fury throw him down and never ceased till they had brought the empire to utter ruin  but if this paternal sovereignty be a mere fiction that never had any effect and no nation was ever commanded by god to make it their rule nor any reproved for the neglect of it none ever learnt it from the light of nature nor were by wise men taught to regard it if the first fathers claimed no privilege from it when every mans genealogy was known and tho there were such a thing in nature it could be of no use at this day when the several races of men are so confused that not one in the world can prove his own original if the first kingdoms whether well or ill constituted according to the command of god or the inventions of men were contrary to and incompatible with it and there can have bin no justice in any if such a rule was to have bin observed the continuance of an unjust usurpation can never have created a right but aggravated the injustice of overthrowing it if no man could ever by his own strength and courage subdue a multitude nor gain any other right over them if he did than they might have to tear it from him whoever denies kingdoms or other magistracys to have bin set up by men according to their own will and from an opinion of receiving benefit by them accuses all the governments that are or ever have bin in the world of that outrageous injustice in their foundation which can never be repaired if there be therefore or ever was any just government amongst men it was constituted by them and whether their proceedings were regular or violent just or unjust the powers annexed to it were their donation the magistracys erected by them whether in one or more men temporary or perpetual elective or hereditary were their creatures and receiving all from them could confer nothing upon them  sect xxxii the contracts made between magistrates and the nations that created them were real solemn and obligatory our author having with big words and little sense inveighed against popular and mixed governments proceeds as if he had proved that they could not or ought not to be if it be says he unnatural for the multitude to choose their governors or to govern or to partake in the government what can be thought of that damnable conclusion which is made by too many that the multitude may correct or depose their princes if need be surely the unnaturalness and injustice of this position cannot sufficiently be expressed for admit that a king make a contract or paction with his people originally in his ancestors or personally at his coronation for both these pactions some dream of but cannot offer any proof of either yet by no law of any nation can a contract be thought broken except first a lawful trial be had by the ordinary judge of the breakers thereof or else every man may be both party and judge in his own case which is absurd once to be thought for then it will lie in the hands of the headless multitude when they please to cast off the yoke of government that god has laid upon them and to judge and punish him by whom they should be judged and punished themselves to this i answer first briefly that if it be natural for the multitude to choose their governors or to govern or to participate of the government as best pleases themselves or that there never was a government in the world that was not so set up by them in pursuance of the power naturally inherent in themselves what can be thought of that damnable conclusion which has bin made by fools or knaves that the multitude may not if need be correct or depose their own magistrates surely the unnaturalness and injustice of such a position cannot be sufficiently expressed if that were admitted all the most solemn pacts and contracts made between nations and their magistrates originally or personally and confirmed by laws and mutual oaths would be of no value he that would break the most sacred bonds that can be amongst men should by perjury and wickedness become judge of his own case and by the worst of crimes procure impunity for all it would be in his power by folly wickedness and madness to destroy the multitude which he was created and sworn to preserve tho wise virtuous and just and headed by the wisest and justest of men or to lay a yoke upon those who by the laws of god and nature ought to be free he might in his own case judge that body by which he ought to be judged and who in consideration of themselves and their own good made him to be whatsoever he is more than every one of them the governments instituted for the preservation of nations would turn to their destruction it would be impossible to check the fury of a corrupt and perfidious magistrate the worst of men would be raised to a height that was never deserved by the best and the assurance of indemnity would by increasing their insolence turn their other vices into madness as has bin too often seen in those who have had more power than they deserved and were more hardly brought to account for their actions than ought to have bin tho i never heard of any who had so much as our author asserts to be in all nor that any was absolutely assured he should not be questioned for the abuse of what he had  besides if every people may govern or constitute and choose one or more governors they may divide the powers between several men or ranks of men allotting to every one so much as they please or retaining so much as they think fit this has bin practiced in all the governments which under several forms have flourished in palestine greece italy germany france england and the rest of the world the laws of every place show what the power of the respective magistrate is and by declaring how much is allowed to him declare what is denied for he has not that which he has not and is to be accounted a magistrate whilst he exercises that which he has  if any doubts do hereupon arise i hope to remove them proving in the first place that several nations have plainly and explicitly made contracts with their magistrates    that they are implicit and to be understood where they are not plainly expressed    that they are not dreams but real things and perpetually obliging    that judges are in many places appointed to decide the contests arising from the breach of these contracts and where they are not or the party offending is of such force or pride that he will not submit nations have bin obliged to take the extremest courses  to the first i suppose it will not be denied that the annual magistrates of diverse commonwealths are under some compact and that there is a power of constraining them to perform the contents or to punish them for the violation the modest behavior of the roman consuls and dictators as long as their laws were in force might not probably proceed from their good nature tho the people had not bin as our author says mad foolish and always desirous to choose the worst men for being most like to themselves but admirably wise and virtuous it is not to be imagined that in the space of three or four hundred years they should never have fallen upon one who would have transgrest if he could have done it safely tho they had used the utmost caution in their choice but the power of the consuls being only for a year that of the dictator for six months at most and the commission that he should take care ne quid detrimenti respubl accipiat the commonwealth might suffer no damage show the end and condition upon which they were chosen and tho their power is by some thought to have bin absolute yet the consuls were frequently opposed and brought into order by the senate tribuns or people and sometimes plut vit camil the dictator himself camillus in his fourth dictatorship was threatened by the tribuns with a great fine and by that means obliged to abdicate his magistracy i have already mentioned marcus fabius maximus who in the behalf of his son quintus condemned to die by papirius the dictator appealed to the qui solus plus quam rua dictatura potest polletque cui and reges cessere etc t live l   people and when the conduct of fabius in the war against hannibal was not approved the tribun thought he made a very modest proposition in that he did not desire his magistracy should be abrogated but that the master of the horse should be made equal to him in power which was done accordingly it is agreed by all that the consuls were in the place of kings and that the power of the dictator was at least equal to what theirs had bin if they therefore were under such a rule which they could not transgress or might be reduced to order if they did and forced to submit to the people as the kings had done the kings were also made upon the same conditions and equally obliged to perform them  the scripture is more clear in the case the judges are said to have bin in power equal to kings and i may perhaps ackowledg it with relation to the deuteronomical king or such as the people might have chosen without offending god the gileadites made a covenant with jephtha that he should be their head and captain he would not return to his country till they had done it this was performed solemnly before the lord in mispeth and all israel followed them they might therefore make a covenant with their kings for the difference of name dos not increase or diminish the right nay they were in duty obliged to do it the words of the    th of deuter he shall not multiply wives etc that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren can have no other signification than that they should take care he did it not or as josephus says hinder him if he attempt it for the law was not given to the king who was not but those who might make him if they thought fit in pursuance of this law   the rest of this chapter is wanting in the original manuscript  chap iii sect i kings not being fathers of their people nor excelling all others in virtue can have no other just power than what the laws give nor any title to the privileges of the lords anointed having proved that the right of fathers is from nature and incommunicable it must follow that every man dos perpetually owe all love respect service and obedience to him that did beget nourish and educate him and to no other under that name no man therefore can claim the right of a father over any except one that is so no man can serve two masters the extent and perpetuity of the duty which every man owes to his father renders it impossible for him to owe the same to any other this right of father cannot be devolved to the heir of the father otherwise than as every son by the law of nature is heir to his father and has the same right of commanding his children as his father had of commanding him when he was a child no man can owe to his brother that which he owed to his father because he cannot receive that from him which he had from his father but the utmost of all absurditys that can enter into the heart of man is for one to exact the rights due to a father who has no other title than force and usurpation it being no less than to say that i owe as much to one who has done me the greatest of all injurys as to him who has conferred upon me the greatest benefits or which is yet worse if possible that as these usurpations cannot be made but by robbing spoiling imprisoning or killing the person in possession that duty which by the eternal law of nature i owe to my father should oblige me to pay the same veneration obedience and service to the man that has spoiled imprisoned or killed my father as i owed to him or that the same law which obliged me to obey and defend my father because he was so should oblige me to obey and defend his enemy because he has imprisoned or killed him and not only to pass over the law of god which makes me the avenger of my fathers blood but to reward his murderer with the rights that comprehend all that is most tender and sacred in nature and to look upon one that has done me the greatest of all injustices and injurys as upon him to whom i owe my birth and education this being evident to all those who have any measure of common sense i suppose it may be safely concluded that what right soever a father may have over his family it cannot relate to that which a king has over his people unless he like the man in the island of pines mentioned before be also the father of them all that which is absolutely unlike in manner and substance institution and exercise must be unlike in all respects and the conclusions which have their strength from similitude and parity can have none when there is not the least similitude of either and tho it were true that fathers are held by no contracts which generally it is not for when the son is of age and dos something for the father to which he is not obliged or gives him that which he is not bound to give suppose an inheritance received from a friend goods of his own acquisition or that he be emancipated all good laws look upon those things as a valuable consideration and give the same force to contracts thereupon made as to those that pass between strangers it could have no relation to our question concerning kings one principal reason that renders it very little necessary by the laws of nations to restrain the power of parents over their children is because it is presumed they cannot abuse it they are thought to have a law in their bowels obliging them more strictly to seek their good than all those that can be laid upon them by another power and yet if they depart from it so as inhumanly to abuse or kill their children they are punished with as much rigor and accounted more unpardonable than other men ignorance or wilful malice persuading our author to pass over all this he boldly affirms that the father of a family governs it by no other law than his own will and from thence infers that the condition of kings is the same he would seem to soften the harshness of this proposition by saying that a king is always tied by the same law of nature to keep this general ground that the safety of the kingdom is his chief law but he spoils it in the next page by asserting that it is not right for kings to do injury but it is right that they go unpunished by the people if they do so that in this point it is all one whether samuel describe a king or a tyrant for patient obedience is due unto both no remedy in the text against tyrants but crying and praying unto god in that day in this our author according to the custom of theaters runs round in a circle pretends to grant that which is true and then by a lie endeavors to destroy all again kings by the law of nature are obliged to seek chiefly the good of the kingdom but there is no remedy if they do it not which is no less than to put all upon the conscience of those who manifestly have none but if god has appointed that all other transgressions of the laws of nature by which a private man receives damage should be punished in this world notwithstanding the right reserved to himself of a future punishment i desire to know why this alone by which whole nations may be and often are destroyed should escape the hands of justice if he presume no law to be necessary in this case because it cannot be thought that kings will transgress as there was no law in sparta against adultery because it was not thought possible for men educated under that discipline to be guilty of such a crime and as diverse nations left a liberty to fathers to dispose of their children as they thought fit because it could not be imagined that any one would abuse that power he ought to remember that the spartans were mistaken and for want of that law which they esteemed useless adulterys became as common there as in any part of the world and the other error being almost every where discovered the laws of all civilized nations make it capital for a man to kill his children and give redress to children if they suffer any other extreme injurys from their parents as well as to other persons but tho this were not so it would be nothing to our question unless it could be supposed that whoever gets the power of a nation into his hands must be immediately filled with the same tenderness of affection to the people under him as a father naturally has toward the children he has begotten he that is of this opinion may examine the lives of herod tiberius caligula and some later princes of like inclinations and conclude it to be true if he find that the whole course of their actions in relation to the people under them do well suit with the tender and sacred name of father and altogether false if he find the contrary but since every man that considers what has bin or sees what is every day done in the world must confess that princes or those who govern them do most frequently so utterly reject all thoughts of tenderness and piety toward the nations under them as rather to seek what can be drawn from them than what should be done for them and sometimes become their most bitter and public enemies it is ridiculous to make the safety of nations to depend upon a supposition which by daily experience we find to be false and impious to prefer the lusts of a man who violates the most sacred laws of nature by destroying those he is obliged to preserve before the welfare of that people for whose good he is made to be what he is if there be any thing of justice in the power he exercises  our author foolishly thinks to cover the enormity of this nonsense by turning salutem populi into salutem regni for tho regnum may be taken for the power of commanding in which sense the preservation of it is the usual object of the care of princes yet it dos more rightly signify the body of that nation which is governed by a king and therefore if the maxim be true as he acknowledges it to be then salus populi est lex suprema and the first thing we are to inquire is whether the government of this or that man dos conduce to the accomplishment of that supreme law or not for otherwise it ought to have bin said salus regis est lex suprema which certainly never entered into the head of a wiser or better man than filmer  his reasons are as good as his doctrine no law says he can be imposed on kings because there were kings before any laws were made this would not follow tho the proposition were true for they who imposed no laws upon the kings they at first made from an opinion of their virtue as in those called by the ancients heroum regna might lay restrictions upon them when they were found not to answer the expectation conceived of them or that their successors degenerated from their virtue other nations also being instructed by the ill effects of an unlimited power given to some kings if there was any such might wisely avoid the rock upon which their neighbors had split and justly moderate that power which had bin pernicious to others however a proposition of so great importance ought to be proved but that being hard and perhaps impossible because the original of nations is almost wholly unknown to us and their practice seems to have bin so various that what is true in one is not so in another he is pleased only to affirm it without giving the least shadow of a reason to persuade us to believe him this might justify me if i should reject his assertion as a thing said gratis but i may safely go a step farther and affirm that men lived under laws before there were any kings which cannot be denied if such a power necessarily belongs to kings as he ascribes to them for nimrod who established his kingdom in babel is the first who by the scripture is said to have bin a mighty one in the earth he was therefore the first king or kings were not mighty and he being the first king mankind must have lived till his time without laws or else laws were made before kings to say that there was then no law is in many respects most absurd for the nature of man cannot be without it and the violences committed by ill men before the flood could not have bin blamed if there had bin no law for that which is not cannot be transgrest cain could not have feared that every man who met him would slay him if there had not bin a law to slay him that had slain another but in this case the scripture is clear at least from the time that noah went out of the ark for god then gave him a law sufficient for the state of things at that time if all violence was prohibited under the name of shedding blood tho not under the same penalty as murder but penal laws being in vain if there be none to execute them such as know god dos nothing in vain may conclude that he who gave this law did appoint some way for its execution tho unknown to us there is therefore a law not given by kings but laid upon such as should be kings as well as on any other persons by one who is above them and perhaps i may say that this law presses most upon them because they who have most power do most frequently break out into acts of violence and most of all disdain to have their will restrained and he that will exempt kings from this law must either find that they are excepted in the text or that god who gave it has not a power over them  moreover it has bin proved at the beginning of this treatise that the first kings were of the accursed race and reigned over the accursed nations whilst the holy seed had none if therefore there was no law where there was no king the accursed posterity of cham had laws when the blessed descendents of shem had none which is most absurd the word outlaw or lawless being often given to the wicked but never to the just and righteous  the impious folly of such assertions goes farther than our author perhaps suspected for if there be no law where there is no king the israelites had no law till saul was made king and then the law they had was from him they had no king before for they asked one they could not have asked one of samuel if he had bin a king he had not bin offended and god had not imputed to them the sin of rejecting him if they had asked that only which he had set over them if samuel were not king moses joshua and the other judges were not kings for they were no more than he they had therefore no king and consequently if our author says true no law if they had no law till saul was king they never had any for he gave them none and the prophets were to blame for denouncing judgments against them for receding from or breaking their law if they had none he cannot say that samuel   samuel  0 gave them a law for that which he wrote in a book and laid up before the lord was not a law to the people but to the king if it had bin a law to the people it must have bin made public but as it was only to the king he laid it up before god to testify against him if he should adventure to break it or if it was a law to the people the matter is not mended for it was given in the time of a king by one who was not king but in truth it was the law of the kingdom by which he was king and had bin wholly impertinent if it was not to bind him for it was given to no other person and to no other end  our authors assertion on which all his doctrine is grounded that there is no nation that allows children any action or remedy for being unjustly governed is as impudently false as any other proposed by him for tho a child will not be heard that complains of the rod yet our own law gives relief to children against their fathers as well as against other persons that do them injurys upon which we see many ill effects and i do rather relate than commend the practice in other places the law gives relief against the extravagances of which fathers may be guilty in relation to their children tho not to that excess as to bring them so near to an equality as in england they cannot imprison sell or kill their children without exposing themselves to the same punishments with other men and if they take their estates from them the law is open and gives relief against them but on the other side children are punished with death if they strike or outrageously abuse their parents which is not so with us  now if the laws of nations take such care to preserve private men from being too hardly used by their true and natural fathers who have such a love and tenderness for them in their own blood that the most wicked and barbarous do much more frequently commit crimes for them than against them how much more necessary is it to restrain the fury that kings who at the best are but fantastical fathers may exercise to the destruction of the whole people it is a folly to say that david and some other kings have had or that all should have as tender an affection toward their people as toward their children for besides that even the first proposition is not acknowledged and will be hardly verified in any one instance there is a vast distance between what men ought to be and what they are every man ought to be just true and charitable and if they were so laws would be of no use but it were a madness to abolish them upon a supposition that they are so or to leave them to a future punishment which many do not believe or not regard i am not obliged to believe that david loved every israelite as well as his son absalom but tho he had i could not from thence infer that all kings do so unless i were sure that all of them were as wise and virtuous as he  but to come more close to the matter do we not know of many kings who have come to their power by the most wicked means that can enter into the heart of man even by the most outrageous injurys done to the people sometimes by a foreign aid as kings were by the power of the romans imposed upon the britans that they might wast the forces and break the spirits of that fierce people this tacitus acknowledges and says inter instrumenta servitutis reges habuere tacit that among other instruments of inslaving nations they imposed kings upon them the medices were made masters of florence by the force of charles the fifths army sometimes by a corrupt party in their own country they have destroyed the best men and subdued the rest as agathocles dionysius and caesar did at rome and syracuse others taking upon them to defend a people have turned the arms with which they were entrusted against their own masters as francesco sforza who being chosen by those of milan to be their general against the venetians made peace with them and by their assistance made himself prince or in our authors phrase father of that great city if these be acts of tenderness love justice and charity those who commit them may well think they have gained the affections of their people and grow to love those from whom they fear nothing and by whom they think they are loved but if on the other hand they know they have attained to their greatness by the worst of all villanys and that they are on that account become the object of the public hatred they can do no less than hate and fear those by whom they know themselves to be hated the italians ordinarily say that chi fa inuria non perdona may he who dos an injury never pardons because he thinks he is never pardoned but he that enslaves and oppresses a people dos an injury which can never be pardoned and therefore fears it will be revenged  other princes who come to their thrones by better ways and are not contented with the power that the law allows draw the same hatred upon themselves when they endeavor by force or fraud to enlarge it and must necessarily fear and hate their own people as much as he who by the ways beforementioned has betrayed or subdued them our author makes nothing of this but taking it for granted that it was all one whether samuel spoke of a king or a tyrant declares that the same patient obedience is due to both but not being pleased to give any reason why we should believe him i intend to offer some why we should not  first there is nothing in the nature or institution of monarchy that obliges nations to bear the exorbitances of it when it degenerates into tyranny  in the second place we have no precept for it  thirdly we have many approved examples and occasional particular commands to the contrary    to the first the point of paternity being explained the duty of children to parents proved to proceed from the benefits received from them and that the power over them which at the first seems to have bin left at large because it was thought they would never abuse it has long since bin much restrained in all civilized nations and particularly in our own we may conclude that men are all made of the same paste and that one ows no more to another than another to him unless for some benefit received or by virtue of some promise made the duty arising from a benefit received must be proportionable to it that which grows from a promise is determined by the promise or contract made according to the true sense and meaning of it he therefore that would know what the babylonians hebrews athenians or romans did owe to nimrod saul theseus or romulus must inquire what benefits were received from them or what was promised to them it cannot be said that any thing was due to them for the sake of their parents they could have no prerogative by birth nimrod was the sixth son of chush the son of cham who was the youngest son of noah his kingdom was erected whilst noah and his elder sons shem and japhet as well as cham chush and his elder sons were still living saul was the son of chish a man of benjamin who was the youngest son of jacob and he was chosen in the most democratical way by lot amongst the whole people theseus according to the custom of the times pretended to be the son of neptune and rhea was so well pleased with the soldier that had gotten her with child that she resolved to think or say that mars was the father of the children that is to say they were bastards and therefore whatever was due to them was upon their own personal account without any regard to their progenitors this must be measured according to what they did for those nations before they were kings or by the manner of their advancement nothing can be pretended before they were kings nimrod rose up after the confusion of languages and the people that understood the tongue he spoke followed him saul was a young man unknown in israel theseus and romulus had nothing to recommend them before other athenians and romans except the reputation of their valor and the honors conferred upon them for that reason must proceed from expectation or hope and not from gratitude or obligation it must therefore proceed from the manner by which they came to be kings he that neither is nor has any title to be a king can come to be so only by force or by consent if by force he dos not confer a benefit upon the people but injures them in the most outrageous manner if it be possible therefore or reasonable to imagine that one man did ever subdue a multitude he can no otherwise resemble a father than the worst of all enemies who dos the greatest mischiefs resembles the best of all friends who confers the most inestimable benefits and consequently dos as justly deserve the utmost effects of hatred as the other dos of love respect and service if by consent he who is raised from amongst the people and placed above his brethren receives great honors and advantages but confers none the obligations of gratitude are on his side and whatsoever he dos in acknowledgment to his benefactors for their love to him is no more than his duty and he can demand no more from them than what they think fit to add to the favors already received if more be pretended it must be by virtue of that contract and can no otherwise be proved than by producing it to be examined that the true sense meaning and intention of it may be known  this contract must be in form and substance according to a general rule given to all mankind or such as is left to the will of every nation if a general one be pretended it ought to be shown that by inquiring into the contents we may understand the force and extent of it if this cannot be done it may justly pass for a fiction no conclusion can be drawn from it and we may be sure that what contracts soever have bin made between nations and their kings have bin framed according to the will of those nations and consequently how many soever they are and whatsoever the sense of any or all of them may be they can oblige no man except those or at the most the descendents of those that made them whoever therefore would persuade us that one or more nations are by virtue of those contracts bound to bear all the insolences of tyrants is obliged to show that by those contracts they did for ever indefinitely bind themselves so to do how great soever they might be  i may justly go a step farther and affirm that if any such should appear in the world the folly and turpitude of the thing would be a sufficient evidence of the madness of those that made it and utterly destroy the contents of it but no such having bin as yet produced nor any reason given to persuade a wise man that there has ever bin any such at least among civilized nations for whom only we are concerned it may be concluded there never was any or is there were they do not at all relate to our subject and consequently that nations still continue in their native liberty and are no otherwise obliged to endure the insolence of tyrants than they or each of them may esteem them tolerable    to the second tho the words of samuel had implied a necessity incumbent upon the hebrews to bear all the injurys that their kings should do to them it could no way relate to us for he dos not speak of all kings but of such as they had asked even such as reigned over the slavish asiaticks their neighbors who are no less infamous in the world for their baseness and cowardice than detestable for their idolatry and vices it was not a plot or trick of samuel to keep the government in himself and family such scurrilous expressions or thoughts are fit only for filmer heylin and their disciples but the prophet being troubled at the folly and wickedness of the people who chose rather to subject themselves to the irregular will of a man than to be governed by god and his law did by the immediate command of god declare to them what would be the event of their fury that since they would be like to their neighbors in sin and folly he told em they should be like to them in shame and misery since they desired to cast off the thing that was good they should suffer evil as the product of their own counsels and that when they should cry to the lord from a sense of their miserys he dos not tell them as our author falsely says they should have no other remedy against tyrants but crying and praying but that their cries and prayers should not be heard it was just that when they had rejected god he should reject them and leave them under the weight of the calamitys they had brought upon themselves in all other cases god had ever said that when his people returned to him he would hear and save them when they cried by reason of the oppressions they suffered under the egyptians cananites midianites philistines and others tho their crimes had deserved them all yet god heard and relieved them but when they meditated this final defection from his law and rejection of his government god seemed to change his nature and forget to be gracious when ye shall cry to me by reason of your king i will not hear you this was the strongest dehortation from their wicked intention that can be imagined but being not enough to reclaim them they answered nay but we will have a king they were like to their neighbors in folly and vice and would be like to them in government which brought all the calamitys upon them that the others suffered but i know not what conclusion can be drawn from hence in favor of our authors doctrine unless all nations are obliged furiously to run into the same crimes with the israelites or to take upon themselves the same punishment tho they do not commit the same crimes  if this was not a precept to the israelites instructing them what they should do but a denunciation of what they should suffer for the evil which they had committed the old testament will afford none and i hope in due time to answer such as he alleges from the new nay we may conclude there can be none there because being dictated by the same spirit which is always uniform and constant to it self it could not agree with the    th of deuteron which so extremely restrains such a king as god allowed as not to suffer him in any manner to raise his heart above his brethren and was said in vain if at the same time it gave him a power which might not be resisted or forbad others to resist him if he would not obey the law    to the third whatsoever was done by the command of god against pharaoh king of egypt and against the kings of the cananites midianites moabites edomites amorites or philistines by moses joshua ehud barak gideon sampson jephtha samuel and the rest of the judges comes expressly under the particular precepts and examples promised by me to show that god had occasionally commanded and his servants executed his commands in resisting and destroying the persons of kings who were their own kings also if possession was only to be regarded and tho this be sufficient to overthrow our authors doctrine that we are not to examine the titles of kings whether they be from usurpation or any other means but only to look upon the power yet they who seek truth ought not to content themselves merely with victory or to esteem that a victory which is obtained by what the schools call argumentum ad hominem grounded upon a false proposition and is of no force except against those who are so ill advised to advance it therefore laying aside the advantages that may be justly taken against filmer for the folly of asserting the same right to be in a usurper as in a lawful prince and confessing that tho such as have no title may and ought to be suppressed as enemies and robbers when respect and obedience is due to those who are rightly instituted i say that none can be claimed by a prince lawfully instituted if he assumes to himself a power which is not granted to him by the law of his institution quia eatnus non habt imperium de jur bell because as grotius says his legal power does not extend so far or turn the power that is given him to ends contrary to those for which it was given because he thereby destroys it and puts himself into the same condition as if it had never bin this is proved by the example of saul tho the people sinned grievously in asking a king yet god assenting to their demand no prince was ever more solemnly instituted than he the people chose him by lot from amongst all the tribes and he was placed in the throne by the general consent of the whole nation but he turning his lawful power into tyranny disobeying the word of the prophet slaying the priests sparing the amalekites and oppressing the innocent overthrew his own right and god declared the kingdom which had bin given him under a conditional promise of perpetuity to be entirely abrogated this did not only give a right to the whole people of opposing him but to every particular man and upon this account david did not only fly from his fury but resisted it he made himself head of all the discontented persons that would follow him he had at first four and afterward six hundred men he kept these in arms against saul lived upon the country and resolved to destroy nabal with all his house only for refusing to send provisions for his men finding himself weak and unsafe he went to achish the philistin and offered his service even against israel this was never reputed a sin in david or in those that followed him by any except the wicked courtflatterer doeg the edomite and the drunken fool nabal who is said to have bin a man of belial  if it be objected that this was rather a flight than a war in as much as he neither killed saul nor his men or that he made war as a king anointed by samuel i answer that he who had six hundred men and entertained as many as came to him sufficiently showed his intention rather to resist than to fly and no other reason can be given why he did not farther pursue that intention than that he had no greater power and he who arms six hundred men against his prince when he can have no more can no more be said to obey patiently than if he had so many hundreds of thousands this holds tho he kills no man for that is not the war but the manner of making it and twere as absurd to say david made no war because he killed no men as that charles the eighth made no war in italy because guicciardin says he conquered naples without breaking a lance but as davids strength increased he grew to be less sparing of blood those who say kings never die but that the right is immediately transferred to the next heirs cannot deny that ishbosheth inherited the right of saul and that david had no other right of making war against him than against saul unless it were conferred upon him by the tribe of judah that made him king if this be true it must be confessed that not only a whole people but a part of them may at their own pleasure abrogate a kingdom tho never so well established by common consent for none was ever more solemnly instituted than that of saul and few subjects have more strongly obliged themselves to be obedient if it be not true the example of nabal is to be followed and david tho guided by the spirit of god deserves to be condemned as a fellow that rose up against his master  if to elude this it be said that god instituted and abrogated readiness kingdom and that david to whom the right was transmitted might therefore proceed against him and his heirs as private men i answer that if the obedience due to saul proceeded from gods institution it can extend to none but those who are so peculiarly instituted and anointed by his command and the hand of his prophet which will be of little advantage to the kings that can give no testimony of such an institution or unction and an indisputable right will remain to every nation of abrogating the kingdoms which are instituted by and for themselves but as david resisted the authority of saul and ishbosheth without assuming the power of a king tho designed by god and anointed by the prophet till he was made king of judah by that tribe or arrogating to himself a power over the other tribes till he was made king by them and had entered into a covenant with them it is much more certain that the persons and authority of ill kings who have no title to the privileges due to saul by virtue of his institution may be justly resisted which is as much as is necessary to my purpose    samuel    object but davids heart smote him when he had cut off the skirt of readiness garment and he would not suffer abishai to kill him this might be of some force if it were pretended that every man was obliged to kill an ill king whenever he could do it which i think no man ever did say and no man having ever affirmed it no more can be concluded than is confessed by all but how is it possible that a man of a generous spirit like david could see a great and valiant king chosen from amongst all the tribes of israel anointed by the command of god and the hand of the prophet famous for victorys obtained against the enemies of israel and a wonderful deliverance thereby purchased to that people cast at his feet to receive life or death from the hand of one whom he had so furiously persecuted and from whom he least deserved and could least expect mercy without extraordinary commotion of mind most especially when abishai who saw all that he did and thereby ought best to have known his thoughts expressed so great a readiness to kill him this could not but make him reflect upon the instability of all that seemed to be most glorious in men and show him that if saul who had bin named even among the prophets and assisted in an extraordinary manner to accomplish such great things was so abandoned and given over to fury misery and shame he that seemed to be most firmly established ought to take care lest he should fall  surely these things are neither to be thought strange in relation to saul who was gods anointed nor communicable to such as are not some may suppose he was king by virtue of gods unction tho if that were true he had never bin chosen and made king by the people but it were madness to think he became gods anointed by being king for if that were so the same right and title would belong to every king even to those who by his command were accursed and destroyed by his servants moses joshua and samuel the same men at the same time and in the same sense would be both his anointed and accursed loved and detested by him and the most sacred privileges made to extend to the worst of his enemies  again the war made by david was not upon the account of being king as anointed by samuel but upon the common natural right of defending himself against the violence and fury of a wicked man he trusted to the promise that he should be king but knew that as yet he was not so and when saul found he had spared his life he said i now know well that thou shall surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall surely be established in thy hand not that it was already nay david himself was so far from taking upon him to be king till the tribe of judah had chosen him that he often acknowledged saul to be his lord when baanah and rechab brought the head of ishbosheth to him he commanded them to be slain because they had killed a righteous man upon his bed in   samuel   his own house which he could not have said if ishbosheth had unjustly detained from him the ten tribes and that he had a right to reign over them before they had chosen him the word of god did not make him king but only foretold that he should be king and by such ways as he pleased prepared the hearts of the people to set him up and till the time designed by god for that work was accomplished he pretended to no other authority than what the six hundred men who first followed him afterward the tribe of judah and at last all the rest of the people conferred upon him  i no way defend absaloms revolt he was wicked and acted wickedly but after his death no man was ever blamed or questioned for siding with him and amasa who commanded his army is represented in scripture as a good man even david saying that joab by slaying abner and amasa had killed two men who were better than himself which could   samuel  0  not have bin unless the people had a right of looking into matters of government and of redressing abuses tho being deceived by absalom they so far erred as to prefer him who was in all respects wicked before the man who except in the matter of vriah is said to be after gods own heart this right was acknowledged by david himself when he commanded hushai to say to absalom i will be thy servant o king and by   kings hushai in the following chapter nay but whom the lord and his people and all the men of israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide which could have no sense in it unless the people had a right of choosing and that the choice in which they generally concurred was esteemed to be from god  but if saul who was made king by the whole people and anointed by the command of god might be lawfully resisted when he departed from the law of his institution it cannot be doubted that any other for the like reason may be resisted if david tho designed by god to be king and anointed by the hand of the prophet was not king till the people had chosen him and he had made a covenant with them it will if i mistake not be hard to find a man who can claim a right which is not originally from them and if the people of israel could erect and pull down institute abrogate or transfer to other persons or familys kingdoms more firmly established than any we know the same right cannot be denied to other nations  sect ii the kings of israel and judah were under a law not safely to be transgrest our author might be pardoned if he only vented his own follys but he aggravates his crime by imputing them to men of more credit and tho i cannot look upon sir walter raleigh as a very good interpreter of scripture he had too much understanding to say that if practice declare the greatness of authority even the best kings of israel and judah were not tied to any law but they did whatsoever they pleased in the greatest matters for there is no sense in those words if practice declares the greatness of authority even the best of kings were tied to no law signifies nothing for practice cannot declare the greatness of authority peter the cruel of castille and christiern the   d of denmark killed whom they pleased but no man ever thought they had therefore a right to do so and if there was a law all were tied by it and the best were less likely to break it than the worst but if sir walter raleighs opinion which   l hist c    he calls a conjecture be taken there was so great a difference between the kings of israel and judah that as to their general proceedings in point of power hardly any thing can be said which may rightly be applied to both and he there endeavors to show that the reason why the ten tribes did not return to the house of david after the destruction of the houses of jeroboam and baasha was because they would not endure a power so absolute as that which was exercised by the house of david if he has therefore any where said that the kings did what they pleased it must be in the sense that moses maimonides says the kings of israel committed many extravagances because they were quia superbi erant cord impii and spretores legis mor nevoch insolent impious and despisers of the law but whatsoever sir walter raleigh may say for i do not remember his words and have not leisure to seek whether any ch are found in his books it is most evident they did not what they pleased the tribes that did not submit to david nor crown him till they thought fit and then made a covenant with him took care it might be observed whether he would or not absaloms rebellion followed by almost all israel was a terrible check to his will that of sheba the son of bichri was like to have bin worse if it had not bin suppressed by joabs diligence and david often confessed the sons of zerviah were too hard for him solomon indeed overthrowing the law given by moses multiplying gold and silver wives and horses introducing idolatry and lifting up his heart above his brethren did what he pleased but rehoboam paid for all the ten tribes revolted from him by reason of the heavy burdens laid upon them stoned adoram who was sent to levy the tributes and set up jeroboam who as sir walter raleigh says in the place before cited had no other title than the courtesy of the people and utterly rejected the house of david if practice therefore declares a right the practice of the people to avenge the injurys they suffered from their kings as soon as they found a man fit to be their leader shows they had a right of doing it  it is true the best of the kings with moses joshua and samuel may in one sense be said to have done what they pleased because they desired to do that only which was good but this will hardly be brought to confer a right upon all kings and i deny that even the kings of judah did what they pleased or that it were any thing to our question if they did zedekiah professed to the great men that is to the sanhedrin that without jerem    them he could do nothing when amaziah by his folly had brought a great slaughter upon the tribe of judah they conspired against him in public council whereupon he fled to lachish and they pursuing him   kings    thither killed him avowed the fact and it was neither questioned nor blamed which examples agree with the paraphrase of josephus on deuteronomy antiq jud    he shall do nothing without the consent of the sanhedrin and if he attempt it they shall hinder him this was the law of god not to be abrogated by man a law of liberty directly opposite to the necessity of submitting to the will of a man this was a gift bestowed by god upon his children and people whereas slavery was a great part of the curse denounced against cham for his wickedness and perpetually incumbent upon his posterity the great sanhedrin were constituted judges as grotius says most particularly of such matters as concerned their kings and maimonides affirms that the kings were judged by them the distribution of the power to the inferior sanhedrins in every tribe and city with the right of calling the people together in general assemblys as often as occasion required were the foundations of their liberty and being added to the law of the kingdom prescribed in the    th of deuteronomy if they should think fit to have a king established the freedom of that people upon a solid foundation and tho in their fury they did in a great measure wave the benefits god had bestowed upon em yet there was enough left to restrain the lusts of their kings ahab did not treat with naboth as with a servant whose person and estate depended upon his will and dos not seem to have bin so tenderhearted to grieve much for his refusal if by virtue of his royal authority he could have taken away his vineyard and his life but that failing he had no other way of accomplishing his design than by the fraud of his accursed wife and the perfidious wretches she employed and no better proof that it did fail can reasonably be required than that he was obliged to have recourse to such sordid odious and dangerous remedys but we are furnished with one that is more unquestionable have thou killed and also taken possession   kings    in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall they lick thy blood even thine this shows that the kings were not only under a law but under a law of equality with the rest of the people even that of retaliation he had raised his heart above his brethren but god brought him down and made him to suffer what he had done he was in all respects wicked but the justice of this sentence consisted in the law he had broken which could not have bin if he had bin subject to none but as this retaliation was the sum of all the judicial law given by god to his people the sentence pronounced against ahab in conformity to it and the execution committed to jehu shows that the kings were no less obliged to perform the law than other men tho they were not so easily punished for transgressing it as others were and if many of them did escape it perfectly agrees with what had bin foretold by samuel  sect iii samuel did not describe to the israelites the glory of a free monarchy but the evils the people should suffer that he might divert them from desiring a king tho no restraint had bin put upon the hebrew kings it could be no prejudice to any other nation they deflected from the law of god and rejecting him that he should reign over them no longer they fell into that misery which could affect none but those who enjoy the same blessings and with the same fury despise them if their kings had more power than consisted with their welfare they gave it and god renounces the institution of ye have chosen kings but not by me and princes but i know them not hos such he gave them a law of liberty and if they fell into the shame and misery that accompanys slavery it was their own work they were not obliged to have any king and could not without a crime have any but one who must not raise his heart above the rest of them this was taught by moses and samuel who spoke by the same spirit could not contradict him and in telling the people what such a king as they desired would do when he should be established he did announce to them the misery they would bring upon themselves by choosing such a one as he had forbidden this free monarchy which our author thinks to be so majestically described was not only displeasing to the prophet but declared by god to be a rejection of him and inconsistent with his reign over them this might have bin sufficient to divert any other people from their furious resolution but the prophet farther enforcing his dissuasion told them that god who had in all other cases bin their helper would not hear them when they should cry to him by reason of their king this is the majestic description of that free monarchy with which our author is so much pleased it was displeasing to the prophet hateful to god an aggravation of all the crimes they had committed since they came out of egypt and that which would bring as it did most certain and irreparable destruction upon them  but it seems the regal majesty in that age was in its infancy and little in comparison of that which we find described by tacitus suetonius and others in later times he shall take your sons says samuel and set them over his chariots and your daughters to make them confectioners and cooks but the majesty of the roman emperors was carried to a higher pitch of glory ahab could not without employing treachery and fraud get a small spot of ground for his money to make a garden of herbs but tiberius caligula and nero killed whom they pleased and took what they pleased of their estates when they had satiated their cruelty and avarice by the murders and confiscations of the most eminent and best men they commonly exposed their children to the lust of their slaves if the power of doing evil be glorious the utmost excess is its perfection and it is pity that samuel knew no more of the effects produced by unrestrained lust that he might have made the description yet more majestic and as nothing can be suffered by man beyond constupration torments and death instead of such trifles as he mentioned he might have showed them the effects of fury in its greatest exaltation  if it be good for a nation to live under such a power why did not god of his own goodness institute it did his wisdom and love to his people fail or if he himself had not set up the best government over them could he be displeased with them for asking it did he separate that nation from the rest of mankind to make their condition worse than that of others or can they be said to have sinned and rejected god when they desired nothing but the government which by a perpetual ordinance he had established over all the nations of the world is not the law of nature a rule which he has given to things and the law of mans nature which is reason an emanation of the divine wisdom or some footsteps of divine light remaining in us is it possible that this which is from god can be contrary to his will and can he be offended with those who desire to live in a conformity to that law or could it justly be said the people had chosen that which is not good if nothing in government be good but what they chose  but as the worst men delight in the worst things and fools are pleased with the most extreme absurditys our author not only gives the highest praises to that which bears so many marks of gods hatred but after having said that abraham isaac jacob and moses were kings he tells us the israelites begged a king of samuel which had bin impertinent if the magistrates instituted by the law were kings and tho it might be a folly in them to ask what they had already it could be no sin to desire that which they enjoyed by the ordinance of god if they were not kings it follows that the only government set up by god amongst men wanted the principal part even the head and foundation from whence all the other parts have their action and being that is gods law is against gods law and destroys it self  but if god did neither by a general and perpetual ordinance establish over all nations the monarchy which samuel describes nor prescribe it to his own people by a particular command it was purely the peoples creature the production of their own fancy conceived in wickedness and brought forth in iniquity an idol set up by themselves to their own destruction in imitation of their accursed neighbors and their reward was no better than the concession of an impious petition which is one of gods heaviest judgments samuels words are acknowledged by all interpreters who were not malicious or mad to be a dissuasion from their wicked purpose not a description of what a king might justly do by virtue of his office but what those who should be set up against god and his law would do when they came to have the power in their hands and i leave such as have the understandings of men and are not abandoned by god to judge what influence this ought to have upon other nations either as to obligation or imitation  sect iv no people can be obliged to suffer from their kings what they have not a right to do our authors next work is to tell us that the scope of samuel was to teach the people a dutiful obedience to their king even in the things that they think mischievous or inconvenient for by telling them what the king would do he indeed instructs them what a subject must suffer yet not so that it is right for kings to do injury but it is right for them to go unpunished by the people if they do it so that in this point it is all one whether samuel describe a king or a tyrant this is hard but the conclusion is grounded upon nothing there is no relation between a prediction that a thing shall be attempted or done to me and a precept that i shall not defend my self or punish the person that attempts or dos it if a prophet should say that a thief lay in the way to kill me it might reasonably persuade me not to go or to go in such a manner as to be able to defend my self but can no way oblige me to submit to the violence that shall be offered or my friends and children not to avenge my death if i fall much less can other men be deprived of the natural right of defending themselves by my imprudence or obstinacy in not taking the warning given whereby i might have preserved my life for every man has a right of resisting some way or other that which ought not to be done to him and tho human laws do not in all cases make men judges and avengers of the injurys offered to them i think there is none that dos not justify the man who kills another that offers violence to him if it appears that the way prescribed by the law for the preservation of the innocent cannot be taken this is not only true in the case of outrageous attempts to assassinate or rob on the high way but in diverse others of less moment i knew a man who being appointed to keep his masters park killed three men in one night that came to destroy his deer and putting himself into the hands of the magistrate and confessing the fact both in matter and manner he was at the public assizes not only acquitted but commended for having done his duty and this in a time when it is well known justice was severely administered and little favor expected by him or his master nay all laws must fall human societys that subsist by them be dissolved and all innocent persons be exposed to the violence of the most wicked if men might not justly defend themselves against injustice by their own natural right when the ways prescribed by public authority cannot be taken  our author may perhaps say this is true in all except the king and i desire to know why if it be true in all except the king it should not be true in relation to him is it possible that he who is instituted for the obtaining of justice should claim the liberty of doing injustice as a privilege were it not better for a people to be without law than that a power should be established by law to commit all manner of violences with impunity did not david resist those of saul did he not make himself head of the tribe of judah when they revolted against his son and afterward of the ten tribes that rejected his posterity did not the israelites stone adoram who collected the taxes revolt from the house of david set up jeroboam and did not the prophet say it was from the lord if it was from the lord was it not good if it was good then is it not so for ever did good proceed from one root then and from another now if god had avenged the blood of naboth by fire from heaven and destroyed the house of ahab as he did the two captains and their men who were sent to apprehend elijah it might be said he reserved that vengeance to himself but he did it by the sword of jehu and the army which was the people who had set him up for an example to others  but it is good to examine what this dutiful obedience is that our author mentions men usually owe no more than they receive it is hard to know what the israelites owed to saul david jeroboam ahab or any other king whether good or bad till they were made kings and the actof the people by which so great a dignity was conferred seems to have laid a duty upon them who did receive more than they had to give so that something must be due from them unless it were released by virtue of a covenant or promise made and none could accrue to them from the people afterward unless from the merit of the person in rightly executing his office if a covenant or promise be pretended the nature and extent of the obligation can only be known by the contents expressed or the true intention of it if there be a general form of covenant set and agreed upon to which all nations must submit it were good to know where it may be found and by whose authority it is established and then we may examine the sense of it if no such do appear we may rationally look upon those to be impostors who should go about from thence to derive a right and as that which dos not appear is as if it were not we may justly conclude there is no other or none that can have any effect but such as have bin made by particular nations with their princes which can be of no force or obligation to others nor to themselves any farther than according to the true intention of those that made them there is no such thing therefore as a dutiful obedience or duty of being obedient incumbent upon all nations by virtue of any covenant nor upon any particular nation unless it be expressed by a covenant and whoever pretends to a right of taking our sons and daughters lands or goods or to go unpunished if he do must show that these things are expressed or intended by the covenant  but tho nations for the most part owe nothing to kings till they are kings and that it can hardly be conceived that any people did ever owe so much to a man as might not be fully repaid by the honor and advantages of such an advancement yet it is possible that when they are made kings they may by their good government lay such obligations upon their subjects as ought to be recompensed by obedience and service there is no mortal creature that deserves so well from mankind as a wise valiant diligent and just king who as a father cherishes his people as a shepherd feeds defends and is ready to lay down his life for his flock who is a terror to evil doers and a praise to those that do well this is a glorious prerogative and he who has it is happy but before this can be adjudgd to belong to all it must be proved that all have the virtues that deserve it and he that exacts the dutiful obedience that arises from them must prove that they are in him he that dos this need not plead for impunity when he dos injurys for if he do them he is not the man we speak of not being so he can have no title to the duty by human institution or covenant nor by divine law since as is already proved god has neither established kings over all nations by precept nor recommended them by example in setting them over his own people he has not therefore done it at all there is no such thing in nature and nations can owe nothing to kings merely as kings but what they owe by the contract made with them  as these contracts are made voluntarily without any previous obligation it is evident that men make them in consideration of their own good and they can be of force no longer than he with whom they are made perform his part in procuring it and that if he turn the power which was given to him for the public good to the public inconvenience and damage he must necessarily lose the benefit he was to receive by it the word think is foolishly and affectedly put in by our author for those matters are very often so evident that even the weakest know them no great sagacity is required to understand that lewd slothful ignorant false unjust covetous and cruel princes bring inconveniences and mischiefs upon nations and many of them are so evidently guilty of some or all these vices that no man can be mistaken in imputing them and the utmost calamitys may rationally be expected from them unless a remedy be applied  but says he samuel by telling them what the king would do instructs them what the subjects must suffer and that it is right he should go unpunished but by his favor samuel says no such thing neither is it to be concluded that because a king will do wickedly he must be suffered any more than a private man who should take the same resolution but he told them that when they should cry to the lord by reason of their king he would not hear them this was as much as to say their ruin was unavoidable and that having put the power into the hands of those who instead of protecting would oppress them and thereby having provoked god against them so as he would not hearken to their cries they could have no relief but this was no security to the authors of their calamity the houses of jeroboam baasha and omri escaped not unpunished tho the people did not thereby recover their liberty the kings had introduced a corruption that was inconsistent with it but they who could not settle upon a right foundation to prevent future mischiefs could avenge such as they had suffered upon the heads of those who had caused em and frequently did it most severely the like besel the romans when by the violence of tyranny all good order was overthrown good discipline extinguished and the people corrupted ill princes could be cut in pieces and mischiefs might be revenged tho not prevented but it is not so every where nor at all times and nothing is more irrational than from one or a few examples to conclude a general necessity of future events they alter according to circumstances and as some nations by destroying tyrants could not destroy tyranny others in removing the tyrant have cut up tyranny by the roots this variety has bin seen in the same nation at different times the romans recovered their liberty by expelling tarquin but remained slaves notwithstanding the slaughter of caesar whilst the body of the people was uncorrupted they cured the evil wrought by the person in taking him away it was no hard matter to take the regal power that by one man had bin enjoyed for life and to place it in the hands of two annual magistrates whilst the nobility and people were according to the condition of that age strong and ready to maintain it but when the mischief had taken deeper root when the best part of the people had perished in the civil wars when all their eminent men had fallen in battle or by the proscriptions when their discipline was lost and virtue abolished the poor remains of the distressed people were brought under the power of a mercenary soldiery and found no relief when they killed one tyrant they often made room for a worse it availed them nothing to cut off a rotten branch whilst the accursed root remained and sent forth new sprouts of the same nature to their destruction other generous nations have bin subdued beyond a possibility of recovery and those that are naturally base slide into the like misery without the impulse of an exterior power they are slaves by nature and have neither the understanding nor courage that is required for the constitution and management of a government within themselves they can no more subsist without a master than a flock without a shepherd they have no comprehension of liberty and can neither desire the good they do not know nor enjoy it if it were bestowed upon them they bear all burdens and whatever they suffer they have no other remedy or refuge than in the mercy of their lord but such nations as are naturally strong stout and of good understanding whose vigor remains unbroken manners uncorrupted reputation unblemished and increasing in numbers who neither want men to make up such armies as may defend em against foreign or domestic enemies nor leaders to head them do ordinarily set limits to their patience they know how to preserve their liberty or to vindicate the violation of it and the more patient they have bin the more inflexible they are when they resolve to be so no longer those who are so foolish to put them upon such courses do to their cost find there is a difference between lions and asses and he is a fool who knows not that ignoratque datos ne quisquam serviat enses lucan swords were given to men that none might be slaves but such as know not how to use them  sect v the mischiefs suffered from wicked kings are such as render it both reasonable and just for all nations that have virtue and power to exert both in repelling them if our author deserve credit we need not examine whether nations have a right of resisting or a reasonable hope of succeeding in their endeavors to prevent or avenge the mischiefs that are feared or suffered for it is not worth their pains the inconveniences says he and miserys which are reckoned up by samuel as belonging to kingly government were not intolerable but such as have bin and still are born by the subjects free consent from their princes nay at this day and in this land many tenants by their tenures are tied unto the same subjection even unto subordinate and inferior lords he is an excellent advocate for kingly government that accounts inconveniences and miserys to be some of the essentials of it which others esteem to be only incidents tho many princes are violent and wicked yet some have bin gentle and just tho many have brought misery upon nations some have bin beneficial to them and they who are esteemed most severe against monarchy think the evils often suffered under that form of government proceed from the corruption of it or deviation from the principle of its institution and that they are rather to be imputed to the vices of the person than to the thing it self but if our author speak truth it is universally and eternally naught inconvenience and misery belong to it  he thinks to mend this by saying they are not intolerable but what is intolerable if inconveniences and miserys be not for what end can he think governments to have bin established unless to prevent or remove inconveniences and miserys or how can that be called a government which dos not only permit but cause them what can incline nations to set up governments is it that they may suffer inconveniences and be brought to misery or if it be to enjoy happiness how can that subsist under a government which not by accident deflection or corruption but by a necessity inherent in it self causes inconveniences and miserys if it be pretended that no human constitution can be altogether free from inconveniences i answer that the best may to some degree fall into them because they may be corrupted but evil and misery can properly belong to none that is not evil in its own nature if samuel deserve credit or may be thought to have spoken sense he could not have enumerated the evils which he foresaw the people should suffer from their kings nor say that they should cry to the lord by reason of them unless they were in themselves grievous and in comparison greater than what they had suffered or known since that would not have diverted them from their intention but rather have confirmed em in it and i leave it to our author to show why any people should for the pleasure of one or a few men erect or suffer that government which brings more of evil with it than any other  moreover there is a great difference between that which nations sometimes suffer under kings and that which they willingly suffer most especially if our authors maxim be received that all laws are the mandates of kings and the subjects libertys and privileges no more than their gracious concessions for how patient soever they are under the evils they suffer it might reasonably be believed they are so because they know not how to help it and this is certainly the case of too many places that are known to us whoever doubts of this if he will not put himself to the trouble of going to turkey or morocco let him pass only into normandy and ask the naked barefooted and halfstarvd people whether they are willing to suffer the miserys under which they groan and whether the magnificence of versailles and the pomp of their haughty master do any way alleviate their calamitys if this also be a matter of too much pains the wretches that come hither every day will inform him that it is not by their own consent they are deprived of all honors and offices in the commonwealth even of those which by a corrupt custom that had gained the force of a law they had dearly bought prohibited to exercise any trade exposed to the utmost effects of fraud and violence if they refuse to adore their masters idols they will tell him that it is not willingly they leave their lands and estates to seek a shelter in the most remote parts of the world but because they are under a force which they are notable to resist and because one part of the nation which is enriched with the spoils of the other have foolishly contributed to lay a yoke upon them which they cannot break  to what he says concerning tenures i answer no man in england ows any service to his lord unless by virtue of a contract made by himself or his predecessors under which he holds the land granted to him on that condition by the proprietor there may be something of hardship but nothing of injustice it is a voluntary act in the beginning and continuance and all men know that what is done to one who is willing volenti non fit injuria is no injury he who did not like the conditions was not obliged to take the land and he might leave it if afterward he came to dislike them if any man say the like may be done by any one in the kingdom i answer that it is not always true the protestants now in france cannot without extreme hazard go out of that country tho they are contented to lose their estates it is accounted a crime for which they are condemned perpetually to the gallys and such as are aiding to them to grievous fines but before this be acknowledged to have any similitude or relation to our discourse concerning kings it must be proved that the present king or those under whom he claims is or were proprietors of all the lands in england and granted the several parcels under the condition of suffering patiently such inconveniences and miserys as are abovementioned or that they who did confer the crown upon any of them did also give a propriety in the land which i do not find in any of the fifteen or sixteen titles that have bin since the coming in of the normans and if it was not done to the first of every one it cannot accrue to the others unless by some new act to the same purpose which will not easily be produced  it will be no less difficult to prove that any thing unworthy of freemen is by any tenures imposed in england unless it be the offering up of the wives and daughters of tenants to the lust of abbots and monks and they are so far from being willingly suffered that since the dens and nurserys of those beasts were abolished no man that succeeds them has had impudence sufficient to exact the performance and tho the letter of the law may favor them the turpitude of the thing has extinguished the usage  but even the kings of israel and judah who brought upon the people those evils that had bin foretold by samuel did not think they had a right to the powers they exercised if the law had given a right to ahab to take the best of their vineyards he might without ceremony have taken that of naboth and by the majestic power of an absolute monarch have chastisd the churlish clown who refused to sell or change it for another but for want of it he was obliged to take a very different course if the lives of subjects had in the like manner depended on the will of kings david might without scruple have killed vriah rather than to place him in the front of the army that he might fall by his own courage the malice and treachery of such proceedings argues a defect of power and he that acts in such an oblique manner shows that his actions are not warranted by the law which is boldly executed in the face of the sun this shows the interpretation put upon the words against thee only have i sinned by courtflatterers to be false for if he had not sinned against bathsheba whom he corrupted vriah whom he caused to be killed the people that he scandalized and the law which he violated he had never endeavored to cover his guilt by so vile a fraud and as he did not thereby fly the sight of god but of men it is evident that in that action he feared men more than god  if by the examples of israel and judah we may judge whether the inconveniences and miserys brought upon nations by their kings be tolerable or intolerable it will be enough to consider the madness of readiness cruelty toward his subjects and the slaughter brought upon them by the hand of the philistines on mount gilboa where he fell with the flower of all israel the civil wars that happened in the time of david and the plague brought upon the people by his wickedness the heavy burdens laid upon them by solomon and the idolatry favored by him the wretched folly of rehoboam and the defection of the ten tribes caused by it the idolatry established by jeroboam and the kings of israel with that of many of those of judah also the frequent wars and unheard of slaughters ensuing thereupon between the tribes the daily devastations of the country by all sorts of strangers the murders of the prophets the abolition of gods worship the desolation of towns and provinces the dispersion of the ten tribes carried away into unknown countries and in the end the abolition of both kingdoms with the captivity of the tribe of judah and the utter destruction of the city it cannot be said that these things were suffered under kings and not from or by them for the desolation of the citys people and country is in many places of scripture imputed to the kings that taught israel to sin as appears by   king      king      king  0 what was denounced against jeroboam jehu ahaz manasseh zedekiah and others nay the captivity of babylon with the evils ensuing were first announcd to hezekiah for his vanity and josiah by the like brought a great slaughter upon himself and people but if mischiefs fell upon the people by the frailty of these who after david were the best nothing surely less than the utmost of all miserys could be expected from such as were set to do evil and to make the nation like to themselves in which they met with too great success  if it be pretended that gods people living under an extraordinary dispensation can be no example to us i desire other historys may be examined for i confess i know no nation so great happy and prosperous nor any power so well established that two or three ill kings immediately succeeding each other have not bin able to destroy and bring to such a condition that it appeared the nations must perish unless the senats diets and other assemblys of state had put a stop to the mischief by restraining or deposing them and tho this might be proved by innumerable testimonys i shall only say that the roman empire perished by the vices corruption and baseness of their princes the noble kingdom of the goths in spain was overthrown by the tyranny of witza and rodrigo the present state of spain now languishes and threatens ruin from the same causes france was brought to the last degree of misery and weakness by the degenerate races of pharamond and charles to which may be added those of our own country which are so well known that i need not mention them  sect vi it is not good for such nations as will have kings to suffer them to be glorious powerful or abounding in riches our author having hitherto spoken of all nations as born under a necessity of being subject to absolute monarchy which he pretends to have bin set up by the universal and indispensible law of god and nature now seems to leave to their discretion whether they will have a king or not but says that those who will have a king are bound to allow him royal maintenance by providing revenues for the crown since it is for the honor profit and safety of the people to have their king glorious powerful and abounding in riches if there be any thing of sense in this clause there is nothing of truth in the foundation or principle of his whole book for as the right and being of a father is natural or inherent and no ways depending upon the will of the child that of a king is so also if he be and ought to enjoy the rights belonging to the father of the people and it is not less ridiculous to say those who will have a king than it would be to say he that will have a father for every one must have one whether he will or not but if the king be a father as our author from thence infers that all laws are from him none can be imposed upon him and whatsoever the subject enjoys is by his concessions it is absurd to speak of an obligation lying upon the people to allow him royal maintenance by providing revenues since he has all in himself and they have nothing that is not from him and depending upon his will for this reason a worthy gentleman of the house of commons in the year    0 desired that the business of the judges who in the star chamber had given for their opinion concerning shipmony that in cases of necessity the king might provide it by his own authority and that he was judge of that necessity might be first examined that they might know whether they had any thing to give before they should speak of giving and as it is certain that if the sentence of those perjured wretches had stood the subjects of england by consequence would have bin sound to have nothing to give it is no less sure that if our authors principle concerning the paternal and absolute power of kings be true it will by a more compendious way appear that it is not left to the choice of any nation whether they will have a king or not for they must have him and can have nothing to allow him but must receive all from him  but if those only who will have a king are bound to have one and to allow this royal maintenance such as will not have a king are by one and the same act delivered from the necessity of having one and from providing maintenance for him which utterly overthrows the magnificent fabric of paternal monarchy and the kings who were lately represented by our author placed on the throne by god and nature and endowed with an absolute power over all appear to be purely the creatures of the people and to have nothing but what is received from them  from hence it may be rationally inferred that qui dat esse dat modum esse he who makes a thing to be makes it to be only what he pleases this must hold in relation to kings as well as other magistrates and as they who made consuls dictators and military tribuns gave them only such power and for such a time as best pleased themselves it is impossible they should not have the same right in relation to kings in making them what they please as well as not to make them unless they please except there be a charm belonging to the name or the letters that compose it which cannot belong to all nations for they are different in every one according to the several languages  but says our author it is for the honor profit and safety of the people that the king should be glorious powerful and abounding in riches there is therefore no obligation upon them and they are to judge whether it be so or not the scripture says plainly the contrary he shall not multiply silver and gold wives and horses he shall not lift up his heart above his brethren he shall not therefore be glorious powerful or abounding in riches reason and experience teach us the same thing if those nations that have bin proud luxurious and vicious have desired by pomp and riches to foment the vices of their princes thereby to cherish their own such as have excelled in virtue and good discipline have abhorred it and except the immediate exercise of their office have kept their supreme magistrates to a manner of living little different from that of private men and it had bin impossible to maintain that frugality in which the integrity of their manners did chiefly consist if they had set up an example directly contrary to it in him who was to be an example to others or to provide for their own safety if they had overthrown that integrity of manners by which it could only be obtained and preserved there is a necessity incumbent upon every nation that lives in the like principle to put a stop to the entrance of those vices that arise from the superfluity of riches by keeping their kings in that honest poverty which is the mother and nurse of modesty sobriety and all manner of virtue and no man can deny this to be well done unless he will affirm that pride luxury and vice is more profitable to a nation than the virtues that are upheld by frugality  there is another reason of no less importance to those nations who tho they think fit to have kings yet desire to preserve their liberty which obliges them to set limits to the glory power and riches of their kings and that is that they can no otherwise be kept within the rules of the law men are naturally propense to corruption and if he whose will and interest it is to corrupt them be furnished with the means he will never fail to do it power honors riches and the pleasures that attend them are the baits by which men are drawn to prefer a personal interest before the public good and the number of those who covet them is so great that he who abounds in them will be able to gain so many to his service as shall be sufficient to subdue the rest it is hard to find a tyranny in the world that has not bin introduced this way for no man by his own strength could ever subdue a multitude none could ever bring many to be subservient to his ill designs but by the rewards they received or hoped by this means caesar accomplished his work and overthrew the liberty of his country and with it all that was then good in the world they who were corrupted in their minds desired to put all the power and riches into his hands that he might distribute them to such as served him and he who was nothing less than covetous in his own nature desired riches that he might gain followers and by the plunder of gaul he corrupted those that betrayed rome to him and tho i do not delight to speak of the affairs of our own time i desire those who know the present state of france to tell me whether it were possible for the king to keep that nation under servitude if a vast revenue did not enable him to gain so many to his particular service as are sufficient to keep the rest in subjection and if this be not enough let them consider whether all the dangers that now threaten us at home do not proceed from the madness of those who gave such a revenue as is utterly unproportionable to the riches of the nation unsuitable to the modest behavior expected from our kings and which in time will render parliaments unnecessary to them  on the other hand the poverty and simplicity of the spartan kings was no less safe and profitable to the people than truly glorious to them agesilaus denied that artaxerxes was greater than he unless he were more temperate or more valiant and he made good his words so well that without any other assistance than what his wisdom and valor afforded he struck such a terror into that great rich powerful and absolute monarch that he did not think himself safe in babylon or ecbatane till the poor spartan was by a captain of as great valor and greater poverty obliged to return from asia to the defense of his own country this was not peculiar to the severe laconic discipline when the roman kings were expelled a few carts were prepared to transport their goods and their lands which were consecrated to mars and now go under the name of campus martius hardly contain ten acres of ground nay the kings of israel who led such vast armies into the field that is were followed by all the people who were able to bear arms seem to have possessed little ahab one of the most powerful was so fond of naboths vineyard which being the inheritance of his fathers according to their equal division of lands could not be above two acres that he grew sick when it was refused  but if an allowance is to be made to every king it must be either according to a universal rule or standard or must depend upon the judgment of nations if the first they who have it may do well to produce it if the other every nation proceeding according to the measure of their own discretion is free from blame  it may also be worth observation whether the revenue given to a king be in such manner committed to his care that he is obliged to employ it for the public service without the power of alienation or whether it be granted as a propriety to be spent as he thinks fit when some of the ancient jews and christians scrupled the payment of tribute to the emperors the reasons alleged to persuade them to a compliance seem to be grounded upon a supposition of the first for said they the defense of the state lies upon them which cannot be performed without armies and garrisons these cannot be maintained without pay nor money raised to pay them without tributes and customs this carrys a face of reason with it especially in those countries which are perpetually or frequently subject to invasions but this will not content our author he speaks of employing the revenue in keeping the kings house and looks upon it as a propriety to be spent as he thinks convenient which is no less than to cast it into a pit of which no man ever knew the bottom that which is given one day is squandered away the next the people are always oppressed with impositions to foment the vices of the court these daily increasing they grow insatiable and the miserable nations are compelled to hard labor in order to satiate those lusts that tend to their own ruin  it may be considered that the virtuous  saevior armis luxuria incubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem lucan  pagans by the light of nature discovered the truth of this poverty grew odious in rome when great men by desiring riches put a value upon them and introduced that pomp and luxury which could not be born by men of small fortunes nullum crimen abest facinusque libidinis ex quo paupertas romana perit juvenal  from thence all furys and mischiefs seemed to break loose the base slavish and so often subdued asia by the basest of men revenged the defeats they had received from the bravest and by infusing into them a delight in pomp and luxury in a short time rendered the strongest and bravest of nations the weakest and basest i wish our own experience did not too plainly manifest that these evils were never more prevalent than in our days when the luxury majestic pomp and absolute power of a neighboring king must be supported by an abundance of riches torn out of the bowels of his subjects which renders them in the best country of the world and at a time when the crown most flourishes the poorest and most miserable of all the nations under the sun we too well know who are most apt to learn from them and by what means and steps they endeavor to lead us into the like misery but the bird is safe when the snare is discovered and if we are not abandoned by god to destruction we shall never be brought to consent to the settling of that pomp which is against the practice of all virtuous people and has brought all the nations that have bin taken with it into the ruin that is intended for us  sect vii when the israelites asked for such a king as the nations about them had they asked for a tyrant tho they did not call him so now that saul was no tyrant says our author note that the people asked a king as all nations had god answers and bids samuel to hear the voice of the people in all things which they spoke and appoint them a king they did not ask a tyrant and to give them a tyrant when they asked a king had not bin to hear their voice in all things but rather when they asked an egg to have given them a scorpion unless we will say that all nations had tyrants but before he drew such a conclusion he should have observed that god did not give them a scorpion when they asked an egg but told them that was a scorpion which they called an egg they would have a king to judge them to go out before them and to fight their battles but god in effect told them he would overthrow all justice and turn the power that was given him to the ruin of them and their posterity but since they would have it so he commanded samuel to hearken to their voice and for the punishment of their sin and folly to give them such a king as they asked that is one who would turn to his own profit and their misery the power with which he should be entrusted and this truly denominates a tyrant aristotle makes no other distinction between a king and a tyrant than that the king governs for the good of the people the tyrant for his own pleasure or profit and they who asked such a one asked a tyrant tho they called him a king this is all could be done in their language for as they who are skilled in the oriental tongues assure me there is no name for a tyrant in any of them or any other way of expressing the thing than by circumlocution and adding proud insolent lustful cruel violent or the like epithets to the word lord or king they did in effect ask a tyrant they would not have such a king as god had ordained but such a one as the nations had not that all nations had tyrants but those who were round about them of whom they had knowledge and which in their manner of speaking went under the name of all were blessed with such masters this way of expression was used by lots daughters who said there was not a man in all the earth to come in to them because there was none in the neighborhood with whom it was thought fit they should accompany now that the eastern nations were then and are still under the government of those which all free people call tyrants is evident to all men god therefore in giving them a tyrant or rather a government that would turn into tyranny gave them what they asked under another name and without any blemish to the mercy promised to their fathers suffered them to bear the penalty of their wickedness and folly in rejecting him that he should not reign over them  but tho the name of tyrant was unknown to them yet in greece from whence the word comes it signified no more than one who governed according to his own will distinguished from kings that governed by law and was not taken in an ill sense till those who had bin advanced for their justice wisdom and valor or their descendents were found to depart from the ends of their institution and to turn that power to the oppression of the people which had bin given for their protection but by these means it grew odious and that kind of government came to be thought only tolerable by the basest of men and those who destroyed it were in all places esteemed to be the best  if monarchy had bin universally evil god had not in the    th of deuteronomy given leave to the israelites to set up a king and if that kind of king had bin asked he had not bin displeased and they could not have bin said to reject god if they had not asked that which was evil for nothing that is good is contrary or inconsistent with a peoples obedience to him the monarchy they asked was displeasing to god it was therefore evil but a tyrant is no more than an evil or corrupted monarch the king therefore that they demanded was a tyrant god in granting one who would prove a tyrant gave them what they asked and that they might know what they did and what he would be he told em they rejected him and should cry by reason of the king they desired  this denotes him to be a tyrant for as the government of a king ought to be gentle and easy tending to the good of the people resembling the tender care of a father to his family if he who is set up to be a king and to be like to that father dos lay a heavy yoke upon the people and use them as slaves and not as children he must renounce all resemblance of a father and be accounted an enemy  but says our author whereas the peoples crying argues some tyrannical oppression we may remember that the peoples cries are not always an argument of their living under a tyrant no man will say solomon was a tyrant yet all the congregation complained that solomon made their yoke grievous it is strange that when children nay when whelps cry it should be accounted a mark that they are troubled and that the cry of the whole people should be none or that the government which is erected for their ease should not be esteemed tyrannical if it prove grievous to those it should relieve but as i know no example of a people that did generally complain without cause our adversarys must alledg some other than that of solomon before i believe it of any we are to speak reverently of him he was excellent in wisdom he built the temple and god appeared twice to him but it must be confessed that during a great part of his life he acted directly contrary to the law given by god to kings and that his ways were evil and oppressive to the people if those of god were good kings were forbidden to multiply horses wives silver and gold but he brought together more silver and gold and provided more horses wives and concubines than any man is known to have had and tho he did not actually return to egypt yet he introduced their abominable idolatry and so far raised his heart above his brethren that he made them subservient to his pomp and glory the people might probably be pleased with a great part of this but when the yoke became grievous and his foolish son would not render it more easy they threw it off and the thing being from the lord it was good unless he be evil  but as just governments are established for the good of the governed and the israelites desired a king that it might be well with them not with him who was not yet known to them that which exalts one to the prejudice of those that made him must always be evil and the people that suffers the prejudice must needs know it better than any other he that denies this may think the state of france might have bin best known from bulion the late treasurer who finding lewis the thirteenth to be troubled at the peoples misery told him they were too happy since they were not reduced to eat grass but if words are to be understood as they are ordinarily used and we have no other than that of tyranny to express a monarchy that is either evil in the institution or fallen into corruption we may justly call that tyranny which the scripture calls a grievous yoke and which neither the old nor the new counselors of rehoboam could deny to be so for tho the first advised him to promise amendment and the others to do worse yet all agreed that what the people said was true  this yoke is always odious to such as are not by natural stupidity and baseness fitted for it but those who are so never complain an ass will bear a multitude of blows patiently but the least of them drives a lion into rage he that said the rod is made for the back of fools confessed that oppression will make a wise man mad and the most unnatural of all oppressions is to use lions like asses and to lay that yoke upon a generous nation which only the basest can deserve and for want of a better word we call this tyranny  our author is not contented to vindicate solomon only but extends his indulgence to saul his custom is to patronize all that is detestable and no better testimony could be given of it it is true says he saul lost his kingdom but not for being too cruel or tyrannical to his subjects but for being too merciful to his enemies but he alleges no other reason than that the slaughter of the priests is not blamed not observing that the writers of the scripture in relating those things that are known to be abominable by the light of nature frequently say no more of them and if this be not so lots drunkenness and incest reubens pollution of his fathers bed abimelechs slaughter of his seventy brothers and many of the most wicked acts that ever were committed may pass for laudable and innocent but if saul were not to be blamed for killing the priests why was david blamed for the death of thou have killed uriah with the sword of the children of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house   samuel    vriah why were the dogs to lick the blood of ahab and jezebel if they did nothing more than kings might do without blame now if the slaughter of one man was so severely avenged upon the authors and their familys none but such as filmer can think that of so many innocent men with their wives and children could escape unreprovd or unpunished but the whole series of the history of saul showing evidently that his life and reign were full of the most violent cruelty and madness we are to seek no other reason for the ruin threatened and brought upon him and his family and as those princes who are most barbarously savage against their own people are usually most gentle to the enemies of their country he could not give a more certain testimony of his hatred to those he ought to have protected than by preserving those nations who were their most irreconcilable enemies this is proved by reason as well as by experience for every man knows he cannot bear the hatred of all mankind such as know they have enemies abroad endeavor to get friends at home those who command powerful nations and are beloved by them fear not to offend strangers but if they have rendered their own people enemies to them they cannot hope for help in a time of distress nor so much as a place of retreat or refuge unless from strangers nor from them unless they deserve it by favoring them to the prejudice of their own country as no man can serve two masters no man can pursue two contrary interests moses joshua gideon and samuel were severe to the amorites midianites and cananites but mild and gentle to the hebrews saul who was cruel to the hebrews spared the amalekites whose preservation was their destruction and whilst he destroyed those he should have saved and saved those that by a general and particular command of god he should have destroyed he lost his ill governed kingdom and left an example to posterity of the end that may be expected from pride folly and tyranny  the matter would not be much altered if i should confess that in the time of saul all nations were governed by tyrants tho it is not true for greece did then flourish in liberty and we have reason to believe that other nations did so also for tho they might not think of a good government at the first nothing can oblige men to continue under one that is bad when they discover the evils of it and know how to mend it they who trusted men that appeared to have great virtues with such a power as might easily be turned into tyranny might justly retract limit or abolish it when they found it to be abused and tho no condition had bin reserved the public good which is the end of all salus populi suprema lex government had bin sufficient to abrogate all that should tend to the contrary as the malice of men and their inventions to do mischief increase daily all would soon be brought under the power of the worst if care were not taken and opportunitys embraced to find new ways of preventing it he that should make war at this day as the best commanders did two hundred years past would be beaten by the meanest soldier the places then accounted impregnable are now slighted as indefensible and if the arts of defending were not improved as well as those of assaulting none would be able to hold out a day men were sent into the world rude and ignorant and if they might not have used their natural facultys to find out that which is good for themselves all must have bin condemned to continue in the ignorance of our first fathers and to make no use of their understanding to the ends for which it was given  the bestial barbarity in which many nations especially of africa america and asia do now live shows what human nature is if it be not improved by art and discipline and if the first errors committed through ignorance might not be corrected all would be obliged to continue in them and for any thing i know we must return to the religion manners and policy that were found in our country at cesars landing to affirm this is no less than to destroy all that is commendable in the world and to render the understanding given to men utterly useless but if it be lawful for us by the use of that understanding to build houses ships and forts better than our ancestors to make such arms as are most fit for our defense and to invent printing with an infinite number of other arts beneficial to mankind why have we not the same right in matters of government upon which all others do almost absolutely depend if men are not obliged to live in caves and hollow trees to eat acorns and to go naked why should they be for ever obliged to continue under the same form of government that their ancestors happened to set up in the time of their ignorance or if they were so ignorant to set up one that was not good enough for the age in which they lived why should it not be altered when tricks are found out to turn that to the prejudice of nations which was erected for their good from whence should malice and wickedness gain a privilege of putting new inventions to do mischief every day into practice and who is it that so far protects them as to forbid good and innocent men to find new ways also of defending themselves if there be any that do this they must be such as live in the same principle who whilst they pretend to exercise justice provide only for the indemnity of their own crimes and the advancement of unjust designs they would have a right of attacking us with all the advantages of the arms now in use and the arts which by the practice of so many ages have bin wonderfully refined whilst we should be obliged to employ no others in our just defense than such as were known to our naked ancestors when caesar invaded them or to the indians when they fell under the dominion of the spaniards this would be a compendious way of placing uncontrold iniquity in all the kingdoms of the world and of overthrowing all that deserves the name of good by the introduction of such accursed maxims but if no man dares to acknowledge any such except those whose acknowledgment is a discredit we ought not to suffer them to be obliquely obtruded upon us nor to think that god has so far abandoned us into the hands of our enemies as not to leave us the liberty of using the same arms in our defense as they do to offend and injure us  we shall be told that prayers and tears were the only arms of the first christians and that christ commanded his disciples to pray for those that persecuted them but besides that those precepts of the most extreme lenity do ill suit with the violent practices of those who attempt to enslave nations and who by alleging them do plainly show either that they do not extend to all christians or that they themselves are none whilst they act contrary to them they are to know that those precepts were merely temporary and directed to the persons of the apostles who were armed only with the sword of the spirit that the primitive christians used prayers and tears only no longer than whilst they had no other arms but knowing that by listing themselves under the ensigns of christianity they had not lost the rights belonging to all mankind when nations came to be converted they no way thought themselves obliged to give their enemies a certain opportunity of destroying them when god had put means into their hands of defending themselves and proceeded so far in this way that the christian valor soon became no less famous and remarkable than that of the pagans they did with the utmost vigor defend both their civil and religious rights against all the powers of earth and hell who by force and fraud endeavored to destroy them  sect viii under the name of tribute no more is understood than what the law of each nation gives to the supreme magistrate for the defraying of public charges to which the customs of the romans or sufferings of the jews have no relation if any desire the directions of the new testament says our author he may find our savior limiting and distinguishing royal power by giving to caesar those things that are caesar s and to god the things that are gods but that will be of no advantage to him in this contest we do not deny to any man that which is his due but do not so well know who is caesar nor what it is that can truly be said to be due to him i grant that when those words were spoken the power of the romans exercised by tiberius was then expressed by the name of caesar which he without any title had assumed the jews amongst many other nations having bin subdued submitted to it and being no way competent judges of the rights belonging to the senate or people of rome were obliged to acknowledge that power which their masters were under they had no commonwealth of their own nor any other government among themselves that was not precarious they thought christ was to have restored their kingdom and by them to have reigned over the nations but he showed them they were to be subject to the gentiles and that within few years their city and temple should be destroyed their commonwealth must needs expire when all that was prefigurd by it was accomplished it was not for them at such a time to presume upon their abrogated privileges nor the promises made to them which were then fulfilled nay they had by their sins profaned themselves and given to the gentiles a right over them which none could have had if they had continued in their obedience to the law of god this was the foundation of the cesars dominion over them but can have no influence upon us the first of the cesars had not bin set up by them the series of them had not bin continued by their consent they had not interrupted the succession by placing or displacing such as they pleased they had not brought in strangers or bastards nor preferred the remotest in blood before the nearest they had no part in making the laws by which they were governed nor had the cesars sworn to them they had no great charter acknowledging their libertys to be innate or inherent in them confirmed by immemorial custom and strengthened by thirty acts of their own general assemblys with the assent of the romans the caesar who then governed came not to the power by their consent the question will ye have this man to reign had never bin asked but he being imposed upon them they were to submit to the laws by which he governed their masters this can be nothing to us whose case is in every respect most unlike to theirs we have no dictatorian power over us and neither we nor our fathers have rendered or owed obedience to any human laws but our own nor to any other magistracy than what we have established we have a king who reigns by law his power is from the lex facit ut sit rex bracton law that makes him king and we can know only from thence what he is to command and what we are obliged to obey we know the power of the cesars was usurped maintained and exercised with the most detestable violence injustice and cruelty but tho it had bin established by the consent of the romans from an opinion that it was good for them in that state of affairs it were nothing to us and we could be no more obliged to follow their example in that than to be governed by consuls tribuns and decemviri or to constitute such a government as they set up when they expelled their kings their authority was as good at one time as at the other or if a difference ought to be made the preference is to be given to what they did when their manners were most pure the people most free and when virtue was most flourishing among them but if we are not obliged to set up such a magistracy as they had it is ridiculous to think that such an obedience is due to one who is not in being as they paid to him that was and if i should confess that caesar holding the senate and people of rome under the power of the sword imposed what tribute he pleased upon the provinces and that the jews who had no part in the government were obliged to submit to his will our liberty of paying nothing except what the parliament appoints and yielding obedience to no laws but such as are made to be so by their authority or by our own immemorial customs could not be thereby infringed but we may justly affirm that the tribute imposed was not as our author infers all their coin nor a considerable part of it nor more than what was understood to go for the defraying of the public charges christ by asking whose image and superscription was stamped upon their money and thereupon commanding them to give to caesar that which was cesars did not imply that all was his but that cesars money being current amongst them it was a continual and evident testimony that they acknowledged themselves to be under his jurisdiction and therefore could not refuse to pay the tribute laid upon them by the same authority as other nations did  it may also be observed that christ did not so much say this to determine the questions that might arise concerning cesars power for he plainly says that was not his work but to put the pharisees to silence who tempted him according to the opinion of the jews that the messiah would restore the kingdom of israel they thought his first work would be to throw off the roman yoke and not believing him to be the man they would have brought him to avow the thing that they might destroy him but as that was not his business and that his time was not yet come it was not necessary to give them any other answer than such as might disappoint their purpose this shows that without detracting from the honor due to austin ambrose or tertullian i may justly say that the decision of such questions as arise concerning our government must be decided by our laws and not by their writings they were excellent men but living in another time under a very different government and applying themselves to other matters they had no knowledge at all of those that concern us they knew what government they were under and thereupon judged what a broken and dispersed people owed to that which had given law to the best part of the world before they were in being under which they had bin educated and which after a most cruel persecution was become propitious to them they knew that the word of the emperor was a law to the senate and people who were under the power of that man that could get the best army but perhaps had never heard of such mixed governments as ours tho about that time they began to appear in the world and it might be as reasonably concluded that there ought to be no rule in the succession or election of princes because the roman emperors were set up by the violence of the soldiers and for the most part by the slaughter of him who was in possession of the power as that all other princes must be absolute when they have it and do what they please till another more strong and more happy may by the like means wrest the same power from them  i am much mistaken if this be not true but without prejudice to our cause we may take that which they say according to their true meaning in the utmost extent and to begin with tertullian it is good to consider the subject of his discourse and to whom he wrote the treatise cited by our author is the apologetick and tends to persuade the pagans that civil magistrates might not intermeddle with religion and that the laws made by them touching those matters were of no value as relating to things of which they had no cognizance leges non annorum numerus nec conditorum dignitas sed sola aequitas commendat atque ideo si iniquae cognoscuntur merito damnantur tertul ap it is not says he length of time nor the dignity of the legislators but equity only that can commend laws and when any are found to be unjust they are deservedly condemned by which words he denied that the magistratical power which the romans acknowledged in caesar had any thing to do in spiritual things and little advantage can be taken by christian princes from what he says concerning the roman emperors for he expressly declares sed and caesares super christo credidissent si aut caesares non essent saeculo necessarii aut christiani potuissent esse caesares ibid that the cesars would have believed in christ if they had either not bin necessary to the secular government or that christians might have bin cesars this seems to have proceeded from an opinion received by christians in the first ages that the use of the civil as well as the military sword was equally accursed that christians were to be filii pacis nullius hosts and christus exarmando petrum omnem christianum militem in aeteranum discinxit tertul ibid sons of peace enemies to no man and that christ by commanding peter to put up his sword did for ever disarm all christians he proceeds to say nobis omnis gloriae and dignitatis ardore frigentibus etc nec alia res est nobis magis aliena quam publica unam nobis rempublicam mundum agnoscimus ibid we cannot fight to defend our goods having in our baptism renounced the world and all that is in it nor to gain honors accounting nothing more foreign to us than public affairs and acknowledging no other commonwealth than that of the whole world nor to save our lives because we account it a happiness to be killed he dissuades the pagans from executing christians rather from charity to them in keeping them from the crime of slaughtering the innocent than that they were unwilling to suffer and gives no other reasons of their prayers for the emperors than that they were commanded to love their enemies and to pray for those who persecuted them except such as he drew from a mistake that the world was shortly to finish with the dissolution of the empire all his works as well those that were written before he fell into montanism as those published afterward are full of the like opinions and if filmer acknowledges them to be true he must confess that princes are not fathers but qui enim magis inimici christianorum quam de quorum majestate convnimur in crimen ibid enemies and that not only they but all those who render themselves ministers of the powers they execute in taking upon them the sword that christ had cursed do renounce him and we may consider how to proceed with such as do so if our author will not acknowledge this then no man was ever guilty of a more vile prevarication than he who alleges those words in favor of his cause which have their only strength in opinions that he thinks false and in the authority of a man whom in that very thing he condemns and must do so or overthrow all that he endeavors to support but tertullians opinions concerning these matters have no relation to our present question the design of his apology and the treatise to scapula almost upon the same subject was to show that the civil magistracy which he comprehends under the name of caesar had nothing to do with matters of religion and that as no man could be a christian who would undertake the work of a magistrate they who were jealous the public offices might be taken out of their hands had nothing to fear from christians who resolved not to meddle with them whereas our question is only whether that magistratical power which by law or usurpation was then in caesar must necessarily in all times and in all places be in one man or may be divided and balanced according to the laws of every country concerning which he says nothing or whether we who do not renounce the use of the civil or military sword who have a part in the government and think it our duty to apply our selves to public cares should lay them aside because the ancient christians every hour expecting death did not trouble themselves with them  if ambrose after he was a bishop employed the ferocity of a soldier which he still retained rather in advancing the power of the clergy than the good of mankind by restraining the rage of tyrants it can be no prejudice to our cause of which he had no cognizance he spoke of the violent and despotical government to which he had bin a minister before his baptism and seems to have had no knowledge of the gothic polity that within a few years grew famous by the overthrow of the roman tyranny and delivering the world from the yoke which it could no longer bear and if austin might say that the emperor is subject to no laws because he has a power of making laws i may justly say that our kings are subject to laws because they can make no law and have no power but what is given by the laws if this be not the case i desire to know who made the laws to which they and their predecessors have sworn and whether they can according to their own will abrogate those ancient laws by which they are made to be what they are and by which we enjoy what we have or whether they can make new laws by their own power if no man but our author have impudence enough to assert any such thing and if all the kings we ever had except richard the second did renounce it we may conclude that austins words have no relation to our dispute and that twere to no purpose to examine whether the fathers mention any reservation of power to the laws of the land or to the people it being as lawful for all nations if they think fit to frame governments different from those that were then in being as to build bastions halfmoons hornworks ravelins or counterscarps or to make use of muskets cannon mortars carabines or pistols which were unknown to them  what solomon says of the hebrew kings dos as little concern us we have already proved their power not to have bin absolute tho greater than that which the law allows to ours it might upon occasion be a prudent advice to private persons living under such governments as were usual in the eastern countries to keep the kings commandments and not to say what do thou because where the word of a king is there is power and all that he pleases he will do but all these words are not his and those that are must not be taken in a general sense for tho his son was a king yet in his words there was no power he could not do what he pleased nor hinder others from doing what they pleased he would have added weight to the yoke that lay upon the necks of the israelites but he could not and we do not find him to have bin master of much more than his own tongue to speak as many foolish things as he pleased in other things whether he had to deal with his own people or with strangers he was weak and impotent and the wretches who flattered him in his follys could be of no help to him the like has befallen many others those who are wise virtuous valiant just and lovers of their people have and ought to have power but such as are lewd vicious foolish and haters of their people ought to have none and are often deprived of all this was well known to solomon who says that a wise child is better than an old and foolish king that will not be advised when nabuchodonosor set himself in the place of god his kingdom was taken from him and he was driven from the society of men to herd with beasts there was power for a time in the word of nero he murdered many excellent men but he was called to account and the world abandoned the monster it had too long endured he found none to defend him nor any better help when he desired to die than the hand of a slave besides some kings by their institution have little power some have bin deprived of what they had for abusing or rendering themselves unworthy of it and historys afford us innumerable examples of both sorts  but tho i should confess that there is always power in the word of a king it would be nothing to us who dispute concerning right and have no regard to that power which is void of it a thief or a pyrat may have power but that avails him not when as often befell the cesars he meets with one who has more and is always unsafe since having no effect upon the consciences of men every one may destroy him that can and i leave it to kings to consider how much they stand obliged to those who placing their rights upon the same foot expose their persons to the same dangers  but if kings desire that in their word there should be power let them take care that it be always accompanied with truth and justice let them seek the good of their people and the hands of all good men will be with them let them not exalt themselves insolently and every one will desire to exalt them let them acknowledge themselves to be the servants of the public and all men will be theirs let such as are most addicted to them talk no more of cesars nor the tributes due to them we have nothing to do with the name of caesar they who at this day live under it reject the prerogatives anciently usurped by those who had it and are governed by no other laws than their own we know no law to which we owe obedience but that of god and our selves asiatick slaves usually pay such tributes as are imposed upon them and whilst braver nations lay under the roman tyranny they were forced to submit to the same burdens but even those tributes were paid for maintaining armies fleets and garrisons without which the poor and abject life they led could not have bin preserved we owe none but what we freely give none is or can be imposed upon us unless by our selves we measure our grants according to our own will or the present occasions for our own safety our ancestors were born free and as the best provision they could make for us they left us that liberty entire with the best laws they could devise to defend it it is no way impaired by the opinions of the fathers the words of solomon do rather confirm it the happiness of those who enjoy the like and the shameful misery under which they lie who have suffered themselves to be forced or cheated out of it may persuade and the justice of the cause encourage us to think nothing too dear to be hazarded in the defense of it  sect ix our own laws confirm to us the enjoyment of our native rights if that which our author calls divinity did reach the things in dispute between us or that the opinions of the fathers which he alleges related to them he might have spared the pains of examining our laws for a municipal sanction were of little force to confirm a perpetual and universal law given by god to mankind and of no value against it since man cannot abrogate what god has instituted nor one nation free it self from a law that is given to all but having abused the scriptures and the writings of the fathers whose opinions are to be valued only so far as they rightly interpret them he seems desirous to try whether he can as well put a false sense upon our law according to his custom he takes pieces of passages from good books and turns them directly against the plain meaning of the authors expressed in the whole scope and design of their writings to show that he intends to spare none he is not ashamed to cite bracton who of all our ancient lawwriters is most opposite to his maxims he lived says he in henry the thirds time since parliamenns were instituted as if there had bin a time when england had wanted them or that the establishment of our liberty had bin made by the normans who if we will believe our author came in by force of arms and oppressed us but we have already proved the essence of parliaments to be as ancient as our nation and that there was no time in which there were not such councils or assemblys of the people as had the power of the whole and made or unmade such laws as best pleased themselves we have indeed a french word from a people that came from france but the power was always in our selves and the norman kings were obliged to swear they would govern according to the laws that had bin made by those assemblys it imports little whether bracton lived before or after they came amongst us his words are omnes sub eo and ipse sub nullo sed tantum sub deo all are under him and he under none but god only if he offend since no writ can go out against him their remedy is by petitioning him to amend his faults which if he will not do it is punishment enough for him to expect god as an avenger let none presume to look into his deeds much less to oppose him here is a mixture of sense and nonsense truth and falsehood the words of bracton with our authors foolish inferences from them bracton spoke of the politic capacity of the king when no law had forbidden him to divide it from his natural he gave the name of king to the sovereign power of the nation as jacob called that of his descendents the scepter which he said should not depart from judah till shiloh came tho all men know that his race did not reign the third part of that time over his own tribe nor full sourscore years over the whole nation the same manner of speech is used in all parts of the world tertullian under the name of caesar comprehended all magistratical power and imputed to him the acts of which in his person he never had any knowledge the french say their king is always present sur son lit de justice in all the sovereign courts of the kingdom which are not easily numbered and that maxim could have in it neither sense nor truth if by it they meant a man who can be but in one place at one time and is always comprehended within the dimensions of his own skin these things could not be unknown to bracton the like being in use amongst us and he thought it no offense so far to follow the dictates of reason prohibited by no law as to make a difference between the invisible and omnipresent king who never dies and the person that wears the crown whom no man without the guilt of treason may endeavor to kill since there is an act of parliament in the case i will not determine whether he spoke properly or no as to england but if he did not all that he said being upon a false supposition is nothing to our purpose the same bracton says the king dos no wrong in as much as he dos nothing but by law potestas regis est potestas legis potestas juris non injuriae bract de leg angl the power of the king is the power of the law a power of right not of wrong again if qui si sacit injuriam non est rex ibid the king dos injustice he is not king in another place he has these words exercere igitur debet rex potestatem juris sicut dei vicarius and minister in terra quia illa potestas solius dei est potestas autem injuriae diaboli est non dei and cujus horum opera fecerit rex eus minister erit igitur dum facit justitiam vicarius est regis aeterni minister autem diaboli dum declinet ad injuriam ibid l   the king therefore ought to exercise the power of the law as becomes the vicar and minister of god upon earth because that power is the power of god alone but the power of doing wrong is the power of the devil and not of god aad the king is his minister whose work he dos whilst he dos justice he is the vicar of the eternal king but if he deflect from it to act unjustly he is the minister of the devil he also says that the king is singulis major universis minor and that he who is in justitia exequenda omnibus major in justitia recipienda cuilibet ex plebe fit aequalis i shall not say bracton is in the right when he speaks in this manner but it is a strange impudence in filmer to cite him as a patron of the absolute power of kings who dos so extremely depress them but the grossest of his follys is yet more pardonable than his detestable fraud in falsifying bractons words and leaving out such as are not for his purpose which show his meaning to be directly contrary to the sense put upon them that this may appear i shall set down the words as they are found in bracton ipse autem rex non debet esse sub homine sed sub deo and sub lege quia lex facit regem attribuat ergo rex legi quod lex attribuit ei id est dominationem and potestatem non est enim rex ubi dominatur voluntas and non lex and quod sub lege esse debeat cum sit dei vicarius evidenter apparet if bracton therefore be a competent judge the king is under the law and he is not a king nor gods vicegerent unless he be so and we all know how to proceed with those who being under the law offend against it for the law is not made in vain in this case something more is to be done than petitioning and it is ridiculous to say that if he will not amend it is punishment enough for him to expect god an avenger for the same may be said of all malefactors god can sufficiently punish thieves and murderers but the future judgment of which perhaps they have no belief is not sufficient to restrain them from committing more crimes nor to deter others from following their example god was always able to punish murderers but yet by his law he commands man to shed the blood of him who should shed mans blood and declares that the land cannot be purged of the guilt by any other means he had judgments in store for jeroboam ahab and those that were like them but yet he commanded that according to that law their houses should be destroyed from the earth the dogs licked up the blood of ahab where they had licked that of naboth and eat jezebel who had contrived his murder but says our author we must not look into his deeds much less oppose them must not david look into readiness deeds nor oppose them why did he then bring together as many men as he could to oppose and make foreign alliances against him even with the moabites and the accursed philistines why did jehu not only destroy ahabs house but kill the king of judah and his forty brothers only for going to visit his children our author may perhaps say because god commanded them but if god commanded them to do so he did not command them and all mankind not to do so and if he did not forbid they have nothing to restrain them from doing the like unless they have made municipal laws of their own to the contrary which our author and his followers may produce when they can find them  his next work is to go back again to the tribute paid by christ to caesar and judiciously to infer that all nations must pay the same duty to their magistrates as the jews did to the romans who had subdued them christ did not says he ask what the law of the land was nor inquire whether there was a statute against it nor whether the tribute were given by the consent of the people but upon sight of the superscription concluded etc it had bin strange if christ had inquired after their laws statutes or consent when he knew that their commonwealth with all the laws by which it had subsisted was abolished and that israel was become a servant to those who exercised a most violent domination over them which being a peculiar punishment for their peculiar sins can have no influence upon nations that are not under the same circumstances  but of all that he says nothing is more incomprehensible than what he can mean by lawful kings to whom all is due that was due to the roman usurpers for lawful kings are kings by the law in being kings by the law they are such kings as the law makes them and that law only must tell us what is due to them or by a universal patriarchical right to which no man can have a title as is said before till he prove himself to be the right heir of noah if neither of these are to be regarded but that right follows possession there is no such thing as a usurper he who has the power has the right as indeed filmer says and his wisdom as well as his integrity is sufficiently declared by the assertion  this wicked extravagancy is followed by an attempt of as singular ignorance and stupidity to shuffle together usurpers and conquerors as if they were the same whereas there have bin many usurpers who were not conquerors and conquerors that deserved not the name of usurpers no wise man ever said that agathocles or dionysius conquered syracuse tarquin galba or otho rome cromwell england or that the magi who seized the government of persia after the death of cambyses conquered that country when moses and joshua had overthrown the kingdoms of the amorites moabites and cananites or when david subdued the ammonites edomites and others none as i suppose but such divines as filmer will say they usurped a dominion over them there is such a thing amongst men as just war or else ttue valor could not be a virtue but a crime and instead of glory the utmost infamy would always be the companion of victory there are says belli aque ac pacis jura de jur bell and pac grotius laws of war as well as of peace he who for a just cause and by just means carrys on a just war has as clear a right to what is acquired as can be enjoyed by man but all usurpation is detestable and abominable  sect x the words of st paul enjoining obedience to higher powers favor all sorts of governments no less than monarchy our authors next quarrel is with st paul who did not at he says in enjoining subjection to the higher powers signify the laws of the land or mean the highest powers as well aristocratical and democratical as regal but a monarch that carries the sword etc but what if there be no monarch in the place or what if he do not carry the sword had the apostle spoken in vain if the liberty of the romans had not bin overthrown by the fraud and violence of caesar was no obedience to be exacted whilst that people enjoyed the benefit of their own laws and virtue flourished under the moderate government of a legal and just magistracy established for the common good by the common consent of all had god no minister amongst them till law and justice was overthrown the best part of the people destroyed by the fury of a corrupt mercenary soldiery and the world subdued under the tyranny of the worst monsters that it had ever produced are these the ways of establishing gods vicegerents and will he patronize no governors or governments but such as these dos god uphold evil and that only if the world has bin hitherto mistaken in giving the name of evil to that which is good and calling that good which is evil i desire to know what can be called good amongst men if the government of the romans till they entered greece and asia and were corrupted by the luxury of both do not deserve that name or what is to be esteemed evil if the establishment and exercise of the cesars power were not so but says he will thou not be afraid of the power and was there no power in the governments that had no monarchs were the carthaginians romans grecians gauls germans and spaniards without power was there no sword in that nation and their magistrates who overthrew the kingdoms of armenia egypt numidia macedon with many others and whom none of the monarchs were able to resist are the venetians switzers grisons and hollanders now let in the same weakness and no obedience at all due to their magistrates if this be so how comes it to pass that justice is so well administered amongst them who is it that defends the hollanders in such a manner that the greatest monarchs with all their swords have had no great reason to boast of any advantages gained against them at least till we whom they could not resist when we had no monarch tho we have bin disgracefully beaten by them since we had one by making leagues against them and sowing divisions amongst them instigated and assisted the greatest power now in the world to their destruction and our own but our author is so accustomed to fraud that he never cites a passage of scripture which he dos not abuse or vitiate and that he may do the same in this place he leaves out the following words for there is no power but of god that he might entitle one sort only to his protection if therefore the people and popular magistrates of athens the two kings ephori and senate of sparta the sanhedrins amongst the hebrews the consuls tribuns pretors and senate of rome the magistrates of holland switzerland and venice have or had power we may conclude that they also were ordained by god and that according to the precept of the apostle the same obedience for the same reason is due to them as to any monarch  the apostle farther explaining himself and showing who may be accounted a magistrate and what the duty of such a one is informs us when we should fear and on what account rulers says he are not a terror to good works but to the evil will thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shall have praise of the same for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil he therefore is only the minister of god who is not a terror to good works but to evil who executes wrath upon those that do evil and is a praise to those that do well and he who dos well ought not to be afraid of the power for he shall receive praise now if our author were alive tho he was a man of a hard forehead i would ask him whether in his conscience he believed that tiberius caligula claudius nero and the rabble of succeeding monsters were a praise to those who did well and a terror to those who did ill and not the contrary a praise to the worst and a terror to the best men of the world or for what reason ob virtutes certissimum exitium tacitus could say that virtue brought men who lived under em to certain destruction and recite so many examples of the brave and good who were murdered by them for being so unless they had endeavored to extinguish all that was good and to ipsam exscindere virtutem tear up virtue by the roots why did he call domitian an virtutibus infestum enemy to virtue if he was a terror only to those that did evil if the world has hitherto bin misled in these things and given the name of virtue to vice and of vice to virtue then germanicus valerius asiaticus corbulo helvidius priscus thraseas soranus and others that resembled them who fell under the rage of those beasts nay paul himself and his disciples were evil doers and macro narcissus pallas vinnius laco and tigellinus were virtuous and good men if this be so we are beholden to filmer for admonishing mankind of the error in which they had so long continued if not those who persecuted and murdered them for their virtues were not a terror to such as did evil and a praise to those who did well the worst men had no need to fear them but the best had because they were the best all princes therefore that have power are not to be esteemed equally the ministers of god they that are so must receive their dignity from a title that is not common to all even from a just employment of their power to the encouragement of virtue and to the discouragement of vice he that pretends to the veneration and obedience due to the ministers of god must by his actions manifest that he is so and tho i am unwilling to advance a proposition that may sound harshly to tender ears i am inclined to believe that the same rule which obliges us to yield obedience to the good magistrate who is the minister of god and assures us that in obeying him we obey god dos equally oblige us not to obey those who make themselves the ministers of the devil lest in obeying them we obey the devil whose works they do  that none but such as are wilfully ignorant may mistake pauls meaning peter who was directed by the same spirit says distinctly submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake if therefore there be several ordinances of men tending to the same end that is the obtaining of justice by being a terror to the evil and a praise to the good the like obedience is for conscience sake enjoined to all and upon the same condition but as no man dares to say that athens and persia carthage and egypt switzerland and france venice and turkey were and are under the same government the same obedience is due to the magistrate in every one of those places and all others on the same account whilst they continue to be the ministers of god  if our author say that peter cannot comprehend kings under the name of human ordinances since paul says they are the ordinance of god i may as well say that paul cannot call that the ordinance of god which peter calls the ordinance of man but as it was said of moses and samuel that they who spoke by the same spirit could not contradict each other peter and paul being full of wisdom and sanctity and inspired by the same spirit must needs say the same thing and grotius shows that they perfectly agree tho the one calls kings rulers and governors the ordinance of man and the other the ordinance of god inasmuch as god having from the beginning ordained that men should not live like wolves in woods every man by himself but together in civil societys left to every one a liberty of joining with that society which best pleased him and to every society to create such magistrates and frame such laws as should seem most conducing to their own good according to the measure of light and reason they might have and every magistracy so instituted might rightly be called the ordinance of man who was the instituter and the ordinance of god according to which it was instituted quia salubrem hominum constitutionem deus probavit and sauxie de jur bell and pac because says he god approved and ratified the salutary constitutions of government made by men  but says our author peter expounds his own words of the human ordinance to be the king who is the lex loquens but he says no such thing and i do not find that any such thought ever entered into the apostles mind the words are often found in the works of plato and aristotle but applied only to such a man as is a king by nature who is endowed with all the virtues that tend to the good of human societys in a greater measure than any or all those that compose them which character i think will be ill applied to all kings and that this may appear to be true i desire to know whether it would well have agreed with nero caligula domitian or others like to them and if not with them then not with all bot only with those who are endowed with such virtues but if the king be made by man he must be such as man makes him to be and if the power of a law had bin given by any human sanction to the word of a foolish mad or wicked man which i hardly believe it would be destroyed by its own iniquity and turpitude and the people left under the obligation of rendering obedience to those who so use the sword that the nations under them may live soberly peaceably and honestly  this obliges me a little to examine what is meant by the sword the pope says there are two swords the one temporal the other spiritual and that both of them were given to peter and to his successors others more rightly understand the two swords to be that of war and that of justice which according to several constitutions of government have bin committed to several hands under several conditions and limitations the sword of justice comprehends the legislative and the executive power the one is exercised in making laws the other in judging controversys according to such as are made the military sword is used by those magistrates who have it in making war or peace with whom they think fit and sometimes by others who have it not in pursuing such wars as are resolved upon by another power the jewish doctors generally agree that the kings of judah could make no law because there was a curse denounced against those who should add to or detract from that which god had given by the hand of moses that they might sit in judgment with the high priest and sanhedrin but could not judge by themselves unless the sanhedrin did plainly fail of performing their duty upon this account maimonides excuses david for commanding solomon not to suffer the gray hairs of joab to go down to the grave in peace and solomon for appointing him to be killed at the foot of the altar for he having killed abner and amasa and by those actions shed the blood of war in time of peace the sanhedrin should have punished him but being protected by favor or power and even david himself fearing him solomon was put in mind of his duty which he performed tho joab laid hold upon the horns of the altar which by the express words of the law gave no protection to wilful murderers  the use of the military sword amongst them was also moderated their kings might make war upon the seven accursed nations that they were commanded to destroy and so might any other man for no peace was to be made with them but not against any other nation without the assent of the sanhedrin and when amaziah contrary to that law had foolishly made war upon joash king of israel and thereby brought a great slaughter upon judah the princes that is the sanhedrin combined against him pursued him to lachish and killed him there  the legislative power of sparta was evidently in the people the laws that go under the name of lycurgus were proposed by him to the general assembly of the people and from them received their authority but the discipline they contained was of such efficacy sor framing the minds of men to virtue and by banishing silver and gold they so far banished all manner of crimes that from the institution of those laws to the times of their corruption which was more than eight hundred years we hardly find that three men were put to death of whom two were kings so that it seems difficult to determine where the power of judging did reside tho it is most probable considering the nature of their government that it was in the senate and in cases extraordinary in the ephori with a right of appealing to the people their kings theresore conld have little to do with the sword of justice neither the legislative nor the judicial power being any ways in them  the military sword was not much more in their power unless the excellency of their virtues gave them the credit of persuading when the law denied the right of commanding they were obliged to make war against those and those only who were declared enemies by the senate and ephori and in the manner place and time they directed so that agesilaus tho carrying on a glorious war in persia no sooner received the parchment roll wherein he was commanded by the ephori to come home for the desence of his own country than he immediately returned and is on that account called by no less a man than xenophon a good and faithful king rendering obedience to the laws of his country  by this it appears that there are kings who may be feared by those that do ill and not by such as do well for having no more power than what the law gives and being obliged to execute it as the law directs they cannot depart from the precept of the apostle my own actions therefore or the sense of my own guilt arising from them is to be the measure of my fear of that magistrate who is the minister of god and not his power  the like may be said of almost all the nations of the world that have had any thing of civil order amongst them the supreme magistrate under what name soever he was known whether king emperor asymnetes suffetes consul dictator or archon has usually a part assigned to him in the administration of justice and making war but that he may know it to be assigned and not inherent and so assigned as to be employed for the public good not to his own profit or pleasure it is circumscribed by such rules as he cannot safely transgress this is above all seen in the german nations from whom we draw our original and government and is so well described by tacitus in his treatise of their customs and manners that i shall content my self to refer to it and to what i have cited from him in the former part of this work the saxons coming into our country retained to themselves the same rights they had no kings but such as were set up by themselves and they abrogated their power when they pleased ad libertatis vestrae tuitionem non meis meritis sed sola liberalitate vestra offa acknowledged that he was chosen for the defense of their liberty not from his own merit but by their favor and in the conventus pananglicus at which all the chief men as well secular as ecclesiastical were present it was decreed by the king archbishops bishops abbots dukes and senators that the kings should be chosen by the priests and by the elders of the people in pursuance of which egbert who had no right to the succession was made king ethelwerd was chosen in the same manner omnium consensu by the consent of all ethelwolf a monk for want of a better was advanced to the same honor his son alfred tho crowned by the pope and marrying without the consent of the nobility and kingdom contra morem and statuta against their customs and statutes acknowledged that he had received the crown from the bounty of the princes elders and people and in his will declared that he left the people as he had found them free as the inward thoughts of man his son edward successor monarchiae electus was elected to be his successor ethelstan tho a bastard and without all title was elected by the consent of the nobility and people eadred by the same authority was elected and preferred before the sons of edmond his predecessor edwin tho rightly chosen was deposed for his ill life and edgar et eligerunt deo dictante edgarum in regem annuente populo elected king by the will of god and consent of the people but he also was deprived of the crown for the rape of a nun and after seven years restored by the whole people coram omni multitudine populi anglorum ethelred who is said to have bin saevus in principio miser in medio turpis in exitu cruel in the beginning wretched in the course and infamous in the end of his reign was deposed by the same power that had advanced him canutus made a canutus oedus cum principibus and omni populo and illi cum ipso percusserunt contract with the princes and the whole people and thereupon was by general consent crowned king over all england after him harold was chosen in the usual manner he being dead a message was sent to hardi canute with an offer of the crown which he accepted and accordingly was received edward the confessor was annuente clero and populo londini in regem eligitur elected king with the consent of the clergy and people at london and harold excused himself for not performing his oath to william the norman because he said he had made it unduly and presumptuously absque generali senatus and populi conventu and edicto matthew paris gul gemit etc without consulting the nobility and people and without their authority william was received with great joy by the clergy and people and saluted king by all swearing to observe the ancient good and approved laws of england and tho he did but ill perform his oath yet before his death he seemed to repent of the ways he had taken and only wishing his son might be king of england he confessed in his last will made at caen in normandy neminem anglici regni constituo haeredem non enim tantum decus hareditario jure possedi ibid that he neither found nor left the kingdom as an inheritance if he possessed no right except what was conferred upon him no more was conferred than had bin enjoyed by the ancient kings according to the approved laws which he swore to observe those laws gave no power to any till he was elected and that which they did then give was so limited that the nobility and people reserved to themselves the disposition of the greatest affairs even to the deposition and expulsion of such as should not well perform the duty of their oath and office and i leave it to our author to prove how they can be said to have had the sword and the power so as to be feared otherwise than as the apostle says by those that do evil which we acknowledge to be not only in the king but in the lowest officer of justice in the world  if it be pretended that our later kings are more to be feared than william the norman or his predecessors it must not be as has bin proved either from the general right of kings or from the doctrine of the apostle but from something else that is peculiar and subsequent which i leave our authors disciples to prove and an answer may be found in due time but to show that our ancestors did not mistake the words of the apostle it is good to consider when to whom and upon what occasion he spoke the christian religion was then in its infancy his discourses were addressed to the professors of it who tho they soon grew to be considerable in number were for the most part of the meanest sort of people servants or inhabitants of the citys rather than citizens and freemen joined in no civil body or society nor such as had or could have any part in the government the occasion was to suppress the dangerous mistake of many converted jews and others who knowing themselves to be freed from the power of sin and the devil presumed they were also freed from the obligation of human laws and if this error had not bin cropd in the bud it would have given occasion to their enemies who desired nothing more to destroy them all and who knowing that such notions were stirring among them would have bin glad that they who were not easily to be discovered had by that means discovered themselves  this induced a necessity of diverting a poor mean scattered people from such thoughts concerning the state to convince them of the error into which they were fallen that christians did not owe the same obedience to civil laws and magistrates as other men and to keep them from drawing destruction upon themselves by such ways as not being warranted by god had no promise of his protection st pauls work was to preserve the professors of christianity as appears by his own words   timothy   i exhort that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty put tit   them in mind to be subject to principalitys and powers to obey magistrates to be ready for every good work st peter agrees with him fully in describing the magistrate and his duty showing the reasons why obedience should be paid to him and teaching christians to be humble and contented with their condition as free yet not using their liberty for a cover to malice and not only to fear god and honor the king of which conjunction of words such as filmer are very proud but to honor all men as is said in the same verse this was in a peculiar manner the work of that time in which those who were to preach and propagate the gospel were not to be diverted from that duty by entangling themselves in the care of state affairs but it dos in some sense agree with all times for it can never be the duty of a good man to oppose such a magistrate as is the minister of god in the exercise of his office nor to deny to any man that which is his due  but as the christian law exempts no man from the duty he ows to his father master or the magistrate it dos not make him more a slave than he was before nor deprive him of any natural or civil right and if we are obliged to pay tribute honor or any other thing where it is not due it must be by some precept very different from that which commands us to give to caesar that which is cesars if he define the magistrate to be the minister of god doing justice and from thence draws the reasons he gives for rendering obedience to him we are to inquire whose minister he is who overthrows it and look for some other reason for rendering obedience to him than the words of the apostles if david who was willing to lay down his life for the people who hated iniquity and would not suffer a liar to come into his presence was the minister of god i desire to know whose minister caligula was who set up himself to be worshipped for a god and would at once have destroyed all the people that he ought to have protected whose minister was nero who besides the abominable impuritys of his life and hatred to all virtue as contrary to his person and government set fire to the great city if it be true that contrariorum contraria est ratio these questions are easily decided and if the reasons of things are eternal the same distinction grounded upon truth will be good for ever every magistrate and every man by his works will for ever declare whose minister he is in what spirit he lives and consequently what obedience is due to him according to the precept of the apostle if any man ask what i mean by justice i answer that the law of the land as far as it is sanctio rect a jubens honesta prohibens contraria declares what it is but there have bin and are laws that are neither just nor commendable there was a law in rome that no god should be worshipped without the consent of the senate upon which tertullian says scoffingly nisi homini deus placuerit deus non erit that god shall not be god unless he please man and by virtue of this law the first christians were exposed to all manner of crueltys and some of the emperors in other respects excellent men most foully polluted themselves and their government with innocent blood antoninus pius was taken in this snare and tertullian bitterly derides trajan for glorying in his clemency when he had commanded pliny who was proconsul in asia not to make any search for christians but only to punish them according to law when they should be brought before him no municipal law can be more firmly established by human authority than that of the inquisition in spain and other places and those accursed tribunals which have shed more christian blood than all the pagans that ever were in the world are commonly called the holy office if a gentleman in poland kill a peasant he is by a law now in use free from punishment if he lay a ducat upon the dead body evenus the third king of scotland caused a law to pass by which the wives and daughters of noblemen were exposed to his lust and those of the commons to the lust of the nobility these and an infinite number of others like to them were not right sanctions but such as have produced unspeakable mischiefs and calamitys they were not therefore laws the name of justice is abusively attributed to them those that govern by them cannot be the ministers of god and the apostle commanding our obedience to the minister of god for our good commands us not to be obedient to the minister of the devil to our hurt for we cannot serve two masters  sect xi that which is not just is not law and that which is not law ought not to be obeyed our author having for a long time pretended conscience now pulls off his mask and plainly tells us that it is not on account of conscience but for fear of punishment or in hope of reward that laws are to be obeyed that familiar distinction of the schoolmen says he whereby they subject kings to the directive but not to the coactive power of the law is a confession that kings are not bound by the positive laws of any nation since the compulsory power of laws is that which properly makes laws to be laws not troubling my self with this distinction of the schoolmen nor acknowledging any truth to be in it or that they are competent judges of such matters i say that if it be true our authors conclusion is altogether false for the directive power of the law which is certain and grounded upon the inherent good and rectitude that is in it is that alone which has a power over the conscience whereas the coercive is merely contingent and the most just powers commanding the most just things have so osten fallen under the violence of the most unjust men commanding the most execrable villanys that if they were therefore to be obeyed the consciences of men must be regulated by the success of a battle or conspiracy than which nothing can be affirmed more impious and absurd by this rule david was not to be obeyed when by the wickedness of his son he was driven from jerusalem and deprived of all coercive power and the conscientious obedience that had bin due to him was transferred to absalom who sought his life and in st pauls time it was not from him who was guided only by the spirit of god and had no manner of coercive power that christians were to learn their duty but from caligula claudius and nero who had that power well established by the mercenary legions if this were so the governments of the world might be justly called magna latrocinia and men laying aside all considerations of reason or justice ought only to follow those who can inflict the greatest punishments or give the greatest rewards but since the reception of such opinions would be the extirpation of all that can be called good we must look for another rule of our obedience and shall find that to be the law which being as i said before sanctio recta must be founded upon that eternal principle of reason and truth from whence the rule of justice which is sacred and pure ought to be deduced and not from the depraved will of man which fluctuating according to the different interests humors and passions that at several times reign in several nations one day abrogates what had bin enacted the other the sanction therefore that deserves the name of a law which derives not its excellency from antiquity or from the dignity of the legislators but from an intrinsic equity and justice ought to be made in pursuance of that universal reason to which all nations at all times owe an equal veneration and obedience by this we may know whether he who has the power dos justice or not whether he be the minister of god to our good a protector of good and a terror to ill men or the minister of the devil to our hurt by encouraging all manner of evil and endeavoring by vice and corruption to make the people worse that they may be miserable and miserable that they may be worse i dare not say i shall never fear such a man if he be armed with power but i am sure i shall never esteem him to be the minister of god and shall think i do ill if i fear him if he has therefore a coercive power over me it is through my weakness for qui cogi potest nescit mori he that will suffer himself to be compelled knows not how to die if therefore he who dos not follow the directive power of the law be not the minister of god he is not a king at least not such a king as the apostle commands us to obey and if that sanction which is not just be not a law and can have no obligation upon us by what power soever it be established it may well fall out that the magistrate who will not follow the directive power of the law may fall under the coercive and then the fear is turned upon him with this aggravation that it is not only actual but just this was the case of nero the coercive power was no longer in him but against him he that was forced to fly and to hide himself that was abandoned by all men and condemned to die more majorum sueton according to ancient custom did as i suppose fear and was no way to be feared the like may be said of amaziah king of judah when he fled to lachish of nabuchodonozor when he was driven from the society of men and of many emperors and kings of the greatest nations in the world who have bin so utterly deprived of all power that they have bin imprisoned deposed confined to monasterys killed drawn through the streets cut in pieces thrown into rivers and indeed suffered all that could be suffered by the vilest slaves  if any man say these things ought not to have bin done an answer may be given in a proper place tho twere enough to say that the justice of the world is not to be overthrown by a mere assertion without proof but that is nothing to the present question for if it was ill done to drive nero to despair or to throw vitellius into the common shore it was not because they were the ministers of god for their lives were no way conformable to the character which the apostle gives of those who deserve that sacred name if those only are to be feared who have the power there was a time when they were not to be feared for they had none and if such princes are not obliged by the law as are not under the coercive power it gave no exemption to those for they fell under it and as we know not what will befall others who walk in their steps till they are dead we cannot till then know whether they are free from it or not  sect xii the right and power of a magistrate depends upon his institution not upon his name it is usual with impostors to obtrude their deceits upon men by putting false names upon things by which they may perplex mens minds and from thence deduce false conclusions but the points abovementiond being settled it imports little whether the governors to whom peter enjoins obedience were only kings and such as are employed by them or all such magistrates as are the ministers of god for he informs us of their works that we may know them and accordingly yield obedience to them this is that therefore which distinguishes the magistrate to whom obedience is due from him to whom none is due and not the name that he either assumes or others put upon him but if there be any virtue in the word king and that the admirable prerogatives of which our author dreams were annexed to that name they could not be applied to the roman emperors nor their substituted officers for they had it not it is true mark anthony in a drunken fit at the celebration of the impure lupercalia did offer a diadem to julius caesar which some flatterers pressed him to accept as our great lawyers did cromwell but he durst not think of putting it upon his head caligulas affectation of that title and the ensigns of royalty he wore were taken for the most evident marks of his madness and tho the greatest and bravest of their men had fallen by the wars or proscriptions tho the best part of the senate had perished in thessaly tho the great city was exhausted and italy brought to desolation yet they were not reduced so low as to endure a king piso was sufficiently addicted to tiberius yet he could not suffer that germanicus should be treated as the son of a king principis romani non parthorum regis silio has epulas dari and whoever understands the latin tongue and the history of those times will easily perceive that the word princeps signified no more than a principal or eminent man as has bin already proved and the words of piso could have no other meaning than that the son of a roman ought not to be distinguished from others as the sons of the parthian kings were this is verified by his letter to tiberius under the name of friend and the answer of tiberius promising to him quod amicus amico praestare potest tacit whatsoever one friend could do for another here was no mention of majesty or sovereign lord nor the base subscriptions of servant subject or creature and i fear that as the last of those words was introduced amongst us by our bishops the rest of them had bin also invented by such christians as were too much addicted to the asiatick slavery however the name of king was never solemnly assumed by nor conferred upon those emperors and could have conferred no right if it had they exercised as they pleased or as they durst the power that had bin gained by violence or fraud the exorbitances they committed could not have bin justified by a title any more than those of a pyrat who should take the same it was no otherwise given to em than by way of assimilation when they were guilty of the greatest crimes and tacitus describing the detestable lust of annal l   tiberius says quibus adeo indomitis exarserat ut more regio pubem ingenuam stupris pollueret nec formam tantum and decora corporis sed in his modestam pueritiam in aliis majorum imagines incitamentum cupiditatis habebat he also informs us that nero took his time to put bareas soranus to death who was one of the most virtuous men of that age when tiridates king of armenia was at rome ut magnitudinem imperatoriam caede insignium virorum quasi regio facinore ostentaret an     that he might show the imperial grandeur by the slaughter of the most illustrious men which he accounted a royal action i leave it to the judgment of all wise men whether it be probable that the apostles should distinguish such as these from other magistrates and dignify those only with the title of gods ministers who distinguished themselves by such ways or that the succeeding emperors should be ennobled with the same prerogative who had no other title to the name than by resembling those that had it in such things as these if this be too absurd and abominable to enter into the heart of a man it must be concluded that their intention was only to divert the poor people to whom they preached from involving themselves in the care of civil matters to which they had no call and the counsel would have bin good as things stood with them if they had bin under the power of a pyrat or any other villain substituted by him  but tho the apostles had looked upon the officers set over the provinces belonging to the roman empire as sent by kings i desire to know whether it can be imagined that they could think the subordinate governors to be sent by kings in the countries that had no kings or that obedience became due to the magistrates in greece italy or other provinces under the jurisdiction of rome only after they had emperors and that none was due to them before the germans had then no king the brave arminius had bin lately killed for aiming at a crown when he had blemished all his virtues by that attempt they forgot his former services they never considered how many roman legions he had cut in pieces nor how many thousands of their allies he had destroyed his valor was a crime deserving death when he sought to make a prey of his country which he had so bravely defended and to enslave those who with him had fought for the public liberty but if the apostles were to be understood to give the name of gods ministers only to kings and those who are employed by them and that obedience is due to no other a domestic tyrant had bin their greatest benefactor he had set up the only government that is authorized by god and to which a conscientious obedience is due agathocles dionysius phalaris phaereus pisistratus nabis machanidas and an infinite number of the most detestable villains that the world has ever produced did confer the same benefits upon the countries they enslaved but if this be equally false sottish absurd and execrable all those epithets belong to our author and his doctrine for attempting to depress all modest and regular magistracys and endeavoring to corrupt the scripture to patronize the greatest of crimes no man therefore who dos not delight in error can think that the apostle designed precisely to determine such questions as might arise concerning any one mans right or in the least degree to prefer any one form of government before another in acknowledging the magistrate to be mans ordinance he declares that man who makes him to be may make him to be what he pleases and tho there is found more prudence and virtue in one nation than in another that magistracy which is established in any one ought to be obeyed till they who made the establishment think fit to alter it all therefore whilst they continue are to be looked upon with the same respect every nation acting freely has an equal right to frame their own government and to employ such officers as they please the authority right and power of these must be regulated by the judgment right and power of those who appoint them without any relation at all to the name that is given for that is no way essential to the thing the same name is frequently given to those who differ exceedingly in right and power and the same right and power is as often annexed to magistracys that differ in name the same power which had bin in the roman kings was given to the consuls and that which had bin legally in the dictators for a time not exceeding six months was afterward usurped by the cesars and made perpetual the supreme power which some pretend belongs to all kings has bin and is enjoyed in the fullest extent by such as never had the name and no magistracy was ever more restrained than those that had the name of kings in sparta arragon england poland and other places they therefore that did thus institute regulate and restrain create magistracys and give them names and powers as seemed best to them could not but have in themselves the coercive as well as the directive over them for the regulation and restriction is coercion but most of all the institution by which they could make them to be or not to be as to the exterior sorce it is sometimes on the side of the magistrate and sometimes on that of the people and as magistrates under several names have the same work incumbent upon em and the same power to persorm it the same duty is to be exacted from them and rendered to them which being distinctly proportioned by the laws of every country i may conclude that all magistratical power being the ordinance of man in pursuance of the ordinance of god receives its being and measure from the legislative power of every nation and whether the power be placed simply in one a few or many men or in one body composed of the three simple species whether the single person be called king duke marquess emperor sultan mogol or grand signor or the number go under the name of senate council pregadi diet assembly of estates and the like it is the same thing the same obedience is equally due to all whilst according to the precept of the apostle they do the work of god for our good and if they depart from it no one of them has a better title than the other to our obedience  sect xiii laws were made to direct and instruct magistrates and if they will not be directed to restrain them i know not who they are that our author introduces to say that the first invention of laws was to bridle or moderate the overgreat power of kings and unless they give some better proof of their judgment in other things shall little esteem them they should have considered that there are laws in many places where there are no kings that there were laws in many before there were kings as in israel the law was given three hundred years before they had any but most especially that as no man can be a rightful king except by law nor have any just power but from the law if that power be found to be overgreat the law that gave it must have bin before that which was to moderate or restrain it for that could not be moderated which was not in being leaving therefore our author to fight with these adversarys if he please when he finds them i shall proceed to examine his own positions the truth is says he the original of laws was for the keeping of the multitude in order popular estates could not subsist at all without laws whereas kingdoms were governed many ages without them the people of athens as soon as they gave over kings were forced to give power to draco first then to solon to make them laws if we will believe him therefore wheresoever there is a king or a man who by having power in his hands is in the place of a king there is no need of law he takes them all to be so wise just and good that they are laws to themselves leges viventes this was certainly verified by the whole succession of the cesars the ten last kings of pharamonds race all the successors of charles the great and others that i am not willing to name but referring my self to history i desire all reasonable men to consider whether the piety and tender care that was natural to caligula nero or domitian was such a security to the nations that lived under them as without law to be sufficient for their preservation for if the contrary appear to be true and that their government was a perpetual exercise of rage malice and madness by which the worst of men were armed with power to destroy the best so that the empire could only be saved by their destruction it is most certain that mankind can never fall into a condition which stands more in need of laws to protect the innocent than when such monsters reign who endeavor their extirpation and are too well furnished with means to accomplish their detestable designs without any prejudice therefore to the cause that i defend i might confess that all nations were at the first governed by kings and that no laws were imposed upon those kings till they or the successors of those who had bin advanced for their virtues by falling into vice and corruption did manifestly discover the inconveniences of depending upon their will besides these there are also children women and fools that often come to the succession of kingdoms whose weakness and ignorance stands in as great need of support and direction as the desperate fury of the others can do of restriction and if some nations had bin so sottish not to foresee the mischief of leaving them to their will others or the same in succeeding ages discovering them could no more be obliged to continue in so pernicious a folly than we are to live in that wretched barbarity in which the romans found our ancestors when they first entered this island  if any man say that filmer dos not speak of monsters nor of children women or fools but of wise just and good princes i answer that if there be a right inherent in kings as kings of doing what they please and in those who are next in blood to succeed them and inherit the same it must belong to all kings and such as upon title of blood would be kings and as there is no family that may not and dos not often produce such as i mentioned it must also be acknowledged in them and that power which is left to the wise just and good upon a supposition that they will not make an ill use of it must be devolved to those who will not or cannot make a good one but will either maliciously turn it to the destruction of those they ought to protect or through weakness suffer it to fall into the hands of those that govern them who are found by experience to be for the most part the worst of all most apt to use the basest arts and to flatter the humors and foment the vices that are most prevalent in weak and vicious princes germanicus corbulo valerius asiaticus thraseas soranus helvidius priscus julius agricola and other excellent men lived in the times of tiberius caligula claudius and nero but the power was put into the hands of sejanus macro tigellinus and other villains like to them and i wish there were not too many modern examples to show that weak and vicious princes will never choose such as shall preserve nations from the mischiefs that would ensue upon their own incapacity or malice but that they must be imposed upon them by some other power or nations be ruined for want of them this imposition must be by law or by force but as laws are made to keep things in good order without the necessity of having recourse to force it would be a dangerous extravagance to arm that prince with force which probably in a short time must be opposed by force and those who have bin guilty of this error as the kingdoms of the east and the ancient roman empire where no provision was made by law against illgoverning princes have found no other remedy than to kill them when by extreme sufferings they were driven beyond patience and this fell out so often that few of their princes were observed to die by a common death but since the empire was transmitted to germany and the emperors restrained by i aws that nation has never bin brought to the odious extremitys of suffering all manner of indignitys or revenging them upon the heads of princes and if the pope had not disturbed em upon the account of religion nor driven their princes to disturb others they might have passed many ages without any civil dissension and all their emperors might have lived happily and died peaceably as most of them have done  this might be sufficient to my purpose for if all princes without distinction whether good or bad wise or foolish young or old sober or mad cannot be entrusted with an unlimited power and if the power they have ought to be limited by law that nations may not with danger to themselves as well as to the prince have recourse to the last remedy this law must be given to all and the good can be no otherwise distinguished from the bad and the wise from the foolish than by the observation or violation of it but i may justly go a step farther and affirm that this law which by restraining the lusts of the vicious and foolish frequently preserves them from the destruction they would bring upon themselves or people and sometimes upon both is an assistance and direction to the wisest and best so that they also as well as the nations under them are gainers by it this will appear strange only to those who know not quam grave and intolerandum sit cuncta regendi onus tacit how difficult and insupportable the government of great nations is and how unable the best man is to bear it and if it surpass the strength of the best it may easily be determined how ordinary men will behave themselves under it or what use the worst will make of it i know there have bin wise and good kings but they had not an absolute power nor would have accepted it tho it had bin offered much less can i believe that any of them would have transmitted such a power to their posterity when none of them could know any more than solomon whether his son would be a wise man or a fool but if the best might have desired and had bin able to bear it tho moses by his own confession was not that could be no reason why it should be given to the worst and weakest or those who probably will be so since the assurance that it will not be abused during the life of one man is nothing to the constitution of a state which aims at perpetuity and no man knowing what men will be especially if they come to the power by succession which may properly enough be called by chance it is reasonably to be feared they will be bad and consequently necessary so to limit their power that if they prove to be so the commonwealth may not be destroyed which they were instituted to preserve the law provides for this in leaving to the king a full and ample power of doing as much good as his heart can wish and in restraining his power so that if he should depart from the duty of his office the nation may not perish this is a help to those who are wise and good by directing them what they are to do more certainly than any one mans personal judgment can do and no prejudice at all since no such man did ever complain he was not suffered to do the evil which he would abhor if it were in his power and is a most necessary curb to the fury of bad princes preventing them from bringing destruction upon the people men are so subject to vices and passions that they stand in need of some restraint in every condition but most especially when they are in power the rage of a private man may be pernicious to one or a few of his neighbors but the fury of an unlimited prince would drive whole nations into ruin and those very men who have lived modestly when they had little power have often proved the most savage of all monsters when they thought nothing able to resist their rage it is said of caligula that no man ever knew nec meliorem servum nec deteriorem dominum a better servant nor a worse master the want of restraint made him a beast who might have continued to be a man and tho i cannot say that our law necessarily admits the next in blood to the succession for the contrary is proved yet the facility of our ancestors in receiving children women or such men as were not more able than themselves to bear the weight of a crown convinces me fully that they had so framed our laws that even children women or ill men might either perform as much as was necessarily required of em or be brought to reason if they transgrest and arrogated to themselves more than was allowed for it is not to be imagined that a company of men should so far degenerate from their own nature which is reason to give up themselves and their posterity with all their concernments in the world to depend upon the will of a child a woman an ill man or a fool  if therefore laws are necessary to popular states they are no less to monarchys or rather that is not a state or government which has them not and it is no less impossible for any to subsist without em than for the body of a man to be and perform its functions without nerves or bones and if any people had ever bin so foolish to establish that which they called a government without laws to support and regulate it the impossibility of subsisting would evidence the madness of the constitution and ought to deter all others from following their example  it is no less incredible that those nations which rejected kings did put themselves into the power of one man to prescribe to em such laws as he pleased but the instances alleged by our author are evidently false the athenians were not without laws when they had kings aegeus was subject to the laws and did nothing of importance without the consent of the people and theseus not being able to please them died a banished man draco and solon did not make but propose laws and plut vit solon they were of no force till established by the authority of the people the spartans dealt in the same manner with lycurgus he invented their laws but the people made them and when the assembly of all the citizens had approved and sworn to observe them till his return from crete he resolved rather to die in a voluntary banishment than by his return to absolve them from the oath they had taken the romans also had laws during the government of their kings but not finding in em that perfection they desired the decemviri were chosen to frame others which yet were of no value till they were passed by the people in the ingenti hominum consensu propositis december tabulis populum ad concionem convocarunt and quod bonum faustum foelixque sit reipublicae ipsis liberisque eorum esset ire and legere propositas jussere t live l   comitia centuriata and being so approved they were established but this sanction to which every man whether magistrate or private citizen was subject did no way bind the whole body of the people who still retained in themselves the power of changing both the matter and the form of their government as appears by their instituting and abrogating kings consuls dictators tribuns with consular power and decemviri when they thought good for the commonwealth and if they had this power i leave our author to show why the like is not in other nations  sect xiv laws are not made by kings not because they are busied in greater matters than doing justice but because nations will be governed by rule and not arbitrarily our author pursuing the mistakes to which he seems perpetually condemned says that when kings were either busied in war or distracted with public cares so that every private man could not have access unto their persons to learn their wills and pleasures then of necessity were laws invented that so every particular subject might find his princes pleasure i have often heard that governments were established for the obtaining of justice and if that be true it is hard to imagine what business a supreme magistrate can have to divert him from accomplishing the principal end of his institution and it is as commonly said that this distribution of justice to a people is a work surpassing the strength of any one exodus    man jethro seems to have bin a wise man and it is probable he thought moses to be so also but he found the work of judging the people to be too heavy for him and therefore advised him to leave the judgment of causes to others who should be chosen for that purpose which advice moses accepted and god approved the governing power was as insupportable to him as the judicial he desired rather to die than to bear so great a burden and god neither accusing him of sloth or impatience gave him seventy assistants but if we may believe our author the powers judicial and legislative that of judging as well as that of governing is not too much for any man woman or child whatsoever and that he stands in no need either of gods statutes to direct him or mans counsel to assist him unless it be when he is otherwise employed and his will alone is sufficient for all but what if he be not busied in greater matters or distracted with public cares is every prince capable of this work tho moses had not found it too great for him or it should be granted that a man of excellent natural endowments great wisdom learning experience industry and integrity might perform it is it certain that all those who happen to be born in reigning familys are so if moses had the law of god before his eyes and could repair to god himself for the application or explanation of it have all princes the same assistance do they all speak with god face to face or can they do what he did without the assistance he had if all kings of mature years are of that perfection are we assured that none shall die before his heir arrive to the same or shall he have the same ripeness of judgment in his infancy if a child come to a crown dos that immediately infuse the most admirable endowments and graces have we any promise from heaven that women shall enjoy the same prerogatives in those countries where they are made capable of the succession or dos that law which renders them capable not only defend them against the frailty of their own nature but confer the most sublime virtues upon them but who knows not that no familys do more frequently produce weak or ill men than the greatest and that which is worse their greatness is a snare to them so that they who in a low condition might have passed unregarded being advanced to the highest have often appeared to be or became the worst of all beasts and they who advance them are like to them for if the power be in the multitude as our author is forced to confess otherwise the athenians and romans could not have given all as he says nor a part as i say to draco solon or the decemviri they must be beasts also who should have given away their right and liberty in hopes of receiving justice from such as probably will neither understand nor regard it or protection from those who will not be able to help themselves and expect such virtue wisdom and integrity should be and for ever remain in the family they set up as was never known to continue in any if the power be not conferred upon them they have it not and if they have it not their want of leisure to do justice cannot have bin the cause for which laws are made and they cannot be the signification of their will but are that to which the prince ows obedience as well as the meanest subject this is that which bracton calls esse sub lege and says that rex in regno superiores habet deum and legem fortescue says the kings of england cannot change the laws and indeed they are so far from having any such power that the judges swear to have no regard to the kings letters or commands but if they receive any to proceed according to law as if they had not bin and the breach of this oath dos not only bring a blemish upon their reputation but exposes them to capital punishments as many of them have found it is not therefore the king that makes the law but the law that makes the king it gives the rule for succession making kingdoms sometimes hereditary and sometimes elective and more often than either simply hereditary under condition in some places males only are capable of inheriting in others females are admitted where the monarchy is regular as in germany england etc the kings can neither make nor change laws they are under the law and the law is not under them their letters or commands are not to be regarded in the administration of justice the question is not what pleases them but what the law declares to be right which must have its course whether the king be busy or at leisure whether he will or not the king who never dys is always present in the supreme courts and neither knows nor regards the pleasure of the man that wears the crown but lest by his riches and power he might have some influence upon judicial proceedings the great charter that recapitulates and acknowledges our ancient inherent libertys obliges him to swear that he will neither sell delay nor deny justice to any man according to the laws of the land which were ridiculous and absurd if those laws were only the signification of his pleasure or any way depended upon his will this charter having bin confirmed by more than thirty parliaments all succeeding kings are under the obligation of the same oath or must renounce the benefit they receive from our laws which if they do they will be sound to be equal to every one of us  our author according to his custom having laid down a false proposition gos about to justify it by misapplying the examples of draco solon the decemviri and moses of whom no one had the power he attributes to them and it were nothing to us if they had the athenians and romans as was said before were so far from resigning the absolute power without appeal to themselves that nothing done by their magistrates was os any force till it was enacted by the people and the power given to the decemviri sine provocatione was only in private cases there being no superior magistrate then in being to whom appeals could be made they were vested with the same power the kings and dictators enjoyed from whom there lay no appeal but to the people and always to them as appears by the case of horatius in the time of tullus hostilius that of marcus fabius when papyrius cursor was dictator and of nenius the tribun when q fabius maximus was in the same office all which i have cited already and refer to them there was therefore a reservation of the supreme power in the people notwithstanding the creation of magistrates without appeal and as it was quietly exercised in making strangers or whom they pleased kings restraining the power of dictators to six months and that of the decemviri to two years when the last did contrary to law endeavor by force to continue their power the people did by force destroy it and them  the case of moses is yet more clear he was the most humble and gentle of all men he never raised his heart above his brethren and commanded kings to live in the same modesty he never desired the people should depend upon his will in giving laws to them he fulfilled the will of god not his own and those laws were not the signification of his will but of the will of god they were the production of gods wisdom and goodness not the invention of man given to purify the people not to advance the glory of their leader he was not proud and insolent nor pleased with that ostentation of pomp to which fools give the name of majesty and whoever so far exalts the power of a man to make nations depend upon his pleasure dos not only lay a burden upon him which neither moses nor any other could ever bear and every wise man will always abhor but with an impious fury endeavors to set up a government contrary to the laws of god presumes to accuse him of want of wisdom or goodness to his own people and to correct his errors which is a work fit to be undertaken by such as our author  from hence as upon a solid foundation he proceeds and making use of king jamess words infers that kings are above the laws because he so teaches us but he might have remembered that having affirmed the people could not judge of the disputes that might happen between them and kings because they must not be judges in their own case it is absurd to make a king judge of a case so nearly concerning himself in the decision of which his own passions and interests may probably lead him into errors and if it be pretended that i do the same in giving the judgment of those matters to the people the case is utterly different both in the nature and consequences the kings judgment is merely for himself and if that were to take place all the passions and vices that have most power upon men would concur to corrupt it he that is set up for the public good can have no contest with the whole people whose good he is to procure unless he deflect from the end of his institution and set up an interest of his own in opposition to it this is in its nature the highest os all delinquencys and if such a one may be judge of his own crimes he is not only sure to avoid punishment but to obtain all that he sought by them and the worse he is the more violent will his dsires be to get all the power into his hands that he may gratiy his lusts and execute his pernicious designs on the other side in a popular assembly no man judges for himself otherwise than as his good is comprehended in that of the public nothing hurts him but what is prejudicial to the commonwealth such amongst them as may have received private injurys are so far only considered by others as their sufferings may have influence upon the public if they be few and the matters not great others will not suffer their quiet to be disturbed by them if they are many and grievous the tyranny thereby appears to be so cruel that the nation cannot subsist unless it be corrected or suppressed corruption of judgment proceeds from private passions which in these cases never govern and tho a zeal for the public good may possibly be misguided yet till it be so it can never be capable of excess the last tarquin and his lewd son exercised their fury and lust in the murders of the best men in rome and the rape of lucretia appius claudius was filled with the like madness caligula and nero were so well established in the power of committing the worst of villanys that we do not hear of any man that offered to defend himself or woman that presumed to refuse them if they had bin judges in these cases the utmost of all villanys and mischiefs had bin established by law but as long as the judgment of these matters was in the people no private or corrupt passion could take place lucius brutus valerius horatius and virginius with the people that followed them did not by the expulsion of the kings or the suppression of the decemviri assume to themselves a power of committing rapes and murders nor any advantages beyond what their equals might think they deserved by their virtues and services to the commonwealth nor had they more credit than others for any other reason than that they showed themselves most forward in procuring the public good and by their valor and conduct best able to promote it  whatsoever happened after the overthrow of their liberty belongs not to my subject for there was nothing of popularity in the judgments that were made one tyrant destroyed another the same passions and vices for the most part reigned in both the last was often as bad as his predecessor whom he had overthrown and one was sometimes approved by the people for no other reason than that it was thought impossible for him to be worse than he who was in possession of the power but if one instance can be of force amongst an infinite number of various accidents the words of valerius asiaticus who by wishing he had bin the man that had killed caligula did in a moment pacify the fury of the soldiers who were looking for those that had done it show that as long as men retain any thing of that reason which is truly their nature they never fail of judging rightly of virtue and vice whereas violent and ill princes have always done the contrary and even the best do often deflect from the rules of justice as appears not only by the examples of edward the first and third who were brought to confess it but even those of david and solomon  moreover to show that the decision of these controversys cannot belong to any king but to the people we are only to consider that as kings and all other magistrates whether supreme or subordinate are constituted only for the good of the people the people only can be fit to judge whether the end be accomplished a physician dos not exercise his art for himself but for his patients and when i am or think i shall be sick i send for him of whom i have the best opinion that he may help me to recover or preserve my health but i lay him aside if i find him to be negligent ignorant or unfaithful and it would be ridiculous for him to say i make my self judge in my own case for i only or such as i shall consult am fit to be the judge of it he may be treacherous and through corruption or malice endeavor to poison me or have other defects that render him unfit to be trusted but i cannot by any corrupt passion be led wilfully to do him injustice and if i mistake it is only to my own hurt the like may be said of lawyers stewards pilots and generally of all that do not act for themselves but for those who employ them and if a company going to the indys should find that their pilot was mad drunk or treacherous they whose lives and goods are concerned can only be fit to judge whether he ought to be trusted or not since he cannot have a right to destroy those he was chosen to preserve and they cannot be thought to judge perversely because they have nothing to lead them but an opinion of truth and cannot err but to their own prejudice in the like manner not only solon and draco but romulus numa hostilius the consuls dictators and decemviri were not distinguished from others that it might be well with them sed ut bonum faelix faustumque sit populo romano but that the prosperity and happiness of the people might be procured which being the thing always intended it were absurd to refer the judgment of the performance to him who is suspected of a design to overthrow it and whose passions interests and vices if he has any lead him that way if king james said any thing contrary to this he might be answered with speech in star chamber      some of his own words i was says he sworn to maintain the laws of the land and therefore had bin perjured if i had broken them it may also be presumed he had not forgotten what his master buchanan had taught hist scot in the books he wrote chiefly for his instruction that the violation of the laws of scotland could not have bin so fatal to most of his predecessors de jure reg apud scot kings of that country nor as he himself had made them to his mother if kings as kings were above them  sect xv a general presumption that kings will govern well is not a sufficient security to the people but says our author yet will they rule their subjects by the law and a king governing in a settled kingdom leaves to be a king and degenerates into a tyrant so soon as he ceases to rule according unto his laws yet where he sees them rigorous or doubtful he may mitigate or interpret this is therefore an effect of their goodness they are above laws but will rule by law we have filmers word for it but i know not how nations can be assured their princes will always be so good goodness is always accompanied with wisdom and i do not find those admirable qualitys to be generally inherent or entailed upon supreme magistrates they do not seem to be all alike and we have not hitherto found them all to live in the same spirit and principle i can see no resemblance between moses and caligula joshua and claudius gideon and nero samson and vitellius samuel and otho david and domitian nor indeed between the best of these and their own children if the sons of moses and joshua had bin like to them in wisdom valor and integrity it is probable they had bin chosen to succeed them if they were not the like is less to be presumed of others no man has yet observed the moderation of gideon to have bin in abimelech the piety of eli in hophni and phineas the purity and integrity of samuel in joel and abiah nor the wisdom of solomon in rehoboam and if there was so vast a difference between them and their children who doubtless were instructed by those excellent men in the ways of wisdom and justice as well by precept as example were it not madness to be confident that they who have neither precept nor good example to guide them but on the contrary are educated in an utter ignorance or abhorrence of all virtue will always be just and good or to put the whole power into the hands of every man woman or child that shall be born in governing familys upon a supposition that a thing will happen which never did or that the weakest and worst will perform all that can be hoped and was seldom accomplished by the wisest and best exposing whole nations to be destroyed without remedy if they do it not and if this be madness in all extremity it is to be presumed that nations never intended any such thing unless our author prove that all nations have bin mad from the beginning and must always continue to be so to cure this he says they degenerate into tyrants and if he meant as he speaks it would be enough for a king cannot degenerate into a tyrant by departing from that law which is only the product of his own will but if he do degenerate it must be by departing from that which dos not depend upon his will and is a rule prescribed by a power that is above him this indeed is the doctrine of bracton who having said that the power of the king is the power of the law because the law makes him king adds quia si faciat injuriam definit esse rex and degenerat in tyrannum and fit vicarius diaboli bract that if he do injustice he ceases to be king degenerates into a tyrant and becomes the vicegerent of the devil but i hope this must be understood with temperament and a due consideration of human frailty so as to mean only those injurys that are extreme for otherwise he would terribly shake all the crowns of the world  but lest our author should be thought once in his life to have dealt sincerely and spoken truth the next lines show the fraud of his last assertion by giving to the prince a power of mitigating or interpreting the laws that he sees to be rigorous or doubtful but as he cannot degenerate into a tyrant by departing from the law which proceeds from his own will so he cannot mitigate or interpret that which proceeds from a superior power unless the right of mitigating or interpreting be conferred upon him by the same for as all wise men confess that cujus est instituere ejus est abrogare none can abrogate but those who may institute and that all mitigation and interpretation varying from the true sense is an alteration that alteration is an abrogation for quicquid mutatut dissolvitur interit ergo whatsoever is changed is dissolved and therefore the power of mitigating is inseparable from that of instituting this is sufficiently evidenced by henry the eighths answer to the speech made to him by the speaker of the house of commons      in which he tho one of the most violent princes we ever had confesses the parliament to be the lawmakers and that an obligation lay upon him rightly to use the power with which he was entrusted the right therefore of altering being inseparable from that of making laws the one being in the parliament the other must be so also fortescue says plainly the king cannot change any law magna charta casts all upon leges terrae and consuetudines angliae the laws of the land and customs of england but to say that the king can by his will make that to be a custom or an ancient law which is not or that not to be so which is is most absurd he must therefore take the laws and customs as he finds them and can neither detract from nor add any thing to them the ways are prescribed as well as the end judgments are given by equals per pares the judges who may be assisting to those are sworn to proceed according to law and not to regard the kings letters or commands the doubtful cases are reserved and to be referred to the parliament as in the statute of    edw   d concerning treasons but never to the king the law intending that these parliaments should be annual and leaving to the king a power of calling them more often if occasion require takes away all pretense of a necessity that there should be any other power to interpret or mitigate laws for it is not to be imagined that there should be such a pestilent evil in any ancient law custom or later act of parliament which being on the sudden discovered may not without any great prejudice continue for forty days till a parliament may be called whereas the force and essence of all laws would be subverted if under color of mitigating and interpreting the power of altering were allowed to kings who often want the inclination and for the most part the capacity of doing it rightly it is not therefore upon the uncertain will or understanding of a prince that the safety of a nation ought to depend he is sometimes a child and sometimes overburdend with years some are weak negligent slothful foolish or vicious others who may have something of rectitude in their intentions and naturally are not incapable of doing well are drawn out of the right way by the subtilty of ill men who gain credit with them that rule must always be uncertain and subject to be distorted which depends upon the fancy of a man he always fluctuates and every passion that arises in his mind or is infused by others disorders him the good of a people ought to be established upon a more solid foundation for this reason the law is established which no passion can disturb it is void of desire and fear lust and anger it is mens sine affectu written reason retaining some measure of the divine perfection it dos not enjoin that which pleases a weak frail man but without any regard to persons commands that which is good and punishes evil in all whether rich or poor high or low it is deaf inexorable inflexible  by this means every man knows when he is safe or in danger because he knows whether he has done good or evil but if all depended upon the will of a man the worst would be often the most safe and the best in the greatest hazard slaves would be often advanced the good and the brave scorned and neglected the most generous nations have above all things sought to avoid this evil and the virtue wisdom and generosity of each may be discerned by the right fixing of the rule that must be the guide of every mans life and so constituting their magistracy that it may be duly observed such as have attained to this perfection have always flourished in virtue and happiness they are as aristotle says governed by god rather than by men whilst those who subjected themselves to the will of a man were governed by a beast  this being so our authors next clause that tho a king do frame all his actions to be according unto law yet he is not bound thereunto but as his good will and for good example or so far forth as the general law for the safety of the commonwealth does naturally bind him is wholly impertinent for if the king who governs not according to law degenerates into a tyrant he is obliged to frame his actions according to law or not to be a king for a tyrant is none but as contrary to him as the worst of men is to the best but if these obligations were untied we may easily guess what security our authors words can be to us that the king of his own good will and for a good example will frame his actions according to the laws when experience instructs us that notwithstanding the strictest laws and most exquisite constitutions that men of the best abilitys in the world could ever invent to restrain the irregular appetites of those in power with the dreadful examples of vengeance taken against such as would not be restrained they have frequently broken out and the most powerful have for the most part no otherwise distinguished themselves from the rest of men than by the enormity of their vices and being the most forward in leading others to all manner of crimes by their example  sect xvi the observation of the laws of nature is absurdly expected from tyrants who set themselves up against all laws and he that subjects kings to no other law than what is common to tyrants destroys their being our authors last clause acknowledging kings to be bound by a general law to provide for the safety of the people would be sufficient for my purpose if it were sincere for municipal laws do only show how that should be performed and if the king by departing from that rule degenerates as he says into a tyrant it is easily determined what ought then to be done by the people but his whole book being a heap of contradictions and frauds we can rely upon nothing that he says and his following words which under the same law comprehend both kings and tyrants show that he intends kings should be no otherwise obliged than tyrants which is not at all by this means says he are all kings even tyrants and conquerors bound to preserve the lands goods libertys and lives of all their subjects not by any municipal law of the land so much as by the natural law of a father which obliges them to ratify the acts of their forefathers and predecessors in things necessary for the public good of their subjects if he be therefore in the right tyrants and conquerors are kings and fathers the words that have bin always thought to comprehend the most irreconcilable contrariety the one expressing the most tender love and care evidently testified by the greatest obligations conferred upon those who are under it the other the utmost of all injurys that can be offered to men signify the same thing there is no difference between a magistrate who is what he is by law and a public enemy who by force or fraud sets himself up against all law and what he said before that kings degenerated into tyrants signifys nothing for tyrants also are kings  his next words are no less incomprehensible for neither king nor tyrant can be obliged to preserve the lands goods and libertys of their subjects if they have none but as liberty consists only in being subject to no mans will and nothing denotes a slave but a dependence upon the will of another if there be no other law in a kingdom than the will of a prince there is no such thing as liberty property also is an appendage to liberty and it is as impossible for a man to have a right to lands or goods if he has no liberty and enjoys his life only at the pleasure of another as it is to enjoy either when he is deprived of em he therefore who says kings and tyrants are bound to preserve their subjects lands libertys goods and lives and yet lays for a foundation that laws are no more than the significations of their pleasure seeks to delude the world with words which signify nothing  the vanity of these whimsys will farther appear if it be considered that as kings are kings by law and tyrants are tyrants by overthrowing the law they are most absurdly joined together and it is not more ridiculous to set him above the law who is what he is by the law than to expect the observation of the laws that enjoin the preservation of the lands libertys goods and lives of the people from one who by fraud or violence makes himself master of all that he may be restrained by no law and is what he is by subverting all law  besides if the safety of the people be the supreme law and this safety extend to and consist in the preservation of their libertys goods lands and lives that law must necessarily be the root and beginning as well as the end and limit of all magistratical power and all laws must be subservient and subordinate to it the question will not then be what pleases the king but what is good for the people not what conduces to his profit or glory but what best secures the libertys he is bound to preserve he dos not therefore reign for himself but for the people he is not the master but the servant of the commonwealth and the utmost extent of his prerogative is to be able to do more good than any private man if this be his work and duty it is easily seen whether he is to judge of his own performance or they by whom and for whom he reigns and whether in order to this he be to give laws or to receive them it is ordinarily said in france il faut que chacun soit servi a sa mode every mans business must be done according to his own mind and if this be true in particular persons it is more plainly so in whole nations many eyes see more than one the collected wisdom of a people much surpasses that of a single person and tho he should truly seek that which is best it is not probable he would so easily find it as the body of a nation or the principal men chosen to represent the whole this may be said with justice of the best and wisest princes that ever were but another language is to be used when we speak of those who may succeed and who very often through the defects of age person or sex are neither fit to judge of other mens affairs nor of their own and are so far from being capable of the highest concernments relating to the safety of whole nations that the most trivial cannot reasonably be referred to them  there are few men except such as filmer who by bidding defiance to the laws of god and man seems to declare war against both whom i would not trust to determine whether a people that can never fall into nonage or dotage and can never fail of having men of wisdom and virtue amongst em be not more fit to judge in their own persons or by representatives what conduces to their own good than one who at a venture may be born in a certain family and who besides his own infirmitys passions vices or interests is continually surrounded by such as endeavor to divert him from the ways of truth and justice and if no reasonable man dare prefer the latter before the former we must rely upon the laws made by our forefathers and interpreted by the nation and not upon the will of a man  it is in vain to say that a wise and good council may supply the defects or correct the vices of a young foolish or ill disposed king for filmer denis that a king whatever he be without exception for he attributes profound wisdom to all is obliged to follow the advice of his council and even he himself would hardly have had the impudence to say that good counsel given to a foolish or wicked prince were of any value unless he were obliged to follow it this council must be chosen by him or imposed upon him if it be imposed upon him it must be by a power that is above him which he says cannot be if chosen by one who is weak foolish or wicked it can never be good because such virtue and wisdom is required to discern and choose a few good and wise men from a multitude of foolish and bad as he has not and it will generally fall out that he will take for his counselors rather those he believes to be addicted to his person or interests than such as are fitly qualified to perform the duty of their places but if he should by chance or contrary to his intentions make choice of some good and wise men the matter would not be much mended for they will certainly differ in opinion from the worst and tho the prince should intend well of which there is no assurance nor any reason to put so great a power into his hands if there be none it is almost impossible for him to avoid the snares that will be laid to seduce him i know not how to put a better face upon this matter for if i examine rather what is probable than possible foolish or ill princes will never choose such as are wise and good but favoring those who are most like to themselves will prefer such as second their vices humors and personal interests and by so doing will rather fortify and rivet the evils that are brought upon the nation through their defects than cure them this was evident in rehoboam he had good counsel but he would not hearken to it we know too many of the same sort and tho it were not impossible as machiavelli says it is for a weak prince to receive any benefit from a good council we may certainly conclude that a people can never expect any good from a council chosen by one who is weak or vicious  if a council be imposed upon him and he be obliged to follow their advice it must be imposed by a power that is above him his will therefore is not a law but must be regulated by the law the monarchy is not above the law and if we will believe our author it is no monarchy because the monarch has not his will and perhaps he says true for if that be an aristocracy where those that are or are reputed to be the best do govern then that is certainly a mixed state in which the will of one man dos not prevail but if princes are not obliged by the law all that is founded upon that supposition falls to the ground they will always follow their own humors or the suggestions of those who second them tiberius hearkened to none but chaldeans or the ministers of his impuritys and crueltys claudius was governed by slaves and the profligate strumpets his wives there were many wise and good men in the senate during the reigns of caligula nero and domitian but instead of following their counsel they endeavored to destroy them all lest they should head the people against them and such princes as resemble them will always follow the like courses  if i often repeat these hateful names it is not for want of fresher examples of the same nature but i choose such as mankind has universally condemned against whom i can have no other cause of hatred than what is common to all those who have any love to virtue and which can have no other relation to the controversys of later ages than what may flow from the similitude of their causes rather than such as are too well known to us and which every man according to the measure of his experience may call to mind in reading these i may also add that as nothing is to be received as a general maxim which is not generally true i need no more to overthrow such as filmer proposes than to prove how frequently they have bin found false and what desperate mischiefs have bin brought upon the world as often as they have bin practiced and excessive powers put into the hands of such as had neither inclination nor ability to make a good use of them and therefore    if the safety of nations be the end for which governments are instituted such as take upon them to govern by what title soever are by the law of nature bound to procure it and in order to this to preserve the lives lands libertys and goods of every one of their subjects and he that upon any title whatsoever pretends assumes or exercises a power of disposing of them according to his own will violates the laws of nature in the highest degree    if all princes are obliged by the law of nature to preserve the lands goods lives and libertys of their subjects those subjects have by the law of nature a right to their libertys lands goods etc and cannot depend upon the will of any man for that dependence destroys liberty etc    ill men will not and weak men cannot provide for the safety of the people nay the work is of such extreme difficulty that the greatest and wisest men that have bin in the world are not able by themselves to perform it and the assistance of counsel is of no use unless princes are obliged to follow it there must be therefore a power in every state to restrain the ill and to instruct weak princes by obliging them to follow the counsels given else the ends of government cannot be accomplished nor the rights of nations preserved  all this being no more than what is said by our author or necessarily to be deduced from his propositions one would think he were become as good a commonwealthsman as cato but the washed swine will return to the mire he overthrows all by a preposterous conjunction of the rights of kings which are just and by law with those of tyrants which are utterly against law and gives the sacred and gentle name of father to those beasts who by their actions declare themselves enemies not only to all law and justice but to mankind that cannot subsist without them this requires no other proof than to examine whether attila or tamerlan did well deserve to be called fathers of the countries they destroyed the first of these was usually called the scourge of god and he gloried in the name the other being reproved for the detestable crueltys he  exercised made answer you speak to me as to a man i am not a man but the scourge of god and plague of mankind this is certainly sweet and gentle language savouring much of a fatherly tenderness there is no doubt that those who use it will provide for the safety of the nations under them and the preservation of the laws of nature is rightly referred to them and it is also very probable that they who come to burn the countries and destroy the nations that fall under their power should make it their business to preserve them and look upon the former governors as their fathers whose acts they are obliged to confirm tho they seldom attain to the dominion by any other means than the slaughter of them and their familys  but if the enmity be not against the nation and the cause of the war be only for dominion against the ruling person or family as that of baasha against the house of jeroboam of zimri against that of baasha of omri against zimri and of jehu against joram the prosecution of it is a strange way of becoming the son of the person destroyed and filmer alone is subtle enough to discover that jehu by extinguishing the house of ahab drew an obligation upon himself of looking on him as his father and confirming his acts if this be true moses was obliged to confirm the acts of the kings of the amalekites moabites and amorites that he destroyed the same duty lay upon joshua in relation to the canaanites but it is not so easily decided to which of them he did owe that deference for the same could not be due to all and it is hard to believe that by killing above thirty kings he should purchase to himself so many fathers and the like may be said of diverse others  moreover there is a sort of tyrant who has no father as agathocles dionysius caesar and generally all those who subvert the libertys of their own country and if they stood obliged to look upon the former magistrates as their predecessors and to confirm their acts the first should have bin to give impunity and reward to any that would kill them it having bin a fundamental maxim in those states uniuique licere tyrannum occidere that any man might kill a tyrant  this being in all respects ridiculous and absurd it is evident that our author who by proposing such a false security to nations for their libertys endeavors to betray them is not less treacherous to kings when under a pretense of defending their rights he makes them to be the same with those of tyrants who are known to have none and are tyrants because they have none and gives no other hopes to nations of being preserved by the kings they set up for that end than what upon the same account may be expected from tyrants whom all wise men have ever abhorred and affirmed to have bin produced in generis humani exitium natos to bring destruction upon the world and whose lives have verified the sentence  this is truly to depose and abolish kings by abolishing that by which and for which they are so the greatness of their power riches state and the pleasures that accompany them cannot but create enemies some will envy that which is accounted happiness others may dislike the use they make of their power some may be unjustly exasperated by the best of their actions when they find themselves incommoded by them others may be too severe judges of slight miscarriages these things may reasonably temper the joys of those who delight most in the advantages of crowns but the worst and most dangerous of all their enemies are these accursed sycophants who by making those that ought to be the best of men like to the worst destroy their being and by persuading the world they aim at the same things and are bound to no other rule than is common to all tyrants give a fair pretense to ill men to say they are all of one kind and if this should be received for truth even they who think the miscarriages of their governors may be easily redrest and desire no more would be the most fierce in procuring the destruction of that which is naught in principle and cannot be corrected  sect xvii kings cannot be the interpreters of the oaths they take our authors book is so full of absurditys and contradictions that it would be a rope of sand if a continued series of frauds did not like a string of poisons running through the whole give it some consistence with it self and show it to be the work of one and the same hand after having endeavored to subvert the laws of god nature and nations most especially our own by abusing the scriptures falsely alleging the authority of many good writers and seeking to obtrude upon mankind a universal law that would take from every nation the right of constituting such governments within themselves as seem most convenient for them and giving rules for the administration of such as they had established he gives us a full view of his religion and morals by destroying the force of the oath taken by our kings at their coronation others says he affirm that although laws of themselves do not bind kings yet the oaths of kings at their coronation ty them to keep all the laws of their kingdoms how far this is true let us but examine the oath of the kings of england at their coronation the words whereof are these art thou pleased to cause to be administered in all thy judgments indifferent and upright justice and to use discretion with mercy and verity art thou pleased that our upright laws and customs be observed and do thou promise that those shall be protected and maintained by thee etc to which the king answers in the affirmative being first demanded by the archbishop of canterbury pleases it you to confirm and observe the laws and customs of the ancient times granted from god by just and devout kings unto the english nation by oath unto the said people especially the laws libertys and customs granted unto the clergy and laity by the famous king edward from this he infers that the king is not to observe all laws but such as are upright because he finds evil laws mentioned in the oath of richard the  d which he swears to abolish now what laws are upright and what evil who shall judge but the king etc so that in effect the king does swear to keep no laws but such as in his judgment are upright etc and if he did strictly swear to observe all laws he could not without perjury give his consent to the repealing or abrogating of any statute by act of parliament etc and again but let it be supposed for truth the kings do swear to observe all laws of their kingdoms yet no man can think it reason that the kings should be more bound by their voluntary oaths than common persons now if a private person make a contract either with oath or without oath he is no farther bound than the equity and justice of the contract tys him for a man may have relief against an unreasonable and unjust promise if either deceit or error force or fear induced him thereunto or if it be hurtful or grievous in the performance since the law in many cases gives the king a prerogative above common persons lest i should be thought to insist upon small advantages i will not oblige any man to show where filmer found this oath nor observe the faults committed in the translation but notwithstanding his false representation i find enough for my purpose and intend to take it in his own words but first i shall take leave to remark that those who for private interests addict themselves to the personal service of princes tho to the ruin of their country find it impossible to persuade mankind that kings may govern as they please when all men know there are laws to direct and restrain them unless they can make men believe they have their power from a universal and superior law or that princes can attempt to dissolve the obligations laid upon them by the laws which they so solemnly swear to observe without rendering themselves detestable to god and man and subject to the revenging hands of both unless they can invalidate those oaths mr hobbes i think was the first who very ingeniously contrived lib de cive a compendious way of justifying the most abominable perjurys and all the mischiefs ensuing thereupon by pretending that as the kings oath is made to the people the people may absolve him from the obligation and that the people having conferred upon him all the power they had he can do all that they could he can therefore absolve himself and is actually free since he is so when he pleases this is only false in the minor for the people not having conferred upon him all but only a part of their power that of absolving him remains in themselves otherwise they would never have obliged him to take the oath he cannot therefore absolve himself the pope indeed finds a help for this and as christs vicar pretends the power of absolution to be in him and exercised it in absolving k john but our author despairing to impose either of these upon our age and nation with more impudence and less wit would enervate all coronationoaths by subjecting them to the discretion of the taker whereas all men have hitherto thought their force to consist in the declared sense of those who give them this doctrine is so new that it surpasses the subtilty of the schoolmen who as an ingenious person said of em had minced oaths so fine that a million of em as well as angels may stand upon the point of a needle and were never yet equaled but by the jesuits who have overthrown them by mental reservations which is so clearly demonstrated from their books that it cannot be denied but so horrible that even those of their own order who have the least spark of common honesty condemn the practice and one of them being a gentleman of a good family told me he would go the next day and take all the oaths that should be offered if he could satisfy his conscience in using any manner of equivocation or mental reservation that he might put any other sense upon them than he knew to be intended by those who offered them and if our authors conscience were not more corrupted than that of the jesuit who had lived fisty years under the worst discipline that i think ever was in the world i would ask him seriously if he truly believe that the nobility clergy and commonalty os england who have bin always so zealous for their ancient laws and so resolute in defending em did mean no more by the oaths they so solemnly imposed and upon which they laid so much weight than that the king should swear to keep em so far only as he should think fit  but he swears only to observe those that are upright etc how can that be understood otherwise than that those who give the oath do declare their laws and customs to be upright and good and he by taking the oath affirms them to be so or how can they be more precisely specified than by the ensuing clause granted from god by just and devout kings by oath especially those os the samous king edward but says he by the same oath richard the  d was bound to abolish those that were evil i any such had ept in hro error or bin obtruded by malice the evil being discovered and declared by the nobility and commons who were concerned he was not to take advantage of them or by his refusal to evade the abolition but to join with his people in annulling them according to the general clause of assenting to those quas vulgus elegerit  magna charta being only an abridgment of our ancient laws and customs the king that swears to it swears to them all and not being admitted to be the interpreter of it or to determine what is good or evil fit to be observed or annuld in it can have no more power over the rest this having bin confirmed by more parliaments than we have had kings since that time the same obligation must still lie upon them all as upon john and henry in whose time that claim of right was compiled the act was no less solemn than important and the most dreadful curses that could be conceived in words which were denounced against such as should any way infringe it by the clergy in westminster hall in the presence and with the assent of k henry iii many of the principal nobility and all the estates of the kingdom show whether it was referred to the kings judgment or not when it is evident they feared the violation from no other than himself and such as he should employ i confess the church as they then called the clergy was fallen into such corruption that their arms were not much to be feared by one who had his conscience clear but that could not be in the case of perjury and our ancestors could do no better than to employ the spiritual sword reserving to themselves the use of the other in case that should be despised tho the popes excommunications proved sometimes to be but bruta fulmina when a just cause was wanting it may be easily judged what obedience a prince could expect from his subjects when every man knew he had by perjury drawn the most heavy curses upon himself k john was certainly wicked but he durst not break these bonds till he had procured the popes absolution for a cover and when he had done so he found himself unsafe under it and could not make good what he had promised to the pope to obtain it the parliament declaring that his grants to the pope were unjust illegal contrary to his coronation oath and that they would not be held by them this went so far in that kings time that writs were issued out to men of all conditions to oblige themselves by oath to keep the great charter and if other means sailed er quod ipsum regem per captionem distringerent and gravarent ad prafata exequenda to compel the king to perform the conditions it is expressly said in his charter et ip barons cum communitate totius terra distringent and gravabunt nos modis omnibus quius poterunt scicet per captionem castrorum terrarum posesionum and aliis modis quibus potuerint don emendatum uerit secundum arbitrium corm that the barons and commonalty of the land shall straiten and compel us by all means possible as by seizing our towns lands and possessions or any other way till satisfaction be made according to their pleasure and in the charter of his son henry it is upon the same supposition of not performing the agreement said licet omnibus de regno nostro contra no nsurgre and omni aere qu gravamen nostrum repiciant a s nobi n nul tenrentur it shall be lawful for all men in our kingdom to rise up against us and to do all things that may be grievous to us as if they were absolutely free from any engagements to our person these words seem to have bin contrived to be so full and strong propter duplicitatem regis which was with too much reason suspected and it is not as i suppose the language of slaves and villains begging something srom their lord but of noble and free men who knew their lord was no more than what they made him and had nothing but what they gave him nor the language of a lord treating with such as enjoyed their libertys by his favor but with those whom he acknowledged to be the judges of his performing what had bin stipulated and equals the agreements made between the kings and people of arragon which i cited before from the relations of antonio perez this is as far as men can go and the experience of all ages manifests that princes performing their office and observing these stipulations have lived glorious happy and beloved and i can hardly find an example of any who have notoriously broken these oaths and bin adjudgd to have incurred the penaltys who have not lived miserably died shamefully and left an abominable memory to posterity  but says our author kings cannot be more obliged by voluntary oaths than other men and may be relieved from unjust and unreasonable promises if they be induced by deceit error force or fear or the performance be grievous which is to say that no oath is of any obligation for there is none that is not voluntary or involuntary and there never was any upon which some such thing may not be pretended which would be the same if such as filmer had the direction of their consciences who take the oaths and of those who are to exact the performance this would soon destroy all confidence between king and people and not only unhinge the best established governments but by a detestable practice of annihilating the force of oaths and most solemn contracts that can be made by men overthrow all societys that subsist by them i leave it to all reasonable men to judge how fit a work this would be for the supreme magistrate who is advanced to the highest degree of human glory and happiness that he may preserve them and how that justice for the obtaining of which governments are constituted can be administered if he who is to exact it from others dos in his own person utterly subvert it and what they deserve who by such base prevarications would teach em to pervert and abolish the most sacred of all contracts a worthy person of our age was accustomed to say that contracts in writing were invented only to bind villains who having no law justice or truth within themselves would not keep their words unless such testimonys were given as might compel them but if our authors doctrine were received no contract would be of more value than a cobweb such as are not absolutely of a profligate conscience so far reverence the religion of an oath to think that even those which are most unjustly and violently imposed ought to be observed and julius caesar who i think was not overscrupulous when he was taken by pirates and set at liberty upon his word caused the ransom he had promised to be paid to them we see the like is practiced every day by prisoners taken in unjust as well as just wars and there is no honest man that would not abhor a person who being taken by the pirates of algier should not pay what he had promised for his liberty twere in vain to say they had no right of exacting or that the performance was grievous he must return to the chains or pay and tho the people of artois alsatia or flanders do perhaps with reason think the king of france has no right to impose oaths of allegiance upon them no man doubts that if they choose rather to take those oaths than to suffer what might ensue upon their refusal they are as much bound to be faithful to him as his ancient subjects  the like may be said of promises extorted by fraud and no other example is necessary to prove they are to be performed than that of joshua made to the gibeonites they were an accursed nation which he was commanded to destroy they came to him with lies and by deceit induced him to make a league with them which he ought not to have done but being made it was to be performed and on that account he did not only spare but defend them and the action was approved by god when saul by a preposterous zeal violated that league the anger of god for that breach of faith could no otherwise be appeased than by the death of seven of his children this case is so full so precise and of such undoubted authority that i shall not trouble my self with any other but if we believe our man of good morals voluntary oaths and promises are of no more value than those gained by force or deceit that is to say none are of any for voluntary signifying nothing but free all human acts are either free or not free that is from the will of the person or some impulse from without if therefore there be no force in those that are free nor in those that are not free there is none in any  no better use can be made of any pretension of error or that the performance was grievous for no man ought to be grieved at the performance of his contract david assures us that a good man performs his agreement tho he lose by it and the lord chancellor egerton told a gentleman who desired relief against his own deed upon an allegation that he knew not what he did when he signed it that he did not sit to relieve fools  but tho voluntary promises or oaths when to use the lawyers language there is not a valuable consideration were of no obligation or that men brought by force fear or error into such contracts as are grievous in the performance might be relieved this would not at all reach the cases of princes in the contracts made between them and their subjects and confirmed by their oaths there being no color of force or fraud fear or error for them to alledg nor any thing to be pretended that can be grievous to perform otherwise than as it may be grievous to an ill man not to do the mischiefs he had conceived  nations according to their own will frame the laws by which they resolve to be governed and if they do it not wisely the damage i only to themselves but it is hard to find an example of any people that did by force oblige a man to take upon him the government of them gideon was indeed much pressed by the israelites to be their ing and the army of germanicus in a mutiny more fiercely urged him to be emperor but both desisted when their offers were refused if our kings have bin more modest and our ancestors more pertinacious in compelling them to accept the crowns they offered i shall upon proof of the matter change my opinion but till that do appear i may be pardoned if i think there was no such thing william the norman was not by force brought into england but came voluntarily and desired to be king the nobility clergy and commons proposed the conditions upon which they would receive him these conditions were to govern according to their ancient laws especially those that had bin granted or rather collected in the time of the famous king edward here was neither force nor fraud i he had disliked the terms he might have retired as freely as he came but he did like them and tho he was not perhaps so modest to say with the addit mat par brave saxon king osfa ad libertatis vestrae tuitionem non meis meriti sed solaliberalitate vestra unanimiter me convocasts he accepted the cown upon the conditions offered and swore upon the evangelists to observe them not much valuing this he pretended to govern according to  own will but finding the people would not endure it he renewed his oath upon the same evangelists and the relics of s alban which he needed not to have done but might have departed to his duchy of normandy if he had not liked the conditions or thought fit to observe them it is probable he examined the contents of edwards laws before he bonas and approbatas antiqus regni leges quas sancti and pii reges ejus antecessores and maxim edvardus statuit iniolabiliter observare swore to them and could not imagine that a free nation which never had any other kings than such as had bin chosen by themselves for the preservation of their liberty and from whose liberality the best of their kings acknowledged the crowns they wore did intend to give up their persons libertys and estates to him who was a stranger most especially when they would not receive him till he had sworn to the same laws by which the others had reigned of which one was as appears by the act of the conventus pananglicus that reges a sacerdotibus and senioribus populi eligantur the kings should be elected by the clergy and elders of the people by these means he was advanced to the crown to which he could have no title unless they had the right of conferring it upon him here was therefore no force deceit or error and whatsoever equity there might be to relieve one that had bin forced frighted or circumvented it was nothing to this case we do not find that william the   d or henry were forced to be kings no sword was put to their throats and for any thing we know the english nation was not then so contemptible but men might have bin found in the world who would willingly have accepted the crown and even their elder brother robert would not have refused but the nobility and commons trusting to their oaths and promises thought fit to prefer them before him and when he endeavored to impose himself upon the nation by force they so severely punished him that no better proof can be required to show they were accustomed to have no other kings than such as they approved and this was one of the customs that all their kings swore to maintain it being as ancient just and well approved as any other  having already proved that all the kings we have had since that time have come in upon the same title that the saxon laws to which all have sworn continue to be of force amongst us and that the words pronounced four times on the four sides of the scaffold by the archbishop will ye have this man to reign do testify it i may spare the pains of a repetition and justly conclude that if there was neither force nor fraud fear nor error to be pretended by the first there could be none in those that followed  but the observation of this oath may be grievous if i received money the last year upon bond promise or sale of a manor or farm can it be thought grievous to me to be compelled to repay or make over the land according to my agreement or if i did not seal the bond till i had the money must not i perform the condition or at the least restore what i had received if it be grievous to any king to preserve the libertys lives and estates of his subjects and to govern according to their laws let him resign the crown and the people to whom the oath was made will probably release him others may possibly be found who will not think it grievous or if none will accept a crown unless they may do what they please the people must bear the misfortune of being obliged to govern themselves or to institute some other sort of magistracy that will be satisfied with a less exorbitant power perhaps they may succeed as well as some others have done who without being brought to that necessity have voluntarily cast themselves into the misery of living without the majestic splendour of a monarch or if that fail they may as their last refuge surrender up themselves to slavery when that is done we will acknowledge that whatsoever we have is derived from the favor of our master but no such thing yet appearing amongst us we may be pardoned if we think we are freemen governed by our own laws and that no man has a power over us which is not given and regulated by them nor that any thing but a new law made by our selves can exempt our kings from the obligation of performing their oaths taken to govern according to the old in the true sense of the words as they are understood in our language by those who give them and conducing to the ends for which they are given which can be no other than to defend us from all manner of arbitrary power and to fix a rule to which we are to conform our actions and from which according to our deserts we may expect reward or punishment and those who by prevarications cavils or equivocations endeavor to dissolve these obligations do either maliciously betray the cause of kings by representing them to the world as men who prefer the satisfaction of their irregular appetites before the performance of their duty and trample under foot the most sacred bonds of human society or from the grossest ignorance do not see that by teaching nations how little they can rely upon the oaths of their princes they instruct them as little to observe their own and that not only because men are generally inclined to follow the examples of those in power but from a most certain conclusion that he who breaks his part of a contract cannot without the utmost impudence and folly expect the performance of the other nothing being more known amongst men than that all contracts are of such mutual obligation that he who fails of his part discharges the other if this be so between man and man it must needs be so between one and many millions of men if he were free because he says he is every man must be free also when he pleases if a private man who receives no benefit or perhaps prejudice from a contract be obliged to perform the conditions much more are kings who receive the greatest advantages the world can give as they are not by themselves nor for themselves so they are not different in specie from other men they are born live and die as we all do the same law of truth and justice is given to all by god and nature and perhaps i may say the performance of it is most rigorously exacted from the greatest of men the liberty of perjury cannot be a privilege annexed to crowns and it is absurd to think that the most venerable authority that can be conferred upon a man is increased by a liberty to commit or impunity in committing such crimes as are the greatest aggravations of infamy to the basest villains in the world  sect xviii the next in blood to deceased kings cannot generally be said to be kings till they are crowned it is hereupon usually objected that kings do not come in by contract nor by oath but are kings by or according to proximity of blood before they are crowned tho this be a bold proposition i will not say it is universally false it is possible that in some places the rule of succession may be set down so precisely that in some cases every man may be able to see and know the sense as well as the person designed to be the successor but before i acknowledge it to be universally true i must desire to know what this rule of succession is and from whence it draws its original  i think i may be excused if i make these scruples because i find the thing in dispute to be variously adjudgd in several places and have observed five different manners of disposing crowns esteemed hereditary besides an infinite number of collateral controversys arising from them of which we have diverse examples and if there be one universal rule appointed one of these only can be right and all the others must be vicious the first gives the inheritance to the eldest male of the eldest legitimate line as in france according to that which they call the salique law the second to the eldest legitimate male of the reigning family as anciently in spain according to which the brother of the deceased king has bin often if not always preferred before the son if he were elder as may appear by the dispute between corbis and orsua cited before from titus livius and in the same country during the reign of the goths the eldest male succeeded whether legitimate or illegitimate the fourth receives females or their descendents without any other condition distinguishing them from males except that the younger brother is preferred before the elder sister but the daughter of the elder brother is preferred before the son of the younger the fifth gives the inheritance to females under a condition as in sweden where they inherit unless they marry out of the country without the consent of the estates according to which rule charles gustavus was chosen as any stranger might have bin tho son to a sister of gustavus adolphus who by marrying a german prince had forfeited her right and by the same act of estates by which her eldest son was chosen and the crown entailed upon the heirs of his body her second son the prince adolphus was wholly excluded  till these questions are decided by a judge of such undoubted authority that all men may safely submit it is hard for any man who really seeks the satisfaction of his conscience to know whether the law of god and nature tho he should believe there is one general law do justify the customs of the ancient  medis levibusque sabaeis imperat hic sexus reginarumque sub armis barbaries pars magna jacet lucan  medes and sabeans mentioned by the poet who admitted females or those of france which totally exclude them as unfit to reign over men and utterly unable to perform the duty of a supreme magistrate as we see they are every where excluded from the exercise of all other offices in the commonwealth if it be said that we ought to follow the customs of our own country i answer that those of our own country deserve to be observed because they are of our own country but they are no more to be called the laws of god and nature than those of france or germany and tho i do not believe that any general law is appointed i wish i were sure that our customs in this point were not more repugnant to the light of nature and prejudicial to our selves than those of some other nations but if i should be so much an englishman to think the will of god to have bin more particularly revealed to our ancestors than to any other nation and that all of them ought to learn from us yet it would be difficult to decide many questions that may arise for tho the parliament in the    th of henry the sixth made an act in favor of richard duke of york descended from a daughter of mortimer who married the daughter of the duke of clarence elder brother to john of gaunt they rather asserted their own power of giving the crown to whom they pleased than determined the question for if they had believed that the crown had belonged to him by a general and eternal law they must immediately have rejected henry as a usurper and put richard into the possession of his right which they did not and tho they did something like to this in the cases of maud the empress in relation to king stephen and her son henry the   d and of henry the   th in relation to the house of york both before he had married a daughter of it and after her death they did the contrary in the cases of william the first and second henry the   st stephen john richard the   d henry the   th mary elizabeth and others so that for any thing i can yet find it is equally difficult to discover the true sense of the law of nature that should be a guide to my conscience whether i so far submit to the laws of my country to think that england alone has produced men that rightly understand it or examine the laws and practices of other nations  whilst this remains undecided it is impossible for me to know to whom i owe the obedience that is exacted from me if i were a frenchman i could not tell whether i owed allegiance to the king of spain duke of lorrain duke of savoy or many others descended from daughters of the house of valois one of whom ought to inherit if the inheritance belongs to females or to the house of bourbon whose only title is founded upon the exclusion of them the like controversys will be in all places and he that would put mankind upon such inquirys goes about to subvert all the governments of the world and arms every man to the destruction of his neighbor  we ought to be informed when this right began if we had the genealogy of every man from noah and the crowns of every nation had since his time continued in one line we were only to inquire into how many kingdoms he appointed the world to be divided and how well the division we see at this day agrees with the allotment made by him but mankind having for many ages lain under such a vast confusion that no man pretends to know his own original except some jews and the princes of the house of austria we cannot so easily arrive at the end of our work and the scriptures making no other mention of this part of the world than what may induce us to think it was given to the sons of japhet we have nothing that can lead us to guess how it was to be subdivided nor to whom the several parcels were given so that the difficultys are absolutely inextricable and tho it were true that some one man had a right to every parcel that is known to us it could be of no use for that right must necessarily perish which no man can prove nor indeed claim but as all natural rights by inheritance must be by descent this descent not being proved there can be no natural right and all rights being either natural created or acquired this right to crowns not being natural must be created or acquired or none at all  there being no general law common to all nations creating a right to crowns as has bin proved by the several methods used by several nations in the disposal of them according to which all those that we know are enjoyed we must seek the right concerning which we dispute from the particular constitutions of every nation or we shall be able to find none  acquired rights are obtained as men say either by fair means or by foul that is by force or by consent such as are gained by force may be recovered by force and the extent of those that are enjoyed by consent can only be known by the reasons for which or the conditions upon which that consent was obtained that is to say by the laws of every people according to these laws it cannot be said that there is a king in every nation before he is crowned john sobietski now reigning in poland had no relation in blood to the former kings nor any title till he was chosen the last king of sweden acknowledged he had none but was freely elected and the crown being conferred upon him and the heirs of his body if the present king dies without issue the right of electing a successor returns undoubtedly to the estates of the country the crown of denmark was elective till it was made hereditary by an act of the general diet held at copenhagen in the year    0 and it is impossible that a right should otherwise accrue to a younger brother of the house of holstein which is derived from a younger brother of the counts of oldenburgh the roman empire having passed through the hands of many persons of different nations no way relating to each other in blood was by constantine transferred to constantinople and after many revolutions coming to theodosius by birth a spaniard was divided between his two sons arcadius and honorius from thence passing to such as could gain most credit with the soldiers the western empire being brought almost to nothing was restored by charles the great of france and continuing for some time in his descendents came to the germans who having created several emperors of the houses of suevia saxony bavaria and others as they pleased about three hundred years past chose rodolphus of austria and tho since that time they have not had any emperor who was not of that family yet such as were chosen had nothing to recommend them but the merits of their ancestors their own personal virtues or such political considerations as might arise from the power of their hereditary countries which being joined with those of the empire might enable em to make the better defense against the turks but in this line also they have had little regard to inheritance according to blood for the elder branch of the family is that which reigns in spain and the empire continues in the descendents of ferdinand younger brother to charles the fifth tho so unfixd even to this time that the present emperor leopold was in great danger of being rejected  if it be said that these are elective kingdoms and our author speaks of such as are hereditary i answer that if what he says be true there can be no elective kingdom and every nation has a natural lord to whom obedience is due but if some are elective all might have bin so if they had pleased unless it can be proved that god created some under a necessity of subjection and left to others the enjoyment of their liberty if this be so the nations born under that necessity may be said to have a natural lord who has all the power in himself before he is crowned or any part conferred on him by the consent of the people but it cannot extend to others and he who pretends a right over any nation upon that account stands obliged to show when and how that nation came to be discriminated by god from others and deprived of that liberty which he in goodness had granted to the rest of mankind i confess i think there is no such right and need no better proof than the various ways of disposing inheritances in several countries which not being naturally or universally better or worse one than another cannot spring from any other root than the consent of the several nations where they are in force and their opinions that such methods were best for them but if god has made a discrimination of people he that would thereupon ground a title to the dominion of any one must prove that nation to be under the curse of slavery which for any thing i know was only denounced against cham and it is as hard to determine whether the sense of it be temporal spiritual or both as to tell precisely what nations by being descended from him fall under the penaltys threatened  if these therefore be either entirely false or impossible to be proved true there is no discrimination or not known to us and every people has a right of disposing of their government as well as the polanders danes swedes germans and such as are or were under the roman empire and if any nation has a natural lord before he be admitted by their consent it must be by a peculiar act of their own as the crown of france by an act of that nation which they call the salique law is made hereditary to males in a direct line or the nearest to the direct and others in other places are otherwise disposed  i might rest here with full assurance that no disciple of filmer can prove this of any people in the world nor give so much as the shadow of a reason to persuade us there is any such thing in any nation or at least in those where we are concerned and presume little regard will be had to what he has said since he cannot prove of any that which he so boldly affirms of all but because good men ought to have no other object than truth which in matters of this importance can never be made too evident i will venture to go farther and assert that as the various ways by which several nations dispose of the succession to their respective crowns show they were subject to no other law than their own which they might have made different by the same right they made it to be what it is even those who have the greatest veneration for the reigning familys and the highest regard for proximity of blood have always preferred the safety of the commonwealth before the concernments of any person or family and have laid aside the nearest in blood not only when they were found to be notoriously vicious and wicked but when they have thought it more convenient to take others and to prove this i intend to make use of no other examples than those i find in the historys of spain france and england  whilst the goths governed spain not above four persons in the space of three hundred years were the immediate successors of their fathers but the brother cousin german or some other man of the familys of the balthei or amalthei was preferred before the children of the deceased king and if it be said this was according to the law of that kingdom i answer that it was therefore in the power of that nation to make laws for themselves and consequently others have the same right one of their kings called wamba was deposed and made a monk after he had saavedra coron goth reigned well many years but falling into a swound and his friends thinking him past recovery cut off his hair and put a monks frock upon him that according to the superstition of those times he might die in it and the cutting off the hair being a most disgraceful thing amongst mar hist l   the goths they would not restore him to his authority suintila another of their kings being deprived of the crown for his ill government his children and brothers were excluded and sisinandus crowned in his saavedra coron goth room  this kingdom being not long after overthrown by the moors a new one arose from its ashes in the person of don pelayo first king of the asturias which increasing by degrees at last came to comprehend all spain and so continues to this day but not troubling my self with all the deviations from the common rule in the collateral lines of navarr arragon and portugal i find that by fifteen several instances in that one series of kings in the asturias and leon who afterward came to be kings of castille it is fully proved that what respect soever they showed to the next in blood who by the law were to succeed they preferred some other person as often as the supreme law of taking care that the nation might receive no detriment persuaded them to it  don pelayo enjoyed for his life the kingdom conferred upon him by the spaniards who with him retired into the mountains to defend themselves against the moors and was succeeded by his son favila but tho favila left many sons when he died alphonso sirnamd the chaste was advanced to the crown and they all laid aside fruela son to alphonso the catholic was for his cruelty deposed put to death and his sons excluded aurelio his cousin german succeeded him and at his death silo who mariana l    married his wifes sister was preferred before the males of the blood royal alphonso sirnamd el casto was first violently dispossessed of the crown by a bastard of the royal family but he being dead the nobility and people thinking alphonso more fit to be a monk than a king gave the crown to bermudo called el diacono but bermudo after several years resigning the kingdom they conceived a better opinion of alphonso and made him king alphonso dying without issue don ramiro son to bermudo was preferred before the nephews of alphonso don ordonno fourth from ramiro let four legitimate sons but they being young the estates laid them aside and made his brother fruela king fruela had many children but the same estates gave the crown to alphonso the fourth who was his nephew alphonso turning monk recommended his son ordonno to the estates of the kingdom but they refused him and made his brother ramiro king ordonno third son to ramiro dying left a son called bermudo but the estates took his brother sancho and advanced him to the throne henry the first being accidentally killed in his youth left only two sisters blanch married to lewis son to philip august king of france and berenguela married to alphonso king of leon the estates made ferdinand son of berenguela the youngest sister marian l   c   king excluding blanch with her husband and children for being strangers and berenguela her self because they thought not fit that her husband should have any part in the government alphonso el savio seems to have bin a very good prince but applying himself more to the study of astrology than to affairs of government his eldest son ferdinand de la cerda dying and leaving his sons alphonso and ferdinand very young the nobility clergy and people deposed him excluded his granchildren and gave the crown to don sancho his younger son sirnamd el bravo thinking him more fit to command them against the moors than an old astrologer or a child alphonso and sancho being dead alphonso el desheredado laid claim to the crown but it was given to ferdinand the fourth and alphonso with his descendents the dukes de medina celi remain excluded to this day peter sirnamd the cruel was twice driven out of the kingdom and at last killed by bertrand de guesclin constable of france or henry count of trastamara his bastardbrother who was made king without any regard to the daughters of peter or marian l    to the house of la cerda henry the fourth left a daughter called joan whom he declared his heir but the estates gave the kingdom to isabel his sister and crowned her with ferdinand of arragon her husband joan daughter to this ferdinand and isabel falling mad the estates committed the care of the governnent to her father ferdinand and after his death to her son  but the french have taught us that when a king dies his next heir is really king before he take his oath or be crowned from them we learn that le mort saisit le vif and yet i know no history that proves more plainly than theirs that there neither is nor can be in any man a right to the government of a people which dos not receive its being manner and measure from the law of the country which i hope to justify by four reasons    when a king of pharamonds race died the kingdom was divided into as many parcels as he had sons which could not have bin if one certain heir had bin assigned by nature for he ought to have had the whole and if the kingdom might be divided they who inhabited the several parcels could not know to whom they owed obedience till the division was made unless he who was to be king of paris metz soissons or orleans had worn the name of his kingdom upon his forehead but in truth if there might be a division the doctrine is false and there was no lord of the whole this wound will not be healed by saying the father appointed the division and that by the law of nature every man may dispose of his own as he thinks fit for we shall soon prove that the kingdom of france neither was nor is disposable as a patrimony or chattel besides if that act of kings had bin then grounded upon the law of nature they might do the like at this day but the law by which such divisions were made having bin abrogated by the assembly hist de fr en la vie de hugues capet of estates in the time of hugh capet and never practiced since it follows that they were grounded upon a temporary law and not upon the law of nature which is eternal if this were not so the pretended certainty could not be for no man could know to whom the last king had bequeathed the whole kingdom or parcels of it till the will were opened and that must be done before such witnesses as may deserve credit in a matter of this importance and are able to judge whether the bequest be rightly made for otherwise no man could know whether the kingdom was to have one lord or many nor who he or they were to be which intermission must necessarily subvert their polity and this doctrine but the truth is the most monarchical men among them are so far from acknowledging any such right to be in the king of alienating bequeathing or dividing the kingdom that they do not allow him the right of making a will and that of the last king lewis the    th touching the regency during the minority of his son was of no effect mem du duc de la rochefocault     this matter was made more clear under the second race if a lord had bin assigned to them by nature he must have bin of the royal family but pepin had no other title to the crown except the merits of his father and his own approved by the nobility and people who made him king he had three sons the eldest was made king of italy and dying before him left a son called bernard heir of that kingdom paul aemil hist franc the estates of france divided what remained between charles the great and carloman the last of these dying in a few years left many sons but the nobility made charles king of all france and he dispossessed bernard of the kingdom of italy inherited from his father so that he also was not king of the whole before the expulsion of bernard the son of his elder brother nor of aquitain which by inheritance should have belonged to the children of his younger brother any otherwise than by the will of the estates lewis the debonair succeeded upon the same title was deposed and put into a monastery by his three sons lothair pepin and lewis whom he had by his first wife but tho these left many sons the kingdom came to charles the bald the nobility and people disliking the eldest son of charles gave the kingdom to lewis le begue who had a legitimate son called charles le simple but his two bastards lewis and carloman were made kings carloman had a son called lewis le faineant he was made king but afterward deposed for his vicious life charles le gross succeeded him but for his ill government was also deposed and odo who was a stranger to the royal blood was made king the same nobility that had made five kings since lewis le begue now made charles le simple king who according to his name was entrapd at peronne by ralph duke of burgundy and forced to resign his crown leaving only a son called lewis who fled into england ralph being dead they took lewis sirnamd outremer and placed him in the throne he had two sons lothair and charles lothair succeeded him and died without issue charles had as fair a title as could be by birth and the estates confessed it but their ambassadors told him that he having by an unworthy life rendered himself unworthy of the crown they whose principal care was to have a good prince at the head of them had chosen hugh capet and the crown continues in his race to this day tho not altogether without interruption robert son to hugh capet succeeded him he left two sons robert and henry but henry the younger son appearing to the estates of the kingdom to be more fit to reign than his elder brother they made him king robert and his descendents continuing dukes of burgundy only for about ten generations at which time his issue male failing that duchy returned to the crown during the life of king john who gave it to his second son philip for an apannage still depending upon the crown the same province of burgundy was by the treaty of madrid granted to the emperor charles the sisth by francis the first but the people refused to be alienated and the estates of the kingdom approved their refusal by the same authority charles the   th was removed from the government when he appeared to be mad and other examples of a like nature may be alleged from which we may safely conclude that if the death of one king dos really invest the next heir with the right and power or that he who is so invested be subject to no law but his own will all matters relating to that kingdom must have bin horribly confused during the reigns of twenty two kings of pharamonds race they can have had no rightful king from the death of chilperic to king john and the succession since that time is very liable to be questioned if not utterly overthrown by the house of austria who by the counts of hapsburg derive their descent from pharamond and by the house of lorrain claiming from charles who was excluded by capet all which is most absurd and they who pretend it bring as much confusion into their own laws and upon the polity of their own nation as shame and guilt upon the memory of their ancestors who by the most extreme injustice have rejected their natural lord or dispossessed those who had bin in the most solemn manner placed in the government and to whom they had generally sworn allegiance    if the next heir be actually king seized of the power by the death of his predecessor so that there is no intermission then all the solemnitys and religious ceremonys used at the coronations of their kings with the oaths given and taken are the most profane abuses of sacred things in contempt of god and man that can be imagined most especially if the act be as our author calls it voluntary and the king receiving nothing by it be bound to keep it no longer than he pleases the prince who is to be sworn might spare the pains of watching all night in the church fasting praying confessing communicating and swearing that he will to the utmost of his power defend the clergy maintain the union of the church obviate all excess rapine extortion and iniquity take care that in all judgments justice may be observed with equity and mercy etc or of invoking the assistance of the holy ghost for the better performance of his oath and without ceremony tell the nobility and people that he would do what he thought fit twere to as little purpose for the archbishop of rheims to take the trouble of saying mass delivering to him the crown scepter and other ensigns of royalty explaining what is signified by them anointing him with the oil which they say was delivered by an angel to st remigius blessing him and praying to god to bless him if he rightly performed his oath to god and the people and denouncing the contrary in case of failure on his part if these things conferred nothing upon him but what he had before and were of no obligation to him such ludifications of the most sacred things are too odious and impious to be imputed to nations that have any virtue or profess christianity this cannot fall upon the french and spaniards who had certainly a great zeal to religion whatever it was and were so eminent sor moral virtues as to be a reproach to us who live in an age of more knowledge but their meaning is so well declared by their most solemn acts that none but those who are wilfully ignorant can mistake one of the councils held at toledo declared by the clergy nobility and  tlt others assisting that no man should be placed in the royal seat till he had sworn to preserve the church etc another held in the same place signified  tlt   to sisinandus who was then newly crowned that if he or any of his successors should contrary to their oaths and the laws of their country proudly and cruelly presume to exercise domination over them he should be excommunicated and separated from christ and them to eternal judgment the french laws and their best writers asserting the same things are confirmed by perpetual practice henry of navarre tho certainly according to their rules and in their esteem a most accomplished prince  was by two general assemblys of the estates held at blois deprived of the succession for being a protestant and notwithstanding the greatness of his reputation valor victorys and affability could never be admitted till he had made himself capable of the ceremonys of his coronation by conforming to the religion which by the oath he was to defend nay this present king tho haughty enough by nature and elevated by many successes has acknowledged as he says with joy that he can do nothing contrary to law and calls it a happy impotence in pursuance of which he has annuld many acts of his father and grandfather alienating the demeasnes of the crown as things contrary to law and not within their power  these things being confirmed by all the good authors of that nation filmer finds only the worst to be fit for his turn and neither minding law nor history takes his maxims from a vile flattering discourse of bellay calculated for the personal interest of henry the fourth then king of navarr in which he says that the heir apparent tho furious mad apol cathol a fool vicious and in all respects abominably wicked must be admitted to the crown but bellay was so far from attaining the ends designed by his book that by such doctrins which filled all men with horror he brought great prejudice to his master and procured little favor from henry who desired rather to recommend himself to his people as the best man they could set up than to impose a necessity upon em of taking him if he had bin the worst but our author not contented with what this sycophant says in relation to such princes as are placed in the government by a law establishing the succession by inheritance with an impudence peculiar to himself asserts the same right to be in any man who by any means gets into power and imposes the same necessity of obedience upon the subject where there is no law as bellay dos by virtue of one that is established    in the last place as bellay acknowledges that the right belongs to princes only where it is established by law i deny that there is was or ever can be any such no people is known to have bin so mad or wicked as by their own consent for their own good and for the obtaining of justice to give the power to beasts under whom it could never be obtained or if we could believe that any had bin guilty of an act so full of folly turpitude and wickedness it could not have the force of a law and could never be put in execution for tho the rules by which the proximity should be judged be never so precise it will still be doubted whose case suits best with them tho the law in some places gives private inheritances to the next heir and in others makes allotments according to several proportions no one knows to whom or how far the benefit shall accrue to any man till it be adjudgd by a power to which the partys must submit contests will in the like manner arise concerning successions to crowns how exactly soever they be disposed by law for tho every one will say that the next ought to succeed yet no man knows who is the next which is too much verified by the bloody decisions of such disputes in many parts of the world and he that says the next in blood is actually king makes all questions thereupon arising impossible to be otherwise determined than by the sword the pretender to the right being placed above the judgment of man and the subjects for any thing i know obliged to believe serve and obey him if he says he has it for otherwise if either every man in particular or all together have a right of judging his title it can be of no value till it be adjudgd  i confess that the law of france by the utter exclusion of females and their descendents dos obviate many dangerous and inextricable difficultys but others remain which are sufficient to subvert all the polity of that kingdom if there be not a power of judging them and there can be none if it be true that le mort saisit le vif not to trouble my self with feigned cases that of legitimation alone will suffice it is not enough to say that the children born under marriage are to be reputed legitimate for not only several children born of joan daughter to the king of portugal wife to henry the fourth of castille during the time of their marriage were utterly rejected as begotten in adultery but also her daughter joan whom the king during his life and at the hour of his death acknowledged to have bin begotten by him and the only title that isabel who was married to ferdinand of arragon had to the crown of spain was derived from their rejection it would be tedious and might give offense to many great persons if i should relate all the dubious cases that have bin or still remain in the world touching matters of this nature but the lawyers of all nations will testify that hardly any one point comes before them which affords a greater number of difficult cases than that of marriages and the legitimation of children upon them and nations must be involved in the most inextricable difficultys if there be not a power somewhere to decide them which cannot be if there be no intermission and that the next in blood that is he who says he is the next be immediately invested with the right and power but surely no people has bin so careless of their most important concernments to leave them in such uncertainty and simply to depend upon the humor of a man or the faith of women who besides their other frailtys have bin often accused of supposititious births and mens passions are known to be so violent in relation to women they love or hate that none can safely be trusted with those judgments the virtue of the best would be exposed to a temptation that flesh and blood can hardly resist and such as are less perfect would follow no other rule than the blind impulse of the passion that for the present reigns in them there must therefore be a judge of such disputes as may in these cases arise in every kingdom and tho it is not my business to determine who is that judge in all places yet i may justly say that in england it is the parliament if no inferior authority could debar ignotus son to the lady rosse born under the protection from the inheritance of a private family none can certainly assume a power of disposing of the crown upon any occasion no authority but that of the parliament could legitimate the children of catherine swinford with a proviso not to extend to the inheritance of the crown others might say if they were lawfully begotten they ought to inherit every thing and nothing if they were not but the parliament knew how to limit a particular favor and prevent it from extending to a public mischief henry the eighth took an expeditious way of obviating part of the controversys that might arise from the multitude of his wives by cutting off the heads of some as soon as he was weary of them or had a mind to take another but having bin hindered from dealing in the same manner with catherine by the greatness of her birth and kindred he left such as the parliament only could resolve and no less power would ever have thought of making mary and elizabeth capable of the succession when according to ordinary rules one of em must have bin a bastard and it had bin absurd to say that both of em were immediately upon the death of their predecessors possessed of the crown if an act of parliament had not conferred the right upon them which they could not have by birth but the kings and princes of england have not bin of a temper different from those of other nations and many examples may be brought of the like occasions of dispute happening every where and the like will probably be for ever which must necessarily introduce the most mischievous confusions and expose the titles which as is pretended are to be esteemed most sacred to be overthrown by violence and fraud if there be not in all places a power of deciding the controversys that arise from the uncertainty of titles according to the respective laws of every nation upon which they are grounded no man can be thought to have a just title till it be so adjudgd by that power this judgment is the first step to the throne the oath taken by the king obliges him to observe the laws of his country and that concerning the succession being one of the principal he is obliged to keep that part as well as any other  sect xix the greatest enemy of a just magistrate is he who endeavors to invalidate the contract between him and the people or to corrupt their manners it is not only from religion but from the law of nature that we learn the necessity of standing to the agreements we make and he who departs from the principle written in the hearts of men pactis standum seems to degenerate into a beast such as had virtue tho without true religion could tell us as a brave and excellent grecian did that it was not necessary for him to live but it was necessary to preserve his heart from deceit and his tongue from falsehood the roman satyrist carrys the same notion to a great height and affirms that  phalaris licet imperet ut sis flsus and admoto dictet perjuria tauro summum creed nesas animam praferre pudori juvena  tho the worst of tyrants should command a man to be false and perjured and back his injunction with the utmost of torments he ought to prefer his integrity before his life and tho filmer may be excused if he often mistake in matters of theology yet his inclinations to rome which he prefers before geneva might have led him to the principles in which the honest romans lived if he had not observed that such principles as make men honest and generous do also make them lovers of liberty and constant in the defense of their country which savouring too much of a republican spirit he prefers the morals of that city since they are become more refined by the pious and charitable jesuits before those that were remarkable in them as long as they retained any shadow of their ancient integrity which admitted of no equivocations and detested prevarications by that means preserving innocence in the hearts of private men for their inward contentment and in civil societys for the public good which if once extinguished mankind must necessarily fall into the condition hobbes rightly calls bellum omnium contra omnes wherein no man can promise to himself any other wise children or goods than he can procure by his own sword  some may perhaps think that the endeavors of our author to introduce such accursed principles as tend to the ruin of mankind proceed from his ignorance but tho he appears to have had a great measure of that quality i fear the evil proceeds from a deeper root and that he attempts to promote the interests of ill magistrates who make it their business to destroy all good principles in the people with as much industry as the good endeavor to preserve them where they are and teach them where they are wanting reason and experience instruct us that every man acts according to the end he proposes to himself the good magistrate seeks the good of the people committed to his care that he may perform the end of his institution and knowing that chiefly to consist in justice and virtue he endeavors to plant and propagate them and by doing this he procures his own good as well as that of the public he knows there is no safety where there is no strength no strength without union no union without justice no justice where faith and truth in accomplishing public and private contracts is wanting this he perpetually inculcates and thinks it a great part of his duty by precept and example to educate the youth in a love of virtue and truth that they may be seasoned with them and filled with an abhorrence of vice and falsehood before they attain that age which is exposed to the most violent temptations and in which they may by their crimes bring the greatest mischiefs upon the public he would do all this tho it were to his own prejudice but as good actions always carry a reward with them these contribute in a high measure to his advantage by preferring the interest of the people before his own he gains their affection and all that is in their power comes with it whilst he unites them to one another he unites all to himself in leading them to virtue he increases their strength and by that means provides for his own safety glory and power  on the other side such as seek different ends must take different ways when a magistrate fancys he is not made for the people but the people for him that he dos not govern for them but for himself and that the people live only to increase his glory or to furnish matter for his pleasures he dos not inquire what he may do for them but what he may draw from them by this means he sets up an interest of profit pleasure or pomp in himself repugnant to the good of the public for which he is made to be what he is these contrary ends certainly divide the nation into partys and whilst every one endeavors to advance that to which he is addicted occasions of hatred for injurys every day done or thought to be done and received must necessarily arise this creates a most fierce and irreconcilable enmity because the occasions are frequent important and universal and the causes thought to be most just the people think it the greatest of all crimes to convert that power to their hurt which was instituted for their good and that the injustice is aggravated by perjury and ingratitude which comprehend all manner of ill and the magistrate gives the name of sedition or rebellion to whatsoever they do for the preservation of themselves and their own rights when mens spirits are thus prepared a small matter sets them on fire but if no accident happen to blow them into a flame the course of justice is certainly interrupted the public affairs are neglected and when any occasion whether foreign or domestic arises in which the magistrate stands in need of the peoples assistance they whose affections are alienated not only show an unwillingness to serve him with their persons and estates but fear that by delivering him from his distress they strengthen their enemy and enable him to oppress them and he fancying his will to be unjustly opposed or his due more unjustly denied is filled with a dislike of what he sees and a fear of worse for the future whilst he endeavors to ease himself of the one and to provide against the other he usually increases the evils of both and jealousys are on both sides multiplied every man knows that the governed are in a great measure under the power of the governor but as no man or number of men is willingly subject to those who seek their ruin such as fall into so great a misfortune continue no longer under it than force fear or necessity may be able to oblige them but as such a necessity can hardly lie longer upon a great people than till the evil be fully discovered and comprehended and their virtue strength and power be united to expel it the ill magistrate looks upon all things that may conduce to that end as so many preparatives to his ruin and by the help of those who are of his party will endeavor to prevent that union and diminish that strength virtue power and courage which he knows to be bent against him and as truth faithful dealing due performance of contracts and integrity of manners are bonds of union and helps to good he will always by tricks artifices cavils and all means possible endeavor to establish falsehood and dishonesty whilst other emissarys and instruments of iniquity by corrupting the youth and seducing such as can be brought to leudness and debauchery bring the people to such a pass that they may neither care nor dare to vindicate their rights and that those who would do it may so far suspect each other as not to confer upon much less to join in any action tending to the public deliverance  this distinguishes the good from the bad magistrate the faithful from the unfaithful and those who adhere to either living in the same principle must walk in the same ways they who uphold the rightful power of a just magistracy encourage virtue and justice and teach men what they ought to do suffer or expect from others they fix them upon principles of honesty and generally advance every thing that tends to the increase of the valor strength greatness and happiness of the nation creating a good union among them and bringing every man to an exact understanding of his own and the public rights on the other side he that would introduce an ill magistrate make one evil who was good or preserve him in the exercise of injustice when he is corrupted must always open the way for him by vitiating the people corrupting their manners destroying the validity of oaths and contracts teaching such evasions equivocations and frauds as are inconsistent with the thoughts that become men of virtue and courage and overthrowing the confidence they ought to have in each other make it impossible for them to unite among themselves the like arts must be used with the magistrate he cannot be for their turn till he is persuaded to believe he has no dependence upon and ows no duty to the people that he is of himself and not by their institution that no man ought to inquire into nor be judge of his actions that all obedience is due to him whether he be good or bad wise or foolish a father or an enemy to his country this being calculated for his personal interest he must pursue the same designs or his kingdom is divided within it self and cannot subsist by this means those who flatter his humor come to be accounted his friends and the only men that are thought worthy of great trusts whilst such as are of another mind are exposed to all persecution these are always such as excel in virtue wisdom and greatness of spirit they have eyes and they will always see the way they go and leaving fools to be guided by implicit faith will distinguish between good and evil and choose that which is best they will judge of men by their actions and by them discovering whose servant every man is know whether he is to be obeyed or not those who are ignorant of all good careless or enemies to it take a more compendious way their slavish vicious and base natures inclining them to seek only private and present advantages they easily slide into a blind dependence upon one who has wealth and power and desiring only to know his will care not what injustice they do if they may be rewarded they worship what they find in the temple tho it be the vilest of idols and always like that best which is worst because it agrees with their inclinations and principles when a party comes to be erected on such a foundation debauchery leudness and dishonesty are the true badges of it such as wear them are cherished but the principal marks of favor are reserved for those who are the most industrious in mischief either by seducing the people with the allurements of sensual pleasures or corrupting their understandings by false and slavish doctrins by this means a man who calls himself a philosopher or a divine is often more useful than a great number of tapsters cooks buffoons players fiddlers whores or bauds these are the devils ministers of a lower order they seduce single persons and such as fall into their snares are for the most part men of the simpler sort but the principal supporters of his kingdom are they who by false doctrins poison the springs of religion and virtue and by preaching or writing if their falsehood and wickedness were not detected would extinguish all principles of common honesty and bring whole nations to be best satisfied with themselves when their actions are most abominable and as the means must always be suitable to the end proposed the governments that are to be established or supported by such ways must needs be the worst of all and comprehend all manner of evil  sect xx unjust commands are not to be obeyed and no man is obliged to suffer for not obeying such as are against law in the next place our author gravely proposes a question whether it be a sin to disobey the king if he command any thing contrary to law and as gravely determins that not only in human laws but even in divine a thing may be commanded contrary to law and yet obedience to such a command is necessary the sanctifying of the sabbath is a divine law yet if a master command his servant not to go to church upon a sabbath day the best divines teach us the servant must obey etc it is not sit to ty the master to acquaint the servant with his secret counsel tho he frequently contradicts in one line what he says in another this whole clause is uniform and suitable to the main design of his book he sets up the authority of man in opposition to the command of god gives it the preference and says the best divines instruct us so to do st paul then must have bin one of the worst for he knew that the powers under which he lived had under the severest penaltys forbidden the publication of the gospel and yet he says woe to me if i preach it not st peter was no better than he for he tells us that it is better to obey god than man and they could not speak otherwise unless they had forgotten the words of their master who told them they should not fear them that could only kill the body but him who could kill and cast into hell and if i must not fear him that can only kill the body not only the reason but all excuse for obeying him is taken away  chap    to prove what he says he cites a pertinent example from st luke and very logically concludes that because christ approved the hypocrisy of the pharisees who generally adhered to the external and circumstantial part of the law neglecting the essential and taking upon themselves to be the interpreters of that which they did not understand the law of god is not to be obeyed and as strongly proves that because christ showed them that the same law which by their own confession permitted them to pull an ass out of a pit on the sabbath day could not but give a liberty of healing the sick therefore the commands of kings are to be obeyed tho they should be contrary to human and divine laws but if perverseness had not blinded him he might have seen that this very text is wholly against his purpose for the magistratical power was on the side of the pharisees otherwise they would not have sought an occasion to ensnare him and that power having perverted the law of god by false glosses and a superinduction of human traditions prohibited the most necessary acts of charity to be done on the sabbathday which christ reproved and restored the sick man to his health in their sight  but i could wish our author had told us the names of those divines who he says are the best and who pretend to teach us these fine things i know some who are thought good that are of a contrary opinion and say that god having required that day to be set apart for his service and worship man cannot dispense with the obligation unless he can abrogate the law of god perhaps for want of other arguments to prove the contrary i may be told that this savours too much of puritanism and calvinism but i shall take the reproach till some better patrons than laud and his creatures may be found for the other opinion by the advice and instigation of these men from about the year    0 to    0 sports and revelings which ended for the most part in drunkenness and leudness were not only permitted on that day but enjoined and tho this did advance human authority in derogation to the divine to a degree that may please such as are of our authors mind yet others resolving rather to obey the laws of god than the commands of men could not be brought to pass the lords day in that manner since that time no man except filmer and heylin have bin so wicked to conceive or so impudent to assert such brutal absurditys but leaving the farther consideration of the original of this abuse i desire to know whether the authority given to masters to command things contrary to the law of god be peculiar in relation to the sabbath or to a few other points or ought generally to extend to all gods laws and whether he who may command his servant to act contrary to the law of god have not a right in himself of doing the same if peculiar some authority or precept must be produced by which it may appear that god has slighted his ordinance concerning that day and suffered it to be contemned whilst he exacts obedience to all others if we have a liberty left to us of slighting others also more or less in number we ought to know how many what they are and how it comes to pass that some are of obligation and others not if the empire of the world is not only divided between god and caesar but every man also who can give five pounds a year to a servant has so great a part in it that in some cases his commands are to be obeyed preferably to those of god it were fit to know the limits of each kingdom lest we happen preposterously to obey man when we ought to obey god or god when we are to follow the commands of men if it be general the law of god is of no effect and we may safely put an end to all thoughts and discourses of religion the word of god is nothing to us we are not to inquire what he has commanded but what pleases our master how insolent foolish vile or wicked soever he may be the apostles and prophets who died for preferring the commands of god before those of men fell like fools and perished in their sins but if every particular man that has a servant can exempt him from the commands of god he may also exempt himself and the laws of god are at once abrogated throout the world  it is a folly to say there is a passive as well as an active obedience and that he who will not do what his master commands ought to suffer the punishment he inflicts for if the master has a right of commanding there is a duty incumbent on the servant of obeying he that suffers for not doing that which he ought to do draws upon himself both the guilt and the punishment but no one can be obliged to suffer for that which he ought not to do because he who pretends to command has not so far an authority however our question is whether the servant should forbear to do that which god commands rather than whether the master should put away or beat him if he do not for if the servant ought to obey his master rather than god as our author says the best divines assert he sins in disobeying and that guilt cannot be expiated by his suffering if it be thought i carry this point to an undue extremity the limits ought to be demonstrated by which it may appear that i exceed them tho the nature of the case cannot be altered for if the law of god may not be abrogated by the commands of men a servant cannot be exempted from keeping the sabbath according to the ordinance of god at the will of his master but if a power be given to man at his pleasure to annul the laws of god the apostles ought not to have preached when they were forbidden by the powers to which they were subject the tortures and deaths they suffered for not obeying that command were in their own wrong and their blood was upon their own heads  his second instance concerning wars in which he says the subject is not to examine whether they are just or unjust but must obey is weak and frivolous and very often false whereas consequences can rightly be drawn from such things only as are certainly and universally true tho god may be merciful to a soldier who by the wickedness of a magistrate whom he honestly trusts is made a minister of injustice it is nothing to this case for if our author say true that the word of a king can justify him in going against the command of god he must do what is commanded tho he think it evil the christian soldiers under the pagan emperors were obliged to destroy their brethren and the best men in the world for being so such as now live under the turk have the same obligation upon them of defending their master and slaughtering those he reputes his enemies for adhering to christianity and the king of france may when he pleases arm one part of his protestant subjects to the destruction of the other which is a godly doctrine and worthy our authors invention  but if this be so i know not how the israelites can be said to have sinned in following the examples of jeroboam omri ahab or other wicked kings they could not have sinned in obeying if it had bin a sin to disobey their commands and god would not have punished them so severely if they had not sinned it is impertinent to say they were obliged to serve their kings in unjust wars but not to serve idols for tho god be jealous of his glory yet he forbids rapine and murder as well as idolatry if there be a law that forbids the subject to examine the commands tending to the one it cannot but enjoin obedience to the other the same authority which justifys murder takes away the guilt of idolatry and the wretches both judges and witnesses who put naboth to death could as little alledg ignorance as those that worshipped jeroboams calves the same light of nature by which they should have known that a ridiculous image was not to be adored as god instructing them also that an innocent man ought not under pretense of law to be murdered by perjury  sect xxi it cannot be for the good of the people that the magistrate have a power above the law and he is not a magistrate who has not his power by law that we may not be displeased or think it dangerous and slavish to depend upon the will of a man which perhaps may be irregular or extravagant in one who is subject to no law our author very dexterously removes the scruples by telling us    that the prerogative of the king to be above the law is only for the good of them that are under the law and to preserve their libertys    that there can be no laws without a supreme power to command or make them in aristocracys the noblemen are above the law in democracys the people by the like reason in a monarchy the king must of necessity be above the law there can be no sovereign majesty in him that is under the law that which gives the very being to a king is the power to give laws without this power he is but an equivocal king it skills not how he comes by this power whether by election donation succession or any other means i am contented in some degree to follow our author and to acknowledge that the king neither has nor can have any prerogative which is not for the good of the people and the preservation of their libertys this therefore is the foundation of magistratical power and the only way of discerning whether the prerogative of making laws of being above laws or any other he may pretend be justly due to him or not and if it be doubted who is the fittest judge to determine that question common sense will inform us that if the magistrate receive his power by election or donation they who elect or give him that power best know whether the good they sought be performed or not if by succession they who instituted the succession if otherwise that is by fraud or violence the point is decided for he has no right at all and none can be created by those means this might be said tho all princes were of ripe age sober wise just and good for even the best are subject to mistakes and passions and therefore unfit to be judges of their own concernments in which they may by various means be misguided but it would be extreme madness to attribute the same to children fools or madmen who are not able to judge of the least things concerning themselves or others but most especially to those who coming in by usurpation declare their contempt of all human and divine laws and are enemies to the people they oppress none therefore can be judges of such cases but the people for whom and by whom the constitutions are made or their representatives and delegats to whom they give the power of doing it  but nothing can be more absurd than to say that one man has an absolute power above law to govern according to his will for the peoples good and the preservation of their liberty for no liberty can subsist where there is such a power and we have no other way of distinguishing between free nations and such as are not so than that the free are governed by their own laws and magistrates according to their own mind and that the others either have willingly subjected themselves or are by force brought under the power of one or more men to be ruled according to his or their pleasure the same distinction holds in relation to particular persons he is a free man who lives as best pleases himself under laws made by his own consent and the name of slave can belong to no man unless to him who is either born in the house of a master bought taken subdued or willingly gives his ear to be nailed to the post and subjects himself to the will of another thus were the grecians said to be free in opposition to the medes and persians as artabanus acknowledged in his discourse to themistocles in the same manner the italians germans and spaniards were distinguished from the eastern nations who for the most part were under the power of tyrants rome was said to have recovered liberty by the expulsion of the tarquins or as tacitus expresses it libertatem and consulatum l brutus instituit an l   lucius brutus established liberty and the consulat together as if before that time they had never enjoyed any and julius caesar is said to have overthrown the liberty of that people but if filmer deserve credit the romans were free under tarquin enslaved when he was driven way and his prerogative extinguished that was so necessarily required for the defense of their liberty and were never restored to it till caesar assumed all the power to himself by the same rule the switzers grisons venetians hollanders and some other nations are now slaves and tuscany the kingdom of naples the ecclesiastical state with such as live under a more gentle master on the other side of the water i mean the turk are free nations nay the florentins who complain of slavery under the house of medices were made free by the power of a spanish army who set up a prerogative in that gentle family which for their good has destroyed all that could justly be called so in that country and almost wholly dispeopld it i who esteem my self free because i depend upon the will of no man and hope to die in the liberty i inherit from my ancestors am a slave and the moors or turks who may be beaten and killed whenever it pleases their insolent masters are freemen but surely the world is not so much mistaken in the signification of words and things the weight of chains number of stripes hardness of labor and other effects of a masters cruelty may make one servitude more miserable than another but he is a slave who serves the best and gentlest man in the world as well as he who serves the worst and he dos serve him if he must obey his commands and depends upon his will for this reason the poet ingeniously flattering a good emperor said that liberty was not more desirable than to serve a gentle master but still acknowledged that it was a service distinct from and contrary to liberty and it had not bin a handsome complement unless the evil of servitude were so extreme that nothing but the virtue and goodness of the master could any way compensate or alleviate it now tho it should be granted that he had spoken more like to a philosopher than a poet that we might take his words in the strictest sense and think it possible to find such conveniences in a subjection to the will of a good and wise master as may balance the loss of liberty it would be nothing to the question because that liberty is thereby acknowledged to be destroyed by the prerogative which is only instituted to preserve it if it were true that no liberty were to be preferred before the service of a good master it could be of no use to the perishing world which filmer and his disciples would by such arguments bring into a subjection to children fools mad or vicious men these are not cases feigned upon a distant imaginary possibility but so frequently found amongst men that there are few examples of the contrary and as it is folly to suppose that princes will always be wise just and good when we know that few have bin able alone to bear the weight of a government or to resist the temptations to ill that accompany an unlimited power it would be madness to presume they will for the future be free from infirmitys and vices and if they be not the nations under them will not be in such a condition of servitude to a good master as the poet compares to liberty but in a miserable and shameful subjection to the will of those who know not how to govern themselves or to do good to others tho moses joshua and samuel had bin able to bear the weight of an unrestrained power tho david and solomon had never abused that which they had what effect could this have upon a general proposition where are the familys that always produce such as they were when did god promise to assist all those who should attain to the sovereign power as he did them whom he chose for the works he designed or what testimony can filmer give us that he has bin present with all those who have hitherto reigned in the world but if we know that no such thing either is or has bin and can find no promise to assure us nor reason to hope that it ever will be it is as foolish to found the hopes of preserving a people upon that which never was or is so likely to fail nay rather which in a short time most certainly will fail as to root up vines and figtrees in expectation of gathering grapes and figs from thistles and briars this would be no less than to extinguish the light of common sense to neglect the means that god has given us to provide for our security and to impute to him a disposition of things utterly inconsistent with his wisdom and goodness if he has not therefore ordered that thorns and thistles should produce figs and grapes nor that the most important works in the world which are not without the utmost difficulty if at all to be performed by the best and wisest of men should be put into the hands of the weakest most foolish and worst he cannot have ordained that such men women or children as happen to be born in reigning familys or get the power into their hands by fraud treachery or murder as very many have done should have a right of disposing all things according to their will and if men cannot be guilty of so great an absurdity to trust the weakest and worst with a power which usually subverts the wisdom and virtue of the best or to expect such effects of virtue and wisdom from those who come by chance as can hardly if at all be hoped from the most excellent our authors proposition can neither be grounded upon the ordinance of god nor the institution of men nay if any such thing had bin established by our first parents in their simplicity the utter impossibility of attaining what they expected from it must wholly have abrogated the establishment or rather it had bin void from the beginning because it was not sanctio recta jubens honesta prohibens ontraia cer a just sanction commanding things good and forbidding the contrary but a foolish and perverse sanction setting up the unruly appetites of one person to the subversion of all that is good in the world by making the wisdom of the aged and experienced to depend upon the will of women children and fools by sending the strong and the brave to seek protection from the most weak and cowardly and subjecting the most virtuous and best of men to be destroyed by the most wicked and vicious these being the effects of that unlimited prerogative which our author says was only instituted for the good and defense of the people it must necessarily fall to the ground unless slavery misery infamy destruction and desolation tend to the preservation of liberty and are to be preferred before strength glory plenty security and happiness the state of the roman empire after the usurpation of caesar will set this matter in the clearest light but having done it already in the former parts of this work i content my self to refer to those places and tho the calamitys they suffered were a little allayed and moderated by the virtues of antoninus and m aurelius with one or two more yet we have no example of the continuance of them in a family nor of any nation great or small that has bin under an absolute power which dos not too plainly manifest that no man or succession of men is to be trusted with it  but says our author there can be no law where there is not a supreme power and from thence very strongly concludes it must be in the king for otherwise there can be no sovereign majesty in him and he is but an equivocal king this might have bin of some force if governments were established and laws made only to advance that sovereign majesty but nothing at all to the purpose if as he confesses the power which he has be given for the good of the people and for the defense of every private mans life liberty lands and goods for that which is instituted cannot be abrogated for want of that which was never intended in the institution if the public safety be provided liberty and propriety secured justice administered virtue encouraged vice suppressed and the true interest of the nation advanced the ends of government are accomplished and the highest must be contented with such a proportion of glory and majesty as is consistent with the public since the magistracy is not instituted nor any person placed in it for the increase of his majesty but for the preservation of the whole people and the defense of the liberty life and estate of every private man as our author himself is forced to acknowledge  but what is this sovereign majesty so inseparable from royalty that one cannot subsist without the other caligula placed it in a power of omnia mihi in omnes licere sueton doing what he pleased to all men nimrod nabuchodonosor and others with an impious and barbarous insolence boasted of the greatness of their power they thought it a glorious privilege to kill or spare whom they pleased but such kings as by gods permission might have bin set up over his people were to have nothing of this they were not to multiply gold silver wives or horses they were not to govern by deuteronomy    their own will but according to the law from which they might not recede nor raise their hearts above their brethren here were kings without that unlimited power which makes up the sovereign majesty that filmer affirms to be so essential to kings that without it they are only equivocal which proving nothing but the incurable perverseness of his judgment the malice of his heart or malignity of his fate always to oppose reason and truth we are to esteem those to be kings who are described to be so by the scriptures and to give another name to those who endeavor to advance their own glory contrary to the precept of god and the interest of mankind  but unless the light of reason had bin extinguished in him he might have seen that tho no law could be made without a supreme power that supremacy may be in a body consisting of many men and several orders of men if it be true which perhaps may be doubted that there have bin in the world simple monarchys aristocracys or democracys legally established it is certain that the most part of the governments of the world and i think all that are or have bin good were mixed part of the power has bin conferred upon the king or the magistrate that represented him and part upon the senate and people as has bin proved in relation to the governments of the hebrews spartans romans venetians germans and all those who live under that which is usually called the gothic polity if the single person participating of this divided power dislike either the name he bears or the authority he has he may renounce it but no reason can be from thence drawn to the prejudice of nations who give so much as they think consistent with their own good and reserve the rest to themselves or to such other officers as they please to establish  no man will deny that several nations have had a right of giving power to consuls dictators archons suffetes dukes and other magistrates in such proportions as seemed most conducing to their own good and there must be a right in every nation of allotting to kings so much as they please as well as to the others unless there be a charm in the word king or in the letters that compose it but this cannot be for there is no similitude between king rex and basileus they must therefore have a right of regulating the power of kings as well as that of consuls or dictators and it had not bin more ridiculous in fabius scipio camillus or cincinnatus to assert an absolute power in himself under pretense of advancing his sovereign majesty against the law than for any king to do the like but as all nations give what form they please to their government they are also judges of the name to be imposed upon each man who is to have a part in the power and it is as lawful for us to call him king who has a limited authority amongst us as for the medes or arabs to give the same name to one who is more absolute if this be not admitted we are content to speak improperly but utterly deny that when we give the name we give any thing more than we please and had rather his majesty should change his name than to renounce our own rights and libertys which he is to preserve and which we have received from god and nature  but that the folly and wickedness of our author may not be capable of any farther aggravation he says that it skills not how he come by the power violence therefore or fraud treachery or murder are as good as election donation or legal succession it is in vain to examine the laws of god or man or the rights of nature whether children do inherit the dignitys and magistracys of their fathers as patrimonial lands and goods whether regard ought to be had to the fitness of the person whether all should go to one or be divided amongst them or by what rule we may know who is the right heir to the succession and consequently what we are in conscience obliged to do our author tells us in short it matters not how he that has the power comes by it  it has bin hitherto thought that to kill a king especially a good king was a most abominable action they who did it were thought to be incited by the worst of passions that can enter into the hearts of men and the severest punishments have bin invented to deter them from such attempts or to avenge their death upon those who should accomplish it but if our author may be credited it must be the most commendable and glorious act that can be performed by man for besides the outward advantages that men so earnestly desire he that dos it is presently invested with the sovereign majesty and at the same time becomes gods vicegerent and the father of his country possessed of that government which in exclusion to all other forms is only favored by the laws of god and nature the only inconvenience is that all depends upon success and he that is to be the minister of god and father of his country if he succeed is the worst of all villains if he fail and at the best may be deprived of all by the same means he employed to gain it tho a prince should have the wisdom and virtues of moses the valor of joshua david and the maccabees with the gentleness and integrity of samuel the most foolish vicious base and detestable man in the world that kills him and seizes the power becomes his heir and father of the people that he governed it skills not how he did it whether in open battle or secret treachery in the field or in the bed by poison or by the sword the vilest slave in israel had become the lords anointed if he could have killed david or solomon and found villains to place him in the throne if this be right the world has to this day lived in darkness and the actions which have bin thought to be the most detestable are the most commendable and glorious but not troubling my self at present to decide this question i leave it to kings to consider how much they are beholden to filmer and his disciples who set such a price upon their heads as would render it hard to preserve their lives one day if the doctrins were received which they endeavor to infuse into the minds of the people and concluding this point only say that we in england know no other king than he who is so by law nor any power in that king except that which he has by law and tho the roman empire was held by the power of the sword and vlpian a corrupt lawyer undertakes to fay that the prince is not obliged by the laws yet theodosius consest that it was the glory of a good emperor to acknowledge himself bound by them  sect xxii the rigor of the law is to be tempered by men of known integrity and judgment and not by the prince who may be ignorant or vicious our authors next shift is to place the king above the law that he may mitigate the rigor of it without which he says the case of the subject would be desperately miserable but this cure would prove worse than the disease such pious fathers of the people as caligula nero or domitian were not like to mitigate the rigor nor such as inherit crowns in their infancy as the present kings of spain france and sweden so well to understand the meaning of it as to decide extraordinary cases the wisdom of nations has provided more assured helps and none could have bin so brutish and negligent of the public concernments to suffer the succession to fall to women children etc if they had not reserved a power in themselves to prefer others before the nearest in blood if reason require and prescribed such rules as might preserve the public from ruin notwithstanding their infirmitys and vices these helps provided by our laws are principally by grand and petit jurys who are not only judges of matters of fact as whether a man be killed but whether he be killed criminally these men are upon their oaths and may be indicted of perjury if they prevaricate the judges are present not only to be a check upon them but to explain such points of the law as may seem difficult and tho these judges may be said in some sense to be chosen by the king he is not understood to do it otherwise than by the advice of his council who cannot perform their duty unless they propose such as in their consciences they think most worthy of the office and most capable of performing the duty rightly nor he accomplish the oath of his coronation unless he admit those who upon deliberation seem to be the best the judges being thus chosen are so far from depending upon the will of the king that they swear faithfully to serve the people as well as the king and to do justice to    edw  cap   every man according to the law of the land notwithstanding any writs letters or commands received from him and in default thereof they are to forfeit their bodies lands and goods as in cases of treason these laws have bin so often and so severely executed that it concerns all judges well to consider them and the cases of tresilian empson dudley and others show that neither the kings preceding command nor subsequent pardon could preserve them from the punishment they deserved all men knew that what they did was agreeable to the kings pleasure for tresilian advanced the prerogative of edward the   d and empson brought great treasures into the coffers of henry the   th nevertheless they were charged with treason for subverting the laws of the land and executed as traitors tho england ought never to forget the happy reign of q elizabeth yet it must be acknowledged that she as well as others had her failings she was full of love to the people just in her nature sincere in her intentions but could not so perfectly discover the snares that were laid for her or resist the importunity of the persons she most trusted as not sometimes to be brought to attempt things against law she and her counselors pressed the judges very hard to obey the patent under her great seal in the case of cavendish andersons rep p     but they answered that both she and they had taken an oath to keep the law and if they should obey her commands the law would not warrant them etc and besides the offense against god their country and the commonwealth they alleged the example of empson and dudley whereby they said they were detered from obeying her illegal commands they who had sworn to keep the law notwithstanding the kings writs knew that the law depended not upon his will and the same oath that obliged them not to regard any command they should receive from him showed that they were not to expect indemnity by it and not only that the king had neither the power of making altering mitigating or interpreting the law but that he was not at all to be heard in general or particular matters otherwise than as he speaks in the common course of justice by the courts legally established which say the same thing whether he be young or old ignorant or wise wicked or good and nothing dos better evidence the wisdom and care of our ancestors in framing the laws and government we live under than that the people did not suffer extremitys by the vices or infirmitys of kings till an age more full of malice than those in which they lived had found tricks to pervert the rule and frustrate their honest intentions it was not safe for the kings to violate their oaths by an undue interposition of their authority but the ministers who served them in those violations have seldom escaped punishment this is to be understood when the deviations from justice are extreme and mischievous for something must always be allowed to human frailty the best have their defects and none could stand if a too exact scrutiny were made of all their actions edward the third about the twentieth year of his reign acknowledged his own in parliament and as well for the ease of his conscience as the satisfaction of his people promoted an act commanding all judges to do justice notwithstanding any writs letters or commands from himself and forbidding those that belonged to the king queen and prince to intermeddle in those matters but if the best and wisest of our princes in the strength and maturity of their years had their failings and every act proceeding from them that tended to the interruption of justice was a failing how can it be said that the king in his personal capacity directly or indirectly may enter into the discussion of these matters much less to determine them according to his will  but says our author the law is no better than a tyrant general pardons at the coronation and in parliament are but the bounty of the prerogative etc there may be hard cases and citing some perverted pieces from aristotles ethics and politics adds that when something falls out besides the general rule then it is fit that what the lawmaker has omitted or where he has erred by speaking generally it should be corrected and supplied as if the lawmaker were present that ordained it the governor whether he be one man or more ought to be lord of these things whereof it was impossible that the law should speak exactly these things are in part true but our author makes use of them as the devil dos of scripture to subvert the truth there may be something of rigor in the law that in some cases may be mitigated and the law it self in relation to england dos so far acknowledge it as to refer much to the consciences of jurys and those who are appointed to assist them and the most difficult cases are referred to the parliament as the only judges that are able to determine them thus the statute of    edw iii enumerating the crimes then declared to be treason leaves to future parliaments to judge what other facts equivalent to them may deserve the same punishment and it is a general rule in the law which the judges are sworn to observe that difficult cases should be reserved till the parliament meet who are only able to decide them and if there be any inconvenience in this it is because they do not meet so frequently as the law requires or by sinister means are interrupted in their sitting but nothing can be more absurd than to say that because the king dos not call parliaments as the law and his oath requires that power should accrue to him which the law and the consent of the nation has placed in them  there is also such a thing in the law as a general or particular pardon and the king may in some degree be entrusted with the power of giving it especially for such crimes as merely relate to himself as every man may remit the injurys done to himself but the confession of edward the third that the oath of the crown had not bin kept by reason of    edw      the grant of pardons contrary to statutes and a new act made that all such charters of pardon from henceforth granted against the oath of the crown and the said statutes should be held for none demonstrates that this power was not in himself but granted by the nation and to be executed according to such rules as the law prescribed and the parliament approved  moreover there have bin many and sometimes bloody contests for the crown upon which the nation was almost equally divided and it being difficult for them to know or even for us who have all the partys before us to judge which was the better side it was understood that he who came to be crowned by the consent of the people was acceptable to all and the question being determined it was no way fit that he should have a liberty to make use of the public authority then in his hands to revenge such personal injurys as he had or might suppose to have received which might raise new and perhaps more dangerous troubles if the authors of them were still kept in fear of being prosecuted and nothing could be more unreasonable than that he should employ his power to the destruction of those who had consented to make him king this made it a matter of course for a king as soon as he was crowned to issue out a general pardon which was no more than to declare that being now what he was not before he had no enemy upon any former account for this reason lewis the twelfth of france when he was incited to revenge himself against those who in the reign of his predecessor charles the eighth had caused him to be imprisoned with great danger of his life made this answer that the king of france did not care to revenge the injurys done to the duke of orleans and the last king of sweden seemed no otherwise to remember who had opposed the queens abdication and his election than by conferring honors upon them because he knew they were the best men of the nation and such as would be his friends when they should see how he would govern in which he was not deceived but lest all those who might come to the crown of england should not have the same prudence and generosity the kings were obliged by a custom of no less force than a law immediately to put an end to all disputes and the inconveniences that might arise from them this did not proceed from the bounty of the prerogative which i think is nonsense for tho he that enjoys the prerogative may have bounty the prerogative can have none but from common sense from the kings obligation and the care of his own safety and could have no other effect in law than what related to his person as appears by the forementioned statute  pardons granted by act of parliament are of another nature for as the king who has no other power than by law can no otherwise dispense with the crimes committed against the laws than the law dos enable him the parliament that has the power of making laws may entirely abolish the crimes and unquestionably remit the punishment as they please  tho some words of aristotles ethics are without any coherence shuffled together by our author with others taken out of his politics i do not much except against them no law made by man can be perfect and there must be in every nation a power of correcting such defects as in time may arise or be discovered this power can never be so rightly placed as in the same hand that has the right of making laws whether in one person or in many if filmer therefore can tell us of a place where one man woman or child however he or she be qualified has the power of making laws i will acknowledge that not only the hard cases but as many others as he pleases are referred to his or her judgment and that they may give it whether they have any understanding of what they do or not whether they be drunk or sober in their senses or stark mad but as i know no such place and should not be much concerned for the sufferings of a people that might bring such misery upon themselves as must accompany an absolute dependence upon the unruly will of such a creature i may leave him to seek it and rest in a perfect assurance that he dos not speak of england which acknowledges no other law than its own and instead of receiving any from kings dos to this day obey none but such as have bin made by our ancestors or our selves and never admitted any king that did not swear to observe them and if aristotle deserve credit the power of altering mitigating explaining or correcting the laws of england is only in the parliament because none but the parliament can make them  sect xxiii aristotle proves that no man is to be entrusted with an absolute power by showing that no one knows how to execute it but such a man as is not to be found our author having falsely cited and perverted the sense of aristotle now brings him in saying that a perfect kingdom is that wherein the king rules all according to his own will but tho i have read his books of government with some attention i can find no such thing in them unless the word which signifies mere or absolute may be justly translated into perfect which is so far from aristotles meaning that he distinguishes the absolute or despotical kingdoms from the legitimate and commending the latter gives no better name than that of barbarous to the first which he says can agree only with the nature of such nations as are base and stupid little differing from beasts and having no skill to govern or courage to defend themselves must resign all to the will of one that will take care of them yet even this cannot be done unless he that should take that care be wholly exempted from the vices which oblige the others to stand in need of it for otherwise it is no better than if a sheep should undertake to govern sheep or a hog to command swine aristotle plainly saying that as men are by nature equal if it were polit l   c   possible all should be magistrates but that being repugnant to the nature of government he finds no other way of solving the difficulty than by obeying and commanding alternately that they may do by turns that which they cannot do all together and to which no one man has more right than another because they are all by nature equal this might be composed by a more compendious way if according to our authors doctrine possession could give a right but aristotle speaking like a philosopher and not like a public enemy to mankind examins what is just reasonable and beneficial to men that is what ought to be done and which being done is to be accounted just and therefore to be supported by good men but as quod ab initio injustum est nullum potest habere juris effectum grot de jur bell and pac l   that which is unjust in the beginning can never have the effect of justice and it being manifestly unjust for one or a few men to assume a power over those who by nature are equal to them no such power can be just or beneficial to mankind nor fit to be upheld by good men if it be unjust and prejudicial in the opinion of aristotle this natural equality continues till virtue makes the distinction which must be either simply complete and perfect in it self so that he who is endud with it is a god among men or relatively as far as concerns civil society and the ends for which it is constituted that is defense and the obtaining of justice this requires a mind unbiased by passion full of goodness and wisdom firm against all the temptations to ill that may arise from desire or fear tending to all manner of good through a perfect knowledge and affection to it and this to such a degree that he or they have more of these virtues and excellencys than all the rest of the society tho computed together where such a man is found he is by nature a ibid l   king and it is best for the nation where he is that he govern if a few men tho equal and alike among themselves have the same advantages above the rest of the people nature for the same reason seems to establish an aristocracy in that place and the power is more safely committed to them than left in the hands of the multitude but if this excellency of virtue dos not appear in one nor in a few men the right and power is by nature equally lodged in all and to assume or appropriate that power to one or a few men is unnatural and tyrannical which in aristotles language comprehends all that is detestable and abominable  if any man should think aristotle a trifler for speaking of such a man as can never be found i answer that he went as ar as his way could be warranted by reason or nature and was obliged to stop there by the defect of his subject he could not say that the government os one was simply good when he knew so many qualifications were required in the person to make it so nor that it is good for a nation to be under the power of a sool a coward or a villain because it is good to be under a man of admirable wisdom valor industry and goodness or that the government of one should be continued in such as by chance succeed in a family because it was given to the first who had all the virtues required tho all the reasons for which the power was given fail in the successor much less could he say that any government was good which was not good for those whose good only it was constituted to promote  moreover by showing who only is fit to be a monarch or may be made such without violating the laws of nature and justice he shows who cannot be one and he who says that no such man is to be found as according to the opinion of aristotle can be a monarch dos most ridiculously alledg his authority in favor of monarchs or the power which some amongst us would attribute to them if any thing therefore may be concluded from his words it is this that since no power ought to be admitted which is not just that none can be just which is not good profitable to the people and conducing to the ends for which it is constituted that no man can know how to direct the power to those ends can deserve or administer it unless he dos so far excel all those that are under him in wisdom justice valor and goodness as to possess more of those virtues than all of them i say if no such man or succession of men be found no such power is to be granted to any man or succession of men but if such power be granted the laws of nature and reason are overthrown and the ends for which societys are constituted utterly perverted which necessarily implys an annihilation of the grant and if a grant so made by those who have a right of setting up a government amongst themselves do perish through its own natural iniquity and perversity i leave it to any man whose understanding and manners are not so entirely corrupted as those of our author to determine what name ought to be given to that person who not excelling all others in civil and moral virtues in the proportion required by aristotle dos usurp a power over a nation and what obedience the people owe to such a one but if his opinion deserve our regard the king by having those virtues is omnium optimus and the best guide to the people ad summum bonum secundum virtutem arist pol to lead them to happiness by the ways of virtue and he who assumes the same power without the qualifications required is tyrannus omnium pessimus leading the people to all manner of ill and in consequence to destruction  sect xxiv the power of augustus caesar was not given but usurped our authors next instance is ingeniously taken from the romans who he says tho they were a people greedy of liberty freed augustus from the necessity of laws if it be true as he affirms that such a prerogative is instituted only for the preservation of liberty they who are most greedy of it ought to be most forward in establishing that which defends it best but if the weight laid upon the words greedy of liberty etc render his memory and judgment liable to censure the unpardonable prevarication of citing any act done by the romans in the time of augustus as done freely shows him to be a man of no faith omnium jura in se traxerat says tacitus of augustus nothing was conferred upon him he took all to himself there could be nothing of right in that which was wholly usurped and neither the people or the senate could do any thing freely whilst they were under the power of a mad corrupted soldiery who first betrayed and then subdued them the greatest part of the senate had fallen at the battle of pharsalia others had bin gleaned up in several places the rest destroyed by the proscriptions and that which then retained the name of a senate was made up chiefly of those who had bin his ministers in bringing the most miserable slavery upon their own country the roman liberty and that bravery of spirit by which it had bin maintained was not only abolished but almost forgotten all consideration of law and right was trampled under foot and none could dispute with him who by the power of the sword had seized the authority both of the senate and people nothing was so extravagant that might not be extorted by the insolent violence of a conqueror who had thirty mercenary legions to execute his commands the uncorrupted part of the people that had escaped the sword of julius had either perished with hirtius and pansa brutus and cassius or bin destroyed by the detestable triumvirate those that remained could lose nothing by a verbal resignation of their liberty which they had neither strength nor courage to defend the magistracys were possessed by the creatures of the tyrant and the people were composed of such as were either born under slavery and accustomed to obey or remained under the terror of those arms that had consumed the assertors of their liberty our author standing in need of some roman example was obliged to seek it in an age when the laws were subverted virtue extinguished injustice placed in the throne and such as would not be of the same spirit exposed to the utmost cruelty this was the time when the sovereign majesty shined in glory and they who had raised it above the law made it also the object of their religion by adoring the statues of their oppressor the corruption of this court spread it self over the best part of the world and reduced the empire to that irrecoverable weakness in which it languishd and perished this is the state of things that pleases filmer and those that are like him who for the introduction of the same among us recommend such an elevation of the sovereign majesty as is most contrary to the laws of god and men abhorred by all generous nations and most especially by our ancestors who thought nothing too dear to be hazarded in the defense of themselves and us from it  sect xxv the regal power was not the first in this nation nor necessarily to be continued tho it had bin the first truth being uniform in it self those who desire to propagate it for the good of mankind lay the foundations of their reasonings in such principles as are either evident to common sense or easily proved but cheats and impostors delighting in obscurity suppose things that are dubious and false and think to build one falsehood upon another and our author can find no better way to persuade us that all our privileges and laws are from the king than by saying that the first power was the kingly power which was both in this and all other nations in the world long before any laws or any other kind of government was thought of from whence we must necessarily infer that the common law or common customs of this land were originally the laws and commands of the king but denying both these points i affirm    that there was a power to make kings before there was any king    tho kings had bin the first created magistrates in all places as perhaps they were in some it dos not follow that they must continue for ever or that laws are from them  to the first i think no man will deny that there was a people at babylon before nimrod was king of that place this people had a power for no number of men can be without it nay this people had a power of making nimrod king or he could never have bin king he could not be king by succession for the scripture shows him to have bin the first he was not king by the right of father for he was not their father chush cham with his elder brothers and father noah being still living and which is worst of all were not kings for if they who lived in nimrods time or before him neither were kings nor had kings he that ought to have bin king over all by the right of nature if there had bin any such thing in nature was not king those who immediately succeeded him and must have inherited his right if he had any did not inherit or pretend to it and therefore he that shall now claim a right from nature as father of a people must ground it upon something more certain than noahs right of reigning over his children or it can have no strength in it  moreover the nations who in and before the time of nimrod had no kings had power or else they could have performed no act nor constituted any other magistrate to this day which is absurd there was therefore a power in nations before there were kings or there could never have bin any and nimrod could never have bin king if the people of babylon had not made him king which they could not have done if they had not had a power of making him so it is ridiculous to say he made himself king for tho he might be strong and valiant he could not be stronger than a multitude of men that which forces must be stronger than that which is forced and if it be true according to the ancient saying that hercules himself is not sufficient to encounter two it is sure more impossible for one man to force a multitude for that must be stronger than he if he came in by persuasion they who were persuaded were persuaded to consent that he should be king that consent therefore made him king but qui dat esse dat modum esse they who made him king made him such a king as best pleased themselves he had therefore nothing but what was given his greatness and power must be from the multitude who gave it and their laws and libertys could not be from him but their libertys were naturally inherent in themselves and their laws were the product of them  there was a people that made romulus king he did not make or beget that people nor for any thing we know one man of them he could not come in by inheritance for he was a bastard the son of an unknown man and when he died the right that had bin conferred upon him reverted to the people who according to that right chose numa hostilius martius tarquinius priscas and servius all stranges to his blood and without any other right than what was bestowed upon them and tarquinius superbus who invaded the throne sinc jussu populi t live l   without the command of the people was ejected and the government of kings abolished by the same power that had created it  we know not certainly by what law moses and the judges created by the advice of jethro governed the israelites but may probably conjecture it to have bin by that law which god had written in the hearts of mankind and the people submitted to the judgment of good and wise men tho they were under no coercive power but it is certain they had a law and a regular magistracy under which they lived four hundred years before they had a king for saul was the first this law was not therefore from the king nor by the king but the king was chosen and made by the people according to the liberty they had by the law tho they did not rightly follow the rules therein prescribed and by that means brought destruction upon themselves  the country in which we live lay long concealed under obscure barbarity and we know nothing of the first inhabitants but what is involved in fables that leave us still in the dark julius caesar is the first who speaks distinctly of our affairs and gives us no reason to believe there was any monarchy then established amongst us cassivellaunus was occasionally chosen by the nations that were most exposed to the violence caes comment l   of the romans for the management of those wars against them by others we hear of boadicia arviragus galgacus and many more set up afterward when need required but we find no footsteps of a regular succession either by inheritance or election and as they had then no kings or any other general magistrate that can be said to be equivalent to a king they might have had none at all unless they had thought fit tacitus mentions a sort of kings used by the romans to keep inter instrumenta servitutis reges habure c tacit nations in servitude to them and tho it were true that there had bin such a man as lucius and he one of this sort he is to be accounted only as a roman magistrate and signifys no more to our dispute than if he had bin called proconsul praetor or by any other name however there was no series of them that which was temporary and occasional depended upon the will of those who thinking there was occasion created such a magistrate and omitted to do so when the occasion ceased or was thought to cease and might have had none at all if they had so pleased the magistracy therefore was from them and depenedd upon their will  we have already mentioned the historys of the saxons danes and normans from which nations together with the britans we are descended and finding that they were severe assertors of their libertys acknowledged no human laws but their own received no kings but such as swore to observe them and deposed those who did not well perform their oaths and duty it is evident that their kings were made by the people according to the law and that the law by which they became what they were could not be from themselves our ancestors were so fully convinced that in the creation of kings they exercised their own right and were only to consider what was good for themselves that without regard to the memory of those who had gone before they were accustomed to take such as seemed most like wisely justly and gently to perform their office refused those that were suspected of pride cruelty or any other vice that might bring prejudice upon the public what title soever they pretended and removed such as had bin placed in the throne if they did not answer the opinion conceived of their virtue which i take to be a manner of proceeding that agrees better with the quality of masters making laws and magistrates for themselves than of slaves receiving such as were imposed upon them    to the second tho it should be granted that all nations had at the first bin governed by kings it were nothing to the question for no man or number of men was ever obliged to continue in the errors of his predecessors the authority of custom as well as of law i mean in relation to the power that made it to be consists only in its rectitude and the same reason which may have induced one or more nations to create kings when they knew no other form of government may not only induce them to set up another if that be found inconvenient to them but proves that they may as justly do so as remove a man who performs not what was expected from him if there had bin a rule given by god and written in the minds of men by nature it must have bin from the beginning universal and perpetual or at least must have bin observed by the wisest and best instructed nations which not being in any measure as i have proved already there can be no reason why a polite people should not relinquish the errors committed by their ancestors in the time of their barbarism and ignorance and why they should not do it in matters of government as well as in any other thing relating to life men are subject to errors and it is the work of the best and wisest to discover and amend such as their ancestors may have committed or to add perfection to those things which by them have bin well invented this is so certain that whatsoever we enjoy beyond the misery in which our barbarous ancestors lived is due only to the liberty of correcting what was amiss in their practice or inventing that which they did not know and i doubt whether it be more brutish to say we are obliged to continue in the idolatry of the druids with all the miserys and follys that accompany the most savage barbarity or to confess that tho we have a right to depart from these yet we are for ever bound to continue the government they had established whatever inconveniences might attend it tertullian disputing with the pagans who objected the novelty of the christian religion troubled not himself with refuting that error nullum tempu ulla praescriptio occurrit vericuti tertul id antiquius quod verius ibid but proving christianity to be good and true he thought he had sufficiently proved it to be ancient a wise architect may show his skill and deserve commendation for building a poor house of vile materials when he can procure no better but he no way ought to hinder others from erecting more glorious fabrics if they are furnished with the means required besides such is the imperfection of all human constitutions that they are subject to perpetual fluctuation which never permits them to continue long in the same condition corruptions slide in insensibly and the best orders are sometimes subverted by malice and violence so that he who only regards what was done in such an age often takes the corruption of the state for the institution follows the worst example thinks that to be the first that is the most ancient he knows and if a brave people seeing the original defects of their government or the corruption into which it may be fallen do either correct and reform what may be amended or abolish that which was evil in the institution or so perverted that it cannot be restored to integrity these men impute it to sedition and blame those actions which of all that can be performed by men are the most glorious we are not therefore so much to inquire after that which is most ancient as that which is best and most conducing to the good ends to which it was directed as governments were instituted for the obtaining of justice and as our author says the preservation of liberty we are not to seek what government was the first but what best provides for the obtaining of justice and the preservation of liberty for whatsoever the institution be and how long soever it may have lasted it is void if it thwarts or dos not provide for the end of its establishment if such a law or custom therefore as is not good in it self had in the beginning prevailed in all parts of the world which in relation to absolute or any kind of monarchy is not true it ought to be abolished and if any man should show himself wiser than others by proposing a law or government more beneficial to mankind than any that had bin formerly known providing better for justice and liberty than all others had done he would merit the highest veneration if any man ask who shall be judge of that rectitude or pravity which either authorizes or destroys a law i answer that as this consists not in formalitys and nicetys but in evident and substantial truths there is no need of any other tribunal than that of common sense and the light of nature o determine the matter and he that travels through france italy turkey germany and switzerland without consulting bartolus or baldus will easily understand whether the countries that are under the kings of france and spain the pope and the great turk or such as are under the care of a wellregulated magistracy do best enjoy the benefits of justice and liberty it is as easily determined whether the grecians when athens and thebes flourished were more free than the medes whether justice was better administered by agathocles dionysius and phalaris than by the legal kings and regular magistrates of sparta or whether more care was taken that justice and liberty might be preserved by tiberius caligula claudius nero and vitellius than by the senate and people of rome whilst the laws were more powerful than the commands of men the like may be said of particular laws as those of nabuchodonosor and caligula for worshipping their statues our acts of parliament against heretics and lollards with the statutes and orders of the inquisition which is called the holy office and if that only be a law which is sanctio recta jubens honesta prohibens contraria the meanest understanding if free from passion may certainly know that such as these cannot be laws by what authority soever they were enacted and that the use of them and others like to them ought to be abolished for their turpitude and iniquity infinite examples of the like nature might be alleged as well concerning divine as human things and if there be any laws which are evil there cannot be an incontestable rectitude in all and if not in all it concerns us to examine where it is to be found laws and constitutions ought to be weighed and whilst all due reverence is paid to such as are good every nation may not only retain in it self a power of changing or abolishing all such as are not so but ought to exercise that power according to the best of their understanding and in the place of what was either at first mistaken or afterward corrupted to constitute that which is most conducing to the establishment of justice and liberty  but such is the condition of mankind that nothing can be so perfectly framed as not to give some testimony of human imbecility and frequently to stand in need of reparations and amendments many things are unknown to the wisest and the best men can never wholly divest themselves of passions and affections by this means the best and wisest are sometimes led into error and stand in need of successors like to themselves who may find remedys for the faults they have committed and nothing can or ought to be permanent but that which is perfect no natural body was ever so well tempered and organized as not to be subject to diseases wounds or other accidents and to need medicines and other occasional helps as well as nourishment and exercise and he who under the name of innovation would deprive nations of the like dos as much as lies in him condemn them all to perish by the defects of their own foundations discors di macchiav l   some men observing this have proposed a necessity of reducing every state once in an age or two to the integrity of its first principle but they ought to have examined whether that principle be good or evil or so good that nothing can be added to it which none ever was and this being so those who would admit of no change would render errors perpetual and depriving mankind of the benefits of wisdom industry experience and the right use of reason oblige all to continue in the miserable barbarity of their ancestors which suits better with the nature of a wolf than that of a man  those who are of better understanding weigh all things and often find reason to abrogate that which their fathers according to the measure of the knowledge they had or the state of things among them had rightly instituted or to restore that which they had abrogated and there can be no greater mark of a most brutish stupidity than for men to continue in an evil way because their fathers had brought them into it but if we ought not too strictly to adhere to our own constitutions those of other nations are less to be regarded by us for the laws that may be good for one people are not for all and that which agrees with the manners of one age is utterly abhorrent from those of another it were absurd to think of restoring the laws of lycurgus to the present inhabitants of peloponnesus who are accustomed to the most abject slavery it may easily be imagined how the romans sabins and latins now under the tyranny of the pope would relish such a discipline as flourished among them after the expulsion of the tarquins and it had bin no less preposterous to give a liberty to the parthians of governing themselves or for them to assume it than to impose an absolute monarch upon the german nation hist l   titus livius having observed this says that if a popular government had bin set up in rome immediately upon the building of the city and if that fierce people which was composed of unruly shepherds herdsmen fugitive slaves and out lawd persons who could not suffer the government under which they wereborn had come to be incited by turbulent orators they would have brought all into confusion whereas that boisterous humor being gradually tempered by discipline under romulus or taught to vent its fury against foreign enemies and softened by the peaceable reign of numa a new race grew up which being all of one blood contracted a love to their country and became capable of liberty which the madness of their last king and the leudness of his son gave them occasion to resume if this was commendable in them it must be so in other nations if the germans might preserve their liberty as well as the parthians submit themselves to absolute monarchy it is as lawful for the descendents of those germans to continue in it as for the eastern nations to be slaves if one nation may justly choose the government that seems best to them and continue or alter it according to the changes of times and things the same right must belong to others the great variety of laws that are or have bin in the world proceeds from this and nothing can better show the wisdom and virtue or the vices and folly of nations than the use they make of this right they have bin glorious or infamous powerful or despicable happy or miserable as they have well or ill executed it  if it be said that the law given by god to the hebrews proceeding from his wisdom and goodness must needs be perfect and obligatory to all nations i answer that there is a simple and a relative perfection the first is only in god the other in the things he has created he saw that they were good which can signify no more than that genesis   they were good in their kind and suited to the end for which he designed them for if the perfection were absolute there could be no difference between an angel and a worm and nothing could be subject to change or death for that is imperfection this relative perfection is seen also by his law given to mankind in the persons of adam and noah it was good in the kind fit for those times but could never have bin enlarged or altered if the perfection had bin simple and no better evidence can be given to show that it was not so than that god did afterward give one much more full and explicit to his people this law also was peculiarly applicable to that people and season for if it had bin otherwise the apostles would have obliged christians to the entire observation of it as well as to abstain from idolatry fornication and blood but if all this be not so then their judicial law and the form of their commonwealth must be received by all no human law can be of any value we are all brethren no man has a prerogative above another lands must be equally divided amongst all inheritances cannot be alienated for above fifty years no man can be raised above the rest unless he be called by god and enabled by his spirit to conduct the people when this man dies he that has the same spirit must succeed as joshua did to moses and his children can have no title to his office when such a man appears a sanhedrim of seventy men chosen out of the whole people are to judge such causes as relate to themselves whilst those of greater extent and importance are referred to the general assemblys here is no mention of a king and consequently if we must take this law for our pattern we cannot have one if the point be driven to the utmost and the precept of deuteronomy where god permitted them to have a king if they thought fit when they came into the promised land be understood to extend to all nations every one of them must have the same liberty of taking their own time choosing him in their own way dividing the kingdom having no king and setting up other governors when they please as before the election of saul and after the return from the captivity and even when they have a king he must be such a one as is described in the same chapter who no more resembles the sovereign majesty that our author adores and agrees as little with his maxims as a tribun of the roman people  we may therefore conclude that if we are to follow the law of moses we must take it with all the appendages a king can be no more and no otherwise than he makes him for whatever we read of the kings they had were extreme deviations from it no nation can make any law and our lawyers burning their books may betake themselves to the study of the pentateuch in which tho some of them may be well versed yet probably the profit arising from thence will not be very great  but if we are not obliged to live in a conformity to the law of moses every people may frame laws for themselves and we cannot be denied the right that is common to all our laws were not sent from heaven but made by our ancestors according to the light they had and their present occasions we inherit the same right from them and as we may without vanity say that we know a little more than they did if we find our selves prejudiced by any law that they made we may repeal it the safety of the people was their supreme law and is so to us neither can we be thought less fit to judge what conduces to that end than they were if they in any age had bin persuaded to put themselves under the power or in our authors phrase under the sovereign majesty of a child a fool a mad or desperately wicked person and had annexed the right conferred upon him to such as should succeed it had not bin a just and right sanction and having none of the qualitys essentially belonging to a law could not have the effect of a law it cannot be for the good of a people to be governed by one who by nature ought to be governed or by age or accident is rendered unable to govern himself the public interests and the concernments of private men in their lands goods libertys and lives for the preservation of which our author says the regal prerogative is only constituted cannot be preserved by one who is transported by his own passions or follys a slave to his lusts and vices or which is sometimes worse governed by the vilest of men and women who flatter him in them and push him on to do such things as even they would abhor if they were in his place the turpitude and impious madness of such an act must necessarily make it void by overthrowing the ends for which it was made since that justice which was sought cannot be obtained nor the evils that were feared prevented and they for whose good it was intended must necessarily have a right of abolishing it this might be sufficient for us tho our ancestors had enslaved themselves but god be thanked we are not put to that trouble we have no reason to believe we are descended from such fools and beasts as would willingly cast themselves and us into such an excess of misery and shame or that they were so tame and cowardly to be subjected by force or fear we know the value they set upon their libertys and the courage with which they defended them and we can have no better example to encourage us never to suffer them to be violated or diminished  sect xxvi tho the king may be entrusted with the power of choosing judges yet that by which they act is from the law i confess that no law can be so perfect to provide exactly for every case that may fall out so as to leave nothing to the discretion of the judges who in some measure are to interpret them but that laws or customs are ever few or that the paucity is the reason that they cannot give special rules or that judges do resort to those principles or common law axioms whereupon former judgments in cases something alike have bin given by former judges who all receive their authority from the king in his right to give sentence i utterly deny and affirm    that in many places and particularly in england the laws are so many that the number of them has introduced an uncertainty and confusion which is both dangerous and troublesome and the infinite variety of adjudgd cases thwarting and contradicting each other has rendered these difficultys inextricable tacitus imputes a great part of the miserys suffered by the romans in his time to this abuse and tells us that et in corruptissima republica plurimae leges the laws grew to be innumerable in the worst and most corrupt state of things and that justice was overthrown by them by the same means in france italy and other places where the civil law is rendered municipal judgments are in a manner arbitrary and tho the intention of our laws be just and good they are so numerous and the volumes of our statutes with the interpretations and adjudgd cases so vast that hardly any thing is so clear and fixed but men of wit and learning may find what will serve for a pretense to justify almost any judgment they have a mind to give whereas the laws of moses as to the judicial part being short and few judgments were easy and certain and in switzerland sweden and some parts of denmark the whole volume that contains them may be read in few hours and by that means no injustice can be done which is not immediately made evident    axioms are not rightly grounded upon judged cases but cases are to be judged according to axioms the certain is not proved by the uncertain but the uncertain by the certain and every thing is to be esteemed uncertain till it be proved to be certain axioms in law are as in mathematics evident to common sense and nothing is to be taken for an axiom that is not so euclid dos not prove his axioms by his propositions but his propositions which are abstruse by such axioms as are evident to all the axioms of our law do not receive their authority from coke and hales but coke and hales deserve praise for giving judgment according to such as are undeniably true    the judges reeeive their commissions from the king and perhaps it may be said that the custom of naming them is grounded upon a right with which he is entrusted but their power is from the law as that of the king also is for he who has none originally in himself can give none unless it be first conferred upon him i know not how he can well perform his oath to govern according to law unless he execute the power with which he is entrusted in naming those men to be judges whom in his conscience and by the advice of his council he thinks the best and ablest to perform that office but both he and they are to learn their duty from that law by which they are and which allots to every one his proper work as the law intends that men should be made judges for their integrity and knowledge in the law and that it ought not to be imagined that the king will break his trust by choosing such as are not so till the violation be evident nothing is more reasonable than to intend that the judges so qualified should instruct the king in matters of law but that he who may be a child overagd or otherwise ignorant and incapable should instruct the judges is equally absurd as for a blind man to be a guide to those who have the best eyes and so abhorrent from the meaning of the law that the judges as i said before are sworn to do justice according to the laws without any regard to the kings words letters or commands if they are therefore to act according to a set rule from which they may not depart what command soever they receive they do not act by a power from him but by one that is above both this is commonly confessed and tho some judges have bin found in several ages who in hopes of reward and preferment have made little account of their oath yet the success that many of them have had may reasonably deter others from following their example and if there are not more instances in this kind no better reason can be given than that jure igitur plectimur nisi enim multorum impunita feeler tulissemus nunquam ad unum tanta pervenisset licentia cicero nations do frequently fail by being too remiss in asserting their own rights or punishing offenders and hardly ever err on the severer side    judgments are variously given in several states and kingdoms but he who would find one where they lie in the breast of the king must go at least as far as morocco nay the ambassador who was lately here from that place denied that they were absolutely in him however it is certain that in england according to the great charter judia iunt per pares mag chart judgments are passed by equals no man can be imprisoned disseizd of his freehold deprived of life or limb ni per judicium parium suorum ibid unless by the sentence of his peers the kings of judah did judicabant and judicabantur maimonid judge and were judged and the judgments they gave were in and with the sanhedrin in england the kings do not judge but are judged and bracton says in justitia recipienda rex cuilibet ex plebe aqualis est that in receiving justice the king is equal to another man which could not be if judgments were given by him and he were exempted from the judgment of all by that law which has put all judgments into the hands of the people this power is executed by them in grand or petty jurys and the judges are assistants to them in explaining the difficult points of the law in which it is presumed they should be learned the strength of every judgment consists in the verdict of these jurys which the judges do not give but pronounce or declare and the same law that makes good a verdict given contrary to the advice or direction of the judges exposes them to the utmost penaltys if upon their own heads or a command from the king they should presume to give a sentence without or contrary to a verdict and no pretensions to a power of interpreting the law can exempt them if they break it the power also with which the judges are entrusted is but of a moderate extent and to be executed bona side prevarications are capital as they proved to tresilian empson dudley and many others nay even in special verdicts the judges are only assistants to the jurys who find it specially and the verdict is from them tho the judges having heard the point argued declare the sense of the law thereupon wherefore if i should grant that the king might personally assist in judgments his work could only be to prevent frauds and by the advice of the judges to see that the laws be duly executed or perhaps to inspect their behavior if he has more than this it must be by virtue of his politic capacity in which he is understood to be always present in the principal courts where justice is always done whether he who wears the crown be young or old wise or ignorant good or bad or whether he like or dislike what is done  moreover as governments are instituted for the obtaining of justice and the king is in a great measure entrusted with the power of executing it it is probable that the law would have required his presence in the distribution if there had bin but one court that at the same time he could be present in more than one that it were certain he would be guilty of no miscarriages that all miscarriages were to be punished in him as well as in the judges or that it were certain he should always be a man of such wisdom industry experience and integrity as to be an assistance to and a watch over those who are appointed for the administration of justice but there being many courts sitting at the same time of equal authority in several places far distant from each other it being impossible for the king to be present in all there being no manner of assurance that the same or greater miscarriages may not be committed in his presence than in his absence by himself than others no opportunity of punishing every delict in him without bringing the nation into such disorder as may be of more prejudice to the public than an injury done to a private man the law which intends to obviate offenses or to punish such as cannot be obviated has directed that those men should be chosen who are most knowing in it imposes an oath upon them not to be diverted from the due course of justice by fear or favor hopes or reward particularly by any command from the king and appoints the severest punishments for them if they prove false to god and their country  if any man think that the words cited from bracton by our author upon the question quis primo and principaliter possit and debeat judicare etc sciendum est quod rex and non alius si solus ad haec sufficere possit cum ad hoc per virtutem sacramenti teneatur are contrary to what i have said i desire the context may be considered that his opinion may be truly understood tho the words taken simply and nakedly may be enough for my purpose for it is ridiculous to infer that the king has a right of doing any thing upon a supposition that it is impossible for him to do it he therefore who says the king cannot do it says it must be done by others or not at all but having already proved that the king merely as king has none of the qualitys required for judging all or any cases and that many kings have all the defects of age and person that render men most unable and unfit to give any sentence we may conclude without contradicting bracton that no king as king has a power of judging because some of them are utterly unable and unfit to do it and if any one has such a power it must be conferred upon him by those who think him able and fit to perform that work when filmer finds such a man we must inquire into the extent of that power which is given to him but this would be nothing to his general proposition for he himself would hardly have inferred that because a power of judging in some cases was conferred upon one prince on account of his fitness and ability therefore all of em however unfit and unable have a power of deciding all cases besides if he believe bracton this power of judging is not inherent in the king but incumbent upon him by virtue of his oath which our author endeavors to enervate and annul but as that oath is grounded upon the law and the law cannot presume impossibilitys and absurditys it cannot intend and the oath cannot require that a man should do that which he is unable and unfit to do many kings are unfit to judge causes the law cannot therefore intend they should do it the context also shows that this imagination of the kings judging all causes if he could is merely chimerical for bracton says in the same chapter that the power of the king is the power of the law that is that he has no power but by the law and the law that aims at justice cannot make it to depend upon the uncertain humor of a child a woman or a foolish man for by that means it would destroy it self the law cannot therefore give any such power and the king cannot have it  if it be said that all kings are not so that some are of mature age wise just and good or that the question is not what is good for the subject but what is glorious to the king and that he must not lose his right tho the people perish i answer first that whatsoever belongs to kings as kings belongs to all kings this power of judging cannot belong to all for the reasons abovementioned it cannot therefore belong to any as king nor without madness be granted to any till he has given testimony of such wisdom experience diligence and goodness as is required for so great a work it imports not what his ancestors were virtues are not entailed and it were less improper for the heirs of hales and harvey to pretend that the clients and patients of their ancestors should depend upon their advice in matters of law and physic than for the heirs of a great and wise prince to pretend to powers given on account of virtue if they have not the same talents for the performance of the works required  common sense declares that governments are instituted and judicatures erected for the obtaining of justice the kings bench was not established that the chief justice should have a great office but that the oppressed should be relieved and right done the honor and profit he receives comes in as it were by accident as the rewards of his service if he rightly perform his duty but he may as well pretend he is there for his own sake as the king god did not set up moses or joshua that they might glory in having six hundred thousand men under their command but that they might lead the people into the land they were to possess that is they were not for themselves but for the people and the glory they acquired was by rightly performing the end of their institution even our author is obliged to confess this when he says that the kings prerogative is instituted for the good of those that are under it it is therefore for them that he enjoys it and it can no otherwise subsist than in concurrence with that end he also yields that the safety of the people is the supreme law the right therefore that the king has must be conformable and subordinate to it if any one therefore set up an interest in himself that is not so he breaks this supreme law he dos not live and reign for his people but for himself and by departing from the end of his institution destroys it and if aristotle to whom our author seems to have a great deference deserves credit such a one ceases to be a king and becomes a tyrant he who ought to have bin the best of men is turned into the worst and he who is recommended to us under the name of a father becomes a public enemy to the people the question therefore is not what is good for the king but what is good for the people and he can have no right repugnant to them  bracton is not more gentle the king says he is obliged by his oath to the utmost of his power to preserve the church and the christian world in peace to hinder rapine and all manner of iniquity to cause justice and mercy to be observed he has no power but from the law that only is to be taken for law quod recte fuerit definitum he is therefore to cause justice to be done according to that rule and not to pervert it for his own pleasure profit or glory he may choose judges also not such as will be subservient to his will but viros sapientes timentes deum in quibus est bract l   c  0 veritas eloquiorum and qui oderunt avaritiam which proves that kings and their officers do not possess their places for themselves but for the people and must be such as are fit and able to perform the dutys they undertake the mischievous fury of those who assume a power above their abilitys is well represented by the known fable of phaeton they think they desire fine things for themselves when they seek their own ruin in conformity to this the same bracton says that si quis minus sapiens and indoctus sedem judicandi and honestatem judicandi sibi praesumserit exalto corruit etc and perinde rit ac si gladium poneret in manu furentis ibid if any man who is unskilful assume the seat of justice he falls as from a precipice etc and it is the same thing as if a sword be put into the hand of a mad man which cannot but affect the king as well as those who are chosen by him if he neglect the functions of his office he dos unjustly and becomes the vicegerent of the devil for he is the minister of him whose works he dos this is bractons opinion but desiring to be a more gentle interpreter of the law i only wish that princes would consider the end of their institution endeavor to perform it measure their own abilitys content themselves with that power which the laws allow and abhor those wretches who by flattery and lies endeavor to work upon their frailest passions by which means they draw upon em that hatred of the people which frequently brings them to destruction  tho vlpians words princeps legibus non tenetur be granted to have bin true in fact with relation to the roman empire in the time when he lived yet they can conclude nothing against us the liberty of rome had bin overthrown long before by the power of the sword and the law rendered subservient to the will of the usurpers they were not englishmen but romans who lost the battles of pharsalia and philippi the carcases of their senators not ours were exposed to the wolves and vulturs pompeius scipio lentulus afranius petreius cato cassius and brutus were defenders of the roman not the english liberty and that of their country not ours could only be lost by their defeat those who were destroyed by the proscriptions left rome not england to be enslaved if the best had gained the victory it could have bin no advantage to us and their overthrow can be no prejudice every nation is to take care of their own laws and whether any one has had the wisdom virtue fortune and power to defend them or not concerns only themselves the examples of great and good men acting freely deserve consideration but they only perish by the ill success of their designs and whatsoever is afterward done by their subdued posterity ought to have no other effect upon the rest of the world than to admonish them so to join in the defense of their libertys as never to be brought under the necessity of acting by the command of one to the prejudice of themselves and their country if the roman greatness persuade us to put an extraordinary value upon what passed among them we ought rather to examine what they did said or thought when they enjoyed that liberty which was the mother and nurse of their virtue than what they suffered or were forced to say when fallen under that slavery which produced all manner of corruption and made them the most base and miserable people of the world  for what concerns us the actions of our ancestors resemble those of the ancient rather than the later romans tho our government be not the same with theirs in form yet it is in principle and if we are not degenerated we shall rather desire to imitate the romans in the time of their virtue glory power and felicity than what they were in that of their slavery vice shame and misery in the best times when the laws were more powerful than the commands of men fraud was accounted a crime so detestable as not to be imputed to any but slaves and he who had sought a power above the law under color of interpreting it would have bin exposed to scorn or greater punishments if any can be greater than the just scorn of the best men and as neither the romans nor any people of the world have better defended their libertys than the english nation when any attempt has bin made to oppress them by force they ought to be no less careful to preserve them from the more dangerous efforts of fraud and falsehood  our ancestors were certainly in a low condition in the time of william the first many of their best men had perished in the civil wars or with harold their valor was great but rough and void of skill the normans by frequent expeditions into france italy and spain had added subtilty to the boisterous violence of their native climate william had engaged his faith but broke it and turned the power with which he was entrusted to the ruin of those that had trusted him he destroyed many worthy men carried others into normandy and thought himself master of all he was crafty bold and elated with victory but the resolution of a brave people was invincible when their laws and libertys were in danger they resolved to die or to defend them and made him see he could no otherwise preserve his crown and life than by the performance of his oath and accomplishing the ends of his election they neither took him to be the giver or interpreter of their laws and would not suffer him to violate those of their ancestors in this way they always continued and tho perhaps they might want skill to fall upon the surest and easiest means of restraining the lusts of princes yet they maintained their rights so well that the wisest princes seldom invaded them and the success of those who were so foolish to attempt it was such as may justly deter others from following their unprosperous examples we have had no king since william the first more hardy than henry the   th and yet he so entirely acknowledged the power of making changing and repealing laws to be in the parliament as never to attempt any extraordinary thing otherwise than by their authority it was not he but the parliament that dissolved the abbys he did not take their lands to himself but received what the parliament thought fit to give him he did not reject the supremacy of the pope nor assume any other power in spiritual matters than the parliament conferred upon him the intricacys of his marriages and the legitimation of his children were settled by the same power at least one of his daughters could not inherit the crown upon any other title they who gave him a power to dispose of the crown by will might have given it to his groom and he was too haughty to ask it from them if he had it in himself which he must have had if the laws and judicatures had bin in his hand  this is farther evidenced by what passed in the tower between sir thomas moor and rich the kings solicitor who asking if it would not be herberts s hen   th treason to oppose richard rich if the parliament should make him king moor said that was casus levis for the parliament could make and depose kings as they thought fit and then as more conducing to his own case asked rich if the parliament should enact that god should not be god whether such as did not submit should be esteemed traitors it is evident that a man of the acuteness and learning of sir tho moor would not have made use of such an argument to avoid the necessity of obeying what the parliament had ordained by showing his case to be of a nature far above the power of man unless it had bin confessed by all men that the parliament could do whatsoever lay within the reach of human power this may be enough to prove that the king cannot have a power over the law and if he has it not the power of interpreting law is absurdly attributed to him since it is founded upon a supposition that he can make them which is false  sect xxvii magna charta was not the original but a declaration of the english libertys the kings power is not restrained but created by that and other laws and the nation that made them can only correct the defects of them i agree with our author that magna charta was not made to restrain the absolute authority for no such thing was in being or pretended the folly of such visions seeming to have bin reserved to complete the misfortune and ignominy of our age but it was to assert the native and original libertys of our nation by the confession of the king then being that neither he nor his successors should any way encroach upon them and it cannot be said that the power of kings is diminished by that or any other law for as they are kings only by law the law may confer power upon one in particular or upon him and his successors but can take nothing from them because they have nothing except what is given to them but as that which the law gives is given by those who make the law they only are capable of judging whether he to whom they gave it do well or ill employ that power and consequently are only fit to correct the defects that may be found in it therefore tho i should confess that faults may be found in many statutes and that the whole body of them is greatly defective it will not follow that the compendious way of referring all to the will of the king should be taken but what defects soever may be in our law the disease is not so great to require extreme remedys and we may hope for a cheaper cure our law may possibly have given away too much from the people and provided only insufficient defenses of our libertys against the encroachments of bad princes but none who are not in judgment and honesty like to our author can propose for a remedy to the evils that proceed from the error of giving too much the resignation of all the rest to them and whatever he says it is evident that he knows this to be true tho when he denis that the power of king can be restrained by acts of parliament he endeavors to take advantage of such clauses as were either fraudulently inserted by the kings officers who till the days of henry the fifth for the most part had the penning of the public acts or through negligence did not fully explain the intentions of the legislators which would be to no purpose if all were put into the hands of the king by a general law from god that no human power could diminish or enlarge and as his last shift would obliquely put all into the power of the king by giving him a right of interpreting the law and judging such cases as are not clearly decided which would be equally impertinent if he had openly and plainly a right of determining all things according to his will  but what defect soever may be in any statutes no great inconveniencys could probably ensue if that for annual parliaments was observed as of right it ought to be nothing is more unlikely than that a great assembly of eminent and chosen men should make a law evidently destructive to their own designs and no mischief that might emerge upon the discovery of a mistake could be so extreme that the cure might not be deferred till the meeting of the parliament or at least forty days in which time the king may call one if that which the law has fixed seem to be too long if he fails of this he performs not his trust and he that would reward such a breach of it with a vast and uncontrolable power may be justly thought equal in madness to our author who by forbidding us to examine the titles of kings and enjoining an entire veneration of the power by what means soever obtained encourages the worst of men to murder the best of princes with an assurance that if they prosper they shall enjoy all the honors and advantages that this world can afford  princes are not much more beholden to him for the haughty language he puts into their mouths it having bin observed that the worst are always most ready to use it and their extravagances having bin often chastisd by law sufficiently proves that their power is not derived from a higher original than the law of their own countries  if it were true that the answer sometimes given by kings to bills presented for their assent did as our author says amount to a denial it could only show that they have a negative voice upon that which is agreed by the parliament and is far from a power of acting by themselves being only a check upon the other parts of the government but indeed it is no more than an elusion and he that dos by art obliquely elude confesses he has not a right absolutely to refuse it is natural to kings especially to the worst to scrue up their authority to the height and nothing can more evidently prove the defect of it than the necessity of having recourse to such pitiful evasions when they are unwilling to do that which is required but if i should grant that the words import a denial and that notwithstanding those of the coronation oath quas vulgus elegerit they might deny no more could be inferred from thence than that they are entrusted with a power equal in that point to that of either house and cannot be supreme in our authors sense unless there were in the same state at the same time three distinct supreme and absolute powers which is absurd  his cases relating to the proceedings of the star chamber and council table do only prove that some kings have incroachd upon the rights of the nation and bin suffered till their excesses growing to be extreme they turned to the ruin of the ministers that advised them and sometimes of the kings themselves but the jurisdiction of the council having bin regulated by the statute of    car   and the star chamber more lately abolished they are nothing to our dispute  such as our author usually impute to treason and rebellion the changes that upon these occasions have ensued but all impartial men do not only justify them but acknowledge that all the crowns of europe are at this day enjoyed by no other title than such acts solemnly performed by the respective nations who either disliking the person that pretended to the crown tho next in blood or the government of the present possessor have thought fit to prefer another person or family they also say as that no government can be so perfect but some defect may be originally in it or afterward introduced none can subsist unless they be from time to time reduced to their first integrity by such an exertion of the power of those for whose sake they were instituted as may plainly show them to be subject to no power under heaven but may do whatever appears to be for their own good and as the safety of all nations consists in rightly placing and measuring this power such have bin found always to prosper who have given it to those from whom usurpations were least to be feared who have bin least subject to be awed cheated or corrupted and who having the greatest interest in the nation were most concerned to preserve its power liberty and welfare this is the greatest trust that can be reposed in men this power was by the spartans given to the ephori and the senate of twenty eight in venine to that which they call concilio de pregadi in germany spain france swedeland denmark poland hungary bohemia scotland england and generally all the nations that have lived under the gothic polity it has bin in their general assemblys under the names of diets cortez parliaments senats and the like but in what hands soever it is the power of making abrogating changing correcting and intepreting laws has bin in the same kings have bin rejected or deposed the succession of the crown settled regulated or changed and i defy any man to show me one king amongst all the nations abovementioned that has any right to the crown he wears unless such acts are good  if this power be not well placed or rightly proportioned to that which is given to other magistrates the state must necessarily fall into great disorders or the must violent and dangerous means must be frequently used to preserve their liberty sparta and venice have rarely bin put to that trouble because the senats were so much above the kings and dukes in power that they could without difficulty bring them to reason the gothic kings in spain never ventured to dispute with the nobility and witza and rodrigo exposed the kingdom as a prey to the moors rather by weakening it through the neglect of military discipline joined to their own ignorance and cowardice and by evil example bringing the youth to resemble them in leudness and baseness than by establishing in themselves a power above the law but in england our ancestors who seem to have had some such thing in their eye as balancing the powers by a fatal mistake placed usually so much in the hands of the king that whenever he happened to be bad his extravagances could not be represt without great danger and as this has in several ages cost the nation a vast proportion of generous blood so it is the cause of our present difficultys and threatens us with more but can never deprive usof the rights we inherit from our fathers  sect xxviii the english nation has always bin governed by it self or its representatives having proved that the people of england have never acknowledged any other human law than their own and that our parliaments having the power of making and abrogating laws they only can interpret them and decide hard cases it plainly appears there can be no truth in our authors assertion that the king is the author corrector and moderator of both statute and common law and nothing can be more frivolous than what he adds that neither of them can be a diminution of that natural power which kings have over their people as fathers in as much as the differences between paternal and monarchical power as he asserts it are vast and irreconcilable in principle and practice as i have proved at large in the former parts of this work  but lest we should be too proud of the honor he is pleased to do to our parliaments by making use of their authority he says we are first to remember that till the conquest which name for the glory of our nation he gives to the coming in of the normans there could be no parliament assembled of the general states because we cannot learn that until those days it was entirely united in one secondly he doubts whether the parliament in the time of the saxons were composed of the nobility and clergy or whether the commons were also called but concludes there could be no knights of any shires because there were no shires thirdly that henry the first caused the commons first to assemble knights and burgesses of their own choosing and would make this to be an act of grace and favor from that king but adds that it had bin more for the honor of parliaments if a king whose title to the crown had bin better had bin the author of the form of it  in answer to the first i do not think my self obliged to insist upon the name or form of the parliament for the authority of a magistracy proceeds not from the number of years that it has continued but the rectitude of the institution and the authority of those that instituted it the power of saul david and jeroboam was the same with that which belonged to the last kings of israel and judah the authority of the roman consuls dictators pretors and tribuns was the same as soon as it was established was as legal and just as that of the kings of denmark which is said to have continued above three thousand years for as time can make nothing lawful or just that is not so of it self tho men are unwilling to change that which has pleased their ancestors unless they discover great inconveniences in it that which a people dos rightly establish for their own good is of as much force the first day as continuance can ever give to it and therefore in matters of the greatest importance wise and good men do not so much inquire what has bin as what is good and ought to be for that which of it self is evil by continuance is made worse and upon the first opportunity is justly to be abolished but if that liberty in which god created man can receive any strength from continuance and the rights of englishmen can be rendered more unquestionable by prescription i say that the nations whose rights we inherit have ever enjoyed the libertys we claim and always exercised them in governing themselves popularly or by such representatives as have bin instituted by themselves from the time they were first known in the world  the britans and saxons lay so long hid in the obscurity that accompanys barbarism that it is in vain to seek what was done by either in any writers more ancient than caesar and tacitus the first describes the britans to have bin a fierce people zealous for liberty and so obstinately valiant in the defense of it that tho they wanted skill and were overpowered by the romans their country could no otherwise be subdued than by the slaughter of all the inhabitants able to bear arms he calls them a free people in as much as they were not like the gauls governed by laws made by the great men but by the people in his time they chose cassivellaunus and afterward caractatus arviragus galgacus and others to command them in their wars but they retained the government in themselves that no force might be put upon them they met armed in their general assemblys and tho the smaller matters were left to the determination of the chief men chosen by themselves for that purpose they reserved the most important amongst which the choosing of those men was one to themselves when the romans had brought them low inter instrumenta servitutis reges habuere c tacit they set up certain kings to govern such as were within their territorys but those who defended themselves by the natural strength of their situation or retired into the north or the islands were still governed by their own customs and were never acquainted with domestic or foreign slavery the saxons from whom we chiefly derive our original and manners were no less lovers of liberty and better understood the ways of defending it they were certainly the most powerful and valiant people of germany and what the germans performed under ariovistus arminius and maroboduus shows both their force and their temper if ever fear entered into the heart of caesar it seems to have bin when he was to deal with ariovistus the advantages that the brave germanicus obtained against arminius were at least thought equal to the greatest victorys that had bin gained by any roman captain because these nations fought not for riches or any instruments of luxury or pleasure which they despised but for liberty this was the principle in which they lived as appears by their words and actions so that arminius when his brother flavius who served the romans boasted of the increase of his pay and the marks of honor he had received in scorn called them the vilis serviii pramia tacit rewards of the vilest servitude but when he himself endeavored to usurp a power over the liberty of his country which he had so bravely defended he was killed by those he would have oppressed tacitus farther describing the nature of the germans shows that the romans had run greater hazards from them than from the samnites carthaginians and parthians and attributes their bravery to the quippe gravior est arsacis regno germanorum libertas liberty they enjoyed for they are says he neither exepti oneribus and collationibus and tantum in usum praliorum seposii velut tela and arma bellis reservantur exhausted by tributes nor vexed by publicans and lest this liberty should be violated de minoribus principes consultant de majoribus omnes c tac de mor germ the chief men consult about things of lesser moment but the most important matters are determined by all whoever would know the opinion of that wise author concerning the german liberty may read his excellent treatise of their manners and customs but i presume this may be enough to prove that they lived free under such magistrates as they chose regulated by such laws as they made and retained the principal powers of the government in their general or particular councils their kings and princes had no other power than what was conferred upon them by these ut turbae placuit considunt armati silentium per acerdotes quibus tum coercendi jus est imperatur mox rex vel princeps prout aetas cuique prout nobilitas prout decus bellorum prout facundia est audiuntur autoritate suadendi magis quam jubendi potestate si displiuit sententia fremitu apernantur si placuit frameas concutiunt etc ibid assemblys who having all in themselves could receive nothing from them who had nothing to give  it is as easily proved that the saxons or angli from whom we descend were eminent among those whose power virtue and love to liberty the abovementioned historian so highly extols in as much as besides what he says in general of the saxons he names the angli describes their habitation near the elb and their religious worship of the goddess erthum or the earth celebrated in an island lying in the mouth of that river thought to be heyligland in resemblance of which a small one lying over against berwick is called holy island if they were free in their own country they must have bin so when they came hither the manner of their coming shows they were more likely to impose than submit to slavery and if they had not the name of parliament it was because they did not speak french or not being yet joined with the normans they had not thought fit to put their affairs into that method but having the root of power and liberty in themselves they could not but have a right of establishing the one in such a form as best pleased them for the preservation of the other  this being as i suppose undeniable it imports not whether the assemblys in which the supreme power of each nation did reside were frequent or rare composed of many or few persons sitting altogether in one place or in more what name they had or whether every free man did meet and vote in his own person or a few were delegated by many for they who have a right inherent in themselves may resign it to others and they who can give a power to others may exercise it themselves unless they recede from it by their own act for it is only matter of convenience of which they alone can be the judges because it is for themselves only that they judge if this were not so it would be very prejudicial to kings for it is certain that cassivellaunus caractatus arviragus galgacus hengist horsa and others amongst the britans and saxons what name soever may have bin abusively given to them were only temporary magistrates chosen upon occasion of present wars but we know of no time in which the britans had not their great council to determine their most important affairs and the saxons in their own country had their councils where all were present and in which tacitus assures us they dispatched their greatest business these were the same with the micklegemots which they afterward held here and might have bin called by the same name if tacitus had spoken dutch  if a people therefore have not a power to create at any time a magistracy which they had not before none could be created at all for no magistracy is eternal and if for the validity of the constitution it be necessary that the beginning must be unknown or that no other could have bin before it the monarchy amongst us cannot be established upon any right for tho our ancestors had their councils and magistrates as well here as in germany they had no monarchs this appears plainly by the testimony of caesar and tacitus and our later historys show that as soon as the saxons came into this country they had their micklegemots which were general assemblys of the noble and free men who had in themselves the power of the nation and tho when they increased in numbers they erected seven kingdoms yet every one retained the same usage within it self these assemblys were evidently the same in power with our parliaments and tho they differed in name or form it matters not for they who could act in the one could not but have a power of instituting the other that is the same people that could meet together in their own persons and according to their own pleasure order all matters relating to themselves whilst three or four countys only were under one government and their numbers were not so great or their habitation so far distant that they might not meet altogether without inconvenience with the same right might depute others to represent them when being joined in one no place was capable of receiving so great a multitude and that the frontiers would have bin exposed to the danger of foreign invasions if any such thing had bin practiced  but if the authority of parliaments for many ages representing the whole nation were less to be valued as our author insinuates because they could not represent the whole when it was not joined in one body that of kings must come to nothing for there could be no one king over all when the nation was divided into seven distinct governments and it is most absurd to think that the nation which had seven great councils or micklegemots at the same time they had seven kingdoms could not as well unite the seven councils as the seven kingdoms into one it is to as little purpose to say that the nation did not unite it self but the several parcels came to be inherited by one for that one could inherit no more from the others than what they had and the seven being only magistrates set up by the micklegemots etc the one must be also and it is neither reasonable to imagine nor possible to prove that a fierce nation jealous of liberty and who had obstinately defended it in germany against all invaders should conquer this country to enslave themselves and purchase nothing by their valor but that servitude which they abhorred or be less free when they were united into one state than they had bin when they were divided into seven and least of all that one man could first subdue his own people and then all the rest when by endeavoring to subdue his own he had broken the trust reposed in him and lost the right conferred upon him and without them had not power to subdue any but as it is my fate almost ever to dissent from our author i affirm that the variety of government which is observed to have bin amongst the saxons who in some ages were divided in others united sometimes under captains at other times under kings sometimes meeting personally in the micklegemots sometimes by their delegats in the wittenagemots dos evidently testify that they ordered all things according to their own pleasure which being the utmost act of liberty it remained inviolable under all those changes as we have already proved by the examples of offa ina alfred canutus edward and other particular as well as universal kings and we may be sure those of the norman race can have no more power since they came in by the same way and swore to govern by the same laws    i am no way concerned in our authors doubt whether parliaments did in those days consist of nobility and clergy or whether the commons were also called for if it were true as he asserts that according to the eternal law of god and nature there can be no government in the world but that of an absolute monarch whose sovereign majesty can be diminished by no law or custom there could be parliaments or other magistracys that did not derive their power and being from his will but having proved that the saxons had their general councils and assemblys when they had no kings that by them kings were made and the greatest affairs determined whether they had kings or not it can be of no importance whether in one or more ages the commons had a part in the government or not for the same power that instituted a parliament without them might when they thought fit receive them into it or rather if they who had the government in their hands did for reasons known to themselves recede from the exercise of it they might resume it when they pleased  nevertheless it may be worth our pains to inquire what our author means by nobility if such as at this day by means of patents obtained for money or by favor without any regard to merit in the persons or their ancestors are called dukes marquesses etc i give him leave to impute as late and base an original to them as he pleases without fearing that the rights of our nation can thereby be impaired and am content that if the king do not think fit to support the dignity of his own creatures they may fall but if by noblemen we are to understand such as have bin ennobld by the virtues of their ancestors manifested in services done to their country i say that all nations amongst whom virtue has bin esteemed have had a great regard to them and their posterity and tho kings when they were made have bin entrusted by the saxons and other nations with a power of ennobling those who by services rendered to their country might deserve that honor yet the body of the nobility was more ancient than such for it had bin equally impossible to take reges ex nobilitate duces ex virtute sumere  sublimato eo coepit lues omnium scelerum crescere sviebat scurrilis nequitia odium veritatis etc ut vas omnium scelerum solus videretur vortigernus and quod maxim regiae honestati contrarium est nobiles deprimens and moribus and sanguine ignobiles extollens deo and hominibus eicitur odiosus mat westminster an       kings according to tacitus out of the nobility if there had bin no nobility as to take captains for their virtue if there had bin no virtue princes could not without breach of trust confer honors upon those that did not deserve them which is so true that this practice was objected as the greatest crime against vortigern the last and the worst of the british kings and tho he might pretend according to such cavils as are usually in our time that the judgment of those matters was referred to him yet the world judged of his crimes and when he had rendered himself odious to god and men by them he perished in them and brought destruction upon his country that had suffered them too long  as among the turks and most of the eastern tyrannys there is no nobility and no man has any considerable advantage above the common people unless by the immediate favor of the prince so in all the legal kingdoms of the north the strength of the government has always bin placed in the nobility and no better defense has bin found against the encroachments of ill kings than by setting up an order of men who by holding large territorys and having great numbers of tenants and dependents might be able to restrain the exorbitances that either the kings or the commons might run into for this end spain germany france poland denmark sweden scotland and england were almost wholly divided into lordships under several names by which every particular possessor owed allegiance that is such an obedience as the law requires to the king and he reciprocally swore to perform that which the same law exacted from him  when these nations were converted to the christian religion they had a great veneration for the clergy and not doubting that the men whom they esteemed holy would be just thought their libertys could not be better secured than by joining those who had the direction of their consciences to the noblemen who had the command of their forces this succeeded so well in relation to the defense of the public rights that in all the forementioned states the bishops abbots etc were no less zealous or bold in defending the public liberty than the best and greatest of the lords and if it were true that things being thus established the commons did neither personally nor by their representatives enter into the general assemblys it could be of no advantage to kings for such a power as is abovementioned is equally inconsistent with the absolute sovereignty of kings if placed in the nobility and clergy as if the commons had a part if the king has all no other man nor number of men can have any if the nobility and clergy have the power the commons may have their share also but i affirm that those whom we now call commons have always had a part in the government and their place in the councils that managed it for if there was a distinction it must have bin by patent birth or tenure  as for patents we know they began long after the coming of the normans and those that now have them cannot pretend to any advantage on account of birth or tenure beyond many of those who have them not nay besides the several branches of the familys that now enjoy the most ancient honors which consequently are as noble as they and some of them of the elder houses we know many that are now called commoners who in antiquity and eminency are no way inferior to the chief of the titular nobility and nothing can be more absurd than to give a prerogative of birth to crvn tftn hde bnnt osbrn and others before the cliftons hampdens courtneys pelhams st johns baintons wilbrahams hungerfords and many others and if the tenures of their estates be considered they have the same and as ancient as any of those who go under the names of duke or marquess i forbear to mention the sordid ways of attaining to titles in our days but whoever will take the pains to examine them shall find that they rather defile than ennoble the possessors and whereas men are truly ennobld only by virtue and respect is due to such as are descended from those who have bravely served their country because it is presumed till they show the contrary that they will resemble their ancestors these modern courtiers by their names and titles frequently oblige us to call to mind such things as are not to be mentioned without blushing whatever the ancient noblemen of england were we are sure they were not such as these and tho it should be confessed that no others than dukes marquesses earls viscounts and barons had their places in the councils mentioned by caesar and tacitus or in the great assemblys of the saxons it could be of no advantage to such as are now called by those names they were the titles of offices conferred upon those who did and could best conduct the people in time of war give counsel to the king administer justice and perform other public dutys but were never made hereditary except by abuse much less were they sold for money or given as recompenses of the vilest services if the ancient order be totally inverted and the ends of its institution perverted they who from thence pretend to be distinguished from other men must build their claim upon something very different from antiquity  this being sufficient if i mistake not to make it appear that the ancient councils of our nation did not consist of such as we now call noblemen it may be worth our pains to examine of what sort of men they did consist and tho i cannot much rely upon the credit of camden which he has forfeited by a great number of untruths i will begin with him because he is cited by our author if we will believe him quod saxones olim wittenagemot parliamentum and pananglicum recte dici possit summamque and acrosanctam habet autoritatem in legibus ferendis antiquandis conformandis interpretandis and in omnibus quae ad reipublicae salutem spectant brit fol    that which the saxons called wittenagemot we may justly name parliament which has the supreme and most sacred authority of making abrogating and interpreting laws and generally of all things relating to the safety of the commonwealth this wittenagemot was according to william of malmsbury generalis senatus and populi conventus malms the general meeting of the senate and people and sir harry spelman calls it commune concilium tam cleri quam populi spelm the general council of the clergy and people in the assembly at calcuth it was decreed by the archbishops bishops abbots dukes senators and the people of the land populo terrae that the ut reges a sacerdotibus and senioribus populi eligantur kings should be elected by the priests and elders of the people by these offa ina and others were made kings and alfred in his will acknowledged his quam dens and principes cum senioribus populi misericorditer and benign dederunt crown from them edgar was elected by all the people and not long after deposed by them and again restored in a coram omni multitudine populi anglorum general assembly these things being sometimes said to be done by the assent of the barons of the kingdom camden says that under the name of the nomine baronagii omnes quodam modo regni ordnes continentur camd baronage all the orders of the kingdom are in a manner comprehended and it cannot be otherwise understood if we consider that those called noblemen or the nobility of england are often by the historians said to be infinita multitudo an infinite multitude  if any man ask how the nobility came to be so numerous i answer that the northern nations who were perpetually in arms put a high esteem upon military valor sought by conquest to acquire better countries than their own valued themselves according to the numbers of men they could bring into the field and to distinguish them from villains called those noblemen who nobly defended and enlarged their dominions by war and for a reward of their services in the division of lands gained by conquest they distributed to them freeholds under the obligation of continuing the same service to their country this appears by the name of knights service a knight being no more than a soldier and a knights fee no more than was sufficient to maintain one it is plain that knighthood was always esteemed nobility so that no man of what quality soever thought a knight inferior to him and those of the highest birth could not act as noblemen till they were knighted among the goths in spain the cutting off the hair which being long was the mark of knighthood was accounted a degrading and looked upon to be so great a mark of infamy that he who had suffered it could never bear any honor or office in the commonwealth and there was no dignity so high but every knight was capable of it there was no distinction of men above it and even to this day baron or varon in their language signifys no more than vir in latin which is not properly given to any man unless he be free the like was in france till the coming in of the third race of kings in which time the    peers of whom   only were laymen were raised to a higher dignity and the commands annexed made hereditary but the honor of knighthood was thereby no way diminished tho there were dukes earls marquesses and barons in the time of froissart yet he usually calls them knights and philip de commines speaking of the most eminent men of his time calls them good wise or valiant knights even to this day the name of gentleman comprehends all that is raised above the common people henry the fourth usually called himself the first gentleman in france and it is an ordinary phrase among them when they speak of a gentleman of good birth to say il est noble comme le roy he is as noble as the king in their general assembly of estates the chamber of the noblesse which is one of three is composed of the deputys sent by the gentry of every province and in the inquiry made about the year      concerning nobility no notice was taken of such as had assumed the titles of earl marquess viscount or baron but only of those who called themselves gentlemen and if they could prove that name to belong to them they were left to use the other titles as they pleased when duels were in fashion as all know they were lately no man except the princes of the blood and marechals of france could with honor refuse a challenge from any gentleman the first because it was thought unfit that he who might be king should fight with a subject to the danger of the commonwealth which might by that means be deprived of its head the others being by their office commanders of the nobility and judges of all the controversys relating to honor that happen amongst them cannot reasonably be brought into private contests with any in denmark nobleman and gentleman is the same thing and till the year    0 they had the principal part of the government in their hands when charles gustavus king of sweden invaded poland in the year      it is said that there were above three hundred thousand gentlemen in arms to resist him this is the nobility of that country kings are chosen by them every one of them will say as in france he is noble as the king the last king was a private man among them not thought to have had more than four hundred pounds a year he who now reigns was not at all above him in birth or estate till he had raised himself by great services done for his country in many wars and there was not one gentleman in the nation who might not have bin chosen as well as he if it had pleased the assembly that did it  this being the nobility of the northern nations and the true baronage of england it is no wonder that they were called nobiles the most eminent among them magnates principes proceres and so numerous that they were esteemed to be multitudo infinita one place was hardly able to contain them and the inconveniences of calling them all together appeared to be so great that in time they chose rather to meet by representatives than every one in his own person the power therefore remaining in them it matters not what method they observed in the execution they who had the substance in their hands might give it what form they pleased our author sufficiently manifests his ignorance in saying there could be no knights of the shires in the time of the saxons because there were no shires for the very word is saxon and we find the names of barkshire wiltshire devonshire dorsetshire and others most frequently in the writings of those times and dukes earls thanes or aldermen appointed to command the forces and look to the distribution of justice in them seldom cites ingulphus for saying that seldom s tit of honor p   c   alfred was the first that changed the provinces etc into countys but refutes him and proves that the distinction of the land into shires or countys for shire signified no more than the share or part committed to the care of the earl or comes was far more ancient whether the first divisions by the saxons were greater or lesser than the shires or countys now are is nothing to the question they who made them to be as they were could have made them greater or lesser as they pleased and whether they did immediately or some ages after that distinction cease to come to their great assemblys and rather choose to send their deputys or whether such deputys were chosen by countys citys and boroughs as in our days or in any other manner can be of no advantage or prejudice to the cause that i maintain if the power of the nation when it was divided into seven kingdoms or united under one did reside in the micklegemots or wittenagemots if these consisted of the nobility and people who were sometimes so numerous that no one place could well contain them and if the preference given to the chief among them was on account of the offices they executed either in relation to war or justice which no man can deny i have as much as serves for my purpose it is indifferent to me whether they were called earls dukes aldermen herotoghs or thanes for it is certain that the titular nobility now in mode amongst us has no resemblance to this ancient nobility of england the novelty therefore is on the other side and that of the worst sort because by giving the name of noblemen which anciently belonged to such as had the greatest interests in nations and were the supporters of their liberty to courtcreatures who often have none and either acquire their honors by money or are preferred for servile and sometimes impure services rendered to the person that reigns or else for mischiefs done to their country the constitution has bin wholly inverted and the trust reposed in the kings who in some measure had the disposal of offices and honors misemployd this is farther aggravated by appropriating the name of noblemen solely to them whereas the nation having bin anciently divided only into freemen or noblemen who were the same and villains the first were as tacitus says of their ancestors the germans exempti oneribus and collationibus and tantum in usum praliorum repositi vluti tela and arma llis reservantur corn tacit de morib germ exempted from burdens and contributions and reserved like arms for the uses of war whilst the others were little better than slaves appointed to cultivate the lands or to other servile offices and i leave any reasonable man to judge whether the latter condition be that of those we now call commoners nevertheless he that will believe the title of noblemen still to belong to those only who are so by patent may guess how well our wars would be managed if they were left solely to such as are so by that title if this be approved his majesty may do well with his hundred and fifty noblemen eminent in valor and military experience as they are known to be to make such wars as may fall upon him and leave the despised commons under the name of villains to provide for themselves if the success do not answer his expectations but if the commons are as free as the nobles many of them in birth equal to the patentees in estate superior to most of them and that it is not only expected they should assist him in wars with their persons and purses but acknowledged by all that the strength and virtue of the nation is in them it must be confessed that they are true noblemen of england and that all the privileges anciently enjoyed by such must necessarily belong to them since they perform the offices to which they were annexed this shows how the nobility were justly said to be almost infinite in number so that no one place was able to contain them the saxon armies that came over into this country to a wholesome and generative climat might well increase in four or five ages to those vast numbers as the franks goths and others had done in spain france italy and other parts and when they were grown so numerous they found themselves necessarily obliged to put the power into the hands of representatives chosen by themselves which they had before exercised in their own persons but these two ways differing rather in form than essentially the one tending to democracy the other to aristocracy they are equally opposite to the absolute dominion of one man reigning for himself and governing the nation as his patrimony and equally assert the rights of the people to put the government into such a form as best pleases themselves this was suitable to what they had practiced in their own country de minoribus consultant principes de majoribus omnes nay even tacit de mor germ these smaller matters cannot be said properly to relate to the king for he is but one and the word principes is in the plural number and can only signify such principal men as the same author says were chosen by the general assemblys to do justice etc and to each of them one hundred comites joined not only to give advice but authority to their actions  the word omnes spoken by a roman must likewise be understood as it was used by them and imports all the citizens or such as made up the body of the commonwealth if he had spoken of rome or athens whilst they remained free he must have used the same word because all those of whom the city consisted had votes how great soever the number of slaves or strangers might have bin the spartans are rightly said to have gained lost and recovered the lordship or principality of greece they were all lords in relation to their helots and so were the dorians in relation to that sort of men which under several names they kept as the saxons did their villains for the performance of the offices which they thought too mean for those who were ennobld by liberty and the use of arms by which the commonwealth was defended and enlarged tho the romans scorned to give the title of lord to those who had usurped a power over their lives and fortunes yet every one of them was a lord in relation to his own servants and altogether are often called romanos rerum dominos virg lords of the world the like is seen almost every where the government of venice having continued for many ages in the same familys has ennobld them all no phrase is more common in switzerland than the lords of bern or the lords of zurich and other places tho perhaps there is not a man amongst them who pretends to be a gentleman according to the modern sense put upon that word the states of the united provinces are called high and mighty lords and the same title is given to each of them in particular nay the word here which signifys lord both in high and low dutch is as common as monsieur in france signor in italy or sennor in spain and is given to every one who is not of a sordid condition but especially to soldiers and tho a common soldier be now a much meaner thing than it was anciently no man speaking to a company of soldiers in italian uses any other style than signori soldati and the like is done in other languages it is not therefore to be thought strange if the saxons who in their own country had scorned any other employment than that of the sword should think themselves farther ennobld when by their arms they had acquired a great and rich country and driven out or subdued the former inhabitants they might well distinguish themselves from the villains they brought with them or the britans they had enslaved they might well be called magnates proceres regni nobiles angliae nobilitas barons and the assemblys of them justly called concilium regni generale vniversitas totius angliae nobilium vniversitas baronagii according to the variety of times and other occurrences we have such footsteps remaining of the name of baron as plainly show the signification of it the barons of london and the cinq ports are known to be only the freemen of those places in the petty courtbarons every man who may be of a jury is a baron these are noblemen for there are noble nations as well as noble men in nations the mammalukes accounted themselves to be all noble tho born slaves and when they had ennobld themselves by the use of arms they looked upon the noblest of the egyptians as their slaves tertullian writing not to some eminent men but to the whole people of carthage calls them antiquitate nobiles nobilitate felices such were the saxons ennobld by a perpetual application to those exercises that belong to noblemen and an abhorrence to any thing that is vile and sordid  lest this should seem far fetched to those who please themselves with cavilling they are to know that the same general councils are expressed by other authors in other words they are called commune concilium episcoporum procerum comitum and omnium sapientum seniorum and populorum totius regni bed eccl hist the general council of the bishops noblemen counts all the wise men elders and people of the whole kingdom in the time of ina in that edward the elder magnum concilium episcoporum abbatum fidelium procerum and populorum the great council of the bishops abbots noblemen and people william of malmsbury calls them senatum generalem and populi conventum the general senate and assembly of the people sometimes they are in short called clergy and people but all express the same power neither received from nor liitable by kings who are always said to be chosen or made and sometimes deposed by them william the norman found and left the nation in this condition henry the second john and henry the third who had nothing but what was conferred upon them by the same clergy and people did so too magna charta could give nothing to the people who in themselves had all and only reduced into a small volume the rights which the nation was resolved to maintain brought the king to confess they were perpetually inherent and time out of mind enjoyed and to swear that he would no way violate them if he did he was ipso facto excommunicated and being thereby declared to be an execrable perjured person they knew how to deal with him this act has bin confirmed by thirty parliaments and the proceedings with kings who have violated their oaths as well before as after the time of henry the third which have bin already mentioned are sufficient to show that england has always bin governed by it self and never acknowledged any other lord than such as they thought fit to set up  sect xxix the king was never master of the soil those who without regard to truth resolve to insist upon such points as they think may serve their designs when they find it cannot be denied that the powers before mentioned have bin exercised by the english and other nations say that they were the concessions of kings who being masters of the soil might bestow parcels upon some persons with such conditions as they pleased retaining to themselves the supreme dominion of the whole and having already as they think made them the fountains of honor they proceed to make them also the fountains of property and for proof of this alledg that all lands tho held of mean lords do by their tenures at last result upon the king as the head from whom they are enjoyed this might be of force if it were true but matters of the highest importance requiring a most evident proof we are to examine first if it be possible and in the next place if it be true    for the first no man can give what he has not whoever therefore will pretend that the king has bestowed this propriety must prove that he had it in himself i confess that the kings of spain and portugal obtained from the pope grants of the territorys they possessed in the westindys and this might be of some strength if the pope as vicar of christ had an absolute dominion over the whole earth but if that fail the whole falls to the ground and he is ridiculously liberal of that which no way belongs to him my business is not to dispute that point but before it can have any influence upon our affairs our kings are to prove that they are lords of england upon the same title or some other equivalent to it when that is done we shall know upon whom they have a dependence and may at leisure consider whether we ought to acknowledge and submit to such a power or give reasons for our resusal but there being no such thing in our present case their property must be grounded upon something else or we may justly conclude they have none  in order to this it is hardly worth the pains to search into the obscure remains of the british historys for when the romans deserted our island they did not confer the right they had whether more or less upon any man but left the enjoyment of it to the poor remainders of the nation and their own established colonys who were grown to be one people with the natives the saxons came under the conduct of hengist and horsa who seem to have bin sturdy pirates but did not that i can learn bear any characters in their persons of the so much admired sovereign majesty that should give them an absolute dominion or propriety either in their own country or any other they should set their feet upon they came with about a hundred men and choosing rather mat west flor hist to serve vortigern than to depend upon what they could get by rapine at sea lived upon a small proportion of land by him allotted to them tho this seems to be but a slender encouragement yet it was enough to invite many others to follow their example and fortune so that their number increasing the county of kent was given to them under the obligation of serving the britans in their wars not long after lands in northumberland were bestowed upon another company of them with the same condition this was all the title they had to what they enjoyed till they treacherously killed four hundred and sixty or as william of ibid malmsbury says three hundred principal men of the nobility and made vortigern prisoner who had bin so much their benefactor that he seems never to have deserved well but from them and to have incensed the britans by the favor he showed them as much as by the worst of his vices and certainly actions of this kind composed of falsehood and cruelty can never create a right in the opinion of any better men than filmer and his disciples who think that the power only is to be regarded and not the means by which it is obtained but tho it should be granted that a right had bin thus acquired it must accrue to the nation not to hengist and horsa if such an acquisition be called a conquest the benefit must belong to those that conquered this was not the work of two men and those who had bin free at home can never be thought to have left their own country to fight as slaves for the glory and profit of two men in another it cannot be said that their wants compelled them for their leaders suffered the same and could not be relieved but by their assistance and whether their enterprise was good or bad just or unjust it was the same to all no one man could have any right peculiar to himself unless they who gained it did confer it upon him and it is no way probable that they who in their own country had kept their princes within very narrow limits as has bin proved should resign themselves and all they had as soon as they came hither but we have already shown that they always continued most obstinate defenders of their liberty and the government to which they had bin accustomed that they managed it by themselves and acknowledged no other laws than their own nay if they had made such a resignation of their right as was necessary to create one in their leaders it would be enough to overthrow the proposition for it is not then the leader that gives to the people but the people to the leader if the people had not a right to give what they did give none was conferred upon the receiver if they had a right he that should pretend to derive a benefit from thence must prove the grant that the nature and intention of it may appear    to the second if it be said that records testify all grants to have bin originally from the king i answer that tho it were confessed which i absolutely deny and affirm that our rights and libertys are innate inherent and enjoyed time out of mind before we had kings it could be nothing to the question which is concerning reason and justice and if they are wanting the defect can never be supplied by any matter of fact tho never so clearly proved or if a right be pretended to be grounded upon a matter of fact the thing to be proved is that the people did really confer such a right upon the first or some other kings and if no such thing do appear the proceedings of one or more kings as if they had it can be of no value but in the present case no such grant is pretended to have bin made either to the first or to any of the following kings the right they had not their successors could not inherit and consequently cannot have it or at most no better title to it than that of usurpation  but as they who inquire for truth ought not to deny or conceal any thing i may grant that manors etc were enjoyed by tenure from kings but that will no way prejudice the cause i defend nor signify more than that the countries which the saxons had acquired were to be divided among them and to avoid the quarrels that might arise if every man took upon him to seize what he could a certain method of making the distribution was necessarily to be fixed and it was fit that every man should have something in his own hands to justify his title to what he possessed according to which controversys should be determined this must be testified by some body and no man could be so fit or of so much credit as he who was chief among them and this is no more than is usual in all the societys of the world the mayor of every corporation the speaker or clerk of the house of peers or house of commons the first president of every parliament or presidial in france the consul burgermaster advoyer or bailiff in every free town of holland germany or switzerland sign the public acts that pass in those places the dukes of venice and genoa do the like tho they have no other power than what is conferred upon them and of themselves can do little or nothing the grants of our kings are of the same nature tho the words mero motu nostro seem to imply the contrary for kings speak always in the plural number to show that they do not act for themselves but for the societys over which they are placed and all the veneration that is or can be given to their acts dos not exalt them but those from whom their authority is derived and for whom they are to execute the tyrants of the east and other barbarians whose power is most absolute speak in the single number as appears by the decrees of nabuchodonosor cyrus darius and ahasuerus recited in scripture with others that we hear of daily from those parts but wheresoever there is any thing of civility or regularity in government the prince uses the plural to show that he acts in a public capacity from hence says grotius the rights of kings to send ambassadors make leagues etc do arise the confederacys made by them do not terminate with their lives because they are not for themselves they speak not in their own persons but as representing their people and rex regno exutus jus legandi amittit grot de jur bell a king who is deprived of his kingdom loses the right of sending ambassadors because he can no longer speak for those who by their own consent or by a foreign force are cut off from him the question is not whether such a one be justly or unjustly deprived for that concerns only those who do it or suffer it but whether he can oblige the people and it is ridiculous for any nation to treat with a man that cannot perform what shall be agreed or for him to stipulate that which can oblige and will be made good only by himself  but tho much may be left to the discretion of kings in the distribution of lands and the like yet it no way diminishes the right of the people nor confers any upon them otherwise to dispose of what belongs to the public than may tend to the common good and the accomplishment of those ends for which they are entrusted nay if it were true that a conquered country did belong to the crown the king could not dispose of it because it is annexed to the office add not alienable by the person this is not only found in regular mixed monarchys as in sweden where the grants made by the last kings have bin lately rescinded by the general assembly of estates as contrary to law but even in the most absolute as in france where the present king who has stretched his power to the utmost has lately acknowledged that he cannot do it and according to the known maxim of the state that the demeasnes of the crown which are designed for the defraying of public charges cannot be alienated all the grants made within the last fifteen years have bin annuld even those who had bought lands of the crown have bin called to account and the sums given being compared with the profits received and a moderate interest allowed to the purchasers so much of the principal as remained due to them has bin repaid and the lands resumed  sect xxx henry the first was king of england by as good a title as any of his predecessors or successors having made it appear as i suppose that the ancient nobility of england was composed of such men as had bin ennobld by bearing arms in the defense or enlargement of the commonwealth that the dukes earls etc were those who commanded them that they and their dependents received lands for such services under an obligation of continuing to render the like and according to their several degrees and proportions to provide and maintain horses arms and men for the same uses it cannot be denied that they were such gentlemen and lords of manors as we now call commoners together with the freeholders and such as in war were found most able to be their leaders of these the micklegemots wittenagemots and other public assemblys did consist and nothing can be more absurd than to assign the names and rights of duke earl and vicount which were names of offices to those who have not the offices and are no way fit for them if our author therefore had said that such as these who had always composed the great councils of our nation had in favor of henry the first bestowed the crown upon him as they had done upon his father and brother i should agree with him but it is the utmost extravagance to say that he who had neither title nor possession should give the power to those who had always bin in the possession of it and exercised it in giving to him whatsoever he had but i most wonder he should so far forget himself to call this henry a usurper and detract from the validity of his acts because he had no title whereas there neither is was or can be a usurper if there be any truth in his doctrine for he plainly tells us we are only to look to the power and not at all to the means and ways by which it is obtained and making no difference between a king and a tyrant enjoins an equal submission to the commands of both if this were only a slip of his pen and he did really take this henry to be a usurper because he had not a good title i should desire to know the marks by which a lawful king is distinguished from an usurper and in what a just title dos consist if he place it in an hereditary succession we ought to be informed whether this right must be deduced from one universal lord of mankind or from a particular lord of every people if from the universal lord the same descent that gives him a right to the dominion of any one country enslaves the whole world to him if from the particular lord of one place proof must be given how he came to be so for if there was a defect in the first it can never be repaired and the possession is no more than a continued usurpation but having already proved the absurdity of any pretense to either i shall forbear the repetition and only say that if the course of succession may never be justly interrupted the family of meroveus could not have had any right to the crown of france pepin was a usurper if it must for ever have continued in the descendents of meroveus and hugh capet could have no title if the race of pepin might not be dispossessed i leave our author to dispute this point with the king of france and when he has so far convinced him thathe is a usurper as to persuade him to resign his crown to the house of austria claiming from pharamond or to that of lorrain as descended from pepin i can give him half a dozen more knots which will not be with less difficulty untied and which instead of establishing the titles of such kings as are known to us will overthrow them all unless a right be given to usurpation or the consent of a people do confer it  but if there be such a thing as a usurper and a rule by which men may judge of usurpation it is not only lawful but necessary to examine the titles of such as go under the name of kings that we may know whether they are truly so or not lest through ignorance we chance to give the veneration and obedience that is due to a king to one who is not a king and deny it to him who by an uninterruptible line of descent is our natural lord and thereby prefer the worst of men and our most bitter enemy before the person we ought to look upon as our father and if this prove dangerous to one or more kings it is our authors fault not mine  if there be no usurper nor rule of distinguishing him from a lawful prince filmer is the worst of all triflers and impostors who grounds his arguments in the most serious matters upon what he esteems to be false but the truth is he seems to have set himself against humanity and common sense as much as against law and virtue and if he who so frequently contradicts himself can be said to mean any thing he would authorize rapine and murder and persuade us to account those to be rightful kings who by treachery and other unjust means overthrow the right of descent which he pretends to esteem sacred as well as the libertys of nations which by better judges are thought to be so and gives the odious name of usurpation to the advancement of one who is made king by the consent of a willing people  but if henry the first were a usurper i desire to know whether the same name belongs to all our kings or which of them deserves a better that we may understand whose acts ought to be reputed legal and to whose descent we owe veneration or whether we are wholly exempted from all for i cannot see a possibility of fixing the guilt of usurpation upon henry the first without involving many if not all our kings in the same  if his title was not good because his brother robert was still living that of rufus is by the same reason overthrown and william their father being a bastard could have none this fundamental defect could never be repaired sor the successors could inherit no more than the right of the first which was nothing stephen could deduce no title either from norman or saxon whatsoever henry the second pretended must be from his mother maud and any other might have bin preserd before her as well as he if her title was from the normans it must be void since they had none and the story of edgar atheling is too impertinent to deserve mention but however it could be of no advantage to her for david king of scotland brother to her mother from whom only her title could be derived was then alive with his son henry who dying not long after left three sons and three daughters whose posterity being distributed into many familys of scotland remains to this day and if proximity of blood is to be considered ought always to have bin preferred before her and her descendents unless there be a law that gives the preference to daughters before sons what right soever henry the second had it must necessarily have perished with him all his children having bin begotten in manifest adultery on eleanor of gascony during the life of lewis king of france her first husband and nothing could be alleged to color the business but a dispensation from the pope directly against the law of god and the words of our savior who says that a wife cannot be put away unless for adultery and he that marrys her that is put away commits adultery the pollution of this spring is not to be cured but tho it should pass unregarded no one part of the succession since that time has remained entire john was preferred before arthur his elder brothers son edward the third was made king by the deposition of his father henry the fourth by that of richard the second if the house of mortimer or york had the right henry the   th   th and   th were not kings and all who claim under them have no title however richard the third could have none for the children of his elder brother the duke of clarence were then living the children of edward the fourth may be suspected of bastardy and tho it may have bin otherwise yet that matter is not so clear as things of such importance ought to be and the consequence may reach very far but tho that scruple were removed it is certain that henry the seventh was not king in the right of his wife elizabeth for he reigned before and after her and for his other titles we mem de commin may believe philip de commines who says he had neither cross nor pile if henry the eighth had a right in himself or from his mother he should have reigned immediately after her death which he never pretended nor to succeed till his father was dead thereby acknowledging he had no right but from him unless the parliament and people can give it the like may be said of his children mary could have no title if she was a bastard begotten in incest but if her mothers marriage was good and she legitimate elizabeth could have none  yet all these were lawful kings and queens their acts continue in force to this day to all intents and purposes the parliament and people made them to be so when they had no other title the parliament and people therefore have the power of making kings those who are so made are not usurpers we have had none but such for more than seven hundred years they were therefore lawful kings or this nation has had none in all that time and if our author like this conclusion the account from whence it is drawn may without difficulty be carried as high as our english historys do reach  this being built upon the steady foundation of law history and reason is not to be removed by any mans opinion especially by one accompanied with such circumstances as sir walter raleigh was in during the last years of his life and there is something of baseness as well as prevarication in turning the words of an eminent person reduced to great difficultys to a sense no way agreeing with his former actions or writings and no less tending to impair his reputation than to deceive others our author is highly guilty of both in citing sir walter raleigh to invalidate the great charter of our libertys as begun by usurpation and showed to the world by rebellion whereas no such thing nor any thing like it in word or principle can be found in the works that deserve to go under his name the dialogue in question with some other small pieces published after his death deserve to be esteemed spurious or if from a desire of life when he knew his head lay under the ax he was brought to say things no way agreeing with what he had formerly professed they ought rather to be buried in oblivion than produced to blemish his memory but that the public cause may not suffer by his fault it is convenient the world should be informed that tho he was a wellqualifyd gentleman yet his morals were no way exact as appears by his dealings with the brave earl of essex and he was so well assisted in his history of the world that an ordinary man with the same helps might have performed the same things neither ought it to be accounted strange if that which he writ by himself had the tincture of another spirit when he was deprived of that assistance tho his life had not depended upon the will of the prince and he had never said that see si w raleighs epistle to king james the bond of subjects to their kings should always be wrought out of iron and those of kings to their subjects out of cobwebs  sect xxxi free nations have a right of meeting when and where they please unless they deprive themselves of it a perverted judgment always leads men into a wrong way and persuades them to believe that those things favor their cause that utterly overthrow it for a proof of this i desire our authors words may be considered in the former parliaments says he instituted and continued since henry the first his time is not to be found the usage of any natural liberty of the people for all those libertys that are claimed in parliament are libertys of grace from the king and not the libertys of nature to the people for if the liberty were natural it would give power to the multitude to assemble themselves when and where they pleased to bestow the sovereignty and by pactions to limit and direct the exercise of it and i say that nations being naturally free may meet when and where they please may dispose of the sovereignty and may direct or limit the exercise of it unless by their own act they have deprived themselves of that right and there could never have bin a lawful assembly of any people in the world if they had not had that power in themselves it was proved in the preceding section that all our kings having no title were no more than what the nobility and people made them to be that they could have no power but what was given to them and could confer none except what they had received if they can therefore call parliaments the power of calling them must have bin given to them and could not be given by any who had it not in themselves the israelites met together and chose ehud gideon sampson jephtha and others to be their leaders whom they judged fit to deliver them from their enemies by the same right they assembled at mispeth to make war against the tribe of benjamin when justice was denied to be done against those who had villanously abused the levites concubine in the like manner they would have made gideon king but he refused in the same place they met and chose saul to be their king he being dead the men of judah assembled themselves and anointed david not long after all the tribes met at hebron made a contract with him and received him as their king in the same manner tho by worse counsel they made absalom king and the like was attempted in favor of sheba the son of bichri tho they then had a king chosen by themselves when they found themselves oppressed by the tributes that had bin laid upon them by solomon they met at shechem and being displeased with rehoboams answer to their complaints ten of the tribes made jeroboam king jehu and all the other kings of israel whether good or bad had no other title than was conferred upon them by the prevailing part of the people which could not have given them any unless they had met together nor meet together without the consent and against the will of those that reigned unless the power had bin in themselves  where governments are more exactly regulated the power of judging when it is fit to call the senate or people together is referred to one or more magistrates as in rome to the consuls or tribuns in athens to the archons and in thebes to the beotarches but none of them could have these powers unless they had bin given by those who advanced them to the magistracys to which they were annexed nor could they have bin so annexed if those who created them had not had the right in themselves if they officers neglected their duty of calling such assemblys when the public affairs required the people met by their own authority and punished the person or abrogated the magistracy as appears in the case of the decemviri and many others that might be alleged if the thing were not so plain as to need no further proof the reason of this is that they who institute a magistracy best know whether the end of the institution be rightly pursued or not and all just magistracys being the same in essence tho differing in form the same right must perpetually belong to those who put the sovereign power into the hands of one a few or many men which is what our author calls the disposal of the sovereignty thus the romans did when they created kings consuls military tribuns dictators or decemviri and it had bin most ridiculous to say that those officers gave authority to the people to meet and choose them for they who are chosen are the creatures of those who choose and are nothing more than others till they are chosen the last king of sweden charles gustavus told a gentleman who was ambassador there that the swedes having made him king when he was poor and had nothing in the world he had but one work to do which was so to reign that they might never repent the good opinion they had conceived of him they might therefore meet and did meet to conser the sovereignty upon him or he could never have had it for tho the kingdom be hereditary to males or females and his mother was sister to the great gustavus yet having married a stranger without the consent of the estates she performed not the condition upon which women are admitted to the succession and thereby falling from her right he pretended not to any the act of his election declares he had none and gives the crown to him and the heirs of his body with this farther declaration that the benefit of his election should no way extend to his brother prince adolphus and it is confessed by all the swedish nation that if the king now reigning should die without children the estates would proceed to a new election  it is rightly observed by our author that if the people might meet and give the sovereign power they might also direct and limit it for they did meet in this and other countries they did confer the sovereign power they did limit and direct the exercise and the laws of each people show in what manner and measure it is every where done this is as certain in relation to kings as any other magistrates the commission of the roman dictators was to take care ne quid detrimenti respublica accipiat t live that the commonwealth might receive no detriment the same was sometimes given to the consuls king offas confession that he was made king in vestrae libertatis tuitionem mat par to preserve the public liberty expresses the same thing and charles gustavus who said he had no other work than to govern in such a manner that they who had made him king might not repent showed there was a rule which he stood obliged to follow and an end which he was to procure that he might merit and preserve their good opinion this power of conferring the sovereignty was exercised in france by those who made meroveus king in the prejudice of the two grandchildren of pharamond sons to clodion by those who excluded his race and gave the crown to pepin by those who deposed lewis le debonair and charles le gross by those who brought in five kings that were either bastards or strangers between him and charles le simple by those who rejected his race and advanced hugh capet by those who made henry the first king to the prejudice of robert his elder brother and continued the crown in the race of henry for ten generations whilst the descendents of robert were only dukes of burgundy the like was done in castille and arragon by frequently preferring the younger before the elder brother the descendents of females before those of the maleline in the same degree the more remote in blood before the nearest and sometimes bastards before the legitimate issue the same was done in england in relation to every king since the coming in of the normans as i showed in the last section and other places of this work  that they who gave the sovereignty might also circumscribe and direct it is manifest by the several ways of providing for the succession instituted by several nations some are merely elective as the empire of germany and the kingdom of poland to this day the kingdom of denmark till the year    0 that of sweden till the time of gustavus ericson who delivered that nation from the oppression of christern ii the cruel king of the danes in others the election was confined to one or more familys as the kingdom of the goths in spain to the balthei and amalthei in some the eldest man of the reigning family was preferred before the nearest as in scotland before the time of kennethus in other places the nearest in blood is preferred before the elder if more remote in some no regard is had to females or their descendents as in france and turkey in others they or their descendents are admitted either simply as well as males or under a condition of marrying in the country or with the consent of the estates as in sweden and no other reason can be given for this almost infinite variety of constitutions than that they who made them would have it so which could not be if god and nature had appointed one general rule for all nations for in that case the kingdom of france must be elective as well as that of poland and the empire or the empire and poland hereditary as that of france daughters must succeed in france as well as in england or be excluded in england as in france and he that would establish one as the ordinance of god and nature must of necessity overthrow all the rest  a farther exercise of the natural liberty of nations is discovered in the de jur bell and pac several limitations put upon the sovereign power some kings says grotius have the summum imperium summo modo others modo non summo and amongst those that are under limitations the degrees as to more or less are almost infinite as i have proved already by the example of arragon ancient germany the saxon kings the normans the kings of castille the present empire with diverse others and i may safely say that the ancient government of france was much of the same nature to the time of charles the   th and lewis the    th but the work of emancipating themselves as they call it begun by them is now brought to perfection in a boundless elevation of the kings greatness and riches to the unspeakable misery of the people  twere a folly to think this variety proceeds from the concessions of kings who naturally delight in power and hate that which crosses their will it might with more reason be imagined that the roman consuls who were brought up in liberty who had contracted a love to their country and were contented to live upon an equal foot with their fellow citizens should confine the power of their magistracy to a year or that the dukes of venice should be graciously pleased to give power to the council of ten to punish them capitally if they transgrest the laws than that kings should put such fetters upon their power which they so much abhor or that they would suffer them if they could be easily broken if any one of them should prove so moderate like trajan to command the prefect of the pretorian guard to use the sword for him if he governed well and against him if he did not it would soon be rescinded by his successor the law which has no other strength than the act of one man may be annuld by another so that nothing dos more certainly prove that the laws made in several countries to restrain the power of kings and variously to dispose of the succession are not from them than the frequent examples of their fury who have exposed themselves to the greatest dangers and brought infinite miserys upon the people through the desire of breaking them it must therefore be concluded that nations have power of meeting together and of conferring limiting and directing the sovereignty or all must be grounded upon most manifest injustice and usurpation  no man can have a power over a nation otherwise than de jure or de facto he who pretends to have a power de jure must prove that it is originally inherent in him or his predecessor from whom he inherits or that it was justly acquired by him the vanity of any pretense to an original right appears sufficiently i hope from the proofs already given that the first fathers of mankind had it not or if they had no man could now inherit the same there being no man able to make good the genealogy that should give him a right to the succession besides the facility we have of proving the beginnings of all the familys that reign among us makes it as absurd for any of them to pretend a perpetual right to dominion as for any citizen of london whose parents and birth we know to say he is the very man noah who lived in the time of the flood and is now four or five thousand years old  if the power were conferred on him or his predecessors it is what we ask for the collation can be of no value unless made by those who had a right to do it and the original right by descent failing no one can have any over a free people but themselves or those to whom they have given it  if acquisition be pretended it is the same thing for there can be no right to that which is acquired unless the right of invading be proved and that being done nothing can be acquired except what belonged to the person that was invaded and that only by him who had the right of invading no man ever did or could conquer a nation by his own strength no man therefore could ever acquire a personal right over any and if it was conferred upon him by those who made the conquest with him they were the people that did it he can no more be said to have the right originally in and from himself than a magistrate of rome or athens immediately after his creation and having no other at the beginning he can have none to eternity for the nature of it must refer to the original and cannot be changed by time  whatsoever therefore proceeds not from the consent of the people must be de facto only that is void of all right and it is impossible there should not be a right of destroying that which is grounded upon none and by the same rule that one man enjoys what he gained by violence another may take it from him cyrus overthrew the assyrians and babylonians alexander the medes and persians and if they had no right of making war upon those nations the nations could not but have a right of recovering all that had bin unjustly taken from them and avenging the evils they had suffered if the cause of the war was originally just and not corrupted by an intemperate use of the victory the conquered people was perhaps obliged to be quiet but the conquering armies that conferred upon their generals what they had taken from their enemies might as justly expect an account of what they had given and that it should be employed according to the intention of the givers as the people of any city might do from their regularly created magistrates because it was as impossible for cyrus alexander or caesar to gain a power over the armies they led without their consent as for pericles valerius or any other disarmed citizen to gain more power in their respective citys than was voluntarily conferred upon them and i know no other difference between kingdoms so constituted by conquering armies and such as are established in the most orderly manner than that the first usually incline more to war the latter to justice and peace but there have not bin wanting many of the first sort especially the nations coming from the north who were no less exact in ordaining that which tended to the preservation of liberty nor less severe in seeing it punctually performed than the most regular commonwealths that ever were in the world and it can with no more reason be pretended that the goths received their privileges from alan or theodoric the francs from pharamond or meroveus and the english from ina or ethelred than that the liberty of athens was the gift of themistocles or pericles that the empire of rome proceeded from the liberality of brutus or valerius and that the commonwealth of venice at this day subsists by the favor of the contarini or moresini which must reduce us to matter of right since that of fact void of right can signify nothing  sect xxxii the powers of kings are so various according to the constitutions of several states that no consequence can be drawn to the prejudice or advantage of any one merely from the name in opposition to what is above said some alledg the name of king as if there were a charm in the word and our author seems to put more weight upon it than in the reasons he brings to support his cause but that we may see there is no efficacy in it and that it conveys no other right than what particular nations may annex to it we are to consider    that the most absolute princes that are or have bin in the world never had the name of king whereas it has bin frequently given to those whose powers have bin very much restrained the cesars were never called kings till the sixth age of christianity the califs and sultan of egypt and babylon the great turk the cham of tartary or the great mogol never took that name nor any other of the same signification the czar of moscovy has it not tho he is as absolute a monarch and his people as miserable slaves as any in the world on the other side the chief magistrates of rome and athens for some time those of sparta arragon sweden denmark and england who could do nothing but by law have bin called kings this may be enough to show that a name being no way essential what title soever is given to the chief magistrate he can have no other power than the laws and customs of his country do give or the people confer upon him    the names of magistrates are often changed tho the power continue to be the same and the powers are sometimes altered tho the name remain when octavius caesar by the force of a mad corrupted soldiery had overthrown all law and right he took no other title in relation to military affairs than that of imperator which in the time of liberty was by the armies often given to pretors and consuls in civil matters he was as he pretended  unitia potestate contentus c it content with the power of tribun and the like was observed in his successor who to new invented usurpations gave old and approved names on the other side those titles which have bin rendered odious and execrable by the violent exercise of an absolute power are sometimes made popular by moderate limitations as in germany where tho the monarchy seem to be as well tempered as any the princes retain the same names of imperator caesar and augustus as those had done who by the excess of their rage and fury had desolated and corrupted the best part of the world  sometimes the name is changed tho the power in all respects continue savedra mrna  the same the lords of castille had for many ages no other title than that of count and when the nobility and people thought good they changed it to that of king without any addition to the power  the sovereign magistrate in poland was called duke till within the last two hundred years when they gave the title of king to one of the jagellan family which title has continued to this day tho without any change in the nature of the magistracy and i presume no wise man will think that if the venetians should give the name of king to their duke it could confer any other power upon him than he has already unless more should be conferred by the authority of the great council    the same names which in some places denote the supreme magistracy in others are subordinate or merely titular in england france and spain dukes and earls are subjects in germany the electors and some princes who are called by those names are little less than sovereigns and the dukes of savoy tuscany moscovy and others acknowledge no superior as well as those of poland and castille had none when they went under those titles the same may be said of kings some are subject to a foreign power as diverse of them were subject to the persian and babylonian monarchs who for that reason were called the kings of kings some also are tributarys and when the spaniards first landed in america the great kings of mexico and peru had many others under them threescore and ten kings gathered up meat under the table of adonibezek the romans had many kings depending upon them herod and those of his race were of this number and the dispute between him and his sons aristobulus and alexander was to be determined by them neither durst he decide the matter till it was referred to him but a right of appeal did still remain as appears by the case of st paul when agrippa was king the kings of mauritania from the time of massinissa were under the like dependence jugurtha went to rome to justify himself for the death of micipsa juba was commanded by the roman magistrates scipio petreius and afranius another juba was made king of the same country by augustus and tiridates of armenia by nero and infinite examples of this nature may be alleged moreover their powers are variously regulated according to the variety of tempers in nations and ages some have restrained the powers that by experience were found to be exorbitant others have dissolved the bonds that were laid upon them and laws relating to the institution abrogation enlargement or restriction of the regal power would be utterly insignificant if this could not be done but such laws are of no effect in any other country than where they are made the lives of the spartans did not depend upon the will of agesilaus or leonidas because nabuchodonosor could kill or save whom he pleased and tho the king of marocco may stab his subjects throw them to the lions or hang them upon tenterhooks yet a king of poland would probably be called to a severe account if he should unjustly kill a single man  sect xxxiii the liberty of a people is the gift of god and nature if any man ask how nations come to have the power of doing these things i answer that liberty being only an exemption from the dominion of another the question ought not to be how a nation can come to be free but how a man comes to have a dominion over it for till the right of dominion be proved and justified liberty subsists as arising from the nature and being of a man tertullian speaking of the emperors says ab eo imperium a quo spiritus and we taking man in his first condition may justly say ab eo libertas a quo spiritus for no man can owe more than he has received the creature having nothing and being nothing but what the creator makes him must owe all to him and nothing to any one from whom he has received nothing man therefore must be naturally free unless he be created by another power than we have yet heard of the obedience due to parents arises from hence in that they are the instruments of our generation and we are instructed by the light of reason that we ought to make great returns to those from whom under god we have received all when they die we are their heirs we enjoy the same rights and devolve the same to our posterity god only who confers this right upon us can deprive us of it and we can no way understand he dos so unless he had so declared by express revelation or had set some distinguishing marks of dominion and subjection upon men and as an ingenious person not long since said caused some to be born with crowns on their heads and all others with saddles upon their backs this liberty therefore must continue till it be either forfeited or willingly resigned the forfeiture is hardly comprehensible in a multitude that is not entered into any society for as they are all equal and par in parem non habet imperium equals can have no right over each other no man can forfeit any thing to one who can justly demand nothing unless it may be by a personal injury which is nothing to this case because where there is no society one man is not bound by the actions of another all cannot join in the same act because they are joined in none or if they should no man could recover much less transmit the forfeiture and not being transmitted it perishes as if it had never bin and no man can claim any thing from it  twill be no less difficult to bring resignation to be subservient to our authors purpose for men could not resign their liberty unless they naturally had it in themselves resignation is a public declaration of their assent to be governed by the person to whom they resign that is they do by that act constitute him to be their governor this necessarily puts us upon the inquiry why they do resign how they will be governed and proves the governor to be their creature and the right of disposing the government must be in them or they who receive it can have none this is so evident to common sense that it were impertinent to ask who made carthage athens rome or venice to be free citys their charters were not from men but from god and nature when a number of phenicians had found a port on the coast of africa they might perhaps agree with the inhabitants for a parcel of ground but they brought their liberty with them when a company of latins sabins and tuscans met together upon the banks of the tiber and chose rather to build a city for themselves than to live in such as were adjacent they carried their liberty in their own breasts and had hands and swords to defend it this was their charter and romulus could confer no more upon them than dido upon the carthaginians when a multitude of barbarous nations infested italy and no protection could be expected from the corrupted and perishing empire such as agreed to seek a place of refuge in the scattered islands of the adriatic gulf had no need of any mans authority to ratify the institution of their government they who were the formal part of the city and had built the material could not but have a right of governing as they pleased since if they did amiss the hurt was only to themselves it is probable enough that some of the roman emperors as lords of the soil might have pretended to a dominion over them if there had bin any color for it but nothing of that kind appearing in thirteen hundred years we are not like to hear of any such cavils it is agreed by mankind that subjection and protection are relative and that he who cannot protect those that are under him in vain pretends to a dominion over them the only ends for which governments are constituted and obedience rendered to them are the obtaining of justice and protection and they who cannot provide for both give the people a right of taking such ways as best please themselves in order to their own safety  the matter is yet more clear in relation to those who never were in any society as at the beginning or renovation of the world after the flood or who upon the dissolution of the societys to which they did once belong or by some other accident have bin obliged to seek new habitations such were those who went from babylon upon the confusion of tongues those who escaped from troy when it was burnt by the grecians almost all the nations of europe with many of asia and africa upon the dissolution of the roman empire to which may be added a multitude of northern nations who when they had increased to such numbers that their countries could no longer nourish them or because they wanted skill to improve their lands were sent out to provide for themselves and having done so did erect many kingdoms and states either by themselves or in union and coalition with the ancient inhabitants  it is in vain to say that wheresoever they came the land did belong to some body and that they who came to dwell there must be subject to the laws of those who were lords of the soil for that is not always true in fact some come into desert countries that have no lord others into such as are thinly peopled by men who knowing not how to improve their land do either grant part of it upon easy terms to the new comers or grow into a union with them in the enjoyment of the whole and historys furnish us with infinite examples of this nature  if we will look into our own original without troubling our selves with the senseless storys of samothes the son of japhet and his magicians or the giants begotten by spirits upon the thirty daughters of danaus sent from phenicia in a boat without sails oars or rudder we shall find that when the romans abandoned this island the inhabitants were left to a full liberty of providing for themselves and whether we deduce our original from them or the saxons or from both our ancestors were perfectly free and the normans having inherited the same right when they came to be one nation with the former we cannot but continue so still unless we have enslaved our selves  nothing is more contrary to reason than to imagine this when the fierce barbarity of the saxons came to be softened by a more gentle climat the arts and religion they learnt taught them to reform their manners and better enabled them to frame laws for the preservation of their liberty but no way dimishd their love to it and tho the normans might desire to get the laads of those who had joined with harold and of others into their hands yet when they were settled in the country and by marriages united to the ancient inhabitants they became true englishmen and no less lovers of liberty and resolute defenders of it than the saxons had bin there was then neither conquering norman nor conquered saxon but a great and brave people composed of both united in blood and interest in the defense of their common rights which they so well maintained that no prince since that time has too violently encroachd upon them who as the reward of his folly has not lived miserably and died shamefully  such actions of our ancestors do not as i suppose savor much of the submission which patrimonial slaves do usually render to the will of their lord on the contrary whatsoever they did was by a power inherent in themselves to defend that liberty in which they were born all their kings were created upon the same condition and for the same ends alfred acknowledged he found and left them perfectly free and the confession of offa that they had not made him king for his own merits but for the defense of their liberty comprehends all that were before and after him they well knew how great the honor was to be made head of a great people and rigorously exacted the performance of the ends for which such a one was elevated severely punishing those who basely and wickedly betrayed the trust reposed in them and violated all that is most sacred among men which could not have bin unless they were naturally free for the liberty that has no being cannot be defended  sect xxxiv no veneration paid or honor conferred upon a just and lawful magistrate can diminish the liberty of a nation some have supposed that tho the people be naturally free and magistrates created by them they do by such creations deprive themselves of that natural liberty and that the names of king sovereign lord and dread sovereign being no way consistent with liberty they who give such titles do renounce it our author carrys this very far and lays great weight upon the submissive language used by the people when they humbly crave that his majesty would be pleased to grant their accustomed freedom of speech and access to his person and give the name of supplications and petitions to the addresses made to him whereas he answers in the haughty language of le roy le veut le roy savisera and the like but they who talk at this rate show that they neither understand the nature of magistracy nor the practice of nations those who have lived in the highest exercise of their liberty and have bin most tenacious of it have thought no honor too great for such magistrates as were eminent in the defense of their rights and set up for that end the name of dread sovereign might justly have bin given to a roman dictator or consul for they had the sovereign authority in their hands and power sufficient for its execution whilst their magistracy continued they were a terror to the same men whose axes and rods had bin a terror to them the year or month before and might be so again the next the romans thought they could not be guilty of excess in carrying the power and veneration due to their dictator to the highest and livy tells us that his edictum dictatoris pro numine observatum hist l   edicts were esteemed sacred i have already shown that this haughty people who might have commanded condescended to join with their tribuns in a petition to the dictator papirius for the life of quintus fabius who had fought a battle in his absence and without his order tho he had gained a great and memorable victory the same fabius when consul was commended by his father q fabius maximus for obliging him by his lictors to dismount from his horse and to pay him the same respect that was due from others the tribuns of the people who were instituted for the preservation of liberty were also esteemed sacred and inviolable as appears by that phrase sacrosancta tribunorum potestas so common in their ancient writers no man i presume thinks any monarchy more limited or more clearly derived from a delegated power than that of the german emperors and yet sacra caesarea majestas is the public style nay the hollanders at this day call their burgermasters tho they see them selling herring or tar high and mighty lords as soon as they are advanced to be of the       or    magistrates of a small town it is no wonder therefore if a great nation should think it conducing to their own glory to give magnificent titles and use submissive language to that one man whom they set up to be their head most especially if we consider that they came from a country where such titles and languages were principally invented  among the romans and grecians we hear nothing of majesty highness serenity and excellence appropriated to a single person but receive them from germany and other northern countries we find majestas populi romani and majestas imperii in their best authors but no man speaking to julius or augustus or even to the vaniest of their successors ever used those empty titles nor took upon themselves the name of servants as we do to every fellow we meet in the streets when such ways of speaking are once introduced they must needs swell to a more than ordinary height in all transactions with princes most of them naturally delight in vanity and courtiers never speak more truth than when they most extol their masters and assume to themselves the names that best express the most abject slavery these being brought into mode like all ill customs increase by use and then no man can omit them without bringing that danger and hatred upon himself which few will undergo except for something that is evidently of great importance matters of ceremony and title at the first seem not to be so and being for some time neglected they acquire such strength as not to be easily removed from private usage they pass into public acts and those flatterers who gave a beginning to them proposing them in public councils where too many of that sort have always insinuated themselves gain credit enough to make them pass this work was farther advanced by the church of rome according to their custom of favoring that most which is most vain and corrupt and it has bin usual with the popes and their adherents liberally to gratify princes for services rendered to the church with titles that tended only to the prejudice of the people these poisonous plants having taken root grew up so fast that the titles which within the space of a hundred years were thought sufficient for the kings and queens of england have of late bin given to monk and his honorable duchess new phrases have bin invented to please princes or the sense of the old perverted as has happened to that of le roy s avisera and that which was no more than a liberty to consult with the lords upon a bill presented by the commons is by some men now taken sor a right inherent in the king of denying such bills as may be offered to him by the lords and commons tho the coronation oath obliges him to hold keep and defend the just laws and customs quas vulgus elegerit and if a stop be not put to this exorbitant abuse the words still remaining in acts of parliament which show that their acts are our laws may perhaps be also abolished  but tho this should come to pass by the slackness of the lords and commons it could neither create a new right in the king nor diminish that of the people but it might give a better color to those who are enemies to their country to render the power of the crown arbitrary than any thing that is yet among us  sect xxxv the authority given by our law to the acts performed by a king de facto detract nothing from the peoples right of creating whom they please they who have more regard to the prevailing power than to right and lay great weight upon the statute of henry the seventh which authorizes the acts of a king de facto seem not to consider that thereby they destroy all the pretended right of inheritance that he only is king de facto who is received by the people and that this reception could neither be of any value in it felf nor be made valid by a statute unless the people and their representatives who make the statute had in themselves the power of receiving authorizing and creating whom they please for he is not king de facto who calls himself so as perkin or simnel but he who by the consent of the nation is possessed of the regal power if there were such a thing in nature as a natural lord over every country and that the right must go by descent it would be impossible for any other man to acquire it or for the people to confer it upon him and to give the authority to the acts of one who neither is nor can be a king which belongs only to him who has the right inherent in himself and inseparable from him neither can it be denied that the same power which gives the validity to such acts as are performed by one who is not a king that belongs to those of a true king may also make him king for the essence of a king consists in the validity of his acts and it is equally absurd for one to pretend to be a king whose acts as king are not valid as that his own can be valid if those of another are for then the same indivisible right which our author and those of his principles assert to be inseparable from the person would be at the same time exercised and enjoyed by two distinct and contrary powers  moreover it may be observed that this statute was made after frequent and bloody wars concerning titles to the crown and whether the cause were good or bad those who were overcome were not only subject to be killed in the field but afterward to be prosecuted as traitors under the color of law he who gained the victory was always set up to be king by those of his party and he never failed to proceed against his enemies as rebels this introduced a horrid series of the most destructive mischiefs the fortune of war varied often and i think it may be said that there were few if any great familys in england that were not either destroyed or at least so far shaken as to lose their chiefs and many considerable branches of them and experience taught that instead of gaining any advantage to the public in point of government he for whom they fought seldom proved better than his enemy they saw that the like might again happen tho the title of the reigning king should be as clear as descent of blood could make it this brought things into an uneasy posture and it is not strange that both the nobility and commonalty should be weary of it no law could prevent the dangers of battle for he that had followers and would venture himself might bring them to such a decision as was only in the hand of god but thinking no more could justly be required to the full performance of their duty to the king than to expose themselves to the hazard of battle for him and not being answerable for the success they would not have that law which they endeavored to support turned to their destruction by their enemies who might come to be the interpreters of it but as they could be exempted from this danger only by their own laws which could authorize the acts of a king without a title and justify them for acting under him it is evident that the power of the law was in their hands and that the acts of the person who enjoyed the crown were of no value in themselves the law had bin impertinent if it could have bin done without law and the intervention of the parliament useless if the kings de facto could have given authority to their own acts but if the parliament could make that to have the effect of law which was not law and exempt those that acted according to it from the penaltys of the law and give the same force to the acts of one who is not king as of one who is they cannot but have a power of making him to be king who is not so that is to say all depends entirely upon their authority  besides he is not king who assumes the title to himself or is set up by a corrupt party but he who according to the usages required in the case is made king if these are wanting he is neither de facto nor de jure but tyrannus sine titulo nevertheless this very man if he comes to be received by the people and placed in the throne he is thereby made king de facto his acts are valid in law the same service is due to him as to any other they who render it are in the same manner protected by the law that is to say he is truly king if our author therefore do allow such to be kings he must confess that power to be good which makes them so when they have no right in themselves if he deny it he must not only deny that there is any such thing as a king de facto which the statute acknowledges but that we ever had any king in england for we never had any other than such as i have proved before  by the same means he will so unravel all the law that no man shall know what he has or what he ought to do or avoid and will find no remedy for this unless he allow that laws made without kings are as good as those made with them which returns to my purpose for they who have the power of making laws may by law make a king as well as any other magistrate and indeed the intention of this statute could be no other than to secure mens persons and possessions and so far to declare the power of giving and taking away the crown to be in the parliament as to remove all disputes concerning titles and to make him to be a legal king whom they acknowledge to be king  sect xxxvi the general revolt of a nation cannot be called a rebellion as impostors seldom make lies to pass in the world without putting false names upon things such as our author endeavor to persuade the people they ought not to defend their libertys by giving the name of rebellion to the most just and honorable actions that have bin performed fer the preservation of them and to aggravate the matter tell us that rebellion is like the sin of witchcraft but those who seek after truth will easily find that there can be no such thing in the world as the rebellion of a nation against its own magistrates and that rebellion is not always evil that this may appear it will not be amiss to consider the word as well as the thing commonly understood by it as it is used in an evil sense  the word is taken from the latin rebellare which signifys no more than to renew a war when a town or province had bin subdued by the romans and brought under their dominion if they violated their faith after the settlement of peace and invaded their masters who had spared them they were said to rebel but it had bin more absurd to apply that word to the people that rose against the decemviri kings or other magistrates than to the parthians or any of those nations who had no dependence upon them for all the circumstances that should make a rebellion were wanting the word implying a superiority in them against whom it is as well as the breach of an established peace but tho every private man singly taken be subject to the commands of the magistrate the whole body of the people is not so for he is by and for the people and the people is neither by nor for him the obedience due to him from private men is grounded upon and measured by the general law and that law regarding the welfare of the people cannot set up the interest of one or a few men against the public the whole body therefore of a nation cannot be tied to any other obedience than is consistent with the common good according to their own judgment and having never bin subdued or brought to terms of peace with their magistrates they cannot be said to revolt or rebel against them to whom they owe no more than seems good to themselves and who are nothing of or by themselves more than other men  again the thing signified by rebellion is not always evil for tho every subdued nation must acknowledge a superiority in those who have subdued them and rebellion dos imply a breach of the peace yet that superiority is not infinite the peace may be broken upon just grounds and it may be neither a crime nor infamy to do it the privernates had bin more than once subdued by the romans and had as often rebeld their  lv l   city was at last taken by plautius the consul after their leader virtuvius and great numbers of their senate and people had bin killed being reduced to a low condition they sent ambassadors to rome to desire peace where when a senator asked them what punishment they deserved one of them answered the same which they deserve who think themselves worthy of liberty the consul then demanded what kind of peace might be expected from them if the punishment should be remitted the ambassador answered si bonam dederitis fidam and perpetuam si malam haud diuturnam live if the terms you give be good the peace will be observed by us faithfully and perpetually if bad it will soon be broken and tho some were offended with the ferocity of the answer yet the best part of the senate approved it as viri and liberi vocem auditam ibid worthy of a man and a freeman and confessing that no man or nation would continue under an uneasy condition longer than they were compelled by force said eos demum qui nihil praeterquam de liberate cogitant dignos esse qui romani fiant ibid they only were fit to be made romans who thought nothing valuable but liberty upon which they were all made citizens of rome and obtained whatsoever they had desired  i know not how this matter can be carried to a greater height for if it were possible that a people resisting oppression and vindicating their own liberty could commit a crime and incur either guilt or infamy the privernates did who had bin often subdued and often pardoned but even in the judgment of their conquerors whom they had offended the resolution they professed of standing to no agreement imposed upon them by necessity was accounted the highest testimony of such a virtue as rendered them worthy to be admitted into a society and equality with themselves who were the most brave and virtuous people of the world  but if the patience of a conquered people may have limits and they who will not bear oppression from those who had spared their lives may deserve praise and reward from their conquerors it would be madness to think that any nation can be obliged to bear whatsoever their own magistrates think fit to do against them this may seem strange to those who talk so much of conquests made by kings immunitys libertys and privileges granted to nations oaths of allegiance taken and wonderful benefits conferred upon them but having already said as much as is needful concerning conquests and that the magistrate who has nothing except what is given to him can only dispense out of the public stock such franchises and privileges as he has received for the reward of services done to the country and encouragement of virtue i shall at present keep my self to the two last points  allegiance signifys no more as the words ad legem declare than such an obedience as the law requires but as the law can require nothing from the whole people who are masters of it allegiance can only relate to particulars and not to the whole nation no oath can bind any other than those who take it and that only in the true sense and meaning of it but single men only take this oath and therefore single men are only obliged to keep it the body of a people neither dos nor can perform any such act agreements and contracts have bin made as the tribe of judah and the rest of israel afterward made a covenant with david upon which they made him king but no wise man can think that the nation did thereby make themselves the creature of their own creature  the sense also of an oath ought to be considered no man can by an oath be obliged to any thing beyond or contrary to the true meaning of it private men who swear obedience ad legem swear no obedience extra or contra legem whatsoever they promise or swear can detract nothing from the public liberty which the law principally intends to preserve tho many of them may be obliged in their several stations and capacitys to render peculiar services to a prince the people continue as sree as the internal thoughts of a man and cannot but have a right to preserve their liberty or avenge the violation  if matters are well examined perhaps not many magistrates can pretend to much upon the title of merit most especially if they or their progenitors have continued long in office the conveniences annexed to the exercise of the sovereign power may be thought sufficient to pay such scores as they grow due even to the best and as things of that nature are handled i think it will hardly be found that all princes can pretend to an irresistible power upon the account of beneficence to their people when the family of medices came to be masters of tuscany that country was without dispute in men money and arms one of the most flourishing provinces in the world as appears by macchiavels account and the relation of what happened between charles the eighth and the magistrates of florence which i have mentioned already from guicciardin now whoever shall consider the strength of that country in those days together with what it might have bin in the space of a hundred and forty years in which they have had no war nor any other plague than the extortion fraud rapin and cruelty of their princes and compare it with their present desolate wretched and contemptible condition may if he please think that much veneration is due to the princes that govern them but will never make any man believe that their title can be grounded upon beneficenee the like may be said of the duke of savoy who pretending upon i know not what account that every peasant in the duchy ought to pay him two crowns every half year did in      subtly find out that in every year there were thirteen halves so that a poor man who had nothing but what he gained by hard labor was through his fatherly care and beneficence forced to pay six and twenty crowns to his royal highness to be employed in his discreet and virtuous pleasures at turin  the condition of the seventeen provinces of the netherlands and even of spain it self when they fell to the house of austria was of the same nature and i will confess as much as can be required if any other marks of their government do remain than such as are manifest evidences of their pride avarice luxury and cruelty  france in outward appearance makes a better show but nothing in this world is more miserable than that people under the fatherly care of their triumphant monarch the best of their condition is like asses and mastiff dogs to work and fight to be oppressed and killed for him and those among them who have any understanding well know that their industry courage and good success is not only unprofitable but destructive to them and that by increasing the power of their master they add weight to their own chains and if any prince or succession of princes have made a more modest use of their power or more faithfully discharged the trust reposed in them it must be imputed peculiarly to them as a testimony of their personal virtue and can have no effect upon others  the rights therefore of kings are not grounded upon conquest the libertys of nations do not arise from the grants of their princes the oath of allegiance binds no private man to more than the law directs and has no influence upon the whole body of every nation many princes are known to their subjects only by the injurys losses and mischiefs brought upon them such as are good and just ought to be rewarded for their personal virtue but can confer no right upon those who no way resemble them and whoever pretends to that merit must prove it by his actions rebellion being nothing but a renewed war can never be against a government that was not established by war and of it self is neither good nor evil more than any other war but is just or unjust according to the cause or manner of it besides that rebellion which by samuel is compared to witchcraft is not of private men or a people against   samuel       the prince but of the prince against god the israelites are often said to have rebeld against the law word or command of god but tho they frequently opposed their kings i do not find rebellion imputed to them on that account nor any ill character put upon such actions we are told also of some kings who had bin subdued and afterward rebeld against chedorlaomer and other kings but their cause is not blamed and we have some reason to believe it good because abraham took part with those who had rebeld however it can be of no prejudice to the cause i defend for tho it were true that those subdued kings could not justly rise against the person who had subdued them or that generally no king being once vanquished could have a right of rebellion against his conqueror it could have no relation to the actions of a people vindicating their own laws and libertys against a prince who violates them for that war which never was can never be renewed and if it be true in any case that hands and swords are given to men that they only may be slaves who have no courage it must be when liberty is overthrown by those who of all men ought with the utmost industry and vigor to have defended it  that this should be known is not only necessary for the safety of nations but advantageous to such kings as are wise and good they who know the frailty of human nature will always distrust their own and desiring only to do what they ought will be glad to be restrained from that which they ought not to do being taught by reason and experience that nations delight in the peace and justice of a good government they will never fear a general insurrection whilst they take care it be rightly administered and finding themselves by this means to be safe will never be unwilling that their children or successors should be obliged to tread in the same steps  if it be said that this may sometimes cause disorders i acknowledge it but no human condition being perfect such a one is to be chosen which carrys with it the most tolerable inconveniences and it being much better than the irregularitys and excesses of a prince should be restrained or suppressed than that whole nations should perish by them those constitutions that make the best provision against the greatest evils are most to be commended if governments were instituted to gratify the lusts of one man those could not be good that set limits to them but all reasonable men confessing that they are instituted for the good of nations they only can deserve praise who above all things endeavor to procure it and appoint means proportioned to that end the great variety of governments which we see in the world is nothing but the effect of this care and all nations have bin and are more or less happy as they or their ancecestors have had vigor of spirit integrity of manners and wisdom to invent and establish such orders as have better or worse provided for this common good which was sought by all but as no rule can be so exact to make provision against all contestations and all disputes about right do naturally end in force when justice is denied ill men never willingly submitting to any decision that is contrary to their passions and interests the best constitutions are of no value if there be not a power to support them this power first exerts it self in the execution of justice by the ordinary officers but no nation having bin so happy as not sometimes to produce such princes as edward and richard the seconds and such ministers as gaveston spencer and tresilian the ordinary officers of justice often want the will and always the power to restrain them so that the rights and libertys of a nation must be utterly subverted and abolished if the power of the whole may not be employed to assert them or punish the violation of them but as it is the fundamental right of every nation to be governed by such laws in such manner and by such persons as they think most conducing to their own good they cannot be accountable to any but themselves for what they do in that most important affair  sect xxxvii the english government was not ill constituted the defects more lately observed proceeding from the change of manners and corruption of the times i am not ignorant that many honest and good men acknowledging these rights and the care of our ancestors to preserve them think they wanted wisdom rightly to proportionate the means to the end it is not enough say they for the general of an army to desire victory he only can deserve praise who has skill industry and courage to take the best measures of obtaining it neither is it enough for wise legislators to preserve liberty and to erect such a government as may stand for a time but to set such clear rules to those who are to put it in execution that every man may know when they transgress and appoint such means for restraining or punishing them as may be used speedily surely and effectually without danger to the public sparta being thus constituted we hardly find that for more than eight hundred years any king presumed to pass the limits prescribed by the law if any roman consul grew insolent he might be reduced to order without blood or danger to the public and no dictator ever usurped a power over liberty till the time of sylla when all things in the city were so changed that the ancient foundations were become too narrow in venice the power of the duke is so circumscribed that in   00 years no one except falerio and tiepoli has dared to attempt any thing against the laws and they were immediately suppressed with little commotion in the city on the other side our law is so ambiguous perplexed and intricate that it is hard to know when it is broken in all the public contests we have had men of good judgment and integrity have followed both partys the means of transgressing and procuring partisans to make good by force the most notorious violations of liberty have bin so easy that no prince who has endeavored it ever failed to get great numbers of followers and to do infinite mischiefs before he could be removed the nation has bin brought to sight against those they had made to be what they were upon the unequal terms of hazarding all against nothing if they had success they gained no more than what was their own before and which the law ought to have secured whereas it is evident that if at any one time the contrary had happened the nation had bin utterly enslaved and no victory was ever gained without the loss of much noble and innocent blood  to this i answer that no right judgment can be given of human things without a particular regard to the time in which they passed we esteem scipio hannibal pyrrhus alexander epimanondas and caesar to have bin admirable commanders in war because they had in a most eminent degree all the qualitys that could make them so and knew best how to employ the arms then in use according to the discipline of their times and yet no man doubts that if the most skilful of them could be raised from the grave restored to the utmost vigor of mind and body set at the head of the best armies he ever commanded and placed upon the frontiers of france or flanders he would not know how to advance or retreat nor by what means to take any of the places in those parts as they are now fortified and defended but would most certainly be beaten by any insignificant fellow with a small number of men furnished with such arms as are now in use and following the methods now practiced nay the manner of marching encamping besieging attacking defending and fighting is so much altered within the last threescore years that no man observing the discipline that was then thought to be the best could possibly defend himself against that which has bin since found out tho the terms are still the same and if it be considered that political matters are subject to the same mutations as certainly they are it will be sufficient to excuse our ancestors who suting their government to the ages in which they lived could neither foresee the changes that might happen in future generations nor appoint remedys for the mischiefs they did not foresee  they knew that the kings of several nations had bin kept within the limits of the law by the virtue and power of a great and brave nobility and that no other way of supporting a mixed monarchy had ever bin known in the world than by putting the balance into the hands of those who had the greatest interests in nations and who by birth and estate enjoyed greater advantages than kings could confer upon them for rewards of betraying their country they knew that when the nobility was so great as not easily to be numbered the little that was left to the kings disposal was not sufficient to corrupt many and if some might fall under the temptation those who continued in their integrity would easily be able to chastise them for deserting the public cause and by that means deter kings from endeavoring to seduce them from their duty whilst things continued in this posture kings might safely be trusted with the advice of their council to confer the commands of the militia in towns and provinces upon the most eminent men in them and whilst those kings were exercised in almost perpetual wars and placed their glory in the greatness of the actions they achieved by the power and valor of their people it was their interest always to choose such as seemed best to deserve that honor it was not to be imagined that through the weakness of some and the malice of others those dignitys should by degrees be turned into empty titles and become the rewards of the greatest crimes and the vilest services or that the noblest of their descendents for want of them should be brought under the name of commoners and deprived of all privileges except such as were common to them with their grooms such a stupendous change being in process of time insensibly introduced the foundations of that government which they had established were removed and the superstructure overthrown the balance by which it subsisted was broken and it is as impossible to restore it as for most of those who at this day go under the name of noblemen to perform the dutys required from the ancient nobility of england and tho there were a charm in the name and those who have it should be immediately filled with a spirit like to that which animated our ancestors and endeavor to deserve the honors they possess by such services to the country as they ought to have performed before they had them they would not be able to accomplish it they have neither the interest nor the estates required for so great a work those who have estates at a rack rent have no dependents their tenants when they have paid what is agreed owe them nothing and knowing they shall be turned out of their tenements as soon as any other will give a little more they look upon their lords as men who receive more from them than they confer upon them this dependence being lost the lords have only more money to spend or lay up than others but no command of men and can therefore neither protect the weak nor curb the insolent by this means all things have bin brought into the hands of the king and the commoners and there is nothing left to cement them and to maintain the union the perpetual jarrings we hear every day the division of the nation into such factions as threaten us with ruin and all the disorders that we see or fear are the effects of this rupture these things are not to be imputed to our original constitutions but to those who have subverted them and if they who by corrupting changing enervating and annihilating the nobility which was the principal support of the ancient regular monarchy have driven those who are truly noblemen into the same interest and name with the commons and by that means increased a party which never was and i think never can be united to the court they are to answer for the consequences and if they perish their destruction is from themselves  the inconveniences therefore proceed not from the institution but from the innovation the law was plain but it has bin industriously rendered perplex they who were to have upheld it are overthrown that which might have bin easily performed when the people was armed and had a great strong virtuous and powerful nobility to lead them is made difficult now they are disarmed and that nobility abolished our ancestors may evidently appear not only to have intended well but to have taken a right course to accomplish what they intended this had effect as long as the cause continued and the only fault that can be ascribed to that which they established is that it has not proved to be perpetual which is no more than may be justly said of the best human constitutions that ever have bin in the world if we will be just to our ancestors it will become us in our time rather to pursue what we know they intended and by new constitutions to repair the breaches made upon the old than to accuse them of the defects that will for ever attend the actions of men taking our affairs at the worst we shall soon find that if we have the same spirit they had we may easily restore our nation to its ancient liberty dignity and happiness and if we do not the fault is owing to our selves and not to any want of virtue and wisdom in them  sect xxxviii the power of calling and dissolving parliaments is not simply in the king the variety of customs in choosing parliament men and the errors a people may commit neither prove that kings are or ought to be absolute the original of magistratical power the intention of our ancestors in its creation and the ways prescribed for the direction and limitation of it may i presume sufficiently appear by what has bin said but because our author taking hold of every twig pretends that kings may call and dissolve parliaments at their pleasure and from thence infers the power to be wholly in them alleges the various customs in several parts of this nation used in the elections of parliament men to procced from the kings will and because a people may commit errors thinks all power ought to be put into the hands of the king  i answer   that the power of calling and dissolving parliaments is not simply in kings they may call parliaments if there be occasion at times when the law dos not exact it they are placed as sentinels and ought diligently to observe the motions of the enemy and give notice of his approach but if the sentinel falls asleep neglects his duty or maliciously endeavors to betray the city those who are concerned may make use of all other means to know their danger and to preserve themselves the ignorance incapacity negligence or luxury of a king is a great calamity to a nation and his malice is worse but not an irreparable ruin remedys may be and often have bin found against the worst of their vices the last french kings of the races of meroveus and pepin brought many mischiefs upon the kingdom but the destruction was prevented edward and richard the seconds of england were not unlike them and we know by what means the nation was preserved the question was not who had the right or who ought to call parliaments but how the commonwealth might be saved from ruin the consuls or other chief magistrates in rome had certainly a right of assembling and dismissing the senate but when hannibal was at the gates or any other imminent danger threatened them with destruction if that magistrate had bin drunk mad or gained by the enemy no wise man can think that formalitys were to have bin observed in such cases every man is a magistrate and he who best knows the danger and the means of preventing it has a right of calling the senate or people to an assembly the people would and certainly ought to follow him as they did brutus and valerius against tarquin or horatius and valerius against the decemviri and whoever should do otherwise might for sottishness be compared to the courtiers of the two last kings of spain the first of these by name philip the third being indisposed in cold weather a braziero of coals was brought into his chamber and placed so near to him that he was cruelly scorched a nobleman then present said to one who stood by him the king burns the other answered it was true but the page whose office it was to bring and remove the braziero was not there and before he could be found his majestys legs and face were so burnt that it caused an erysipelas of which he died philip the fourth escaped not much better who being surpised as he was hunting by a violent storm of rain and hail and no man presuming to lend the king a cloak he was so wet before the officer could be found who carried his own that he took a cold which cast him into a dangerous fever if kings like the consequences of such a regularity they may cause it to be observed in their own familys but nations looking in the first place to their own safety would be guilty of the most extreme stupidity if they should suffer themselves to be ruined for adhering to such ceremonys  this is said upon a supposition that the whole power of calling and dissolving parliaments is by the law placed in the king but i utterly deny that it is so and to prove it shall give the following reasons    that the king can have no such power unless it be given to him for every man is originally free and the same power that makes him king gives him all that belongs to his being king it is not therefore an inherent but a delegated power and whoever receives it is accountable to those that gave it for as our author is forced to confess they who give authority by commission do always retain more than they grant    the law for annual parliaments expressly declares it not to be in the kings power as to the point of their meeting nor consequently their continuance for they meet to no purpose if they may not continue to do the work for which they meet and it were absurd to give them a power of meeting if they might not continue till it be done for as grotius says qui dat finem dat media ad finem necessaria the only reason why parliaments do meet is to provide for the public good and they by law ought to meet for that end they ought not therefore to be dissolved till it be accomplished for this reason the opinion given by tresilian that kings might dissolve parliaments at their pleasure was adjudgd to be a principal part of his treason    we have already proved that saxons danes normans etc who had no title to the crown were made kings by micklegemots wittenagemots and parliaments that is either by the whole people or their representatives others have bin by the same authority restrained brought to order or deposed but as it is impossible that such as were not kings and had no title to be kings could by virtue of a kingly power call parliaments when they had none and absurd to think that such as were in the throne who had not governed according to law would suffer themselves to be restrained imprisoned or deposed by parliaments called and sitting by themselves and still depending upon their will to be or not to be it is certain that parliaments have in themselves a power of sitting and acting for the public good    to the second the various customs used in elections are nothing to this question in the countys which make up the body of the nation all freeholders have their votes these are properly cives members of the commonwealth in distinction from those who are only incolae or inhabitants villains and such as being under their parents are not yet sui juris these in the beginning of the saxons reign in england composed the micklegemots and when they grew to be fo numerous that one place could not contain them or so far dispersed that without trouble and danger they could not leave their habitations they deputed such as should represent them when the nation came to be more polished to inhabit citys and towns and to set up several arts and trades those who exercised them were thought to be as useful to the commonwealth as the freeholders in the country and to deserve the same privileges but it not being reasonable that every one should in this case do what he pleased it was thought fit that the king with his council which always consisted of the proceres and magnates regni should judge what numbers of men and what places deserved to be made corporations or bodies politic and to enjoy those privileges by which he did not confer upon them any thing that was his but according to the trust reposed in him did dispense out of the public stock parcels of what he had received from the whole nation and whether this was to be enjoyed by all the inhabitants as in westminster by the common hall as in london or by the mayor aldermen jurats and corporation as in other places it is the same thing for in all these cases the king dos only distribute not give and under the same condition that he might call parliaments that is for the public good this indeed increases the honor of the person entrusted and adds weight to the obligation incumbent upon him but can never change the nature of the thing so as to make that an inherent which is only a delegated power and as parliaments when occasion required have bin assembled have refusd to be dissolved till their work was finished have severely punished those who went about to persuade kings that such matters depended absolutely upon their will and made laws to the contrary it is not to be imagined that they would not also have interposed their authority in matters of charters if it had bin observed that any king had notoriously abused the trust reposed in him and turned the power to his private advantage with which he was entrusted for the public good  that which renders this most plain and safe is that men chosen in this manner to serve in parliament do not act by themselves but in conjunction with others who are sent thither by prescription nor by a power derived from kings but from those that choose them if it be true therefore that those who delegate powers do always retain to themselves more than they give they who send these men do not give them an absolute power of doing whatsoever they please but retain to themselves more than they confer upon their deputys they must therefore be accountable to their principals contrary to what our author asserts this continues in force tho he knows not that any knights and burgesses have ever bin questioned by those that sent them for it cannot be concluded they ought not or may not be questioned because none have bin questioned but in truth they are frequently questioned the people do perpetually judge of the behavior of their deputys whenever any of them has the misfortune not to satisfy the major part of those that chose him he is sure to be rejected with disgrace the next time he shall desire to be chosen this is not only a sufficient punishment for such faults as he who is but one of five hundred may probably commit but as much as the greatest and freest people of the world did ever inflict upon their commanders that brought the greatest losses upon them appius claudius pomponius and terentius varro survived the greatest defeats that ever the romans suffered and tho they had caused them by their folly and perverseness were never punished yet i think no man doubts that the romans had as much right over their own officers as the athenians and carthaginians who frequently put them to death they thought the mind of a commander would be too much distracted if at the same time he should stand in fear both of the enemy and his own countrymen and as they always endeavored to choose the best men they would lay no other necessity upon them of performing their duty than what was suggested by their own virtue and love to their country it is not therefore to be thought strange if the people of england have followed the most generous and most prosperous examples besides if any thing has bin defective in their usual proceedings with their delegats the inconvenience has bin repaired by the modesty of the best and wisest of them that were chosen many in all ages and sometimes the whole body of the commons have refused to give their opinion in some cases till they had consulted with those that sent them the house have bin often adjourned to give them time to do it and if this were done more frequently or that the towns citys and countys had on some occasions given instructions to their deputys matters would probably have gone better in parliament than they have often done    the question is not whether the parliament be impeccable or infallible but whether an assembly of nobility with a house of commons composed of those who are best esteemed by their neighbors in all the towns and countys of england are more or less subject to error or corruption than such a man woman or child as happens to be next in blood to the last king many men do usually see more than one and prove       if we may believe the wisest king in the multitude of counselors there is safety such as are of mature age good experience and approved reputation for virtue and wisdom will probably judge better than children or fools men are thought to be more fit for war than women and those who are bred up in discipline to understand it better than those who never knew any thing of it if some countys or citys fail to choose such men as are eminently capable all will hardly be so mistaken as to choose those who have no more of wisdom or virtue than is usually entailed upon familys but filmer at a venture admires the profound wisdom of the king tho besides such as we have known historys give us too many proofs that all those who have bin possessed of crowns have not excelled that way he speaks of kings in general and makes no difference between solomon and his foolish son he distinguishes not our edward the first from edward the second edward the third from richard the second or henry the fifth from henry the sixth and because all of them were kings all of them if he deserves credit must needs have bin endowed with profound wisdom david was wise as an angel of god therefore the present kings of france spain and sweden must have bin so also when they were but five years old joan of castille could not be mad nor the two joans of naples infamous strumpets or all his arguments fall to the ground for tho solomons wisdom surpast that of all the people yet men could not rely equally upon that of rehoboam unless it had bin equal and if they are all equal in wisdom when they come to be equally kings perses of macedon was as great a captain as philip or alexander commodus and heliogabalus were as wise and virtuous as marcus aurelius and antoninus pius nay christina of sweden in her infancy was as fit to command an army as her valiant father if this be most absurd and false there can be neither reason nor sense in proposing as our author dos that the power should be in the king because the parliament is not infallible it is says he for the head to correct and not to expect the consent of the members or partys peccant to be judges in their own cases nor is it needful to confine the king etc besides that this is directly contrary to his own fundamental maxim that no man must be the judge of his own case in as much as this would put the power into the kings hands to decide the controversys between himself and the people in which his own passions private interest and the corrupt counsels of ill ministers will always lead him out of the way of justice the inconveniences that may arise from a possibility that the parliament or people is not infallible will be turned to the most certain and destructive mischiefs as must have fallen out in spain if upon a supposition that the estates of castille might err the correction of such errors had bin left to the profound wisdom and exquisit judgment of joan their queen and head who was stark mad and the like may be said of many other princes who through natural or accidental infirmitys want of age or dotage have bin utterly unable to judge of any thing  the matter will not be much mended tho i pass from idiots and lunaticks to such as know well enough how to clothe and feed themselves and to perform the ordinary functions of life and yet have bin as incapable of giving a right judgment concerning the weighty matters of government as the weakest of children or the most furious of madmen good manners forbid me to enumerate the examples of this kind which europe has produced even in this age but i should commit a greater fault if i did in silence pass over the extravagances of those who being most weak in judgment and irregular in their appetites have bin most impatient of any restraint upon their will the brave gustavus adolphus and his nephew carolus gustavus who was not inferior to him in valor wisdom and love to his people were content with the power that the laws of their country gave to them but frederick the fourth of denmark never rested till he had overthrown the liberty of that nation casimir by attempting the like in poland lost almost half that kingdom and flying from the other left all to be ravaged by swedes tartars and cosacks the present emperor who passed his time in setting songs in music with a wretched italian eunuch when he ought to have bin at the head of a brave army raised to oppose the turks in the year      and which under good conduct might have overthrown the ottoman empire as soon as he was delivered from the fear of that enemy fell upon his own subjects with such cruelty that they are now forced to fly to the turks for protection the protestants especially who find their condition more tolerable under those professed enemies to christianity than to be exposed to the pride avarice perfidiousness and violence of the jesuits by whom he is governed and the qualitys of the king of portugal are so well known together with the condition to which he would have brought his kingdom if he had not bin sent to the terceras that i need not speak particularly of him  if kings therefore by virtue of their office are constituted judges over the body of their people because the people or parliaments representing them are not infallible those kings who are children fools disabled by age or madmen are so also women have the same right where they are admitted to the succession those men who tho of ripe age and not superannuated nor directly fools or madmen yet absolutely incapable of judging important affairs or by their passions interests vices or the malice and wickedness of their ministers servants and favorites are set to oppress and ruin the people enjoy the same privilege than which nothing can be imagined more absurd and abominable nor more directly tending to the corruption and destruction of the nations under them for whose good and safety our author confesses they have their power  sect xxxix those kings only are heads of the people who are good wise and seek to advance no interest but that of the public the worst of men seldom arrive to such a degree of impudence as plainly to propose the most mischievous follys and enormitys they who are enemies to virtue and fear not god are afraid of men and dare not offer such things as the world will not bear lest by that means they should overthrow their own designs all poison must be disguised and no man can be persuaded to eat arsenic unless it be covered with something that appears to be harmless creusa would have abhorred medeas present if the pestilent venom had not bin hidden by the exterior luster of gold and gems the garment that destroyed hercules appeared beautiful and eve had neither eaten of the forbidden tree nor given the fruit to her husband if it had not seemed to be good and pleasant and she had not bin induced to believe that by eating it they should both be as gods the servants of the devil have always followed the same method their malice is carried on by fraud and they have seldom destroyed any but such as they had first deceived truth can never conduce to mischief and is best discovered by plain words but nothing is more usual with ill men than to cover their mischievous designs with figurative phrases it would be too ridiculous to say in plain terms that all kings without distinction are better able to judge of all matters than any or all their people they must therefore be called the head that thereby they may be invested with all the preeminences which in a natural body belong to that part and men must be made to believe the analogy between the natural and political body to be perfect but the matter must be better examined before this mortal poison seems fit to be swallowed  the word head is figuratively used both in scripture and profane authors in several senses in relation to places or persons and always implys something of real or seeming preeminence in point of honor or jurisdiction thus damascus is said to be the head of syria samaria of ephraim and ephraim of the ten tribes that is ephraim was the chief   chronicles   tribe samaria was the chief city of ephraim and damascus of syria tho it be certain that ephraim had no jurisdiction over the other tribes nor samaria over the other citys of ephraim but every one according to the law had an equal power within it self or the territorys belonging to it and no privileges were granted to one above another except to jerusalem in the matter of religion because the temple was placed there  the words head prince principal man or captain seem also to be equivocal and in this sense the same men are called heads of the tribes princes in the houses of their fathers and it is said that two hundred heads of the tribe of reuben were carried away captive by tiglath pilezer and proportionably in the other tribes which were a strange thing if the word did imply that supreme absolute and infinite power that our author attributes to it and no man of less understanding than he can comprehend how there should be two hundred or more sovereign unlimited powers in one tribe most especially when it is certain that one series of kings had for many ages reigned over that tribe and nine more and that every one of those tribes as well as the particular citys even from their first entrance into the promised land had a full jurisdiction within it self when the gileadites came to jephtha he suspected them and asked whether indeed they intended to make him judge    their head they answered if he would lead them against the ammonites he should be their head in the like sense when jul caesar in despair would have killed himself one of his soldiers dissuaded him from that design by telling him cum tot ab hac anima populorum vita salusque pendeat and tantus caput hoc sibi fecerit orbis savitia est voluisse mori lucan  that the safety of so many nations that had made him their head depending upon his life it would be cruelty in him to take such a resolution but for all that when this head was taken off the body did still subsist upon which i observe many fundamental differences between the relation of this figurative head even when the word is rightly applied and that of the natural head to their respective bodies  the figurative heads may be many the natural but one  the people make or create the figurative head the natural is from it self or connate with the body  the natural body cannot change or subsist without the natural head but a people may change and subsist very well without the artificial nay if it had bin true that the world had chosen caesar as it was not for he was chosen only by a factious mercenory army and the soundest part so far opposed that election that they brought him to think of killing himself there could have bin no truth in this flattering assertion that the safety of the whole depended upon his life for the world could not only subsist without him but without any such head as it had done before he by the help of his corrupted soldiery had usurped the power which also shows that a civil head may be a matter of convenience but not of necessity many nations have had none and if the expression be so far stretched as to make it extend to the annual or temporary magistrates set up by the athenians carthaginians romans and other ancient commonwealths or to those at this day in venice holland switzerland and other places it must be confessed that the people who made deposed abrogated or abolished both the magistrates and magistracys had the power of framing directing and removing their heads which our author will say is most absurd yet they did it without any prejudice to themselves and very often much to their advantage  in mentioning these vast and essential differences between the natural and political head i no way intend to exclude others that may be of equal weight but as all figurative expressions have their strength only from similitude there can be little or none in this which differs in so many important points and can therefore be of no effect  however right proceeds from identity and not from similitude the right of a man over me is by being my father and not by being like my father if i had a brother so perfectly resembling me as to deceive our parents which has sometimes happened to twins it could give him no right to any thing that is mine if the power therefore of correcting the partys peccant which our author attributes to kings be grounded upon the name of head and a resemblance between the heads of the body politic and body natural if this resemblance be found to be exceedingly imperfect uncertain or perhaps no way relating to the matter in question or tho it did and were absolutely perfect could confer no right the allegation of it is impertinent and absurd  this being cleared it is time to examine what the office of the head is in a natural body that we may learn from thence why that name is sometimes given to those who are eminent in political bodies and to whom it dos belong  some men account the head to be so absolutely the seat of all the senses as to derive even that of feeling which is exercised in every part from the brain but i think it is not doubted that all the rest have both their seat and function in the head and whatsoever is useful or hurtful to a man is by them represented to the understanding as aristotle says nihil est in intellectu quod non sit prius in sensu this is properly the part of every magistrate he is the sentinel of the public and is to represent what he discovers beneficial or hurtful to the society which office belongs not only to the supreme but proportionably to the subordinate in this sense were the chief men among the israelites called heads   chronicles    0 of their fathers house choice and mighty men of valor chief of the princes and in the following chapter mention is made of nine hundred and fifty benjamites chief men in the house of their fathers these men exercised a charitable care over such as were inferior to them in power and valor without any shadow of sovereignty or possibility that there could be so many sovereigns and such as were under their care are said to be their brethren which is not a word of majesty and domination but of dearness and equality the name therefore of head may be given to a sovereign but it implys nothing of sovereignty and must be exercised with charity which always terminates in the good of others the head cannot correct or chastise the proper work of that part is only to indicate and he who takes upon him to do more is not the head a natural body is homogeneous and cannot subsist if it be not so we cannot take one part of a horse another of a bear and put upon them the head of a lion for it would be a monster that would have neither action nor life the head must be of the same nature with the other members or it cannot subsist but the lord or master differs in specie from his servants and slaves he is not therefore properly their head  besides the head cannot have a subsistence without the body nor any interest contrary to that of the body and it is impossible for any thing to be good for the head that is hurtful to the body a prince therefore or magistrate who sets up an interest in himself distinct from or repugnant to that of the people renounces the title or quality of their head indeed moses was the head of the israelites for when god threatened to destroy that people and promised to make him a great nation he waved the particular advantages offered to himself interceded for them and procured their pardon yet he was not able to bear the weight of the government alone but desired that some might be appointed to assist him gideon was the head of the same people but he would not reign himself nor suffer his sons to reign over them samuel was also their head he took nothing from any man defrauded none took bribes from no man oppressed none god and the people were his witnesses he blamed them for their rebellion against god in asking a king but was no way concerned for himself or his family david likewise had a right to that title for he desired that god would spare the people and turn the effect of his anger against himself and the house of his father but rehoboam was not their head for tho he acknowledged that his father had laid a heavy yoke upon them yet he told them he would add to the weight and that if his father had chastisd them with whips he would chastise them with scorpions the head is no burden to the body and can lay none upon it the head cannot chastise any member and he who dos so be it more or less cannot be the head jeroboam was not the head of the revolting tribes for the head takes care of the members and provides for the safety of the whole but he through fear that the people going to jerusalem to worship should return to the house of david by setting up idols to secure his own interests drew guilt and destruction upon them tho it should be granted that augustus by a gentle use of his power had in a manner expiated the detestable villanys committed in the acquisition and had truly deserved to be called the head of the romans yet that title could no way belong to caligula claudius nero or vitellius who neither had the qualitys required in the head nor the understanding or will to perform the office nay if i should carry the matter farther and acknowledge that brutus cincinnatus fabius camillus and others who in the time of their annual or shorter magistracys had by their vigilance virtue and care to preserve the city in safety and to provide for the public good performed the office of the head and might deserve the name i might justly deny it to the greatest princes that have bin in the world who having their power for life and leaving it to descend to their children have wanted the virtues required for the performance of their duty and i should less fear to be guilty of an absurdity in saying that a nation might every year change its head than that he can be the head who cares not for the members nor understands the things that conduce to their good most especially if he sets up an interest in himself against them it cannot be said that these are imaginary cases and that no prince dos these things for the proof is too easy and the examples too numerous caligula could not have wished the romans but one head that he might cut it off at once if he had bin that head and had advanced no interest contrary to that of the members nero had not burnt the city of rome if his concernments had bin inseparably united to those of the people he who caused above three hundred thousand of his innocent unarmed subjects to be murdered and filled his whole kingdom with fire and blood did set up a personal interest repugnant to that of the nation and no better testimony can be required to show that he did so than a letter written by his son to take off the penalty due to one of the chief ministers of those crueltys for this reason that what he had done was by the command and for the service of his royal father king john did not pursue the advantage of his people when he endeavored to subject them to the pope or the moors and whatever prince seeks assistance from foreign powers or makes leagues with any stranger or enemy for his own advantage against his people however secret the treaty may be declares himself not to be the head but an enemy to them the head cannot stand in need of an exterior help against the body nor subsist when divided from it he therefore that courts such an assistance divides himself from the body and if he dos subsist it must be by a lise he has in himself distinct from that of the body which the head cannot have  but besides these enormitys that testify the most wicked rage and fury in the highest degree there is another practice which no man that knows the world can deny to be common with princes and incompatible with the nature of a head the head cannot desire to draw all the nourishment of the body to it self nor more than a due proportion if the rest of the parts are sick weak or cold the head suffers equally with them and if they perish must perish also let this be compared with the actions of many princes we know and we shall soon see which of them are heads of their people if the gold brought from the indys has bin equally distributed by the kings of spain to the body of that nation i consent they may be called the heads if the kings of france assume no more of the riches of that great kingdom than their due proportion let them also wear that honorable name but if the naked backs and empty bellys of their miserable subjects evince the contrary it can by no means belong to them if those great nations wast and languish if nothing be so common in the best provinces belonging to them as misery famine and all the effects of the most outrageous oppression whilst their princes and favorites possess such treasures as the most wanton prodigality cannot exhaust if that which is gained by the sweat of so many millions of men be torn out of the mouths of their starving wives and children to foment the vices of those luxurious courts or reward the ministers of their lusts the nourishment is not distributed equally to all the parts of the body the economy of the whole is overthrown and they who do these things cannot be the heads nor parts of the body but something distinct from and repugnant to it it is not therefore he who is found in or advanced to the place of the head who is truly the head it is not he who ought but he who dos perform the office of the head that deserves the name and privileges belonging to the head if our author therefore will persuade us that any king is head of his people he must do it by arguments peculiarly relating to him since those in general are found to be false if he say that the king as king may direct or correct the people and that the power of determining all controversys must be referred to him because they may be mistaken he must show that the king is infallible for unless he dos so the wound is not cured this also must be by some other way than by saying he is their head for such powers belong not to the office of the head and we see that all kings do not deserve that name many of them want both understanding and will to perform the functions of the head and many act directly contrary in the whole course of their government if any therefore among them have merited the glorious name of heads of nations it must have bin by their personal virtues by a vigilant care of the good of their people by an inseparable conjunction of interests with them by an ardent love to every member of the society by a moderation of spirit affecting no undue superiority or assuming any singular advantage which they are not willing to communicate to every part of the political body he who finds this merit in himself will scorn all the advantages that can be drawn from misapplied names he that knows such honor to be peculiarly due to him for being the best of kings will never glory in that which may be common to him with the worst nay whoever pretends by such general discourses as these of our author to advance the particular interests of any one king dos either know he is of no merit and that nothing can be said for him which will not as well agree with the worst of men or cares not what he says so he may do mischief and is well enough contented that he who is set up by such maxims as a public plague may fall in the ruin he brings upon the people  sect xl good laws prescribe easy and safe remedys against the evils proceeding from the vices or infirmitys of the magistrate and when they fail they must be supplied those who desire to advance the power of the magistrate above the law would persuade us that the difficultys and dangers of inquiring into his actions or opposing his will when employed in violence and injustice are so great that the remedy is always worse than the disease and that it is better to suffer all the evils that may proceed from his infirmitys and vices than to hazard the consequences of displeasing him but on the contrary i think and hope to prove    that in wellconstituted governments the remedys against ill magistrates are easy and safe    that it is good as well for the magistrate as the people so to constitute the government that the remedys may be easy and safe    that how dangerous and difficult soever they may be through the defects of the first constitution they must be tried  to the first it is most evident that in wellregulated governments these remedys have bin found to be easy and safe the kings of sparta were not suffered in the least to deviate from the rule of the law and theopompus one of those kings in whose time the ephori were created and the regal power much restrained doubted not to affirm that it was by plutarch that means become more lasting and more secure pausanias had not the name of king but commanded in the war against xerxes with more than regal power nevertheless being grown insolent he was without any trouble to that state banished and afterward put to death leonidas father of cleomenes was in the like manner banished the second agis was most unjustly put to death by the ephori for he was a brave and a good prince but there was neither danger nor difficulty in the action many of the roman magistrates after the expulsion of the kings seem to have bin desirous to extend their power beyond the bounds of the law and perhaps some others as well as the decemviri may have designed an absolute tyranny but the first were restrained and the others without much difficulty suppressed nay even the kings were so well kept in order that no man ever pretended to the crown unless he were chosen nor made any other use of his power than the law permitted except the last tarquin who by his insolence avarice and cruelty brought ruin upon himself and his family i have already mentioned one or two dukes of venice who were not less ambitious but their crimes returned upon their own heads and they perished without any other danger to the state than what had passed before their treasons were discovered infinite examples of the like nature may be alleged and if matters have not at all times and in all places succeeded in the same manner it has bin because the same courses were not every where taken for all things do so far follow their causes that being ordered in the same manner they will always produce the same effects    to the second such a regulation of the magistratical power is not at all grievous to a good magistrate he who never desires to do any thing but what he ought cannot desire a power of doing what he ought not nor be troubled to find he cannot do that which he would not do if he could this inability is also advantageous to those who are evil or unwise that since they cannot govern themselves a law may be imposed upon them lest by following their own irregular will they bring destruction upon themselves their familys and people as many have done if apollo in the fable had not bin too indulgent to phaeton in granting his ill conceived request the furious youth had not brought a necessity upon jupiter either of destroying him or suffering the world to be destroyed by him  besides good and wise men know the weight of sovereign power and misdoubt their own strength sacred and human historys furnish us with many examples of those who have feared the luster of a crown men that find in themselves no delight in doing mischief know not what thoughts may insinuate into their minds when raised too much above their sphere they who were able to bear adversity have bin precipitated into ruin by prosperity when the prophet told hazael the villanys he would commit he answered is thy servant a dog that i should do these things but yet he did them i know not where to find an example of a man more excellently qualified than alexander of macedon but he sell under the weight of his own fortune and grew to exceed those in vice whom he had conquered by his virtue the nature of man can hardly suffer such violent changes without being disordered by them and every one ought to enter into a just diffidence of himself and fear the temptations that have destroyed so many if any man be so happily born so carefully educated so established in virtue that no storm can shake him nor any poison corrupt him yet he will consider he is mortal and knowing no more than solomon whether his son shall be a wise man or a fool he will always fear to take upon him a power which must prove a most pestilent evil both to the person that has it and to those that are under it as soon as it shall fall into the hands of one who either knows not how to use it or may be easily drawn to abuse it supreme magistrates always walk in obscure and slippery places but when they are advanced so high that no one is near enough to support direct or restrain them their fall is inevitable and mortal and those nations that have wanted the prudence rightly to balance the powers of their magistrates were frequently obliged to have recourse to the most violent remedys and with much difficulty danger and blood to punish the crimes which they might have prevented on the other side such as have bin more wise in the constitution of their governments have always had regard to the frailty of human nature and the corruption reigning in the hearts of men and being less liberal of the power over their lives and libertys have reserved to themselves so much as might keep their magistrates within the limits of the law and oblige them to perform the ends of their institution and as the law which denounces severe penaltys for crimes is indeed merciful both to ill men who are by that means deterd from committing them and to the good who otherwise would be destroyed so those nations that have kept the reins in their hands have by the same act provided as well for the safety of their princes as for their own they who know the law is well defended seldom attempt to subvert it they are not easily tempted to run into excesses when such bounds are set as may not safely be transgrest and whilst they are by these means rendered more moderate in the exercise of their power the people are exempted from the odious necessity of suffering all manner of indignitys and miserys from their princes or by their destruction to prevent or avenge them    to the third if these rules have not bin well observed in the first constitution or from the changes of times corruption of manners insensible encroachments or violent usurpations of princes have bin rendered ineffectual and the people exposed to all the calamitys that may be brought upon them by the weakness vices and malice of the prince or those who govern him i confess the remedys are more difficult and dangerous but even in those cases they must be tried nothing can be feared that is worse than what is suffered or must in a short time fall upon those who are in this condition they who are already fallen into all that is odious shameful and miserable cannot justly fear when things are brought to such a pass the boldest counsels are the most safe and if those must moriendum victis moriendum deditis id solum interest an inter cruciatus and ludibria an per virtutem expiremus c tacit quod si nocentes innocentesque idem exitus maneat acrioris viri est merit perire ibid perish who lie still and they can but perish who are most active the choice is easily made let the danger be never so great there is a possibility of safety whilst men have life hands arms and courage to use them but that people must certainly perish who tamely suffer themselves to be oppressed either by the injustice cruelty and malice of an ill magistrate or by those who prevail upon the vices and infirmitys of weak princes it is in vain to say that this may give occasion to men of raising tumults or civil war for tho these are evils yet they are not the greatest of evils civil war in macchiavels account is a disease but tyranny is the death of a state gentle ways are first to be used and it is best if the work can be done by them but it must not be left undone if they fail it is good to use supplications advices and remonstrances but those who have no regard to justice and will not hearken to counsel must be constrained it is folly to deal otherwise with a man who will not be guided by reason and a magistrate who despises the law or rather to think him a man who rejects the essential principle of a man or to account him a magistrate who overthrows the law by which he is a magistrate this is the last result but those nations must come to it which cannot otherwise be preserved neros madness was not to be cured nor the mischievous effects of it any otherwise to be suppressed than by his death he who had spared such a monster when it was in his power to remove him had brought destruction upon the whole empire and by a foolish clemency made himself the author of his future villanys this would have bin yet more clear if the world had then bin in such a temper as to be capable of an entire liberty but the ancient foundations had bin overthrown and nothing better could be built upon the new than something that might in part resist that torrent of iniquity which had overflowed the best part of the world and give mankind a little time to breath under a less barbarous master yet all the best men did join in the work that was then to be done tho they knew it would prove but imperfect the sacred history is not without examples of this kind when ahab had subverted the law set up false witnesses and corrupt judges to destroy the innocent killed the prophets and established idolatry his house must then be cut off and his blood be licked up by dogs when matters are brought to this pass the decision is easy the question is only whether the punishment of crimes shall fall upon one or a few persons who are guilty of them or upon a whole nation that is innocent if the father may not die for the son nor the son for the father but every one must bear the penalty of his own crimes it would be most absurd to punish the people for the guilt of princes when the earl of morton was sent ambassador to q elizabeth by the estates of scotland to justify their proceedings against mary their queen whom they had obliged to renounce the government he alleged amongst other things the murder of her husband plainly proved against her asserted the ancient right and custom of that kingdom of animadvertendi in reges examining the actions of their kings by which means he said many had bin morte vinculis and exilio puniti buan  st l  0 qui tot reges regno exuerunt exilio damnarunt carceribus

iid punished with death imprisonment and exile confirmed their actions by the examples of other nations and upon the whole matter concluded that if she was still permitted to live it was not on account of her innocence or any exemption from the penaltys of the law but from the mercy and clemency of the people who contenting themselves with a resignation of her right and power to her son had spared her this discourse which is set down at large by the historian cited on the margin being of such strength in it self as never to have bin any otherwise answered than by railing and no way disapproved by queen elizabeth or her council to whom it was made either upon a general account of the pretensions of princes to be exempted from the penaltys of the law or any pretext that they had particularly misapplied them in relation to their queen i may justly say that when nations fall under such princes as are either utterly incapable of making a right use of their power or do maliciously abuse that authority with which they are entrusted those nations stand obliged by the duty they owe to themselves and their posterity to use the best of their endeavors to remove the evil whatever danger or difficultys they may meet with in the performance pontius the samnite said as truly as bravely to his countrymen that justa piaque sunt arma quibus necessaria and necessaria quib nlla ni in armis spes est saluts t  lib   those arms were just and pious that were necessary and necessary when there was no hope of safety by any other way this is the voice of mankind and is disliked only by those princes who fear the deserved punishments that may fall upon them or by their servants and flatterers who being for the most part the authors of their crimes think they shall be involved in their ruin  sect xli the people for whom and by whom the magistrate is created can only judge whether he rightly perform his office or not it is commonly said that no man ought to be the judge of his own case and our author lays much weight upon it as a fundamental maxim tho according to his ordinary inconstancy he overthrows it in the case of kings where it ought to take place if in any for it often falls out that no men are less capable of forming a right judgment than they their passions and interests are most powerful to disturb or pervert them no men are so liable to be diverted from justice by the flatterys of corrupt servants they never act as kings except for those by whom and for whom they are created and acting for others the account of their actions cannot depend upon their own will nevertheless i am not afraid to say that naturally and properly a man is the judge of his own concernments no one is or can be deprived of this privilege unless by his own consent and for the good of that society into which he enters this right therefore must necessarily belong to every man in all cases except only such as relate to the good of the community for whose sake he has divested himself of it if i find my self afflicted with hunger thirst weariness cold heat or sickness it is a folly to tell me i ought not to seek meat drink rest shelter refreshment or physic because i must not be the judge of my own case the like may be said in relation to my house land or estate i may do what i please with them if i bring no damage upon others but i must not set fire to my house by which my neighbors house may be burnt i may not erect forts upon my own lands or deliver them to a foreign enemy who may by that means infest my country i may not cut the banks of the sea or those of a river lest my neighbors ground be overflown because the society into which i am incorporated would by such means receive prejudice my land is not simply my own but upon condition that i shall not thereby bring damage upon the public by which i am protected in the peaceable enjoyment and innocent use of what i possess but this society leaves me a liberty to take servants and put them away at my pleasure no man is to direct me of what quality or number they shall be or can tell me whether i am well or ill served by them nay the state takes no other cognizance of what passes between me and them than to oblige me to perform the contracts i make and not to do that to them which the law forbids that is to say the power to which i have submitted my self exercises that jurisdiction over me which was established by my consent and under which i enjoy all the benefits of life which are of more advantage to me than my liberty could have bin if i had retained it wholly in my self the nature also and measure of this submission must be determined by the reasons that induced me to it the society in which i live cannot subsist unless by rule the equality in which men are born is so perfect that no man will suffer his natural liberty to be abridgd except others do the like i cannot reasonably expect to be defended from wrong unless i oblige my sel to do none or to suffer the punishment prescribed by the law if i perform not my engagement but without prejudice to the society into which i enter i may and do retain to my self the liberty of doing what i pleasein all things relating peculiarly to my self or in which i am to seek my own convenience  now if a private man is not subject to the judgment of any other than those to whom he submits himself for his own safety and convenience and notwithstanding that submission still retains to himself the right of ordering according to his own will all things merely relating to himself and of doing what he pleases in that which he dos for his own sake the same right must more certainly belong to whole nations when a controversy happens between caius and seius in a matter of right neither of them may determine the cause but it must be referred to a judge superior to both not because it is not fit that a man should be judge of his own case but because they have both an equal right and neither of them ows any subjection to the other but if there be a contest between me and my servant concerning my service i only am to decide it he must serve me in my own way or be gone if i think fit tho he serves me never so well and i do him no wrong in putting him away if either i intend to keep no servant or find that another will please me better i cannot therefore stand in need of a judge unless the contest be with one who lives upon an equal foot with me no man can be my judge unless he be my superior and he cannot be my superior who is not so by my consent nor to any other purpose than i consent to this cannot be the case of a nation which can have no equal within it self controversys may arise with other nations the decision of which may be left to judges chosen by mutual agreement but this relates not to our question a nation and most especially one that is powerful cannot recede from its own right as a private man from the knowledge of his own weakness and inability to defend himself must come under the protection of a greater power than his own the strength of a nation is not in the magistrate but the strength of a magistrate is in the nation the wisdom industry and valor of a prince may add to the glory and greatness of a nation but the foundation and substance will always be in it self if the magistrate and people were upon equal terms as caius and seius receiving equal and mutual advantages from each other no man could be judge of their differences but such as they should set up for that end this has bin done by many nations the ancient germans referred the decision of the most difficult matters to their priests the gauls and britans to the druides the mahometans for some ages to the califs of babylon the saxons in england when they had embraced the christian religion to their clergy whilst all europe lay under the popish superstition the decision of such matters was frequently assumed by the pope men often submitted to his judgment and the princes that resisted were for the most part excommunicated deposed and destroyed all this was done for the same reasons these men were accounted holy and inspired and the sentence pronounced by them was usually reverenced as the judgment of god who was thought to direct them and all those who refused to submit were esteemed execrable but no man or number of men as i think at the institution of a magistrate did ever say if any difference happen between you or your successors and us it be shall determined by your self or by them whether they be men women children mad foolish or vicious nay if any such thing had bin the folly turpitude and madness of such a sanction or stipulation must necessarily have destroyed it but if no such thing was ever known or could have no effect if it had bin in any place it is most absurd to impose it upon all the people therefore cannot be deprived of their natural rights upon a frivolous pretense to that which never was and never can be they who create magistracys and give to them such name form and power as they think fit do only know whether the end for which they were created be performed or not they who give a being to the power which had none can only judge whether it be employed to their welfare or turned to their ruin they do not set up one or a few men that they and their posterity may live in splendour and greatness but that justice may be administered virtue established and provision made for the public safety no wise man will think this can be done if those who set themselves to overthrow the law are to be their own judges if caligula nero vitellius domitian or heliogabalus had bin subject to no other judgment they would have completed the destruction of the empire if the disputes between durstus evenus the third dardannus and other kings of scotland with the nobility and people might have bin determined by themselves they had escaped the punishments they suffered and ruined the nation as they designed other methods were taken they perished by their madness better princes were brought into their places and their successors were by their example admonished to avoid the ways that had proved fatal to them if edward the second of england with gaveston and the spencers richard the second with tresilian and vere had bin permitted to be the judges of their own cases they who had murdered the best of the nobility would have pursued their designs to the destruction of such as remained the enslaving of the nation the subversion of the constitution and the establishment of a mere tyranny in the place of a mixed monarchy but our ancestors took better measures they who had felt the smart of the vices and follys of their princes knew what remedys were most fit to be applied as well as the best time of applying them they found the effects of extreme corruption in government to be so desperately pernicious that nations must necessarily perish unless it be corrected and the state reduced to its first principle or altered which being the case it was as easy for them to judge whether the governor who had introduced that corruption should be brought to order or removed if he would not be reclaimed or whether he should be suffered to ruin them and their posterity as it is for me to judge whether i should put away my servant if i knew he intended to poison or murder me and had a certain facility of accomplishing his design or whether i should continue him in my service till he had performed it nay the matter is so much the more plain on the side of the nation as the disproportion of merit between a whole people and one or a few men entrusted with the power of governing them is greater than between a private man and his servant this is so fully confirmed by the general consent of mankind that we know no government that has not frequently either bin altered in form or reduced to its original purity by changing the familys or persons who abused the power with which they had bin entrusted those who have wanted wisdom and virtue rightly and seasonably to perform this have bin soon destroyed like the goths in spain who by omitting to curb the mariana fury of witza and rodrigo in time became a prey to the moors their kingdom by this means destroyed was never restored and the remainder of that nation joining with the spaniards whom they had kept in subjection for three or four ages could not in less than eight hundred years expel those enemies they might have kept out only by removing two base and vicious kings such nations as have bin so corrupted that when they have applied themselves to seek remedys to the evils they suffered by wicked magistrates could not fall upon such as were proportionable to the disease have only vented their passions in destroying the immediate instruments of their oppression or for a while delayed their utter ruin but the root still remaining it soon produced the same poisonous fruit and either quite destroyed or made them languish in perpetual misery the roman empire was the most eminent example of the first many of the monsters that had tyrannized over them were killed but the greatest advantage gained by their death was a respite from ruin and the government which ought to have bin established by good laws depending only upon the virtue of one man his life proved to be no more than a lucid interval and at his death they relapsed into the depth of infamy and misery and in this condition they continued till that empire was totally subverted  all the kingdoms of the arabians medes persians moors and others of the east are of the other sort common sense instructs them that barbarous pride cruelty and madness grown to extremity cannot be born but they have no other way than to kill the tyrant and to do the like to his successor if he falls into the same crimes wanting that wisdom and valor which is required for the institution of a good government they languish in perpetual slavery and propose to themselves nothing better than to live under a gentle master which is but a precarious life and little to be valued by men of bravery and spirit but those nations that are more generous who set a higher value upon liberty and better understand the ways of preserving it think it a small matter to destroy a tyrant unless they can also destroy the tyranny they endeavor to do the work thoroughly either by changing the government entirely or reforming it according to the first institution and making such good laws as may preserve its integrity when reformed this has bin so frequent in all the nations both ancient and modern with whose actions we are best acquainted as appears by the foregoing examples and many others that might be alleged if the case were not clear that there is not one of them which will not furnish us with many instances and no one magistracy now in being which dos not owe its original to some judgment of this nature so that they must either derive their right from such actions or confess they have none at all and leave the nations to their original liberty of setting up those magistracys which best please themselves without any restriction or obligation to regard one person or family more than another  sect xlii the person that wears the crown cannot determine the affairs which the law refers to the king our author with the rest of the vulgar seems to have bin led into gross errors by the form of writs summoning persons to appear before the king the common style used in the trial of delinquents the name of the kings witnesses given to those who accuse them the verdicts brought in by jurys coram domino rege and the prosecution made in the kings name seem to have caused this and they who understand not these phrases render the law a heap of the most gross absurditys and the king an enemy to every one of his subjects when he ought to be a father to them all since without any particular consideration or examination of what any witness deposes in a court of justice tending to the death confiscation or other punishment of any man he is called the kings witness whether he speak the truth or a lie and on that account favored it is not necessary to alledg many instances in a case that is so plain but it may not be amiss to insert two or three of the most important reasons to prove my assertion    if the law did intend that he or she who wears the crown should in his or her person judge all causes and determine the most difficult questions it mnst like our author presume that they will always be of profound wisdom to comprehend all of them and of perfect integrity always to act according to their understanding which is no less than to lay the foundation of the government upon a thing merely contingent that either never was or very often fails as is too much verified by experience and the historys of all nations or else to refer the decision of all to those who through the infirmitys of age sex or person are often incapable of judging the least or subject to such passions and vices as would divert them from justice tho they did understand it both which seem to be almost equally preposterous    the law must also presume that the prince is always present in all the places where his name is used the king of france is as i have said already esteemed to be present sur son lit de justice on the seat of justice in all the parliaments and sovereign courts of the kingdom and if his corporeal presence were by that phrase to be understood he must be in all those distinct and far distant places at the same time which absurdity can hardly be paralleled unless by the popish opinion of transubstantiation but indeed they are so far from being guilty of such monstrous absurdity that he cannot in person be present at any trial and no man can be judged if he be this was plainly asserted to lewis the    th when he would have bin at the trial of the duke of candale by the president de bellievre who told him that as he could judge no man himself so they could not judge any if he were present upon which he retired    the laws of most kingdoms giving to kings the confiscation of delinquents estates if they in their own persons might give judgment upon them they would be constituted both judges and partys which besides the forementioned incapacitys to which princes are as much subject as other men would tempt them by their own personal interest to subvert all manner of justice  this therefore not being the meaning of the law we are to inquire what it is and the thing is so plain that we cannot mistake unless we do it wilfully some name must be used in all manner of transactions and in matters of public concernment none can be so fit as that of the principal magistrate thus are leagues made not only with kings and emperors but with the dukes of venice and genoa the avoyer and senate of a canton in switzerland and the burgermaster of an imperial town in germany and the states general of the united provinces but no man thinking i presume these leagues would be of any value if they could only oblige the persons whose names are used it is plain that they do not stipulate only for themselves and that their stipulations would be of no value if they were merely personal and nothing can more certainly prove they are not so than that we certainly know those dukes avoyers and burgermasters can do nothing of themselves the power of the states general of the united provinces is limited to the points mentioned in the act of union made at vtrecht the empire is not obliged by any stipulation made by the emperor without their consent nothing is more common than for one king making a league with another to exact a confirmation of their agreement by the parliaments diets or general de jur bell l   estates because says grotius a prince dos not stipulate for himself but for the people under his government and a king deprived of his kingdom loses the right of sending an ambassador the powers of europe showed themselves to be of this opinion in the case of portugal when philip the second had gained the possession they treated with him concerning the affairs relating to that kingdom few regarded don antonio and no man considered the dukes of savoy parma or braganza who perhaps had the most plausible titles but when his grandson philip the fourth had lost that kingdom and the people had set up the duke of braganza they all treated with him as king and the english court tho then in amity with spain and not a little influenced by a spanish faction gave example to others by treating with him and not with spain touching matters relating to that state nay i have bin informed by those who well understood the affairs of that time that the lord cottington advising the late king not to receive any persons sent from the duke of braganza rebel to his ally the king of spain in the quality of ambassadors the king answered that he must look upon that person to be king of portugal who was acknowledged by the nation and i am mistaken if his majesty now reigning did not find all the princes and states of the world to be of the same mind when he was out of his kingdom and could oblige no man but himself and a few followers by any treaty he could make  for the same reason the names of kings are used in treatys when they are either children or otherwise incapable of knowing what alliances are fit to be made or rejected and yet such treatys do equally oblige them their successors and people as if they were of mature age and fit for government no man therefore ought to think it strange if the kings name be used in domestic affairs of which he neither ought nor can take any cognizance in these cases he is perpetually a minor he must suffer the law to take its due course and the judges thonominated by him are obliged by oath not to have any regard to his letters or personal commands if a man be sud he must appear and a delinquent is to be tried coram rege but no otherwise than secundum legem terrae according to the law of the land not the kings personal will or opinion and the judgments given must be executed whether they please him or not it being always understood that he can speak no otherwise than the law speaks and is always present as far as the law requires for this reason a noble lord who was irregularly detained in prison in      being by habeas corpus brought to the bar of the kings bench where he sud to be released upon bail and an ignorant judge telling him he must apply himself to the king he replied that he came thither for that end that the king might eat drink or sleep where he pleased but when he rendered justice he was always in that place the king that renders justice is indeed always there he never sleeps he is subject to no infirmity he never dies unless the nation be extinguished or so dissipated as to have no government no nation that has a sovereign power within it self dos ever want this king he was in athens and rome as well as at babylon and susa and is as properly said to be now in venice switzerland or holland as in france morocco or turkey this is he to whom we all owe a simple and unconditional obedience this is he who never dos any wrong it is before him we appear when we demand juice or render an account of our actions all jurys give their verdict in his sight they are his commands that the judges are bound and sworn to obey when they are not at all to consider such as they receive from the person that wears the crown twas for treason against him that tresilian and others like to him in several ages were hanged they gratified the lusts of the visible powers but the invisible king would not be mocked he caused justice to be executed upon empson and dudley he was injured when the perjured wretches who gave that accursed judgment in the case of shipmony were suffered to escape the like punishment by means of the ensuing troubles which they had chiefly raised and i leave it to those who are concerned to consider how many in our days may expect vengeance for the like crimes  i should here conclude this point if the power of granting a noli proseq cesset processus and pardons which are said to be annexed to the person of the king were not taken for a proof that all proceedings at law depend upon his will but whoever would from hence draw a general conclusion must first prove his proposition to be universally true if it be wholly false no true deduction can be made and if it be true only in some cases it is absurd to draw from thence a general conclusion and to erect a vast fabric upon a narrow foundation is impossible as to the general proposition i utterly deny it the king cannot stop any suit that i begin in my own name or invalidate any judgment i obtain upon it he cannot release a debt of ten shillings due to me nor a sentence for the like sum given upon an action of battery assault trespass public nuisance or the like he cannot pardon a man condemned upon an appeal nor hinder the person injured from appealing his power therefore is not universal if it be not universal it cannot be inherent but conferred upon him or entrusted by a superior power that limits it  these limits are fixed by the law the law therefore is above him his proceedings must be regulated by the law and not the law by his will besides the extent of those limits can only be known by the intention of the law that sets them and are so visible that none but such as are wilfully blind can mistake it cannot be imagined that the law which dos not give a power to the king of pardoning a man that breaks my hedge can intend he should have power to pardon one who kills my father breaks my house robs me of my goods abuses my children and servants wounds me and brings me in danger of my life whatever power he has in such cases is founded upon a presumption that he who has sworn not to deny or delay justice to any man will not break his oath to interrupt it and farther as he dos nothing but what he may rightly do cum magnatum and sapientum consilio and that it is supposed they will never advise him to do any thing but what ought to be done in order to attain the great ends of the law justice and the public safety nevertheless lest this should not be sufficient to keep things in their due order or that the king should forget his oath not to delay or deny justice to any man his counselors are exposed to the severest punishments if they advise him to do any thing contrary to it and the law upon which it is grounded so that the utmost advantage the king can pretend to in this case is no more than that of the norman who said he had gained his cause because it depended upon a point that was to be decided by his oath that is to say if he will betray the trust reposed in him and perjure himself he may sometimes exempt a villain from the punishment he deserves and take the guilt upon himself i say sometimes for appeals may be brought in some cases and the waterman who had bin pardoned by his majesty in the year    0 for a murder he had committed was condemned and hanged at the assizes upon an appeal nay in cases of treason which some men think relate most particularly to the person of the king he cannot always do it gaveston the two spencers tresilian empson dudley and others have bin executed as traitors for things done by the kings command and it is not doubted they would have bin saved if the kings power had extended so far i might add the cases of the earls of strafford and danby for tho the king sign d a warrant for the execution of the first no man doubts he would have saved him if it had bin in his power the other continues in prison notwithstanding his pardon and for any thing i know he may continue where he is or come out in a way that will not be to his satisfaction unless he be found innocent or something fall out more to his advantage than his majestys approbation of what he has done if therefore the king cannot interpose his authority to hinder the course of the law in contests between private men nor remit the debts adjudgd to be due or the damages given to the persons agrievd he can in his own person have no other power in things of this nature than in some degree to mitigate the vindictive power of the law and this also is to be exercised no other way than as he is entrusted but if he acts even in this capacity by a delegated power and in few cases he must act according to the ends for which he is so entrusted as the same law says cum magnatum and sapientum consilio and is not therein to pursue his own will and interests if his oath farther oblige him not to do it and his ministers are liable to punishment if they advise him otherwise if in matters of appeal he has no power and if his pardons have bin of no value when contrary to his oath he has abused that with which he is entrusted to the patronizing of crimes and exempting such delinquents from punishment as could not be pardoned without prejudice to the public i may justly conclude that the king before whom every man is bound to appear who dos perpetually and impartially distribute justice to the nation is not the man or woman that wears the crown and that he or she cannot determine those matters which by the law are referred to the king whether therefore such matters are ordinary or extraordinary the decision is and ought to be placed where there is most wisdom and stability and where passion and private interest dos least prevail to the obstruction of justice this is the only way to obviate that confusion and mischief which our author thinks it would introduce in cases of the first sort this is done in england by judges and jurys in the other by the parliament which being the representative body of the people and the collected wisdom of the nation is least subject to error most exempted from passion and most free from corruption their own good both public and private depending upon the rectitude of their sanctions they cannot do any thing that is ill without damage to themselves and their posterity which being all that can be done by human understanding our lives libertys and propertys are by our laws directed to depend upon them  sect xliii proclamations are not laws our author according to his usual method and integrity lays great weight upon proclamations as the significations of the kings pleasure which in his opinion is our only law but neither law nor reason openly directing nor by consequences insinuating that such a power should be put into an uncertain or suspected hand we may safely deny them to be laws or in any sense to have the effect of laws nay they cannot be so much as significations of his will for as he is king he can have no will but as the law directs if he depart from the law he is no longer king and his will is nothing to us proclamations at most are but temporary by the advice of council in pursuance of the law if they be not so the subject is no way obliged to obey them and the counselors are to be punished for them these laws are either immemorial customs or statutes the first have their beginning and continuance from the universal consent of the nation the latter receive their authority and force of laws from parliaments as is frequently expressed in the preambles these are under god the best defense of our lives libertys and estates they proceed not from the blind corrupt and fluctuating humor of a man but from the mature deliberation of the choicest persons of the nation and such s have the greatest interest in it our ancestors have always relied upon these laws and it is to be hoped we shall not be so abandoned by god so deprived of courage and common sense to suffer our selves to be cheated of the inheritance which they have so frequently so bravely and so constantly defended tho experience has too well taught us that parliaments may have their failings and that the vices which are industriously spread among them may be too prevalent yet they are the best helps we have and we may much more reasonably depend upon them than upon those who propagate that corruption among them for which only they can deserve to be suspected we hope they will take care of our concernments since they are as other men so soon as a session is ended and can do nothing to our prejudice that will not equally affect them and their posterity besides the guilt of betraying their country which can never be washed off if some should prove false to their trust it is probable that others would continue in their integrity or if the base arts which are usually practiced by those who endeavor to delude corrupt enslave and ruin nations should happen to prevail upon the youngest and weakest it may be reasonably hoped that the wisest will see the snares and instruct their companions to avoid them but if all things were so put into the hands of one man that his proclamations were to be esteemed laws the nation would be exposed to ruin as soon as it should chance to fall into an ill hand it is in vain to say we have a good king who will not make an ill use of his power for even the best are subject to be deceived by flatterers and crowned heads are almost ever encompast by them the principal art of a courtier is to observe his masters passions and to attack him on that side where he seems to be most weak it would be a strange thing to find a man impregnable in every part and if he be not it is impossible he should resist all the attempts that are made upon him if his judgment comes to be prepossest he and all that depend on him are lost contradictions tho never so just are then unsafe and no man will venture upon them but he who dares sacrifice himself for the public good the nature of man is frail and stands in need of assistance virtuous actions that are profitable to the commonwealth ought to be made as far as it is possible safe easy and advantageous and it is the utmost imprudence to tempt men to be enemies to the public by suffering the most pernicious actions to be the means of obtaining honor and favor whilst no man can serve his country but with the ruin of himself and his family  however in this case the question is not concerning a person the same counsels are to be followed when moses or samuel is in the throne as if caligula had invaded it laws ought to aim at perpetuity but the virtues of a man die with him and very often before him those who have deserved the highest praises for wisdom and integrity have frequently left the honors they enjoyed to foolish and vicious children if virtue may in any respect be said to outlive the person it can only be when good men frame such laws and constitutions as by favoring it preserve themselves this has never bin done otherwise than by balancing the powers in such a manner that the corruption which one or a few men might fall into should not be suffered to spread the contagion to the ruin of the whole the long continuance of lycurgus his laws is to be attributed to this they restrained the lusts of kings and reduced those to order who adventured to transgress them whereas the whole fabric must have fallen to the ground in a short time if the first that had a fancy to be absolute had bin able to effect his design this has bin the fate of all governments that were made to depend upon the virtue of a man which never continues long in any family and when that fails all is lost the nations therefore that are so happy to have good kings ought to make a right use of them by establishing the good that may outlast their lives those of them that are good will readily join in this work and take care that their successors may be obliged in doing the like to be equally beneficial to their own familys and the people they govern if the rulers of nations be restrained not only the people are by that means secured from the mischiefs of their vices and follys but they themselves are preserved from the greatest temptations to ill and the terrible effects of the vengeance that frequently ensues upon it an unlimited prince might be justly compared to a weak ship exposed to a violent storm with a vast sail and no rudder we have an eminent example of this in the book of esther chap   a wicked villain having filled the ears of a foolish king with false storys of the jews he issues out a proclamation for their utter extirpation and not long after being informed of the truth he gave them leave by another proclamation to kill whom they pleased which they executed upon seventy thousand men the books of ezra nehemiah and daniel manifestly discover the like fluctuation in all the counsels of nabuchodonosor cyrus darius and artaxerxes when good men had credit with them they favored the israelites sent them back to their own country restored the sacred vessels that had bin taken away gave them all things necessary for the rebuilding of the city and advanced the chief of them to the highest employments but if they fell into ill hands three just men must be thrown into the burning furnace for refusing to worship an idol daniel must be cast to the lions the holy city esteemed rebellious and those who endeavored to rebuild it enemies to kings such was the state of things when their proclamations passed for laws and numbers of flattering slaves were ready to execute their commands without examining whether they were just or unjust good or bad the life and death of the best men together with the very being of nations was exposed to chance and they were either preserved or destroyed according to the humor of that man who spoke last to the king or happened to have credit with him if a frantic fancy come into the head of a drunken whore persepolis must be burnt and the hand of alexander is ready to execute her will if a dancing wench please herod the most venerable of all human heads must be offered in a dish for a sacrifice to the rage of her impure mother the nature of man is so frail that wheresoever the word of a single person has had the force of a law the innumerable extravagances and mischiefs it has produced have bin so notorious that all nations who are not stupid slavish and brutish have always abominated it and made it their principal care to find out remedys against it by so dividing and balancing the powers of their government that one or a few men might not be able to oppress and destroy those they ought to preserve and protect this has always bin as grateful to the best and wisest princes as necessary to the weakest and worst as i have proved already by the examples of theopompus moses and others these considerations have given beginning growth and continuance to all the mixed governments that have bin in the world and i may justly say there never was a good one that was not mixed if other proofs of their rectitude were wanting our authors hatred would be enough to justify them he is so bitter an enemy to mankind as to be displeased with nothing but that which tends to their good and so perverse in his judgment that we have reason to believe that to be good which he most abhors one would think he had taken the model of the government he proposes from the monstrous tyranny of ceylon an island in the eastindys where the king knows no other law than his own will he kills tears in pieces empales or throws to his elephants whomsoever he pleases no man has any thing that he can call his own he seldom fails to destroy those who have bin employed in his domestic service or public offices and few obtain the favor of being put to death and thrown to the dogs without torments his subjects approach him no otherwise than on their knees licking the dust and dare assume to themselves no other name than that of dogs or limbs of dogs this is a true pattern of filmers patriarchical monarch his majesty i suppose is sufficiently exalted for he dos whatever he pleases the exercise of his power is as gentle as can reasonably be expected from one who has all by the unquestionable right of usurpation and knows the people will no longer suffer him and the villains he hires to be the instruments of his cruelty than they can be kept in such ignorance weakness and baseness as neither to know how to provide for themselves or dare to resist him we ought to esteem our selves happy if the like could be established among us and are much obliged to our author for so kindly proposing an expedient that might terminate all our disputes let proclamations obtain the power of laws and the business is done they may be so ingeniously contrievd that the ancient laws which we and our fathers have highly valued shall be abolished or made a snare to all those that dare remember they are englishmen and are guilty of the unpardonable crime of loving their country or have the courage conduct and reputation required to defend it this is the sum of filmers philosophy and this is the legacy he has left to testify his affection to the nation which having for a long time lain unregarded has bin lately brought into the light again as an introduction of a popish successor who is to be established as we ought to believe for the security of the protestant religion and our english libertys both will undoubtedly flourish under a prince who is made to believe the kingdom is his patrimony that his will is a law and that he has a power which none may resist if any man doubt whether he will make a good use of it he may only examine the historys of what others in the same circumstances have done in all places where they have had power the principles of that religion are fo full of meekness and charity the popes have always showed themselves so gentle toward those who would not submit to their authority the jesuits who may be accounted the soul that give life to the whole body of that faction are so well natured faithful and exact in their morals so full of innocence justice and truth that no violence is to be feared from such as are governed by them the fatherly care showed to the protestants of france by the five last kings of the house of valois the mercy of philip the second of spain to his pagan subjects in the westindys and the more hated protestants in the netherlands the moderation of the dukes of savoy toward the vaudois in the marquisat of saluzzo and the vallys of piedmont the gentleness and faith of the two marys queens of england and scotland the kindness of the papists to the protestants of ireland in      with what we have reason to believe they did and do still intend if they can accomplish the ends o their conspiracy in a word the sweetness and apostolical meekness of the inquisition may sufficiently convince us that nothing is to be seared where that principle reigns we may suffer the word of such a prince to be a law and the people to be made to believe it ought to be so when he is expected tho we should wave the bill of exclusion and not only admit him to reign as other kings have done but resign the whole power into his hands it would neither bring inconvenience or danger on the present king he can with patience expect that nature should take her course and would neither anticipate nor secure his entrance into the possession of the power by taking one day from the life of his brother tho the papists know that like a true son of their church he would prefer the advancement of their religion before all other considerations and that one stab with a dagger or a dose of poison would put all under his feet not one man would be found among them to give it the assassins were mahometans not pupils of the honest jesuits nor ever employed by them these things being certain all our concernments would be secure if instead of the foolish statutes and antiquated customs on which our ancestors and we have hitherto doted we may be troubled with no law but the kings will and a proclamation may be taken for a sufficient declaretion of it we shall by this means be delivered from that liberty with a mischief in which our mistaken nation seems so much to delight this phrase is so new and so peculiar to our author that it deserves to be written upon his tomb we have heard of tyranny with a mischief slavery and bondage with a mischief and they have bin denounced by god against wicked and perverse nations as mischiefs comprehending all that is most to be abhorred and dreaded in the world but filmer informs us that liberty which all wise and good men have in all ages esteemed to be the most valuable and glorious privilege of mankind is a mischief if he deserves credit moses joshua gideon sampson and samuel with others like them were enemies to their country in depriving the people of the advantages they enjoyed under the paternal care of pharaoh adonibezek eglon jabin and other kings of the neighboring nations and restoring them to that liberty with a mischief which he had promised to them the israelites were happy under the power of tyrants whose proclamations were laws and they ought to have bin thankful to god for that condition and not for the deliverances he wrought by the hands of his servants subjection to the will of a man is happiness liberty is a mischief but this is so abominably wicked and detestable that it can deserve no answer  sect xliv a people that is not free cannot substitute delegats how full soever the power of any person or people may be he or they are obliged to give only so much to their delegats as seems convenient to themselves or conducing to the ends they desire to attain but the delegate can have none except what is conferred upon him by his principal if therefore the knights citizens and burgesses sent by the people of england to serve in parliament have a power it must be more perfectly and fully in those that send them but as was proved in the last section proclamations and other significations of the kings pleasure are not laws to us they are to be regulated by the law not the law by them they are to be considered only so far as they are conformable to the law from which they receive all the strength that is in them and can confer none upon it we know no laws but our own statutes and those immemorial customs established by the consent of the nation which may be and often are changed by us the legislative power therefore that is exercised by the parliament cannot be conferred by the writ of summons but must be essentially and radically in the people from whom their delegates and representatives have all that they have but says our author they must only choose and trust those whom they choose to do what they list and that is as much liberty as many of us deserve for our irregular elections of burgesses this is ingeniously concluded i take what servant i please and when i have taken him i must suffer him to do what he pleases but from whence should this necessity arise why may not i take one to be my groom another to be my cook and keep them both to the offices for which i took them what law dos herein restrain my right and if i am free in my private capacity to regulate my particular affairs according to my own discretion and to allot to each servant his proper work why have not i with my associates the freemen of england the like liberty of directing and limiting the powers of the servants we employ in our public affairs our author gives us reasons proportionable to his judgment this were liberty with a mischief and that of choosing only is as much as many of us deserve i have already proved that as far as our historys reach we have had no princes or magistrates but such as we have made and they have had no other power than what we have conferred upon them they cannot be the judges of our merit who have no power but what we gave them through an opinion they did or might deserve it they may distribute in parcels to particulars that with which they are entrusted in the gross but it is impossible the public should depend absolutely upon those who are nothing above other men except what they are made to be for and by the public the restrictions therefore of the peoples liberty must be from themselves or there can be none  nevertheless i believe that the powers of every county city and borough of england are regulated by the general law to which they have all consented and by which they are all made members of one political body this obliges them to proceed with their delegats in a manner different from that which is used in the united netherlands or in switzerland amongst these every province city or canton making a distinct body independent from any other and exercising the sovereign power within it self looks upon the rest only as allies to whom they are bound only by such acts as they themselves have made and when any new thing not comprehended in them happens to arise they oblige their delegats to give them an account of it and retain the power of determining those matters in themselves it is not so amongst us every county dos not make a distinct body having in it self a sovereign power but is a member of that great body which comprehends the whole nation it is not therefore for kent or sussex lewis or maistone but for the whole nation that the members chosen in those places are sent to serve in parliament and tho it be fit for them as friends and neighbors so far as may be to hearken to the opinions of the electors for the information of their judgments and to the end that what they shall say may be of more weight when every one is known not to speak his own thoughts only but those of a great number of men yet they are not strictly and properly obliged to give account of their actions to any unless the whole body of the nation for which they serve and who are equally concerned in their resolutions could be assembled this being impracticable the only punishment to which they are subject if they betray their trust is scorn infamy hatred and an assurance of being rejected when they shall again seek the same honor and tho this may seem a small matter to those who fear to do ill only from a sense of the pains inflicted yet it is very terrible to men of ingenuous spirits as they are supposed to be who are accounted fit to be entrusted with so great powers but why it should be called liberty with a mischief if it were otherwise or how the liberty of particular societys would be greater if they might do what they pleased than whilst they send others to act for them such wise men only as filmer can tell us for as no man or number of men can give a power which he or they have not the achaians etolians latins samnites and tuscans who transacted all things relating to their associations by delegates and the athenians carthaginians and romans who kept the power of the state in themselves were all equally free and in our days the united provinces of the netherlands the switzers and grisons who are of the first sort and the venetians genoeses and luccheses who are of the other are so also all men that have any degree of common sense plainly see that the liberty of those who act in their own persons and of those who send delegates is perfectly the same and the exercise is and can only be changed by their consent  but whatever the law or custom of england be in this point it cannot concern our question the general proposition concerning a patriarchical power cannot be proved by a single example if there be a general power every where forbidding nations to give instructions to their delegates they can do it no where if there be no such thing every people may do it unless they have deprived themselves of their right all being born under the same condition it is to no purpose to say that the nations before mentioned had not kings and therefore might act as they did for if the general thesis be true they must have kings and if it be not none are obliged to have them unless they think fit and the kings they make are their creatures but many of these nations had either kings or other magistrates in power like to them the provinces of the netherlands had dukes earls or marquesses genoa and venice have dukes if any on account of the narrowness of their territorys have abstained from the name it dos not alter the case for our dispute is not concerning the name but the right if that one man who is in the principal magistracy of every nation must be reputed the father of that people and has a power which may not be limited by any law it imports not what he is called but if in small territorys he may be limited by laws he may be so also in the greatest the least of men is a man as well as a giant and those in the westindys who have not above twenty or thirty subjects able to bear arms are kings as well as xerxes every nation may divide it self into small parcels as some have done by the same law they have restrained or abolished their kings joined to one another or taken their hazard of subsisting by themselves acted by delegation or retaining the power in their own persons given finite or indefinite powers reserved to themselves a power of punishing those who should depart from their duty or referred it to their general assemblys and that liberty for which we contend as the gift of god and nature remains equally to all  if men who delight in cavilling should say that great kingdoms are not to be regulated by the examples of small states i desire to know when it was that god ordained great nations should be slaves and deprived of all right to dispose matters relating to their government whilst he left to such as had or should divide themselves into small parcels a right of making such constitutions as were most convenient for them when this is resolved we ought to be informed what extent of territory is required to deserve the name of a great kingdom spain and france are esteemed great and yet the deputys or procuradores of the vida de carlos  0 de sandoval several parts of castille did in the cortez held at madrid in the beginning of charles the fifths reign excuse themselves from giving the supplys he desired because they had received no orders in that particular from the towns that sent them and afterward receiving express orders not to do it they gave his majesty a flat denial the like was frequently done during the reigns of that great prince and of his son philip the second and generally those procuradores never granted any thing of importance to either of them without particular orders from their principals the same way was taken in france as long as there were any general assemblys of estates and if it dos not still continue it is because there are none for no man who understood the affairs of that kingdom did ever deny that the deputys were obliged to follow the orders of those who sent them and perhaps if men would examine by what means they came to be abolished they might find that the cardinals de richelieu and mazarin with other ministers who have accomplished that work were acted by some other principle than that of justice or the establishment of the laws of god and nature in the general assembly of estates held at blois in the time of henry the third bodin then hist thuan deputy for the third estate of vermandois by their particular order proposed so many things as took up a great part of their time other deputys alleged no other reason for many things said and done by them highly contrary to the kings will than that they were commanded so to do by their superiors these general assemblys being laid aside the same custom is still used in the lesser assemblys of estates in languedoc and britany the deputys cannot without the infamy of betraying their trust and fear of punishment recede from the orders given by their principals and yet we do not find that liberty with a mischief is much more predominant in france than amongst us the same method is every day practiced in the diets of germany the princes and great lords who have their places in their own right may do what they please but the deputys of the citys must follow such orders as they receive the historys of denmark sweden poland and bohemia testify the same thing and if this liberty with a mischief dos not still continue entire in all those places it has bin diminished by such means as suit better with the manners of pirates than the laws of god and nature if england therefore dos not still enjoy the same we must have bin deprived of it either by such unjustifiable means or by our own consent but thanks be to god we know no people who have a better right to liberty or have better defended it than our own nation and if we do not degenerate from the virtue of our ancestors we may hope to transmit it entire to our posterity we always may and often do give instructions to our delegates but the less we fetter them the more we manifest our own rights for those who have only a limited power must limit that which they give but they that can give an unlimited power must necessarily have it in themselves the great treasurer burleigh said the parliament could do any thing but turn a man into a woman sir thomas moor when rich solicitor to k henry the   th asked him if the parliament might not make r rich king said that was casus levis taking it for granted that they might make or unmake whom they pleased the first part of this which includes the other is asserted by the statute of the    th of q elizabeth denouncing the most grievous punishments against all such as should dare to contradict it but if it be in the parliament it must be in those who give to parliament men the powers by which they act for before they are chosen they have none and can never have any if those that send them had it not in themselves they cannot receive it from the magistrate for that power which he has is derived from the same spring the power of making and unmaking him cannot be from himself for he that is not can do nothing and when he is made can have no other power than is conferred upon him by those that make him besides he who departs from his duty desires to avoid the punishment the power therefore of punishing him is not from himself it cannot be from the house of peers as it is constituted for they act for themselves and are chosen by kings and it is absurd to think that kings who generally abhor all restriction of their power should give that to others by which they might be unmade if one or more princes relying upon their own virtue and resolutions to do good had given such a power against themselves as trajan did when he commanded the prefect to use the sword for him if he governed well and against him if he governed ill it would soon have bin rescinded by their successors if our edward the first had made such a law his lewd son would have abolished it before he would have suffered himself to be imprisoned and deposed by it he would never have acknowledged his unworthiness to reign if he had bin tied to no other law than his own will for he could not transgress that nor have owned the mercy of the parliament in sparing his life if they had acted only by a power which he had conferred upon them this power must therefore be in those who act by a delegated power and none can give it to their delegates but they who have it in themselves the most certain testimony that can be given of their unlimited power is that they rely upon the wisdom and fidelity of their deputys so as to lay no restrictions upon them they may do what they please if they take care ne quid detrimenti respublica accipiat that the commonwealth receives no detriment this is a commission fit to be granted by wise and good men to those they choose through an opinion that they are so also and that they cannot bring any prejudice upon the nation that will not fall upon themselves and their posterity this is also fit to be received by those who seeking nothing but that which is just in it self and profitable to their country cannot foresee what will be proposed when they are all met together much less resolve how to vote till they hear the reasons on both sides the electors must necessarily be in the same ignorance and that law which should oblige them to give particular orders to their knights and burgesses in relation to every vote would make the decision of the most important affairs to depend upon the judgment of those who know nothing of the matters in question and by that means cast the nation into the utmost danger of the most inextricable confusion this can never be the intention of that law which is sanctio recta and seeks only the good of those that live under it the foresight therefore of such a mischief can never impair the libertys of the nation but establish them  sect xlv the legislative power is always arbitrary and not to be trusted in the hands of any who are not bound to obey the laws they make if it be objected that i am a defender of arbitrary powers i confess i cannot comprehend how any society can be established or subsist without them for the establishment of government is an arbitrary act wholly depending upon the will of man the particular forms and constitutions the whole series of the magistracy together with the measure of power given to every one and the rules by which they are to exercise their charge are so also magna charta which comprehends our ancient laws and all the subsequent statutes were not sent from heaven but made according to the will of men if no men could have a power of making laws none could ever have bin made for all that are or have bin in the world except those given by god to the israelites were made by them that is they have exercised an arbitrary power in making that to be law which was not or annulling that which was the various laws and governments that are or have bin in several ages and places are the product of various opinions in those who had the power of making them this must necessarily be unless a general rule be set to all for the judgments of men will vary if they are left to their liberty and the variety that is found among them shows they are subject to no rule but that of their own reason by which they see what is fit to be embraced or avoided according to the several circumstances under which they live the authority that judges of these circumstances is arbitrary and the legislators show themselves to be more or less wise and good as they do rightly or not rightly exercise this power the difference therefore between good and ill governments is not that those of one sort have an arbitrary power which the others have not for they all have it but that those which are well constituted place this power so as it may be beneficial to the people and set such rules as are hardly to be transgrest whilst those of the other sort fail in one or both these points some also through want of courage fortune or strength may have bin oppressed by the violence of strangers or suffered a corrupt party to rise up within themselves and by force or fraud to usurp a power of imposing what they pleased others being sottish cowardly and base have so far erred in the foundations as to give up themselves to the will of one or few men who turning all to their own profit or pleasure have bin just in nothing but in using such a people like beasts some have placed weak defenses against the lusts of those they have advanced to the highest places and given them opportunitys of arrogating more power to themselves than the law allows where any of these errors are committed the government may be easy for a while or at least tolerable whilst it continues uncorrupted but it cannot be lasting when the law may be easily or safely overthrown it will be attempted whatever virtue may be in the first magistrates many years will not pass before they come to be corrupted and their successors deflecting from their integrity will seize upon the illguarded prey they will then not only govern by will but by that irregular will which turns the law that was made for the public good to the private advantage of one or few men it is not my intention to enumerate the several ways that have bin taken to effect this or to show what governments have deflected from the right and how far but i think i may justly say that an arbitrary power was never well placed in any men and their successors who were not obliged to obey the laws they should make this was well understood by our saxon ancestors they made laws in their assemblys and councils of the nation but all those who proposed or assented to those laws as soon as the assembly was dissolved were comprehended under the power of them as well as other men they could do nothing to the prejudice of the nation that would not be as hurtful to those who were present and their posterity as to those who by many accidents might be absent the normans entered into and continued in the same path our parliaments at this day are in the same condition they may make prejudicial wars ignominious treatys and unjust laws yet when the session is ended they must bear the burden as much as others and when they die the teeth of their children will be set an edg with the sour grapes they have eaten but it is hard to delude or corrupt so many men do not in matters of the highest importance yield to slight temptations no man serves the devil for nothing small wages will not content those who expose themselves to perpetual infamy and the hatred of a nation for betraying their country our kings had not wherewithal to corrupt many till these last twenty years and the treachery of a few was not enough to pass a law the union of many was not easily wrought and there was nothing to tempt them to endeavor it for they could make little advantage during the session and were to be lost in the mass of the people and prejudiced by their own laws as soon as it was ended they could not in a short time reconcile their various interests or passions so as to combine together against the public and the former kings never went about it we are beholden to hde clffrd and dnby for all that has bin done of that kind they found a parliament full of lewd young men chosen by a furious people in spite to the puritans whose severity had distasted them the weakest of all ministers had wit enough to understand that such as these might be easily deluded corrupted or bribed some were fond of their seats in parliament and delighted to domineer over their neighbors by continuing in them others preferred the cajolerys of the court before the honor of performing their duty to the country that employed them some sought to relieve their ruined fortunes and were most forward to give the king a vast revenue that from thence they might receive pensions others were glad of a temporary protection against their creditors many knew not what they did when they annuld the triennial act voted the militia to be in the king gave him the excise customs and chimnymony made the act for corporations by which the greatest part of the nation was brought under the power of the worst men in it drunk or sober passed the fivemile act and that for uniformity in the church this emboldened the court to think of making parliaments to be the instruments of our slavery which had in all ages past bin the firmest pillars of our liberty there might have bin perhaps a possibility of preventing this pernicious mischief in the constitution of our government but our brave antestors could never think their posterity would degenerate into such baseness to sell themselves and their country yet how great soever the danger may be it is less than to put all into the hands of one man and his ministers the hazard of being ruined by those who must perish with us is not so much to be feared as by one who may enrich and strengthen himself by our destruction it is better to depend upon those who are under a possibility of being again corrupted than upon one who applys himself to corrupt them because he cannot otherwise accomplish his designs it were to be wished that our security were more certain but this being under god the best anchor we have it deserves to be preserved with all care till one of a more unquestionable strength be framed by the consent of the nation  sect xlvi the coercive power of the law proceeds from the authority of parliament having proved that proclamations are not laws and that the legislative power which is arbitrary is trusted only in the hands of those who are bound to obey the laws that are made it is not hard to discover what it is that gives the power of law to the sanctions under which we live our author tells us that all statutes or laws are made properly by the king alone at the rogation of the people as his majesty king james of happy memory affirms in his true law of free monarchy and as hooker teaches us that laws do not take their constraining power from the quality of such as devise them but from the power that gives them the strength of law but if the rogation of the people be necessary that cannot be a law which proceeds not from their rogation the power therefore is not alone in the king for a most important part is confessed to be in the people and as none could be in them if our authors proposition or the principles upon which it is grounded were true the acknowledgment of such a part to be in the people shows them to be false for if the king had all in himself none could participate with him if any do participate he has not all and it is from that law by which they do participate that we are to know what part is left to him the preambles of most acts of parliament manifest this by the words be it enacted by the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parliament assembled and by authority of the same but king james says filmer in his law of free monarchy affirms the contrary and it may be so yet that is nothing to us no man doubts that he desired it might be so in england but it dos not from thence appear that it is so the law of a free monarchy is nothing to us for that monarchy is not free which is regulated by a law not to be broken without the guilt of perjury as he himself speech in star chamber      confessed in relation to ours as to the words cited from hooker i can find no hurt in them to draw up the form of a good law is a matter of invention and jugdment but it receives the force of a law from the power that enacts it we have no other reason for the payment of excise or customs than that the parliament has granted those revenues to the king to defray the public charges whatever therefore king james was pleased to say in his books or in those written for him we do not so much as know that the killing of a king is treason or to be punished with death otherwise than as it is enacted by parliament and it was not always so for in the time of leg aethestani fol   ethelstan the estimates of lives were agreed in parliament and that of a king valued at thirty thousand thrymsae and if that law had not bin altered by the parliament it must have bin in force at this day it had bin in vain for a king to say he would have it otherwise for he is not created to make laws but to govern according to such as are made and sworn to assent to quas vulgus elegerit such as shall be proposed he who thinks the crown not worth accepting on these conditions may refuse it the words le roy le veut are only a pattern of the french fashions upon which some kings have laid gress stress and would no doubt have bin glad to introduce car tell est notre plaisir but that may prove a difficult matter nay in france it self where that style and all the ranting expressions that please the vainest of men are in mode no edict has the power of a law till it be registered in parliament this is not a mere ceremony as some pretend but all that is essential to a law nothing has bin more common than for those parliaments to refuse edicts sent to them by the king when john chastel had at the instigation of the jesuits stabbed henry the fourth in the mouth and that order had designed or executed many other execrable crimes they were banished out of the kingdom by an arrest of the parliament of paris some other parliaments registered the same but those of toulouse and bordeaux absolutely refused and notwithstanding all the king could do the jesuits continued at tournon and many other places within their precincts till the arrest was revoked these proceedings are so displeasing to the court that the most violent ways have bin often used to abolish them about the year    0 seguier then chancellor mem de l r f of france was sent with a great number of soldiers to oblige the parliament of paris to pass some edicts upon which they had hesitated but he was so far from accomplishing his design that the people rose against him and he thought himself happy that he escaped with his life if the parliaments do not in all parts of the kingdom continue in the liberty of approving or rejecting all edicts the law is not altered but oppressed by the violence of the sword and the prince of conde who was principally employed to do that work may i suppose have had leisure to reflect on those actions and cannot but find reason to conclude that his excellent valor and conduct was used in a most noble exploit equally beneficial to his country and himself however those who are skilled in the laws of that nation do still affirm that all public acts which are not duly examined and registered are void in themselves and can be of no force longer than the miserable people lies under the violence of oppression which is all that could reasonably be said if a pirat had the same power over them but whether the french have willingly offered their ears to be bored or have bin subdued by force it concerns us not our libertys depend not upon their will virtue or fortune how wretched and shameful soever their slavery may be the evil is only to themselves we are to consider no human laws but our own and if we have the spirit of our ancestors we shall maintain them and die as free as they left us le roy le veut tho written in great letters or pronounced in the most tragical manner can signify no more than that the king in performance of his oath dos assent to such laws as the lords and commons have agreed without prejudice to themselves and their libertys a people may suffer the king to advise with his council upon what they propose two eyes see more than one and human judgment is subject to errors tho the parliament consists of the most eminent men of the nation yet when they intend good they may be mistaken they may safely put a check upon themselves that they may farther consider the most important matters and correct the errors that may have bin committed if the kings council do discover them but he can speak only by the advice of his council and every man of them is with his head to answer for the advice he gives if the parliament has not bin satisfied with the reasons given against any law that they offered it has frequently passed and if they have bin satisfied twas not the king but they that laid it aside he that is of another opinion may try whether le roy le veut can give the force of a law to any thing conceived by the king his council or any other than the parliament but if no wise man will affirm that he can do it or deny that by his oath he is obliged to assent to those that come from them he can neither have the legislative power in himself nor any other part in it than what is formal and necessarily to be performed by him as the law prescribes  i know not what our author means by saying le roy le veut is the interpretative phrase pronounced at the passing of every act of parliament for if there be difficulty in any of them those words do no way remove it but the following part of the paragraph better deserves to be observed it was says he the ancient custom for a long time until the days of henry the fifth for the kings when any bill was brought to them that had passed both houses to take and pick out what they liked not and so much as they chose was enacted as a law but the custom of the latter kings has bin so gracious as to allow always of the entire bill as it passed both houses he judiciously observes when our kings began to be gracious and we to be free that king excepting the persecution for religion in his time which is rather to be imputed to the ignorance of that age than to any evil in his own nature governed well and as all princes who have bin virtuous and brave have always desired to preserve their subjects liberty which they knew to be the mother and nurse of their valor fitting them for great and generous enterprises his care was to please them and to raise their spirits but about the same time those detestable arts by which the mixed monarchys in this part of the world have bin every where terribly shaken and in many places totally overthrown began to be practiced charles the seventh of france under pretense of carrying on a war against him and his son took upon him to raise money by his own authority and we know how well that method has bin pursued the mischievous sagacity of his son lewis the    th which is now called kingcraft was wholly exerted in the subversion of the laws of france and the nobility that supported them his successors except only lewis the    th followed his example and in other nations ferdinand of arragon james the third of scotland and henry the seventh of england were thought to imitate him the most tho we have little reason to commend all the princes that preceded henry the fifth yet i am inclined to date the general impairing of our government from the death of that king and his valiant brothers his weak son became a prey to a furious french woman who brought the maxims of her own country into ours and advanod the worst of villains to govern according to them these measures were pursued by edward the   th whose wants contracted by prodigality and debauchery were to be supplied by fraud and rapine the ambition cruelty and perfidiousness of richard the   d the covetousness and malicious subtilty of henry the   th the violent lust rage and pride of henry the   th and the bigoted fury of q mary instigated by the craft and malice of spain persuaded me to believe that the english liberty did not receive birth or growth from the favor and goodness of their gracious princes but it seems all this is mistaken henry the   th was wise valiant and no way guided by his wife edward the fourth continent sober and contented with what the nation gave him richard the third mild gentle and faithful henry the   th sincere and satisfied with his own henry the   th humble temperate and just and queen mary a friend to our country and religion no less praises sure can be due to those who were so gracious to recede from their own right of picking what they pleased out of our laws and to leave them entirely to us as they passed both houses we are beholden to our author for the discovery of these mysterys but tho he seems to have taken an oath like that of the gypsys when they enter into that virtuous society never to speak one word of truth he is not so subtle in concealing his lies all kings were trusted with the publication of the laws but all kings did not falsify them such as were not wicked and vicious or so weak as to be made subservient to the malice of their ministers and flatterers could never be drawn into the guilt of so infamous a cheat directly contrary to the oath of their coronation they swear to pass such laws quas vulgus elegerit as the people choose but if we will believe our author they might have picked out whatever they pleased and falsely imposed upon the nation as a law made by the lords and commons that which they had modeled according to their own will and made to be different from or contrary to the intention of the parliament the kings part in this fraud of which he boasts was little more than might have bin done by the speaker or his clerks they might have falsifyd an act as well as the king tho they could not so well preserve themselves from punishment it is no wonder if for a while no stop was put to such an abominable custom twas hard to think a king would be guilty of a fraud that were infamous in a slave but that proved to be a small security when the worst of slaves came to govern them nevertheless it is probable they proceeded cautiously the first alterations were perhaps innocent or it may be for the best but when they had once found out the way they stuck at nothing that seemed for their purpose this was like the plague of leprosy that could not be cured the house infected was to be demolished the poisonous plant must be torn up by the root the trust that had bin broken was to be abolished they who had perverted or frustrated the law were no longer to be suffered to make the least alteration and that brave prince readily joined with his people to extinguish the mischievous abuse that had bin introduced by some of his worthless predecessors the worst and basest of them had continual disputes with their parliaments and thought that whatever they could detract from the liberty of the nation would serve to advance their prerogative they delighted in frauds and would have no other ministers but such as would be the instruments of them since their word could not be made to pass for a law they indeavord to impose their own or their servants inventions as acts of parliament upon the deluded people and to make the best of them subservient to their corrupt ends and pernicious counsels this if it had continued might have overthrown all our rights and deprived us of all that men can call good in the world but the providence of god furnished our ancestors with an opportunity of providing against so great so universal a mischief they had a wise and valiant prince who scorned to encroach upon the libertys of his subjects and abhorred the detestable arts by which they had bin impaired he esteemed their courage strength and love to be his greatest advantage riches and glory he aimed at the conquest of france which was only to be effected by the bravery of a free and well satisfied people slaves will always be cowards and enemies to their master by bringing his subjects into that condition he must infallibly have ruined his own designs and made them unfit to fight either for him or themselves he desired not only that his people should be free during his time but that his successors should not be able by oblique and fraudulent ways to enslave them if it be a reproach to us that women have reigned over us it is much more to the princes that succeeded our henry that none of them did so much imitate him in his government as queen elizabeth she did not go about to mangle acts of parliament and to pick out what might serve her turn but frequently passed forty of fifty in a session without reading one of them she knew that she did not reign for her self but for her people that what was good for them was either good for her or that her good ought not to come into competition with that of the whole nation and that she was by oath obliged to pass such laws as were presented to her on their behalf this not only shows that there is no such thing as a legislative power placed in kings by the laws of god and nature but that nations have it in themselves it was not by law nor by right but by usurpation fraud and perjury that some kings took upon them to pick what they pleased out of the public acts henry the fifth did not grant us the right of making our own laws but with his approbation we abolished a detestable abuse that might have proved fatal to us and if we examine our history we shall find that every good and generous prince has sought to establish our libertys as much as the most base and wicked to infringe them   the end the copy of a paper delivered to the sheriffs upon the scaffold on tower hill on friday december        by algernon sidney esquire immediately before his death men brethren and fathers friends countrymen and strangers it may be expected that i should now say some great matters unto you but the rigor of the season and the infirmitys of my age increased by a close imprisonment of above five months do not permit me  moreover we live in an age that makes truth pass for treason i dare not say any thing contrary unto it and the ears of those that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it my trial and condemnation does sufficiently evidence this  west rumsey and keyling who were brought to prove the plot said no more of me than that they knew me not and some others equally unknown to me had used my name and that of some others to give a little reputation to their designs the lord howard is too infamous by his life and the many perjurys not to be denied or rather sworn by himself to deserve mention and being a single witness would be of no value tho he had been of unblemished credit or had not seen and confessed that the crimes committed by him would be pardoned only for committing more and even the pardon promised could not be obtained till the drudgery of swearing was over  this being laid aside the whole matter is reduced to the papers said to be found in my clft by the kings officers without any other proof of their being written by me than what is taken from suppositions upon the similitude of an hand that is easily counterfeited and which has been lately declared in the lady cars case to be no lawful evidence in criminal causes  but if i had been seen to write them the matter would not be much altered they plainly appear to relate to a large treatise written long since in answer to filmers book which by all intelligent men is thought to be grounded upon wicked principles equally pernicious to magistrates and people  if he might publish to the world his opinion that all men are born under a necessity derived from the laws of god and nature to submit to an absolute kingly government which could be restrained by no law or oath and that he that has the power whether he came to it by creation election inheritance usurpation or any other way had the right and none must oppose his will but the persons and estates of his subjects must be indispensably subject unto it i know not why i might not have published my opinion to the contrary without the breach of any law i have yet known  i might as freely as he publicly have declared my thought and the reasons upon which they were grounded and i persuaded to believe that god had left nations to the liberty of setting up such governments as best pleased themselves  that magistrates were set up for the good of nations not nations for the honor or glory of magistrates  that the right and power of magistrates in every country was that which the laws of that country made it to be  that those laws were to be observed and the oaths taken by them having the force of a contract between magistrate and people could not be violated without danger of dissolving the whole fabric  that usurpation could give no right and the most dangerous of all enemies to kings were they who raising their power to an exorbitant height allowed to usurpers all the rights belonging unto it  that such usurpations being seldom compassed without the slaughter of the reigning person or family the worst of all villanys was thereby rewarded with the most glorious privileges  that if such doctrines were received they would stir up men to the destruct on of princes with more violence than all the passions that have hitherto raged in the hearts of the most unruly  that none could be safe if such a reward were proposed to any that could destro them  that few would be so gentle as to spare even the best if by their destruction a wild usurper could become gods anointed and by the most execrable wickedness invest himself with that divine character  this is the scope of the whole treatise the writer gives such reasons as at present did occur unto him to prove it this seems to agree with the doctrines of the most reverenced authors of all times nations and religions the best and wisest of kings have ever acknowledged it the present king of france has declared that kings have that happy want of power that they can do nothing contrary to the laws of their country and grounds his quarrel with the king of spain anno      upon that principle king james in his speech to the parliament anno   0  does in the highest degree assert it the scripture seems to declare it if nevertheless the writer was mistaken he might have been refuted by law reason and scripture and no man for such matters was ever otherwise punished than by being made to see his error and it has not as i think been ever known that they had been referred to the judgment of a jury composed of men utterly unable to comprehend them  but there was little of this in my case the extravagance of my prosecutors goes higher the abovementioned treatise was never finished nor could be in many years and most probably would never have been so much as is of it was written long since never reviewed nor shown to any man and the fiftieth part of it was not produced and not the tenth of that offered to be read that which was never known to those who are said to have conspired with me was said to be intended to stir up the people in prosecution of the designs of those conspirators  when nothing of particular application to time place or person could be found in it as has ever been done by those who endeavored to raise insurrections all was supplied by innuendos  whatsoever is said of the expulsion of tarquin the insurrection against nero the slaughter of caligula or domitian the translation of the crown of france from meroveus his race to pepin and from his descendents to hugh capet and the like was applied by innuendo to the king  they have not considered that if such acts of state be not good there is not a king in the world that has any title to the crown he wears nor can have any unless he could deduce his pedigree from the eldest son of noah and show that the succession had still continued in the eldest of the eldest line and been so deduced to him  every one may see what advantage this would be to all the kings of the world and whether that failing it were not better for them to acknowledge they had received their crowns by the consent of willing nations or to have no better title to them than usurpation and violence which by the same ways may be taken from them  but i was long since told that i must die or the plot must die  lest the means of destroying the best protestants in england should fail the bench must be filled with such as had been blemishes to the bar  none but such as these would have advised with the kings council of the means of bringing a man to death suffered a jury to be packed by the kings solicitors and the undersheriff admit of jury men who are not freeholders receive such evidence as is above mention d refuse a copy of an indictment or suffer the statute of    edw   to be read that does expressly enact it should in no case be denied to any man upon any occasion whatsoever overruled the most important points of law without hearing and whereas the statute    ed   upon which they said i should be tried does reserve to the parliament all constructions to be made in points of treason they could assume to themselves not only a power to make constructions but such constructions as neither agree with law reason or common sense  by these means i am brought to this place the lord forgive these practices and avert the evils that threaten the nation from them the lord sanctify these my sufferings unto me and tho i fall as a sacrifice to idols suffer not idolatry to be established in this land bless thy people and save them defend thy own cause and defend those that defend it stir up such as are saint direct those that are willing confirm those that waver give
