and j bew paternosterrow  mdcclxxviii  learning at a loss etc william easy to charles melmoth foxhall june dear melmoth i am just at this present minute in as bad a humor for letterwriting as any private gentleman need be you see i confine myself to privates for statesmen and secretaries methinks should be allowed some greater degree of latitude for their displeasures on this head as being more perpetually tormented with it you will find by my date where my quarters are i have been here about a week just time enough to assist at the reception of your brother who arrived but a day after me he was followed on tuesday last by two maiden aunts of sir thorobreds who live together at york and were so obliging as to favor foxhall with their company till this morning when they left us which i believe their ungracious nephew is not very sorry for what a tribe of aunts he has two at york two at woodstock all virgins and a fifth at last married and settled in essex after having lived in fear of the apes for above these twenty years  i spent an incomparable evening yesterday which perhaps you would not have suspected when you hear who were our party it consisted of miss rugg her two aunts aforesaid your brother strongly contrasted by tom fetlock who is now in possession of the living the baronet and myself sir thorobred having tired himself with lunging a young stonehorse in the morning suffered the conversation to turn upon general topics and newspaper intelligences only reserving to himself the liberty of putting in a sentence now and then as he thought proper having dispatched the common business of weather and remarked without reflection that such a day had been excessive cold or intensely hot or wet or dry or neither without any regard to the matter of fact which indeed was not necessary as the acquiescing spirit of the company entirely agreed in whatever the first person advanced however the common sense and acceptance of words might suffer by their politeness we proceeded to touch a little upon american matters and the behavior of a late reverend criminal at his execution alas poor doctor cried aunt dorothy who for some time had been nodding over her snuff box whilst the combination of snivel and rappee streamed its chocolate defluxions down her handkerchief poor man well they say he made a fine end why my dear madam cried sir thorobred yawning he entered at the post didnt he and i am told there was a dead heat though some indeed pretend that he was smuggled over to france which i dont believe a word of why i was there says fetlock who affects to be a cockfighter and i never in my life saw any man die better game than he did aye and struck to the last to be sure he wheeled at first a little but say what they will your wheeling cocks always fight the best battle what say you thorobred miss rugg smiled the old ladies sniffed and wiped their noses and the captain relaxing his features agreeably took out his toothpickcase and began playing with the contents of it  i have told you that i arrived here about a week ago but have not mentioned a mistake i had nearly fallen into on getting out of my chaise i saw a tall young fellow standing in the yard with dark hair cropped short a narrowbrimmd roundhat bound with black ferret upon his head and his tout ensemble exactly corresponding with my ideas of a groom or a stableboy not happening to think of fetlock i was just meditating a salutation of holla my lady to ask his assistance in bringing in my luggage when he turned round and thereby saved me an infinity of confusion and apologies which i should otherwise infallibly have intailed upon myself his dress was a light gray coat with black buttons an outer waistcoat of green and white striped cotton under which as it was open at the breast i could descry at least seven flannel ones faced with as many scraps of different colored sattins a pair of fustian breeches with a profusion of string at the kneebands white thread stockings a colored silk handkerchief round his neck and an hookdstick in his hand  having suppressed my intended exclamation i accosted him as a gentleman and made some feeble efforts toward entering into an equine conversation which however i soon found my utter incapacity of supporting being in less than five minutes so completely bewildered with a variety of cant phrases and technical terms that i was obliged to change the subject for one more generally intelligible during this time sir thorobred was at some distance in a field earnestly examining the heel of one of his hunters which fetlock told me was gorged a little and as he was upon his hands and knees with his hair hanging loose about his shoulders he exhibited methought no unapt representation of king nebuchadnezzar at grass toward the end of his seven years metamorphosis nor was the similitude at all diminished by his nearer approach to us for his dwelling had been with the beasts of the field and his body was wet with the dew of heaven and his beard was grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws  upon his coming up to us i received from him an honest hearty downright welcome exemplified or rather expressed by a violent blow on the shoulder and such a shake by the hand as exposed the economy of my bones and cartilages to intolerable jeopardy and which indeed nothing but the extremity of friendship would have induced me to submit to as his paws were by no means exempt from the nastiness attendant on farriery having however survived the satation without material injury we all three adjourned to his study as he has thought proper to denominate it and indeed upon reflection i think he has much reason on his side though probably without being sensible of it cicero if you remember defines studium or study to be the attention and application of the mind to some one particular object and therefore though the name of a study or repository for such things as may assist us in this pursuit usually conveys the idea of a room particularly devoted to books and literature inasmuch as the studium of the generality of people tends that way yet it is equally applicable to a room equipped in any manner whatsoever provided that manner bears the same affinity to the studium of its possessor whether our friends did you shall be your own judge the size of the room you know is small with two windows a door and a fireplace the literary part of its furniture consisted of a pretty considerable quantity of old newspapers magazines racing calendars and lists of running horses which entirely occupied the window seats and invellopd the greatest part of the floor on his table was a bartletts farriery garnished with spurs spurleathers and a bootjack and the remains of euclids elements without a cover which he informed me was going the way of all its university companions being constantly made use of at his cloacinean sacrifices his chimney was decorated with jockey whips perpendicularly suspended from their thongs and every other part of the walls seemed loaded with an astonishing variety of curbs snaffles cavessons and martingals with five thousand other instruments of equestrian utility full as curious and entertaining to me as the weapons of new zealand or otaheite or the old bandoleers and shot pouches in the armoury in the tower as it wanted some hours to dinner we agreed that a bottle of strong beer and some slices of cold ham would not be unseasonable these were procured and dispatched speedily after which i retired to dress myself as did my two companions to try a young horse of fetlocks at the leaping bar  miss rugg and your brother seem to find each other exceedingly agreeable and if i may presume to prophesy will not be averse in due time to a junction of forces the captains method of attack is not of the most vigorous nature but i dare say is a very sure and judicious one he seems to entertain the same idea of marrying a wife that he would of purchasing an house or a farm i dont mean venally but he seems to consider it as a serious bargain to be made which must be abided by and would therefore choose as thorough an acquaintance with the nature of his purchase as possible this is all very right i dare say charles but i cannot be so exceeding methodical upon the occasion i cannot help admitting a little of the volatilized spirit of love into my composition whereas he conducts himself with a calm settled resolution never suffering any flames or darts to enter his head on the occasion not that i consider myself as a dying strephon with willows and billows and pillows to recline on nor yet as a hot frantic firebrand full of jealousy and madness committing extravagancies one minute on purpose to beg pardon for them the next nor in short any way altered in the usual tenor of my behavior by the fascination of female attractions at least i hope not for they say people in love are blind to the absurdities of their own conduct pray tell me therefore in friendship if you discover any thing in my letters at all savouring of bedlam or whether you should think it necessary to consult monro or battie upon the occasion  hei mihi quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis said apollo the head of the college of physicians a good many years ago when he was desperately unsuccessful in some love affair and rather desponding and low about it however he speaks only of the vegetable world so perhaps since the introduction of minerals into medicine a poor lovers case may not be quite so immedicable in expectation of your opinion on this head i remain my dear charles  yours sincerely w easy  captain melmoth to charles melmoth esquire foxhall july my dear brother it would perhaps be needless to say any thing about the heat of the weather to you did i not intend to employ it as the excuse for my epistolary omissions upon m honor it has been too intense for these last ten days to attempt any thing particularly so laborious a business as that of letterwriting my hours here pass on very smoothly calm and unruffled unless by the occasional vociferation of my good baronet who is eternally abusing me because i sometimes read italian and avowedly proclaim my detestation of the smell of horsedung i guess you have heard how much i am determined upon marrying his sister she is a very good girl and i think may contribute to make me more comfortable than i am at present so i have been laying regular siege to her heart and understanding ever since my arrival and i believe with considerable success sir thorobred approves of it in his way as much as i can wish him i approve of it highly our fortunes are sufficient to authorize the step and in short nothing is wanted but her consent absolute for i consider her tacit as given already and her uncles approbation to conclude our treaty what think you charles shall i do well ex nitido fieri rusticus to change my red coat with lace for an unornamented brown one and without becoming savage or grazier to endeavor at getting my health in a quiet family way and raising children for the defense of my country in future instead of personally fighting for it at present i have told you already that my time passes very smoothly but i will give you a description of my daily labors and let you judge for yourself i generally rise about seven and stroll into the garden with my constant companion lord chesterfield here we walk for about an hour entertaining ourselves with each others conversation and every two or three turns perhaps stopping to take a view of sir thorobred who is deeply engaged on the other side of the hedge in the elegant occupation of breaking two young horses for his phaeton and haranguing his friend fetlock who attends with a long whip in his hand in all the mode and figure of equestrian vulgarity enter nous this fetlock is sometimes a most intolerable fatigue to me the baronet is at least a rational savage and will sometimes divert and be entertaining even upon the subject of his own oddities but his chaplain or aid du camp is insipid to the most distressing degree sir thorobred often attempts to better my opinion of him by informing me what an honest goodnatured fellow he is and far be it from me to say otherwise it would be cruel to detract from the merits of a person who can so very ill afford it twere like robbing a poor beggar of his halfpenny but still it is hard one must be condemned to suffer his company he never commits even a laughable absurdity unless by mere accident the most ridiculous anecdote i ever heard concerning him and that too by the contrivance of sir thorobred was his falling asleep at foxhall after a drinking match on saturday afternoon and continuing in that situation till the monday morning i believe it was not above a week before my arrival when he waked about eight oclock perfectly sober dressed himself breakfasted took his horse out of the stable and departed very quietly with his sermon in his pocket to officiate at his parish church which is about a mile distant upon his arrival there however not finding any appearance of a congregation he rode twice round the churchyard kicked stoutly at the vestry door damned his clerk and parishioners parately and altogether for a parcel of negligent heathens and returned perfectly satisfied that he had at least performed his duty and paid a due reverence to the sanctity of the sabbath  well after breakfast charles i attach myself to miss rugg ride or walk out with her and discourse of my exploits in america of battles sieges fortunes of moving accidents by flood and field of hairbreadth escapes in the imminent deadly breach and so on till like another desdemona she almost loves me for the dangers i have past and i love her that she does pity them for in truth many of them were very worthy of pity and such as i will not undergo again whilst the enemy keep on their own side the atlantic many times charles during our confinement in boston have i worn the same shirt for three days together lived invariably upon rice and salt pork and when at length the place was evacuated i was absolutely reduced to my last pint of lavender water sometimes these conversations are broken in upon by sir thorobred who enquires whether we could turn our horses to grass there and how much a load i supposed our hay might cost government apropos of sir thorobred he always wears his hat in the house and has besides an uncivilized custom of throwing his legs into the seat of any chair that happens to stand near him if empty or if occupied he entangles his boots and spurs so effectually with the bars of it as to expose the stockings of his neighbor to unavoidable destruction and his body to imminent danger of a fall i was sitting next to him yesterday evening when he entertained himself in this manner presently i rose from my chair in which as i expected his legs immediately posted themselves sir thorobred said i that chair i left for your hat to lie in and apropes de botes ringing the bell i am now going to give orders that the gouty cradle may be brought to support your legs which i should think a much properer place for them he stared for half a minute in my face damned me for an odd fellow flung his hat into the middle of the room called for his slippers and begging i would lend him my pocketglass began digging his jaw bone with his horsepicker as composedly as if it had been the hoof of the animal it appertained to  alas poor brute he is utterly incorrigible i believe i have several times attempted persuading him to keep his nails within some tolerable bounds of civilized longitude for at present they are entirely in a state of unimproved nature full as extensive and infinitely less delicate than the talons of a chinese mandarin but i have not the happiness of discovering the least shadow of improvement arising from it ah thorobred thou art a well meaning fellow but  my dear baronet   adieu charles yours george melmoth  charles melmoth to william easy melmoth place july my dear easy i am sorry to write on a subject which i doubt not will sensibly afflict you our poor friend harry is no more i received a letter yesterday from ned freeman who went abroad with him informing me of his decease wearied of life says he before he had well entered into it with a temper soured by reflection and a constitution ruined by excess he died unknown and unregarded at lisbon in the twentysecond year of his age except myself and his servant there was not a soul in the place that he could speak to we were with him in his last moments and i declare to you that it was with the utmost difficulty i supported myself through the scene there is at all times something inconceivably awful in that last agony of convulsed nature but in the present instance it was particularly so to see him pale and emaciated falling in the prime of youth a sacrifice to his own imprudence to see every feature distorted every nerve striving with its dissolution and nature by her strong repeated struggles loudly exclaiming that her time was not yet come is a spectacle too affecting to be looked upon with composure it was near three hours before he breathed his last with his eyes fixed steadfastly on me and his hands firmly grasping one of mine before you receive this i shall probably be on my passage to england with our poor friends body  surely easy this is a melacholy history the inattention of his guardians and the certain prospect of an immense fortune immediately upon his coming of age were the cause of his misfortunes happy had it been for him if his father had lived a few years longer it is amazing too how greatly his manner of life had altered his disposition he had latterly lost all that mirth that ease and gaiety of heart which rendered his company so universally desirable and was become peevish and dissatisfied with every thing i never shall forget what he said to me as we were sitting together in his dressing room but a few weeks before he went abroad i think it was the last conversation we ever had together melmoth says he i am unhappy i am sick of my follies and almost wearied of my life i enter into company without enjoying it i frequent public places but they are become indifferent and irksome to me nothing amuses me i wish i had lived as you have melmoth  to quit a subject so unpleasant let me enquire a little into your course of employment at foxhall for instance how do you spend your mornings do you ride or walk or sit at home and read those curious tracts which you say sir thorobreds study abounds with i should think with a little application under so excellent a master you might soon acquire a very competent stock of theoretical horsemanship i never presume to expect anything considerable from you in the practical parts a few days ago i received advices from george giving such satisfactory accounts of his amatorial progresses that i expect every newspaper to read particulars of the marriage i am heartily glad to find matters in so fair a train with him because i think he will do a much wiser thing in marrying an amiable girl with a good fortune than in returning to live upon saltbeef and honor in america i have a wife easy and i want to see all my friends in the same situation which believe me is a much more comfortable one than many silly people imagine with due compliments to the inhabitants of foxhall in general and that centaur sir thorobred in particular i remain  yours ever charles melmoth  william easy to charles melmoth foxhall july dear melmoth your melancholy account of our friends decease gives me much concern poor harry i am sincerely sorry for him not that he is dead for i do not think death a thing to be lamented nor yet that he died in the prime of life it is not his end but the causes and manner of it the unhappy course of dissipation which occasioned it and the stain that may throw upon a character in itself truly amiable which i grieve for but i will not trouble you with a detail of reflections on this head as i have thrown them into a few elegiac stanzas to disbuthen my mind a little of a subject which i could not help dwelling upon these i send to you in confidence so far however from wishing though i have disposed them in the manner of an epitaph that they should be inscribed on his monument that i even would not choose they should be seen by any person except those few friends who can drop a tear of pity when they chance to think of his failings but will always honor his memory for the goodness and excellence of his heart  in memoriam infelicis juvenis here sleeps a martyr to illicit love the breast that once each nobler feeling fired the mind that virtues self might well approve had prudence checked what amorous youth inspired pure were his thoughts and innocent his joys but early wealth seduced his easy soul soft scenes of pleasure seemed to court his choice and youth and nature sickend at control each varied luxury of sense was there that art could form or fancys powers design fair laughed the feast with mirthful freedom fair and beauty crowned the imperfect joys of wine alas how soon the illusive pageant flies dark clouds of death obscure his dawning day in a strange land unknown unwept he lies a dreadful warning to the young and gay unknown unwept save where the secret tear steals in sad silence from the muses eyes lest wrinkled age injuriously severe should wrong his follies with the name of vice but ye wild partners of my hapless friend pass not unheedful by this sacred stone and when your heaving breasts would mourn his end mourn for his frailties and correct your own adieu my poor inconsiderate friend the earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so brave a gentleman adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave but not remembered in thy epitaph and now melmoth let me answer your questions concerning myself and my amusements in the first place then all my odd halfhours which are a good many are devoted to the study of tookes pantheon and the nomina propria in ainsworths dictionary can you conceive any thing more edifying but i read them to refresh my memory and prepare myself more fully for an heathenish style of conversation with pedant if he should happen to spend the summer with us at hartleys the books lie upon the floor in sir thorobreds study from whence drafts are made occasionally to be employed in the same services as his euclids elements and indeed i find their pages suffer such considerable decrease that i am obliged to study very vigorously in order to keep up with him in his consumption then i sometimes ride after breakfast but soberly as lady grace says not in the frantic whip and cut style of a nimrod nor with the more dignified pomposity of the manege like a king william the third in old tapestry and then if any log or broken hurdle or furzebush should sprout up in my way i never risque the whole army at once but pass it in two divisions videlicet myself first as being of the greatest consequence and afterward my cavalry or sometimes if the passage should be very much obstructed i place my horse in the van as pioneer or forlorn hope and bring up myself as the sustaining party you know which he is sir thorobreds old gray poney i can tell you we are very great friends age and experience have cooled down all the little tricks and vanities which more youthful quadrupeds are subject to and as each pays the most punctilious regard to his own particular safety we are excessively cautious of hazarding anything that might break the bond of union between us i fear however we shall be under the necessity of parting in a day or two as my time of furlow is nearly elapsed and old hartley will begin to be impatient for the execution of his university plans vale charles believe me  yours w easy  miss hartley to miss rugg hillstreet july well my cunning reserved little madam i have heard of all your coquetries to ensnare the poor melmoth though you have not thought fit to write to me since his arrival amongst you indeed i think you might have found some spare half hour to scribble in and acquaint me a little how matters went on especially as you had declared your intentions with such a pretty blushing bashfulness in your last letter upon my honor you deserve to be plagued a little should nothing material prevent i shall probably spend great part of the summer with my brother as he seems to wish much for my company  how very pretty and sisterlike that was of you was not it but then we are not without hopes of seeing captain melmoth how that comes stealing in as if it thought to escape unobserved and presently it is somehow or other i wish he may come down to us how we have changed by degrees from the plural to the singular and then in the next sentence he is such an agreeable man and so ready to do as i please with  o you little gipsey they may talk as they please but i will be hanged if one such little puritan as yourself will not cost a lover more pains and attendance and give him more plague aye and play him more tricks too than half a dozen of us madheaded ones and then to put yourself to the trouble of telling a naughty story and denying it and afterward running into the lovesick strain so artfully as if you had forgot that you were writing about your brother  indeed i must in charity believe that you did it all on purpose or i shall never have any mercy on you but you should really have written to me for my part i have nothing but scribbling to amuse me at present easy as you may guess by the time of his leaving foxhall came here but tuesday and this morning he was packed up in a postchaise with my father and transported to oxford in pursuit of my spouse and tutor elect poor fellow i dare say he could have found a better without the expense of traveling in search of him however he is gone and his poor disconsolate kitty has no other business but to wake and weep and read novels by lamplight all night and to write letters and accompany despairing ditties with her piano forte all day however i made him swear eternal fidelity and so forth in the true style of chivalry before his departure to that country of necromancers and inchanters whom he promises to destroy and spare not unless they acknowledge the incomparable princess he worships to be the very flower and paragon of perfection nay he farther engages that he will make them appear in due form as slaves before my footstool saying i am the profound metaphysician and logician puzzlearius governor of the college of a b who being vanquished by the superior valor and arguments etc etc  i fancy he will find this task rather difficult for by the specimen i have seen i believe the odd things would rather forfeit all pretensions to chivalry and every thing else than endure the terror of passing five minutes in a womans company in which time at farthest they must have emptied their whole budget of conversation to speak seriously though i have no idea of pedants being prevailed upon to return with them by any arguments whatsoever if he should not my fathers plan of operations for the present at least will be entirely deranged and before he can form any new ones easy is to chop logic quote greek bring him into a good humor after dinner and then having recounted his numerous services and unparalled disinterestedness ask my hand of him in form if on the contrary the pedantic animals avarice or some other strange infatuation should prompt him to hazard a long vacation in dorsetshire why he will be a delightful subject to exercise ones ill humors upon and after having stayed there till every idea has been ridiculed out of him he may return home to be the laughing stock of his fellow savages and leave easy in peaceable possession of the victory and the prize for i dont doubt my fathers goodness if we can but once drive this nonsensical chimera out of his head  oh i must tell you now though whilst i think of it what a sacrifice easy has made at my shrine and what incense he has been offering to that dear favorite foible of ours vanity he begged indeed an assuming fellow that i would not communicate them to any body but we women you know never can conceal these matters from each other though i really do not think you deserve them after the sly style of secrecy which you would have adopted toward me if your pen would have suffered you however if you will beg pardon and be a good girl i will not keep you any longer in suspense they are two languishing epistles the produce of an unalterable passion which he sustained in his younger days for a lady whom he calls delia and to whom he is distantly related  as delias papa and mama lived entirely in the country the young people had not met since they were children and colins parents for so he calls himself having no very good opinion of miss delia had often described her to him in a manner not the most favorable one summer however they resolved to pay old mr delia a months or six weeks visit and it being vacation time with young mr colin who was then of the university he of course accompanied them and then it was that the superlative excellence and goodness of miss delia struck him through the liver poor man he was in a sad way about it for miss delia though she treated him very kindly was unluckily engaged already to a man of very considerable fortune and when after some time he attempted to prefer his suit she revealed to him the state of the case and showed him one or two letters from her other lover mr corydon which entirely drove poor colin to desperation then it fortunately happened that instead of hanging or drowning himself as a downright ignorant fellow would have done in similar circumstances poetry came to his aid and he presented her with the first epistle  soon afterward she became mrs corydon and within a month more the inexorable parcae cut down her husband upon this not having leisure to versify lest any other claimant would step in before him he had nothing for it but to administer comfort as early as possible in plain prose and endeavor to bring himself upon the tapis again she however is utterly inconsolable and after having got the funeral over and taken a little time for consideration absolutely determines upon a perpetual retirement and seclusion from the world in general this you may imagine produces a second piece of poetry from her inamorato longer than the first wherein after having said a great many fine things and attacked her with a profusion of morality and sentiment he considers himself as bound in common politeness to imitate her illustrious example pitches upon a very pretty cave for the place of his retirement and resolves to surrender his body to tears and meditations whilst living and to fleshflies and jackdaws after he is dead without benefit of clergy or christian burial in consequence of these pious determinations on both sides she is married within a twelvemonth to a man old enough to be her grandfather but with a very large fortune and he having amused himself for several years amongst the groves and solitude of the temple gardens is at present  just as i would have him be  i have enclosed the two pieces of poetry which he gave me the prose i was only suffered to read before he burnt them  adieu my dear rugg believe me your very affectionate catharine hartley colin to delia on her approaching marriage with corydon read or o say have present joys effaced each thought each fond remembrance of the past can that blessed rival censure one sad sigh one transient tear to me and misery read nor with cold severity reprove the unconquered struggles of distracted love grant one last look of comfort to my grief one sympathetic strain of sad relief then all my woes in dark oblivion drown and yield thy soul to bliss and corydon cursed be the hour  no  be it ever blessed when first thy beauty struck myastonishd breast the wild luxuriance of thine auburn hair thy mien majestic face divinely fair seemed like the ideal phantom of a dream i saw i wondered but could not esteem vile prejudice with bigoted control checked every nobler feeling of my soul still in my ear base slander whispered lies beheld vivacity and named it vice did any dare applaud your wit or sense twas sneering satire all and impudence  gods how i erred could i thus grossly sin or think so fair a form so foul within thus think of her whose virtues now i see and honor almost to idolatry yet how sincerely i bewailed my crimes and cursed the unfeeling malice of the times cursed my weak heart that could so soon believe such excellence was made but to deceive bear witness heaven and thou fair maid forgive for whom alone i can endure to live forgive this error it is my last request then welcome solitude my minds at rest scarce had three suns their daily circuit ran and the fourth morn revealed its light to man when with full radiance on my dazzled sense beamed forth the wonders of your excellence there veiled in all the sprightliness of youth sat meekeyed modesty and honest truth there calm religion reigned with sweet control the sanctity of thought and snow of soul their heaven descended influence there combined to prove thy face less beauteous than thy mind slander beheld and shuddring with affright plunged headlong midst the shades of endless night ah me whilst yet i breath my mournful strain fresh woes arise and aggravate my pain fixed in my tortured minds distracted waste sits memory tween the present and the past forming dire parallels how erst among the shadowing groves dark gloom we roved along then whilst my soul dissolved in amorous bliss planned idle schemes of endless happiness thy voice soft soothing flattered my desire roused every sense and filled my breast with fire thus rapt in extacy my moments past ah extacy too wonderful to last when one cursed hour one blasting stroke of fate down hurled me from my pinnacle of state snatched every vain ideal hope of bliss and whelmed me deep in woes extreme abyss unfeeling maid by such harsh means to prove the boundless influence of almighty love had those sad papers been at first revealed or ever from my cheated sight concealed one last farewell one heartbreaking adieu had torn my struggling soul from love and you or still of happy ignorance possessed i had enjoyed a visionary rest till shuddring with astonishment and fear loud nuptial hymns had pierced myaffrighted ear and as with lightning blasted my strange doom had sunk me deep deep in the graves dark womb think not i seek to interrupt your joys upbraid your conduct or condemn your choice my happy rival boasts far nobler birth vows earlier plighted and superior worth propitious fortune blessed his natal hour and plutus hailed him in a golden shower ten thousand heifers over his pastures rove  my only wealth was competence and love no  could you pitying as these lines you see bid me still live to happiness and thee could you for me unmindful of your vows burst from the embraces of your promised spouse for me in some lone cot consent to dwell and bid your country and your friends farewell wretch though i am the prize i would still forego nor wish such joys even to my deadliest foe live long and happy nor disturb your bliss with one sad thought of colins wretchedness or should soft pity prompt you still to bear the memory of a youth you once held dear still grant me your esteem since love must end and though the wife be lost remain the friend colin to delia on the death of corydon written at the university if from these gloomy walls these antique towers where meagre study wastes the midnight hours where pedant learning sits severe nor knows the anguish of an hopeless lovers woes yet delia yet again it is given to mourn vent all my griefs nor be received with scorn accept these heartfelt strains nor fear to join the bitter sorrows of thy cup with mine mix tear with tear heave flow the alternate sigh we may at least unite in misery this step nor friends nor fortune disallows nor the pale phantom of thy shrouded spouse o corydon in lifes aspiring bloo snatched from a brides embraces to the tomb methinks i see thy lingering spirit fly and scarce quit her for heaven without a sigh methinks i see thee midst the angelic choir strike the soft warblings of thy pensive lyre with listless eye the aetherial mansions range look sadly down and half regret the change rest virtuous youth supremely blessed in heaven nor scorn this tribute by a rival given no storied urn no funeral dirge you need vain empty offerings to the senseless dead silent be fame and hushed be every voice your worth stands blazoned by your delias choice nor thou fair maid esteem it feigned that here i breath sad strains of sorrow over his bier to see thee blessed was all my wish below the first best gift gods bounty could bestow those dreams are fled so cruel fate decreed and a long train of thickening ills succeed rest of your lord no second you approve but shrine your soul in monumental love by the pale tapers dimly glimmering light count the long moments of the tedious night or with slow step majestically sad seek the damp aisle where his cold corse is laid invoke his shade to prove your vow sincere and bid the world farewell without a tear and can thou delia can thou waste thy bloom in some dark solitudes sequestered gloom can thou forget the honors of thy race say can thou yield that fair that faultless face a prey to grief a voluntary slave so sweet a flower to wither over a grave  no  yet again in this worlds pleasures join again in all thy fatal beauty shine in social mirth lifes transient hours employ nor sourd by grief nor mad with thoughtless joy on reasons rules let every action move what she prescribes religion must approve let peevish dotards bid the world adieu and censure joys they can no more pursue let avarice barter soul and bodys health to roll in piles of solitary wealth let superstition big with righteous pride pardning herself damn all the world beside with pious rancour against mankind inveigh and thank her god she is not made as they condemn the blessings by his mercy given to smooth this mortal pilgrimage to heaven it is thine to spend thy little hour on earth in social comforts and becoming mirth catch the worlds guiltless pleasures as they fly thankful to live yet not afraid to die breath the soft air of resignations gale thus speaks thy friend and let his voice prevail and is that all must my fierce passions bend to the cold names of monitor and friend can those weak formal empty titles prove to what excess of misery i love ah fond aspiring interested youth in vain you preach up righteousness and truth in vain with pious fraud yourself deceive and teach your willing senses to believe pretend it is pure religions flame you feel and grace your passion with the name of zeal nor grace nor zeal love only fires your lays it is the heart dictates and the hand obeys come then in all thy pride of beauty come pronounce my sentence stamp my final doom come  let me clasp thee in myenrapturd arms drink in thy matchless luxury of charms with quivering lips caressing and carest rouse the tumultuous heavings of thy breast then lost in love and sickening with desire sunk on thy neck triumphantly expire alas how wildly do my senses rove yet who can hope consistency in love  is this the preacher will my delia cry is this the youth of wondrous piety the friend who late with righteous fervor glowed and bade me learn submission to my god taught me his bounties were not given in vain to be neglected by desponding man and would he now my peace of mind destroy midst the rude transports of illicit joy mar the fair prospects of my future life and bid me stoop to be a beggars wife o rare humility best gift of heaven sure means for all my sins to be forgiven cease delia cease nor with too hasty tongue condemn the wretch who never wished you wrong o were the fierce conflicting struggles known twixt grace and love your welfare and my own could you but feel what seas of passion roll and pang with boisterous rage my tortured soul your gentle heart would pity not reprove the hapless youth whose only crime was love farewell  from every hope of comfort driven i here devote my future hours to heaven far from the noise and busy hum of men my soul has formed a melancholy scene an unfrequented cave mossy and old there save the tinklings of some distant fold or some small brook high overgrown with reeds that bubbling winds its waters amongst the weeds silence shall reign  no trace of man intrude upon the still sequestered solitude unless some hapless wretchs skeleton who long time since like me by love undone sought that sad place out to despair and die there mixed with his my scattered bones shall lie there mixed with his in dark oblivion rot alike unwept unhonourd and forgot or should strange chance some wandering shepherds lead to these lone mansions of the unburied dead shaking their pensive heads they will drop a tear of generous pity on our mossgrown bier then sighing say as the sad tale they tell alas these loved not wisely but too well   mr hartley to sir anthony artichoke hillstreet july my dear sir anthony i am so overjoyed i am the happiest man alive all my schemes have succeeded and i have been down to oxford and have brought up mr pedant with me and we are as happy and as learned as the day is long and we are all going down to dorsetshire in a day or two and now my old friend since every thing has turned out so prosperously i will let you into the secret which i talked of in my former letters and inform you who has been my confidant and assistant in managing this business i say since every thing has turned out so prosperously for else you know as well as i can tell you that least said is soonest mended and bad news always comes fast enough and the like his name is william easy a young man about seven or eight and twenty his father and i were old schoolfellows and cronies at hackney together poor old easy he used to be sadly troubled with the gout latterly like myself and went to bath once or twice in a year constantly and would you believe it the young fellow his son found me out when i was there last before i visited staples you know aye and came to breakfast with me too and was as glad to see me the young rogue was as if i had been of his own age let them say what they will of the vices and follies of the present race of young men i am glad to find they are not all so corrupt and he is clever too in the bargain and has read a good deal and has seen a good deal of the world too i dare say which is no harm when it does not interfere with a mans learning now what person do you think could be so proper to assist in managing this business of a husband for kitty as he was for his manner of introducing himself at first to me showed how disinterested he was and that he came to see me purely because i was so well acquainted with his poor old father and what a regard he had for me upon that account so i communicated all my intentions to him and he approved of them highly and accompanied me in my journey to oxford and talked to me about the prometheus of aeschylus and aristotles treatise upon rhetoric by the hour together as we went along and i have engaged him to come down with me to dorsetshire to complete the affair so mr pedant and myself i wanted to have persuaded mr pedant to have gone down in the same carriage with my daughter by way of making a beginning you know but he chose rather to go with me so mr pedant and myself will travel in my chariot and four and i must make an apology to easy about going in an hired chaise with my daughter and they can keep on before and prepare things at the inns for us do write to me soon and tell me what your opinion is of all this and believe me to be  your most faithful friend christopher hartley  william easy to charles melmoth dorsetshire august dear charles that i have for this week past intended epistolizing melmoth place is as certain as that i have omitted doing it and you perhaps would now have been as well satisfied with goodnaturedly taking the will for the deed and compounding for my not writing at all however since the pen is put to paper you shall have no reason to complain of my brevity in correspondence be your passion for letterreading ever so excessive it is now about three weeks since i made my escape from oxford from whence in conjunction with old hartley i have effected the peregrination of pedant to this western world a piece of success as far beyond my expectation as my wishes indeed i had not the smallest idea that any thing could have induced him to such a desperate undertaking and should have been full as well pleased had he been inexorable to our entreaties for by the frequent consultations he has held with the old gentleman for these last three or four days and some other little incidents i suspect there is more in the wind than i am aware of however as i dont feel myself disposed to stand greatly in awe of their intentions whatever they may be i shall drop him for the present and commence the journal or history of our university expedition  about the middle of july then within two days after my return from foxhall to hillstreet i was put on board a postchaise with old hartley about eight oclock in the morning and about four in the afternoon found myself with my companion at the cross inn oxford as it happened to be during the time of the public act the town was tolerably crowded so having deposited our baggage in the best room we could meet with we procured proper directions to mr pedants chambers and immediately sallied out in pursuit of them many and curious were the figures we encountered in our way and of all sizes and dimensions several of them i remembered as my contemporaries with whom in those days i had been very well acquainted but the devil or my evil genius or some strange circumstance that i was not apprized of had so transformed and disfigured me since that time that not a man of them could i prevail upon to remain within gunshot of me if i ran hollowed or called them by their names it served but to increase their velocity in retreating they scudded up their staircases like black rabbits in a warren and i believe it was near ten minutes before i could procure any creature to assist me with farther instructions toward the discovery of pedants residence at last i had the good fortune to meet tom frankley your neighbor harboroughs nephew who is a gentleman commoner of the same college he conducted us immediately to the object of our pursuit and begged if i was not already engaged i would call in the evening and sup with him and bring old hartley with me i told him that i feared supper would not be in my power but that i would certainly call upon him about eight oclock though i could not promise farther so we parted and mr hartley and myself proceeded up the staircase toward the door of pedants apartment unluckily it happened that not thinking of the still caution necessary in an attack of this sort we advanced carelessly talking as our vanguard approached the outworks and thereby effectually excluded ourselves from all possibility of entering for just as we turned round the last landingplace the vigilance of the enemy was alarmed the outer door shut with a thunder clap and all within was silent you may imagine that after this all the knocking and noise we could make would be of very little service so we were obliged to content ourselves for the present with the supposition that he probably was busied as old hartley said in some metaphysical investigation but that he would go there by himself in the evening and attempt him a second time by surprise this plan of proceeding i entirely applauded as it released me from all the purgatorial discipline of such a service and gave me the better opportunity of supping with frankley whose conversation though less abstruse would probably be more entertaining so having drank our tea together quietly at the coffeehouse i left my companion planning the mode of his attack over a newspaper and went immediately to fulfill my engagement and most excellently entertained i was both with the behavior and conversation of my company so much so that without any apology i shall send you a minute detail of the whole business which if you find yourself too stupid or lazy to read with due attention i desire you will forthwith send back to me again with all proper thanks and acknowledgements carriage paid  well to frankleys i went then sat down and having got through the first necessary business of speechifying and enquiries was just verging toward a discourse upon university matters in general when on a sudden preceded however by an infinite variety of tallios hoickss hark to venoms vipers vixens vermins which we perceived gradually increasing from the opposite side of the quadrangle the door flew open and in rushed a party of gentlemen who it seems from their particular attachment to that species of cur as well as from the exact similarity of their noises are called the terriers at the head of this extraordinary troop was a mr jack solecism who first discovered his capability of articulation by a damn that villainous rascal euclid to      i wish the fellow         and whatever else is usual on such occasions  this curious exclamation which having lasted for some minutes terminated but with the breath of the utterer was accompanied by a loud amen in chorus from the rest of the company presently several of them snatched chairs and threw themselves into them for the benefit of conversation well frankley says solecism to my friend after all this college is a damned place here am i now a fellow allowedly clever preposterously so now and then a little drunk to be sure why they puzzle and torture me at their examinations worse than a rich criminal in an inquisition strike me sober if i know whether their examinations are most like an inquisition or a bullbait and the rascals are true bred dogs too every one of them they run all at the head till a mans brain becomes as confused as a bankrupts account books however i keep my head up and then they cannot pin me an old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street but i marked him not and yet he talked very wisely and in the street too but i regarded him not i am unhurt in the midst of them like daniel in the den of lions aye or in the fiery furnace cried another at the same instant catching his chair from under him with a velocity that tilted him headforemost into the grate o damn the expense of a fiery furnace cried a third expense is nothing troubles all bellowed a fourth back him up fan him spilt dishd all abroad wound up shant be bad not of the two a few or so all abroad abroad abro  ad here articulation ended and was succeeded by their former canine conversation with which they quitted or to use their own expression dangled out of the room  as soon as they were gone frankley began entering into some sort of dissertation on the characters of these incomprehensibles explained to me their style of life their amusements the rules of their club with many other articles infinitely curious and entertaining jack solecism says he is a fellow of very excellent abilities but very rarely sober enough to employ them properly or to adopt his own words is allowedly clever preposterously so but now and then a little drunk to be sure he is not at present a member of the terrier society but has a very fair prospect of being speedily admitted as he excels particularly in the indian war whoop and is allowed by several seacaptains who are good judges to approach nearer the true sound than any european they had ever conversed with  i hope continued he that you find yourself pleased with the company of these good folks as the greater part infallibly design doing themselves the honor of supping with me and it is an absolute impossibility to put them off or prevent them so you see what you are to expect in reply to this i could only say that it was the very thing which i was most desirous of provided that he could insure my carcass from all practical wit and manual pleasantry which i acknowledged myself too stupid to enter into the spirit of and consequently to have any particular taste for this he undertook to answer for provided i on the other hand would do my part by retiring in case of particular and extraordinary combustion to which article i with equal readiness assented so matters being stipulated between us we stretched ourselves upon a sopha and with the assistance of sleep and chitchat murdered our interval of time very handsomely and by and by after having enjoyed i believe about an hours respite our friends the terriers returned with jack solecism the first fiddle as usual as he was still very tolerably drunk and the fumes of the liquor remained in absolute possession of his capital we had hardly eaten three mouthfulls i forgot to tell you we were at supper when he was upon his legs declaiming with all the energy of diction and before we had well finished our meal entered with an oration so gloriously absurd and ridiculous that i could not help committing it to paper as soon as i quitted them and now send it to you with absolute injunctions to be diverted as you value my friendship or regard the trouble i shall be subjected to both in transcribing that and relating the consequences which attended it  gentlemen said he and as he spoke he hiccupd and drank two bumpers of punch to assist his articulation i think gentlemen when i had last the happiness of addressing you in this house when as i remember you did me the honor of increasing and enforcing my comparisons by absolute contact with the fender the marks whereof my forehead retains with a grateful sense of their utility unto this hour i think i say i was then giving it as my opinion that this college was a damned place that is in other words for i mean not to swear absolutely a place to be condemned utterly and now my present purpose is to make good my assertions by a little incontrovertible ratiocination  now the seniors or graduate members of a college may i think be divided into three species or classes the first and best and who as being best should consequently be first mentioned had they no other pretensions to priority are those few fine old fellows who being naturally and originally the children of dullness have chose to enjoy their birthright unimpaired uninterrupted uncontaminated by science and in consequence have vegetated in the spot providence first planted them without impertinent interference or prying into the conduct and behavior of their betters peace be to all such men to their great grizzle wigs and apathy i bow with reverence the honorable gentlemen may call them stupid i adore them for their stupidity it is perhaps a pleasant it is certainly an innocent amusement it offends nobody were they as stupid as many of them are corpulent which i allow cannot easily be the case as stupid as a sot before dinner or an alderman after it i pay them the greater reverence therefore but perhaps the honorable gentlemen may object to their corpulence to their globose rotundity of paunch i would ask the honorable gentlemen whether they are the contractors for victualling it do they provide covering for its convexity is not the owner at the sole expense of continuing it in its usual state of dilation is not he at the sole expense of covering its nakedness which unless covered would doubtless be unseemly with an extravagant profusion of broadcloth is not that broadcloth black too a color if indeed black may be considered as a color which however my philosophy has not yet determined upon notoriously expensive from the rottenness of its die at least was it not black originally though now perhaps its tint may be more venerably assimilated to the verd antique marble of italy but enough of these gentlemen let us now turn our attention to my second species of existences to a set of men originally endued with abilities with abilities destroyed and obnubilated by residence and application does any one start at my assertion the honorable gentlemen are not to be taught i hope that application is the bane and destruction of abilities the human mind gentlemen pardon the comparison is like a leg of mutton the meat is fine but requires roasting to make it eatable we place it before the fire then and it is suffered according to its size to continue there for a longer or shorter period we resume it and upon cutting it we find the natural gravy remains there but matured and meliorated by concoction so far it has been in a state of improvement it is then at its point tropical its solstice its zenith of perfection but would any cook in christendom replace it there in expectation of farther advantages would she not know that any farther torrefaction must be prejudicial that the natural gravy would from that time decrease and evaporate gradually a gravy gentlemen not to be supplied by all the adscititious sauces of the most ingenious artificer i presume no gentleman needs my information that learning is an elegant accomplishment so is snufftaking that the one strengthens the ideas and clears the head of its votary so does the other but in either case how dangerous are excesses in the one it degenerates into pedantry in the other to bestiality and nastiness i will conclude my remarks on this species with their character as drawn by a late elegant satyrist  fellows who have soaked away their knowledge in sleepy residence at college whose lives are like a stagnant pool muddy and placid dull and cool mere drinking eating eating drinking with no impertinence of thinking who lack no farther erudition than just to set an imposition to cramp demolish and dispirit each truebegotten child of merit censors who in the days broad light punish the vice they act at night whose charity with self begins nor covers others venial sins but that their feet may safely tread take up hypocrisy instead as knowing that must always hide a multitude of sins beside whose rusty wit is at a stand without a freshman at their hand i am come now gentlemen to my third division and here willingly would i be silent but justice calls upon me to speak though my feelings are wounded by the description what shall i say then shall i call them with dr hurd in one of his dialogues a set of bearded boys and would you invite our liberal and noble youth to resort hither can you expect that their free spirits will stoop to be lectured by these or that their minds can ever be formed and tutored by such pedants in a way that fits them for the real practice of the world and of mankind  but let us choose an instance for illustration let one suffer for the rest and be selected as a subject for dissection and can we want a subject whilst euclid is before us a fellow whose only pleasure and delight lies in plaguing every body of equal genius but less erudition than himself a fellow whose very instructions are insults who forces science upon you nolens volens as an apothecary does physic thrusts rhomboids parallelograms and parallelopipedons down your throat like pistols leek crams you with pentagons hexagons and quindekagons till your head is as full of odd shapes and figures as a chinese manuscript or an egyptian necromancers talisman or the hieroglyphics of a greasy buttery account book a fellow who claps a triangular mathematical yoke or collar round your neck as they do round a hogs to prevent your getting through the parallels of a fivebarrd gate and feasting in the turnip field of classical knowledge on the other side of it  evil communication says the old copybook corrupts good manners and for my part i declare honestly that i can hardly consider that knowledge as respectable which i behold prostituted and contaminated by a communication with the most despicable of characters i cannot help connecting my ideas of one with the other and then damn em i hate both and yet get them by themselves the mathematics are good intelligent things enough and very useful too for a land surveyor or builder of bridges i am sure i look up to them with fear and reverence as a thief does to a gibbet and only pray secretly that it may never be my case  and then he is such an inveterate unchristian rascal in his resentments letting the sun go down upon his wrath an absolute polypheme nec visu facilis nec dictu affabilis ulli in short ten times worse than pedant or any of his compeers in as much at least as a person who behaves ill to every body is worse than him who has no behavior at all and yet they are all bad enough occasionally even men who are liberal and well spoken of at any other place as if they thought illiberality a college accomplishment and were afraid of appearing affected and singular if they did not give into it or perhaps it may be philosophically accounted for by the difference of the medium in these parts and that the very atmosphere is mephitically impregnated with a sort of illiberal vapor from the constant respiration of such a number of uncivilized inhabitants  by the time our cicero had got thus far in his oration which i have here endeavored to give you connectively omitting the frequent remarks and interruptions of his companions the quantity of liquor which he had drank or according to his own philosophical method of accounting for things the vinous atmosphere he had been so long breathing called off the organs of speech from elocution to employ them in an operation perhaps more natural and certainly better adapted to his present condition his eyes fixed his jaw fell down he dropped and to use the words of an irish acquaintance of mine when he was describing the issue of one of his duels never brought life to the ground with him at least not intellectual life well in this state he lay for about five minutes formidably nasty indeed cascading like a leaden rivergods urn or the grotesque human waterspouts of a gothic cathedral presently he began to kick a little and in a short time after by the application of salt hot water and other methods according to the practice of the humane society which his companions were very liberally observant of he started up at once on his legs filled an halfpint bumper of punch and indistinctly muttering an old adage of his own that the more came out the more room to go in drained it in an instant this act of heroism with the sagacious comment that accompanied it excited a burst of universal applause  well jack cried tom riotous who stood next him now you have settled your internals i suppose we shall have the rest of your oration come come why damn ye you look as meagre and as melancholy as duns scotus of merton in the last page of the bible come your oration  oration sir exclaimed solecism who since his last half pint of lethe had been black in the face with a kind of hiccuping convulsion and remained without the least recollection of any previous circumstances oration sir what do you mean to insult me sir oration sir is of two kinds demosthenes and his plumbstones two methods of using the hand  in oration sir first there is the hand open employed in the milder kind of argument then sir damme i will not put up with an insult there is the hand closed commonly called the clinchd fist  do you observe me for more weighty arguments sir to evince convince the knockyedown argument sir which will humble the most highheaded adversary convert his perpendicular arrogance into an horizontal supineness as i am now going to demonstrate upon your poor miserable carcass and as he spoke the last word he made a blow at riotous which had it taken place properly would most effectually have verified his assertion by levelling the object of it but through want of precision in the director vented itself on an unhappy plaster figure of tully that stood upon the mantelpiece which it broke into a thousand pieces  sir cried riotous enforcing his exclamation with a most dignified profusion of blasphemy which as the wit will evaporate in repetition i shall leave you to guess at do you strike me sir such behavior requires satisfaction i insist upon immediate satisfaction pistols were produced instantly for it seems they are as necessary a part of furniture in an oxford apartment as a corkscrew or an horsewhip seconds were chosen ground measured and every thing prepared for action in the same moment sans ceremony or compliment solecism swore and fired but without any effect upon this riotous advanced and applying the muzzle of his pistol to the mouth of his unfortunate antagonist who began now to recover his senses solecism says he you have broken the rules of honor and now by god sir i am sorry to tell you that you must die the death for it so prepare yourself to drop like a gentleman and here is at you gentlemen fill bumpers to solecisms voyage in the ferryboat and raise a subscription to pay for his passage for i dare say he has not a sixpence of his own to defray the expenses have you jack our poor orator ran behind the window curtain and roared for mercy as one deprecated the other persisted till at last finding his enemy inexorable he plucked up his scattered resolution and being determined i suppose to die like a good christian poppd forth a face the most ruefully ridiculous i ever beheld and begged but for a minutes respite then drawing it in again o lord cried he thou see the situation i am in pity a poor miserable sinner aye cried riotous there you see he acknowledges his poverty i told you he had not a sixpence come subscribe gentlemen who is going to be blown out of life in a smoke by he was then silent for about a minute but presently raising his voice again lord jesus added he receive my spirit  and now sir throwing aside the curtain and stepping forward with a calm assured countenance now damn ye fire away twas done as soon as spoke a cloud of smoke darkened the apartment and upon its dispersing no solecism was to be found one would have imagined him carried off by some inchanter like an arabian night princess or absolutely pulverized to an impalpable powder by the horrors of his situation well for above half an hour i believe did we hunt after him in every staircase in the quadrangle dogs and all till at last guided by a degree of scent which i verily believe led us to the discovery we found him squeezed behind the door of a cellar with his eyes and tongue rolling like the clockwork drummer at the waxwork and his hands raised upwards like the effigies of some brazen saint in the aisle or vestibule of a cathedral and here unobserved by the rest of the company i took my leave of frankley and departed to my inn and so ended the operations of the first day  and now charles i may tell you lest you should suspect me of enchantment in good earnest that the seconds had put no lead into the pistols which allowed solecism the capability of quitting the room at the instant riotous fired how he effected it you must enquire of his fears as it was with a more instantaneous velocity than i have any conception of  the next morning old hartley informed me that he had been successful in his second attack upon pedant and that we were both engaged to breakfast there on our arrival we found him seated in due form and order surrounded by food mental and corporeal with a companion on the other side the table whose countenance had i met with it in a dark lane or alley would by no means have corresponded with my ideas of personal safety upon our entrance they rose and bowed distantly and immediately reseating themselves we followed their example and took our chairs in awful silence as pedant had not thought it necessary to effect a nominal acquaintance of parties by introducing us to this friend of his we could only endeavor to supply the deficiency by surveying each other with that kind of cautious curiosity which you may have seen in two dogs upon their first meeting when they look half afraid and in doubt whether they shall quarrel or not hartley indeed soon struck up a conversation with pedant which i joined in occasionally but my attention was chiefly occupied in forming a conjectural judgment of his comrade whose lips were never opened unless once in five minutes to give an abrupt negative to what somebody else had been saying no such thing  it was not so  or i dont believe a word of it and then he would take up a book and begin reading again faith charles i believe pedant never appeared to such advantage before i began to suspect that he was determined to make the best of himself and so brought the other animal by way of foil for though neither of them could be accused of being overburthend with entregent or politeness yet the reserve and aukwardness which proceeded from mauvaise honte in pedant seemed in the other to arise from a churlish selfconceit and a predetermined contempt for the understanding of his company good god thought i this must be poor solecisms friend euclid there cannot surely exist two such wretches and euclid indeed it was as i found presently after by pedants naming him in the course of conversation i dare say now charles from the little i saw of the man that he is capable of going into the first company committing every incivility perpetrating every shocking clumsiness he can think of and in short just doing every thing that he ought not to do without imagining it necessary to be ashamed of himself i fancy he is one of those ipse dixit infallible gentlemen who either think they cannot do wrong or imagine themselves qualified to do it but i will not attempt his character as i can send it to you drawn in a much more masterly manner by somebody who knows him better than i ever desire to do it was given me by frankley whom i happened to meet in the evening at the coffeehouse and upon mentioning the company i had breakfasted with he took it out of his pocket and told me that it was found about three or four mornings since pasted upon the door of euclids chambers by way of epitaph but that the author was utterly unknown  epitaph here continues to slumber whilst his mind absorpt in science dreams wildly of imaginary propositions the body of diagram euclid a man who in defiance of the weaknesses unavoidably incident to his nature preserved a consistency of conduct and supported an uniformity of character which malice never could asperse and slander was unable to vilify as a tutor and governor of his college toward his inferiors his superiors and his equals toward his servants his pupils and toward his friends if indeed he ever possessed one he persevered in an unvaried illiberality of behavior that he might avoid the very suspicion of being partial politeness he considered as a servility disgraceful to the dignity of learning and as his soul was incapable of the comforts of society his actions honestly expressed his dislike to it by disgusting every company he appeared in with the superciliousness of cynical contempt that he might not be accidentally agreeable he observed from his first entrance at the university an inflexible moroseness of countenance which characterized the misanthrophy of his heart nor was he ever seen to relax the scowl of severity but when his spleen and ill nature were gratified in wounding the feelings of the ingenuous or covering the face of the diffident with the blush of confusion to avoid being imposed upon by appearances his memory never forgot an affront and his heart was never weak enough to forgive one for he considered forgiveness as a credulity which might expose him to the repetition of insult when he was appointed lecturer of his college in his favorite science of mathematics he confused the understanding of his auditors by expressions they were incapable of comprehending and by a vain ostentation of his own erudition obscured what it was his business to have illustrated to others in his opinions and assertions he was dogmatical proud pedantic and perplexing nor did he ever scruple to reprobate with all the arrogance of conscious superiority the united authorities of his predecessors in science when they chanced to differ in their sentiments from his own infallible standard of perfection think not youthful reader from the depravity of this mans character that the pursuit of learning is to be neglected he was but suffered as an instance that without good manners it may be despised without good nature it must ever be detested well charles what think you of it is it not a pretty good pasquinade god help the poor author if he should be discovered for i dont believe the golgotha would have much mercy on him  to return to my breakfast again which i hope you have not forgot was suspended from a principle of pure digressive politeness i must inform you that euclid having left us as soon as it was finished old hartley and pedant sat down to an inveterate tete a tete together and having in the course of about two hours restored helen to her husband routed the persian army at the plains of marathon with diverse other achievements equally difficult and celebrated it was proposed formally on hartleys part and after due hesitation as formally consented to on pedants that he should accompany us to dorsetshire  and so here we are all at present living as comfortably as we can together old hartley and pedant and pedant and old hartley to the end of the chapter and then kitty and i and i and kitty inseperables sometimes strolling in the garden and admiring the horizontal verdure of her fathers clipped hedges with fifty pretty little similars full as indolently entertaining farewell melmoth the voice of my charmer who at this instant enters the room cuts short my tale and obliges me to conclude incontinently  w easy  from her virgin cheek a fresher bloom shoots less and less the live carnation round her lips blush deeper sweets she breaths of youth the shining moisture swells into her eyes in brighter flow her wishing bosom heaves with palpitations wild kind tumults seize her veins and all her yielding soul is love   miss rugg to miss hartley foxhall august my dear kitty i received yours upon my honor you have treated my last letter very unmercifully and positively accused me of slyness and secresy without considering the confidence i placed in you by sending it at all suppose i had thought proper to burn it and had given you a fair copy revised and corrected and then after having been as spiteful and malicious as you possibly could be and torn the poor thing peicemeal sentence by sentence you affect to be wondrously merciful and it is your charity forsooth that obliges you to believe that i did it all on purpose since you are so very ready at belief and supposition i shall not tell you whether i did or not perhaps i might but you know i cannot retort or rally you which makes you so saucy however i must in charity believe that you did it all by accident or i shall never have any mercy on you and as you have made some amends by sending me easys poetical secrets i will even go farther and give you a little authentic information as to my prospects with melmoth and this i can do in a very few sentences merely by way of continuation to easys intelligence since his departure from foxhall then my uncle has been applied to by letter in consequence of which he arrived here about three days ago he has given his consent and approbation to our marriage melmoth has determined to quit the army and every thing will probably be concluded in the course of this month we expect my two aunts from york on wednesday is this account plain and undisguised enough or is there any sly style of secresy to be complained of as to expatiating upon my own happiness and my inamoratos extacy i shall leave your sensations when you think of similar prospects with easy to supply the omission you know i love him i own honestly that i do and i hope at least that he loves me equally what can i say then but what your own feelings will more forcibly speak for me adieu kitty write soon to me and believe my sincerity when i wish to see you as happy as she hopes to be who now probably for the last time subscribes herself  maria rugg  mr hartley to sir anthony artichoke o sir anthony sir anthony my best set of plans and schemes the best i ever contrived in my life are all blown up and gone and come to nothing as one may say here when i had got him into dorsetshire and talked him over and persuaded him and had just brought matters to bear and had got him into the right humor for it and he had given his consent to marry my daughter and all was in a manner settled except acquainting her with my success then what does she go and do but runs away within two hours after i told her of her happiness and takes easy with her too and i suppose they are gone to be married together o never never was such an unlucky old man in this world as i am and after you warned me so much against it too in your last letter and told me you thought my daughter had a mind for a husband that i did not in tend for her and truly i began latterly to suspect as much myself but then who would have thought of her going off and running away in this sudden manner as one may call it or else i had prepared to counteract that husband for her o i am the most unfortunate old man in the world surely   dicique beatus aute obitum nemo supremaque funera debet here i went to her after breakfast this morning and told her that next monday was to be the happy day and how happy i should be and the like and she put me into a passion and when i came to enquire for her at dinner time nobody could tell what was become of her and easy was missing likewise so i was for going to the inn and making enquiries and following them immediately in the heat of my passion but mr pedant was luckily at hand to prevent me and persuaded me that by staying till the next morning we could send and investigate matters at the inn more minutely and should have more time to consider what steps should be taken and to pack up our things and to prepare every thing for pursuing them so here i am quite out of my wits about it as i may say and my old butler that has lived with me these four and twenty years come michaelmas is quite out of his wits too and can hardly believe it and is gone to the fox and goose and the crookedbillet with john docktail the coachman to see if he can hear any tidings of her and i told him to go to every place in the neighborhood and to get a man to cry her an obstinate perverse hussy i am sure she has no more taste for the dead languages than my housemaid or she would never have ran away from such a husband as mr pedant if she had but known how well the ancients understood them and could discourse in them and so often as i have talked to her about them but she never would listen to me and there i hear poor mr pedant now shut up in his room reading greek like one distracted poor man i believe he never would express himself in his native language if he could help it but i am in the utmost hurry and confusion and must go and give orders about fifty things immediately which obliges me to conclude as that wise people the spartans used to do upon urgent occasions in great haste  yours laconically christopher hartley  miss hartley to miss rugg my dear rugg how shall i write to you and what kind of roundabout expression shall i adopt to acquaint you with my situation the more i consider the more i feel myself at a loss in three words then be it known  that my father has been opinionated and imperious i have been perhaps a little inconsiderate and am at present almost before i know how to believe it on the road to scotland with easy  and now if you have had time enough for your wonderment and conjecture i will let you into particulars you know my poor papa amongst his other qualifications had always that wise one of making every thing a great secret and keeping people as much in the dark as possible whenever he had a scheme in his head by way of surprising them all at once with its excellence when the wind did get to it so last thursday after breakfast he came up to my room a thing not very common with him and which indeed he seldom used but upon grand occasions and seating himself in a great chair and settling his wig with both hands by way of preparation kitty says he with a face that told me some wondrous matter was in agitation you remember when i was in london that i introduced my friend mr pedant to you as a man every way qualified to make you a good husband and to restrain that levity and giddiness which the younger part of your sex are too much guilty of though i must own i rather despaired of ever bringing him to consent to the match he has now you know been here above a month with me in the country in which time by persuasions and promises i have at last with difficulty prevailed upon him to accept of my proposals and therefore lest upon reconsideration he should be induced to alter his mind toward you in this matter i have thought it better to strike whilst the iron is hot and on monday next have resolved that you shall be made happy in regard to   my dear rugg i was thunderstruck for though i knew this was my fathers intention in bringing pedant to dorsetshire with him yet i had no idea that the ungain animal would ever have consented to so dreadful a ceremony with me after the many silly looks i had helped him to put on since he had been there however i presently collected myself enough to cut my father short in the middle of his sentence which i suppose was to have concluded with a panegyric on his bookworm by a god forbid my dear sir that ever the living and the dead should be joined together let the dead bury their dead my dear father and his books him say i for i am sure he is as disagreeable and dead to the world as the languages he cultivates  my father looked at me wondrous petulant i could perceive o those confounded languages that ever my ill stars led me to mention the word for immediately and the frenzy took him like lightning peace peace girl said he the greek language though it  and here he was tumbling all at once into his eulogium upon its various excellencies when i who had experienced the miserable ennui of that self same dissertation at least fifty times in my life and knew from the beginning that it might last from two hours to three or four could not help interrupting him by saying how much i was indebted for the trouble he was going to give himself but as i had it perfectly fresh in my memory since the rehearsal of tuesday sennight i should be happy to postpone the hearing till some future opportunity when my recollection might begin to fail me this put him into a desperate passion which i really did not design he snatched up his stick to express the vehemence of his displeasure but impatience begetting inattention instead of the floor which he intended should be the sufferer he applied it to his own gouty shins with such a hearty good will that i thought he would never have forgiven himself he was now past all patience so that grinning between his high anger for my contemptuous treatment of the grecians and the actual pain he suffered from the vigor of his own bastinado by god cried he kitty i will not be trifled with monday is the day on which your happiness is determined and happy you shall be rubbing his leg all the time in spite of yourself i know more of easy madam than you are aware of and with these words he hobbled out of the room  what could i do my dear i knew him to be exceeding obstinate particularly when literature was in the question besides i was rather piqued at the positiveness and undutifulness of his behavior for i hold undutifulness in a parent to be the worst of all possible offenses and then too his last obscure sentence in regard to easy greatly perplexed me just as i was in the midst of all these puzzles easy came into the room and discovering immediately by my countenance that all was not right enquired what was the matter i as people in a passion like invalids are always bursting to tell their complaints related all that had happened and to cut my story short what with persuasion and argument on one side and fear and displeasure and an odd taste for novelty and eclat on the other recollecting too that very just saying of the poet that the woman who deliberates is lost which easy very forcibly urged upon me he made the best of his opportunity and within two hours i found myself in a postchaise half willing half unwilling nothing with me but my ridinghabit and some linen and indeed not quite certain whether i was there myself  so you see my dear how great consequences like great folks generally owe their greatness to small causes and little incidents for had not that unfortunate dissertation upon the grecians come across us and had not my father when he catched up his stick in consequence of my thwarting him there made that unpropitious application to his own shins instead of the ground which he intended we might probably have talked the matter over coolly the day of marriage might have been postponed pedant after several protractions might in the end have been exploded or tired out and every thing terminated as i could have wished for whereas now my father i dare say is raving like fifty bedlamites and perhaps spouting greek too at such a rate that all the country will take him for a necromancer whilst i like a poor inconsiderate giddybraind girl am flourishing away and killing posthorses with a knight errant on a journey to the land of matrimony without so much as a new gown or a weddingring prepared for the occasion  well my dear maria of all the silly things you feel yourself disposed to never make a runaway match of it though i dont think you are in any great danger with all your reserve and prudence about matrimonial matters and yet how should i laugh to see you for once as great a madcap as myself to meet you upon the road now going off as they say with your officer some how or other i am monstrously frightened i did not think i should have been half such a coward when i sat out or i am sure he would never have persuaded me however i long anxiously for your opinion about it do you think i have acted rightly if yes let me know instantly but if no you may as well keep your pen and censure to yourself for since what is done is done i am determined to be in the right so i tell you beforehand and yet you cannot write to me for i have no place of address and now only steal this hour from sleep to scribble to you as we are off again very early in the morning however we purpose seeing you at foxhall on our return when we shall not be in such a desperate hurry as we are at present adieu and believe me whether single or married  yours ever catharine hartley p s i received your last how different the style of our two weddings will be as different as our dispositions    william easy to charles melmoth edinburgh my dear charles to say that i am the happiest creature existing will be only repeating what every vulgar fool or merchants clerk has said upon the same occasion and yet how else can i express myself miss hartley miss hartley now no more is mine by all the ties of love and honor dont think me mad and raving now and throw down my letter in a passion we were married yesterday the place my letter is dated from will give you some information as to the grand outline of our proceedings the particulars i am now going to furnish you with  i believe i mentioned in my last that i was not entirely satisfied with some parts of pedants behavior nor with the frequent closetings and conferences between him and old hartley i cannot say that i paid any attention to those appearances at the time but since they have turned out so consequential i must mention one particular circumstance as it occurs to me before i proceed any farther about a fortnight ago i remember when old hartley had retired as usual to take his afternoon nap and pedant and myself were left in the parlour together i stepped out of the room for about ten minutes to relieve myself from the fatigue of his taciturnity by a little conversation with my kitty above stairs upon my return finding the wretch exactly where i left him absorpt in cogitation i was in some doubt at first whether i ought not to attempt a recovery from the torpor he seemed to labor under by a salutary tweak of the nose when presently i observed the forefinger of his right hand placed cautiously and as if it was an act of deliberation across the palm of his left and after a few unintelligible mutterings he began syllogizing as follows  the man who marries miss hartley gets her fortune i marry miss hartley ergo i get her fortune i could hold out no longer but instantly gave him the negatur with a voice that made him start as if he had seen the ghosts of his forefathers for he had not perceived that i was in the room he jumped up and rolled his eyes that witnessed huge dismay and turned out of the room with a more meaning confusion in his countenance than i ever before observed there now this little circumstance i say knowing the mans style and character as well as several others had made me for some time suspect that the old gentleman and pedant had some silly piece of contrivance in their head however as nothing very material appeared i doubted not but that with the help of my dear divinity i should be able gradually to counteract them before they brought any thing to a conclusion the event however proved the contrary and as the suddenness of their explosion left me no opportunity for sap or countermine in my operations i was oblige to commit every thing to the hazard of a coup de main in which i happily succeeded going a few mornings since i believe it was thursday into kittys dressing room o easy says she and i thought she seemed nettled at something i am glad you are come to give me joy monday next is the day fixed on for my being made happy that is you know in my fathers dialect being married to pedant monday next was my reply and more than that continued she he is so paternal as to tell me that i shall be made happy then whether i like it or not if he thinks he can effect this i fancy he will be about as cunning as sancho in his government when he sentenced a criminal to sleep so many nights in prison but what is to be done easy what measures can we take to prevent all this for you know if one did feel an odd fancy to accept of the wretch one would choose to take ones own time about it was not this a fair opening charles little cupid who i suppose sat upon my shoulder immediately whispered scotland and a postchaise and four and offered himself as first postillion faith i thought the young fellow advised very sensibly so as he had mentioned it in confidence to me i could not do otherwise than communicate it between a kiss and a whisper to the ear of my kitty she looked a little queerly at the proposal and hesitated and said nothing when a woman does not absolutely start at the first intimation of a thing of this nature you may make yourself sure of her consenting within half an hour if it is not your own fault so having once broke the ice i thought it better like old hartley to strike whilst the iron is hot and urged my proposal upon her with all the rhetoric i was master of i exaggerated the inevitable danger she exposed herself to by delaying any longer expatiated upon the unhappy obstinacy of her fathers temper that as he had hitherto kept his designs so secret as to the time intended for her marriage it was too probable that excited by his detestable coadjutor he would adopt measures for the effecting it which must utterly ruin all our prospects that it was not to be doubted but that her father though he might at first be highly displeased with the step i proposed would soon upon consideration see things in a proper light and even be inclined to thank us for counteracting him that all his friends she very well knew had invariably condemned his strange idea of sacrificing his daughter to a bookworm that their opinions would certainly have great weight with him when the delusion he at present labored under was removed that as she knew how well he loved her his displeasure would fall in some part upon pedant mutual recriminations would ensue and the animal would show himself in his proper colors that at all events her fathers strange treatment of her in this business would entirely justify her measures and that i could not say however highly i reverenced the duty of children toward their parents that i thought it should be observed implicitly when so great a stake as ones own happiness or misery was depending whilst i was haranguing thus finely i could perceive by five hundred little changes in her countenance what an internal contest she was engaged in for instance there was love i suppose and the novelty of the thing and a little pique against her father all volunteers on my side the question then there was prudence and propriety and punctilio and a whole musterroll of presbyterian virtues like a city militia on the other and like a city militia there they stood by each other all in form no doubt and made a great show of resistance but as soon as the other party charged home upon them away they ran as if the devil was at their heels and not two were to be found together till all the danger was over for guessing how matters stood with her i brought up to the attack a reinforcement of arguments and at last as the reward for all my trouble drew from her lips a dear kind of half denying affirmative which i took immediate advantage of by running out of the room whilst she remained in the right humor and in short conducted every thing with so much vigor that i believe within two hours from the time of our consultation we found ourselves cheek by jole in a postchaise together  and here we are now in scotland as happy as any two new married people can be my dear girl with all the bloom of young desire and purple light of love glowing in her cheeks is more winning soft more amiably mild than all the heathen beauties i ever heard or read of if they were put together with their goddesses at the head of them o charles how she looked yesterday as we returned from the altar with such a dear demisaison april smile upon her countenance moistened with a tear and every now and then she is so prettily pensive which i love her ten times more for from the novelty of the thing o melmoth how rejoiced i am on all accounts at what has happened for if her father had been less precipitate and peremptory and i had not taken her at the instant when every thing was favorable the little gipsy might have played me on and off for this twelvemonth and teazed my very soul out by the bye i wonder why that odd urchin cupid pitches upon scotland as the place of rendezvous for all his mad votaries unless he does it to caseharden their hearts against all other impressions by the rigor of the climate like hot iron in cold water or perhaps he means to try whether their passion will bear change of country and considers no love as a true one which is not sufficient to keep a man warm so many degrees northward and enable him to write odes like a laplander to his orra moor though he is knee deep in snow all the time  well charles i think i have done very handsomely in absenting myself so long from my gentle kate on purpose to send an account of matters to you and if you dont think so to though i believe you are still uxorious enough to allow my plea pray put yourself in my situation for five minutes and then if you are not amazed at my abstinence i shall not scruple to call you the most unreasonable fellow living whenever i meet you adieu we are now going to station ourselves at sir thorobreds from whence penitentials mediatorials and conciliatories will be dispatched to my queer fatherinlaw with all due ceremony and expedition encore adieu believe me though married as much as ever your  william easy  sir thorobred rugg to charles melmoth esquire foxhall damnation charles melmoth i believe every body is mad of our acquaintance at least and are determined to make my house their bedlam here is your brother george and maria in the first place they have been prating and preaching and palavering one another over till they have both persuaded themselves they were in love and so then my uncle was to be wrote to and fetched to see their folly and consent to their running in couples  by and by i hear a confounded noise and rattle at my gate and who of all the fools in the world should bolt out of a postchaise but our poor silly friend easy with kitty hartley tacked to his tail by way of helpmate however they have had a long run for it and good sport i dare swear let me see a damned silly scheme of old hartleys about one pedant first unkennelld them twas at his house they broke cover and then took off strait an end to edinburgh the old fellow and pedant after them full cry a fine burst by god well at edinburgh they headed back it seems and before old hartley got there were both eathed safe enough at foxhall however the old dog stuck to the scent and was here yesterday morning by ten oclock to dig em out again as for pedant he laggd and was lost some how as soon as he lost scent of matrimony however i am glad to see easy has so much bottom i never thought he would have run half so well and the old buck is in good humor too now he finds things cannot be altered  so i have got a fine housefull of em too and not a creature except your brother knows which side of a horse to mount on like that poor stupid rascal nineveh that didnt know his right hand from his left as king solomon says i wish you and your wife were here with all my soul for the lovers talk all of them so much like fools and hartley so much like an old schoolmaster that there is no bearing them and my uncle you know is a devilish slugg in conversation at best so that at present i am absolutely not master of my own house and can hardly squeeze in a word edgeways about surly or my chestnut stonehorse faith i begin to find it very true what my old friend virgil used to tell me when i was at school in his art of prophecy that it was impossible to couple a horses neck to a mans head i believe he said people would laugh at you if you tried at it humano capiti risum tencatis equinum you remember what i mean and indeed he was pretty right there too for they generally do when i begin and will easy in particular who knows no more of a horse than i do of a rhinoceros poor ignorant fellow and george too though he sometimes will ride with me yet he always pulls his boots off and dresses when he comes in and scents himself with all manner of nastiness for my sister to smell to him he never goes by my kennel but the dogs give tongue and when he came down here was mistaken at two or three inns for bailey the great perfumer in cockspurstreet so i am always obliged to carry a foxs pad in my pocket to prevent being infected love love love and ottah of roses from morning till night damn it i will go and coquet with my horse  thorobred rugg  william easy to charles melmoth foxhall september well my dear friend here we are all assembled like characters in the last scene of a comedy for the sake of matrimony  dramatis personae william easy esquire a young gentleman of polite accomplishments will that do to begin charles just married to miss hartley against her fathers consent a runaway match does that look polite i am afraid it is too common amongst the canaille now damn the dogs how soon they ape all our fashions mr hartley or christopher hartley esquire a sir woudbe literate father to miss hartley displeased at first but afterward reconciled to the match george melmoth a young officer rather fine but of good reputation i may venture to say that may not i on the brink of matrimony with miss rugg mr rugg her uncle and guardian an inoffensive chipinporridge sort of a man sir thorobred rugg  whose character i must omit as infinitely too eccentrical for my pen to do justice to the reverend tom fetlock a stupid parson useful enough in the marrying way women mrs easy late miss hartley a goddess miss rugg a good natured sensible girl with a good fortune and sir thorobreds two aunts whom i had almost forgot to mention a couple of old snuffboxes or rolls of pigtail tobacco scene foxhall  servants horses victuals and drink licenses settlements etc  act  st scene  st  and here if you please we will drop our theatrical embellishments and give you a plain historical account of things i mentioned in my last our intention of stopping at sir thorobreds and dispatching our penitentials from that quarter but the old gentleman has saved us the trouble for we had hardly been stationed here four and twenty hours just time enough to tell our adventures eat a comfortable meal and enjoy a good nights sleep upon it when the next morning about half an hour after breakfast as i was sauntering in the hall with the baronet i heard a carriage stop at the gate and presently in stumpd old hartley with his two ivoryheaded canes in one hand and his hat and handkerchief in the other you may guess i found myself in a little embarras at his appearing so unexpectedly sir thorobred advanced to receive him he begged pardon he said for troubling him with this visit but that it was needless to mention the occasion of it and that he should be glad of a little private conversation with me so in he went to sir thorobreds study and i followed with as little inclination as ever i did at eton to receive a flogging and faith i believe i looked monstrous silly not unlike a condemned schoolboy however as it has been always a rule invariable with me whenever i am on the wrong side of the question to carry matters with an high hand and behaving myself as the injured person to astonish my plaintiff into silence by the unexpectedness of the retort i resolved not to be wanting to myself in the present attack and had already prepared a tolerable volley of recrimination to counterpoise my antagonist when my expectations were very agreeably disappointed so far from arraigning me with all the just resentment of an injured parent he only censured me mildly for the precipitancy and unkindness of my conduct toward him and after sagaciously remarking which i suppose he had discovered in his way from edinburgh as well as ourselves that what was done could not be undone and that we should always make the best of a bad bargain with a few more pretty proverbials of the same sort he absolutely found me guilty only of petty larceny and enquired kindly after his daughter desiring to see her i need not tell you my amazement at a reception so entirely unhoped for nor of the many vows and protestations i gave him in return for it i ran up stairs to kitty whom i found with miss rugg at her elbow in no small consternation my intelligence was spirits of hartshorn to her down she came instantly not forgetting however to look as melancholy and repentant as possible and threw herself at his feet he immediately raised her up you know and so then after allowing a sufficient quantity of slobbering and blessing and white handkerchief work all was well again i believe we are all apt to form judgments of people in proportion to their good or bad behavior toward ourselves and indeed we should be sad wretches if we did not show some such gratitude to our benefactors but i really think i never knew old hartley so agreeable or felt half so much regard for him as at present we all get our health here as well as can be expected and both young and old are exceedingly convivial in about a week your poor brothers slipknot is to be drawn tight and according to old hartley i am likely to come in for a second edition of matrimony as he seems not at all satisfied with the validity of any thing on the other side the tweed so in for a penny in for a pound as they say i have nothing to do but submit myself and yet i dont know charles a double knot is confoundedly difficult to be untied though one should have ever so great a mind for it well god help us poor souls since we must march two and two newgate fashion as bardolph says god help us say i and keep us all from quarrelling and that we may not hate one another is the sincere wish and prayer of william easy the married man  i had almost forgot to tell you that i could not rest till i had endeavored to find out the cause of hartleys wonderful acquiescence and where his rarity of a companion had bestowed himself upon enquiring of his servant i found that his master upon first missing us which was about two hours after our departure flew into a most violent passion and would have prepared for an immediate pursuit now i did not imagine he would have pursued us at all but that upon pedants overpersuasion they delayed it till the next morning that upon their arrival at edinburgh finding the turtles paired and flown the old gentleman appeared very thoughtful and hearing some how or other of our intention to visit foxhall he determined to follow us thither and proposed it to his companion who seemingly acquiesced but that next morning upon his enquiring after him at breakfast no pedant was to be found nor any body that could give the smallest account of him old hartley was inconsolable and people were just beginning to propose a grand searching of horseponds hogtubs and i suppose necessaries had there been any when one of the postilions or bootcatchers recollected that he had seen a maddish looking gentleman go out of their house very early in the morning to a stagecoach that was passing which he believed he went away with but could not tell whether it was in the inside or the basket so here all our wonderments are unriddled and our reception accounted for for the sneaking animal you see finding all his hopes at an end thinks proper to slink off and leave hartley to make the best of it this piques the old gentleman who begins at last to open his eyes a little and perceive what a fool he has been and so considering as he says that what is done cannot be undone he resolves to put the best face upon things and make up his mind as well as he can about it before he sees us i wondered what the deuce made him so amazingly piano upon the occasion but this clears up the mystery and as for pedant he has shown his wisdom too for to be sure his appearance at the baronets must have been rather a silly one circumstanced as he was like squire gawkey at the end of a pantomime when he finds harlequin in full possession of his mistress so all is well that ends well that i may conclude like my fatherinlaw with a proverb and i forthwith subscribe myself  yours sincerely w easy  finis
