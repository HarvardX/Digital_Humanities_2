of thomasos shop enter juan and carlos carlos hush tread softly for your life   juan why what are you afraid of   carlos if thomaso should return and then perhaps    juan perhaps what why your whole conversation is composed of ifs  buts  perhapses  and supposes  a mere vocabulary of doubts   carlos hark i hear annas voice  the sound transports me oh juan i scarcely know where i am   juan why then i will tell you  this is an apothecarys shop it is dark and you are surrounded with phials therefore take care you break none  those are stairs before us and lead to the room where our dear girls are

yet broken they deeply sighing sung  at every sound they hear  with fond alarm they start  alternate hope and fear  now joy now pain impart but by each sound misguided alas they only find their tears their sighs derided by mocking rain and wind on every former token of love etc anna isabella it is a whole week since i saw my carlos how can he say he loves me and yet suffer them to marry me to this hateful german officer   theresa within anna why dont you go to your chamber child   isabella heavens your mother is not gone to bed yet   anna and do you think my carlos has really forsaken me my carlos did i say  yes will repeat it  my heart yields to the fond elusion of my tongue and i think i love him better every time i call him mine   exit isabella sola poor anna i love her sincerely and yet i am not sorry she is gone  i think juan must be here soon  and  and perhaps our conversation would be very uninteresting to her   reenter anna anna oh isabella i am frightened out of my wits two

isabella and do you know madam this unreasonable creature hesitates though she promised me long ago to elope whenever i could find an opportunity   juan psha marry first and dispute afterward that would be much more in the common order of things  come my dear isabella let us set them a good example  leave dissimulation to knaves and coquettes and lead up the dance of hymen as first couple    isabella why if i were sure you would never wish to change partners   carlos consider my dear anna the moments fly   isabella peeping through the keyhole i vow your mother is not in bed yet  to anna away away instantly and leave me to keep her quiet  i will follow you directly exeunt anna carlos and juan i will sing that she may suspect nothing  air isabella i ye hours that part my love and me

where i had been drinking a glass in moderation as sober as i am now  i saw two men getting into my fatherinlaws house  what is to be done thought i  for this was enough to stagger me you may suppose    thomaso oh certainly aside that you had enough to stagger you i believe   theresa taking the contract from annas pocket yes and here is enough to stagger us all  this paper explains to me that these thieves are of cupids gang gentlemen who commit sentimental robberies on the hearts of young ladies  there thomaso read that   gives the contract thomaso what do i see a contract of marriage between

scene and sturmwald places himself on a couch before thomasos closet door air sturmwald  come on my boys now i am commander  though youre as brave as alexander   heigho yawning   you lie  on my guard here am i  i fear no ambush no entrapping  no one shall catch old sturmwald napping falls asleep juan and carlos come out of the closet carlos softly softly  first let us secure the key of the shop door to let ourselves out   takes the key juan that this old remnant of mortality should think of rivalling a young fellow with his five senses in perfection   carlos but to our plot good juan  our plot  we have no time to lose   juan faith that is very true  so in you must go my old commander   they wheel the couch into thomasos closet air carlos bacchus now his nap is taking but his power can never subdue watchful love who ever waking bids the sleeping sot adieu bacchus should on venus waiting hold the cup with bended knee none but fools his worth oerrating with the servant make too free juan comes out of the closet and brings with him sturmwalds cloak hat and patch duet carlos and juan bacchus now his nap is taking but his power can never subdue watchful love who ever waking bids the sleeping sot adieu end of act i act ii scene the outside of dr biliosos house enter guzman and perez guzman but pray perez is doctor bilioso informed of his sons attachment to my cousin anna   perez oh dear no my old master hates signor thomaso to that degree that he would rather see his son hanged than married into the family   guzman though unacquainted with poor carlos i sympathize with him  had my leonora lived    perez ah but she is gone  and your honor has been doleful and dumpish as one may say ever since you came home from sea oh i love to hear you talk of old stories  you make me so melancholy and so happy that i cry by the hour together   guzman poor fellow   perez and pray good signor guzman when you was voyaging about on the stormy main and fighting the algerines was not you now and then frightened too much to think of your love   guzman no perez  true love purifies the soul from every base alloy   air guzman i let angry ocean to the sky in proud despite his billows roll let thunders to his threats reply fear is a stranger to my soul within the heart which love illumes and blesses with his sacred rays if meaner passion ever presumes it fades before the hallowed blaze ii though war with sullen aspect lower and crimson over the troubled wave and emulate the lightnings power the dangers of the fight i brave within the heart etc exit perez here comes my master  and as cross as usual   enter dr bilioso dr bilioso what a cursed neighborhood is this for a physician to live in no such thing as an asthma or a fit of the gout to be met with from years end to years end all the villagers are such a set of d  nd vulgar healthy dogs  never have the pleasure of seeing a meagre bilious gentlemanlike man within ten miles of the place  how comfortable it would be to live at constantinople where the plague rages all the year  and then people laugh more here than in all spain besides  ah i dont like laughing well perez  any body ill this morning   perez sighing no sir  all well   dr bilioso aye  and will remain so as long as this plaguey fine weather lasts  no chance of another influenza  i who am the physician am the only sick man in the parish   perez yes your worship seems stuck up here by way of a medical scarecrow to frighten away sickness   dr bilioso or rather like an electrical conductor  i save the neighborhood from danger by attracting it to myself  ah i lost the only good patient i had in my friend alvarez  as fine a corpulent  inactive subject as a physician would wish for what with repletion and want of exercise the good soul was always ailing i had great expectations from him  but he grew stingy as he grew rich  avarice produced abstinence and he starved away the only hopes i had left   perez there is the traveller who was taken ill at the next inn    dr bilioso aye the only person i have at present under my care and he is a foreigner  no native would have behaved so civilly as to be taken ill  not got well i hope   perez yes so they say  the apothecary thomaso was sent for to him last night   dr bilioso what send for my enemy  my antagonist thomaso the apothecary a man of honor would have sooner died under his physicians hands than have played him such a trick   perez and he took some of thomasos quack medicine   dr bilioso o curse his quack medicine  i hate all violent remedies  they make an end of a business so soon  they either kill or cure and then either way one loses the patient   perez and so thomaso    dr bilioso oh rot him  i will go to the rascally quack directly my patients are my property  and shall i tamely suffer my property to be taken from me i will trounce the dog no no if a doctors patients are permitted to slip through his fingers and get well by stealth there is an end to all law and justice   scene a room in thomasos house enter thomaso thomaso ah ha the captain off already  i didnt expect he had shaken off the effects of last nights dose quite so soon i can hardly reconcile it to myself to sacrifice poor anna to such a sot my conscience revolts against it and whispers  aye but then my wife talks so much louder than my conscience and so there is an end of the matter   enter juan behind disguised as sturmwald and carlos disguised as a notary who listens at the corner of the scene juan in a hoarse voice fatherinlaw good morning to you   thomaso eh what bless my soul soninlaw

 enter thomaso theresa and anna anna no nothing shall shake my constancy  every obstacle you raise serves but to increase my affection   air anna the summer heats bestowing their influence on the rose perfect its charms when blowing and every sweet disclose yet summer funs denying the zephyr and the shower their fervid glow applying destroy their favorite flower the lovesick heart requiring the
