quod tibi vitae sors detraxit fama adjiciet posthuma laudi nostris longum tu dolor et honor buch the balmy zephyrs over the woodland stray and gently stir the bosom of the lake the fawns that panting in the covert lay now through the bloomy park their revels take pale rise the rugged hills that skirt the north the wood glows yellow by the evening rays silent and beauteous flows the silver forth and aman murmuring through the willows strays but ah what means this silence in the grove where often the wildnotes soothed the lovesick boy why cease in marys bower the songs of love the songs of love of innocence and joy when bright the lake reflects the setting ray the sportive virgins tread the flowery green and by the moon full often in cheerful may the merry bridemaids at the dance are seen but who these nymphs that through the copse appear in robes of white adorned with violet blue fondly with purple flowers they deck yon bier and wave in solemn pomp the boughs of yew supreme in grief her eye confused with woe appears the lady of the aerial train tall as the sylvan goddess of the bow and fair as she who wept adonis slain such was the pomp when gileads virgin band wandering by judahs flowery mountains wept and with fair iphis by the hallowed strand of siloes brook a mournful sabbath kept by the resplendent cross with thistles twined it is marys guardian genius lost in woe  ah say what deepest wrongs have thus combined  to heave with restless sighs thy breast of snow  oh stay ye dryads nor unfinished fly  your solemn rites here comes no foot profane  the muses son and hallowed is his eye  implores your stay implores to join the strain  see from her cheek the glowing lifeblush flies  alas what faultering sounds of woe be these  ye nymphs who fondly watch her languid eyes  oh say what music will her soul appease  resound the solemn dirge the nymphs reply  and let the turtles moan in marys bower  let grief indulge her grand sublimity  and melancholy wake her melting power  for art has triumphed art that never stood  on honors side or generous transport knew  has died its haggard hands in marys blood  and over her fame has breathed its blighting dew  but come ye nymphs ye woodland spirits come  and with funereal flowers your tresses braid  while in this hallowed grove we raise the tomb  and consecrate the song to marys shade  o sing what smiles her youthful morning wore  here is every charm and every liveliest grace  when natures happiest touch could add no more  heaven lent an angels beauty to her face  o whether by the moss grown bushy dell  where from the oak depends the misletoe  where creeping ivy shades the druids cell  where from the rock the gurgling waters flow  or whether sportive over the cowslip beds  you through the haunted dales of mona glide  or brush the upland lea when cynthia sheds  her silvery light on snowdons hoary side  hither ye gentle guardians of the fair  by virtues tears by weeping beauty come  unbind the festive robes unbind the hair  and wave the cypress bough at marys tomb  and come ye fleet magicians of the air  the mournful lady of the chorus cried  your airy tints of baleful hue prepare  and through this grove bid marys fortunes glide  and let the song with solemn harping joined  and wailing notes unfold the tale of woe she spoke and waking through the breathing wind from lyres unseen the solemn harpings flow the song began how bright her early morn  what lasting joys her smiling fate portends  to wield the awful british scepters born  and gauls young heir her bridalbed ascends  see round her bed lightfloating on the air  the little loves their purple wings display  when sudden shrieking at the dismal glare  of funeral torches far they speed away  far with the loves each blissful omen speeds  her eighteenth april hears her widowed moan  the bridal bed the sable hearse succeeds  and struggling factions shake her native throne  no more a goddess in the swimming dance  may thou o queen thy lovely form display  no more thy beauty reign the charm of france  nor in versailles proud bowers outshine the day  a nation stern and stubborn to command  and now convulsed with factions fiercest rage  commits its scepter to thy gentle hand  and asks a bridle from thy tender age  domestic bliss that dear that sovereign joy  far from her hearth was seen to speed away  strait darkbrowd factions entering in destroy  the seeds of peace and mark her for their prey  no more by moonshine to the nuptial bower  her francis comes by loves soft fetters led  far other spouse now wakes her midnight hour  enraged and reeking from the harlots bed  ah draw the veil shrill trembles through the air the veil was drawn but darker scenes arose another nuptial couch the fates prepare the baleful teeming source of deeper woes the bridal torch her evil angel waved far from the couch offended prudence fled of deepest crimes deceitful faction raved and roused her trembling from the fatal bed the hinds are seen in arms and glittering spears instead of crooks the grampian shepherds wield fanatic rage the plowmans visage wears and red with slaughter lies the harvestfield from borthwick field deserted and forlorn the beauteous queen all tears is seen to fly now through the streets a weeping captive borne her woes the triumph of the vulgar eye again the vision shifts the fatal scene again forlorn from rebel arms she flies and unsuspecting on a sister queen the lovely injured fugitive relies when wisdom baffled owns the attempt in vain heaven often delights to set the virtuous free some friend appears and breaks afflictions chain but ah no generous friend appears for thee a prisons ghastly walls and grated cells deformed the airy scenery as it past the haunt where listless melancholy dwells where every genial feeling shrinks aghast no female eye her sickly bed to tend a fact   ah cease to tell it in the female ear a womans stern command a proffered friend  oh generous passion peace forbear forbear  and could oh tudor could thy breast retain  no softening thought of what thy woes had been  when thou the heir of englands crown in vain  did sue the mercy of a tyrant queen  and could no pang from tender memory wake  and feel those woes that once had been thine own  no pleading tear to drop for marys sake  for marys sake the heir of englands throne  alas no pleading pang thy memory knew  dried were the tears which for thyself had flowed  dark politics alone engaged thy view  with female jealousy thy bosom glowed  and say did wisdom own thy stern command  did honor wave his banner over the deed  no  marys fate thy name shall ever brand  and ever over her woes shall pity bleed  the babe that prattled on his nurses knee  when first thy woeful captive hours began  ere heaven oh hapless mary set thee free  that babe to battle marched in arms a man an awful pause ensues  with speaking eyes and hands half raised the guardian wood nymphs wait while slow and sad the airy scenes arise stained with the last deep woes of marys fate with dreary black hung round the hall appears the thirsty sawdust strews the marble floor blue gleams the ax the block its shoulders rears and pikes and halberts guard the iron door the clouded moon her dreary glimpses shed and marys maids a mournful train pass by languid they walk and listless hang the head and silent tears pace down from every eye serene and nobly mild appears the queen she smiles on heaven and bows the injured head the ax is lifted  from the deathful scene the guardians turned and all the picture fled it fled the wood nymphs over the distant lawn as rapt in vision dart their earnest eyes so when the huntsman hears the rustling sawn he stands impatient of the starting prize the sovereign dame her awful eye balls rolled as cumas maid when by the god inspired  the depths of ages to my sight unfold she cries and marys meed my breast has fired  on tudors throne her sons shall ever reign  age after age shall see their flag unfurled  with sovereign pride wherever roars the main  stream to the wind and awe the trembling world  nor in their britain shall they reign alone  age after age through lengthening time shall see  her branching race on europes every throne  and goths and vandals bend to them the knee  but tudor as a fruitless gourd shall die  i see her deathscene  on the lowly flore  dreary she sits cold grief has glassd her eye  and anguish gnaws her till she breathes no more but hark  loud howling through the midnight gloom faction is roused and sends her baleful yell oh save ye generous few your marys tomb oh save her ashes from the blasting spell  and see where time with brightened face serene  points to yon far but gloricus opening sky  see truth walk forth majestic awful queen  and partys blackening mists before her fly  falsehood unmasked withdraws her ugly train  and marys virtues all illustrious shine   yes thou have friends the godlike and humane  of latest ages injured queen are thine the milky splendors of the dawning ray now through the grove a trembling radiance shed with sprightly note the woodlark hailed the day and with the moonshine all the vision fled the author of this little poem to the memory of an unhappy princess is unwilling to enter into the controversy respecting her guilt or her innocence suffice it only to observe that the following facts may be proved to demonstration the letters which have been always esteemed as the principal proof of queen marys guilt are forged buchanan on whose authority thuanus and other historians have condemned her has falsified several circumstances of her history and has cited against her public records which never existed and to add no more the treatment she received from her illustrious cousin was dictated by a policy truly machiavelian which trampled on the obligations of honor of humanity and morality from whence it may be inferred that to express the indignation at the cruel treatment of mary which history must ever inspire and to drop a tear on her sufferings is not unworthy of a writer who would appear in the cause of virtue  hengist and mey a ballad by the author of the concubine haec novimus esse nihil  in ancient days when arthur reigned sir elmer had no peer and no young knight in all the land the ladies loved so dear his sister mey the fairest maid of all the virgin train won every heart at arthurs court but all their love was vain in vain they loved in vain they vowed her heart they could not move yet at the evening hour of prayer her mind was lost in love the abbess saw the abbess knew and urged her to explain  o name the gentle youth to me  and his consent i will gain long urged long vexed fair mey replied  his name how can i say  an angel from the fields above  has rapt my heart away  but once alas and never more  his lovely form i spied  one evening by the sounding shore  all by the greenwood side  his eyes to mine the love confessed  that glowed with mildest grace  his courtly mien and purple vest  bespoke his princely race  but when he heard my brothers horn  fast to his ships he fled  yet while i sleep his graceful form  still hovers round my bed  sometimes all clad in armor bright  he shakes a warlike lance  and now in courtly garments dight  he leads the sprightly dance  his hair is black as ravens wing  his skin as christmas snow  his cheeks outvie the blush of morn  his lips like rosebuds glow  his limbs his arms his stature shaped  by natures finest hand  his sparkling eyes declare him born  to love and to command the livelong year fair mey bemoaned her hopeless pining love but when the balmy spring returned and summer clothed the grove all round by pleasant humber side the saxon banners flew and to sir elmers castle gates the spearmen came in view fair blushed the morn when mey looked over the castlewall so sheen and lo the warlike saxon youth were sporting on the green there hengist offas eldest son leaned on his burnished lance and all the armed youth around obeyed his manly glance his locks as black as ravens wing adown his shoulders flowed his cheeks outvied the blush of morn his lips like rosebuds glowed and soon the lovely form of mey has caught his piercing eyes he gives the sign his bands retire while big with love he sighs  oh thou for whom i dared the seas  and come with peace or war  oh by that cross that veils thy breast  relieve thy lovers care  for thee i will quit my fathers throne  with thee the wilds explore  or with thee share the british crown  with thee the cross adore beneath the timorous virgin blush with loves soft warmth she glows so blushing through the dews of morn appears the opening rose twas now the hour of morning prayer when men their sins bewail that elmer heard king arthurs horn shrill sounding through the dale the pearly tears from meys bright eyes like april dew drops fell when with a parting dear embrace her brother bade farewell the cross with sparkling diamonds bright that veiled her snowy breast with prayers to heaven her lily hands have fixed on elmers vest now with fivehundred bowmen true he is marched across the plain till with his gallant yeomandrie he joined king arthurs train full forty thousand saxon spears came glittering down the hill and with their shouts and clang of arms the distant valleys fill old offa dressed in odins garb assumed the hoary god and hengist like the warlike thor before the horsemen rode with dreadful rage the combat burns the captains shout amain and elmers tall victorious spear far glances over the plain to stop its course young hengist flew like lightning over the field and soon his eyes the wellknown cross on elmers vest beheld the slighted lover swelled his breast his eyes shot living fire and all his martial heat before to this was mild desire on his imagined rivals steed with furious force he pressed and glancing to the sun his sword resounds on elmers crest the foe gave way the princely youth with heedless rage pursued till trembling in his cloven helm sir elmers javelin stood he bowed his head slow dropped his spear the reins slipped through his hand and stained with blood his stately corse lay breathless on the strand  o bear me off sir elmer cried  before my painful sight  the combat swims  yet hengists vest  i claim as victors right brave hengists fall the saxons saw and all in terror fled the bowmen to his castle gates the bold sir elmer led  oh wash my wounds my sister dear  o pull this saxon dart  that whizzing from young hengists arm  has almost pierced my heart  yet in my hall his vest shall hang  and britons yet unborn  shall with the trophies of today  their solemn feasts adorn alltrembling mey beheld the vest  oh merlin loud she cried  thy words are true  my slaughtered love  shall have a breathless bride  oh elmer elmer boast no more  that low my hengist lies  o hengist cruel was thine arm  my brother bleeds and dies she spoke  the roses left her cheek and lifes warm spirits fled so nipt by winters lingering blasts the snowdrop bows the head yet parting life one struggle gave she lifts her languid eyes  return my hengist oh return  my slaughtered love she cries  oh  still he lives  he smiles again  with all his grace he moves  i come  i come where bow nor spear  shall more disturb our loves  she spoke  she died the saxon dart was drawn from elmers side and thrice he called his sister mey and thrice he groaned and died where in the dale a mossgrown cross oershades an aged thorn sir elmers and young hengists corse were by the spearmen borne and there all clad in robes of white with many a sigh and tear the village maids to hengists grave did meys fair body bear and there at dawn and fall of day all from the neighboring groves the turtles wail in widowed notes and sing their hapless loves knowledge an ode by the same ducit in errorem variarum ambage viarum ovid high on a hills green bosom laid at ease my careless fancy strayed and over the landscape ran reviewed what scenes the seasons show and weighed what share of joy and woe is doomed to toiling man the nibbling flocks around me bleat the oxen low beneath my feet along the cloverd dale the golden sheaves the reapers bind the ploughman whistles near behind and breaks the newmown vale  hail knowledge gift of heaven i cried  even all the gifts of heaven beside  compared to thee how low  the blessings of the earth and air  the beasts of fold and forest share  but godlike beings know  how mean the shortlived joys of sense  but how sublime the excellence  of wisdoms sacred lore  in deaths deep shades what nations lie  yet still can wisdoms piercing eye  their mighty deeds explore  she sees the little spartan band  with great leonidas withstand  the asian world in arms  she hears the heavenly sounds that hung  on homers and on platos tongue  and glows at tullys charms  the wonders of the spacious sky  she penetrates with newtons eye  and marks the planets roll  the human mind with lock she scans  with cambray virtues flame she fans  and lifts to heaven the soul  how matter takes ten thousand forms  of metals plants of men and worms  she joys to trace with boil  this life she deems an infant state  a gleam that bodes a light complete  when done the mortal toil  what numerous ills in life befall  yet wisdom learns to scorn them all  and arms the breast with steel  even deaths pale face no horror wears  but ah what horrid pangs and fears  unknowing wretches feel  that breast excels proud ophirs mines  and fairer than the morning shines  where wisdoms treasures glow  but ah how void yon peasants mind  his thoughts how darkened and confined  nor cares he more to know  the last two tenants of the ground  of ancient times his history bound  alas it scarce goes higher  in vain to him is maros strain  and shakespeares magic powers in vain  in vain is miltons fire  nor sun by day nor stars by night  can give his soul the grand delight  to trace almighty power  his team think just as much as he  of natures vast variety  in animal and flower as thus i sung a solemn sound accosts mine ear i looked around and lo an ancient sage hard by an ivied oak stood near that fenced the cave where many a year had been his hermitage his mantle gray flowed loose behind his snowy beard waved to the wind and added solemn grace his broad bald front gave dignity attention marked his lively eye and peace smiled in his face he beckoned with his wrinkled hand my ear was all at his command and thus the sage began  godlike it is to know i own  but oh how little can be known  by poor shortsighted man  go mark the schools where lettered pride  and starcrownd science boastful guide  display their fairest light  there led by some pale meteors ray  that leaves them often the sages stray  and grope in endless night  of wisdom proud yon sage exclaims  virtue and vice are merely names  and changing every hour  ashley how loud in virtues praise  yet ashley with a kiss betrays  and strips her of her dower  hark bolingbroke his god arraigns  hobbs smiles on vice descartes maintains  a godless passive cause  see bail often slily shifting round  would fondly fix on skeptic ground  and wrest the eternal laws  and what the joy this lore bestows  alas no joy no hope it knows  above what brutes may claim  to quench our noblest native fire  that bids to nobler worlds aspire  is all its hope its aim  not africs wilds nor babels waste  where ignorance her tents has placed  more dismal scene display  a scene where virtue sickening dies  where vice to dark extinction flies  and scorns the future day  wisdom you boast to you is given  at night then mark the fires of heaven  and let thy mind explore  swift as the lightning let it fly  from star to star from sky to sky  still still are millions more  the immense ideas strike the soul  with pleasing horror and control  thy wisdoms empty boast  what are they  thou can never say  then silent adoration pay  and be in wonder lost  say how the selfsame roots produce  the wholesome food and poisonous juice  and adders balsams yield  how fierce the lurking tiger glares  how mild the heifer with thee shares  the labors of the field  why growling to his den retires  the sullen pard while joy inspires  yon happy sportive lambs  now scattered over the hill they stray  now weary of their gambling play  all ingle out their dams  instinct directs  but what is that  fond man thou never can say what  far short thy searches fall  by stumbling chance and slow degrees  the useful arts of men increase  but this at once is all  a trunk first floats along the deep  long ages still improve the ship  till she commands the shore  but never bird improved her nest  each all at once of powers possessed  which never can rise to more  that down the steep the waters flow  that weight descends we see and know  but why can never explain  then humbly weighing natures laws  to gods high will ascribe the cause  and own thy wisdom vain  for still the more thou know the more  shall thou the vanity deplore  of all thy soul can find  this life a sickly woeful dream  a burial of the soul will seem  a palsy of the mind  though knowledge scorns the peasants fear  alas it points the secret spear  of many a nameless woe  thy delicacy dips the dart  in rankling gall and gives a smart  beyond what he can know  how happy then the simple mind  of yon unknowing laboring hind  where all is smiling peace  no thoughts of more exalted joy  his present bliss one hour destroy  nor rob one moments ease  the stings neglected merit feels  the pangs the virtuous soul conceals  when crushed by wayward fate  these are not found below his roof  against them all securely proof  heaven guards his humble state  knowledge or wealth to few are given  but mark how just the ways of heaven  true joy to all is free  nor wealth nor knowledge grant the boon  it is thine o virtue thine alone  it all belongs to thee  with thee  how blessed the shepherd lives  gay is his morn his evening gives  content and sweet repose  without thee  ever ever cloyed  to sage or chief one weary void  is all that life bestows  then would thou mortal rise divine  let innocence of soul be thine  with active goodness joined  thy heart shall then confess thee blessed  and ever lively joyful taste  the pleasures of the mind so spoke the sage my heart replied  how poor how blind is human pride  all joy how false and vain  but that from conscious worth which flows  which triumphs in the midst of woes  and boasts an endless reign pollio it has been often said that fiction is the most proper field for poetry if it is always so the writer of this little piece acknowledges it is a circumstance against him the following ode was first suggested and the ideas contained in it raised on revisiting the ruins and woods that had been the scene of his early amusements with a deserving brother who died in his twentyfirst year  an elegiac ode written in the wood near r  castle      by the same haec jovem sentire deosque cunctos spem bonam certamque domum reporto hor the peaceful evening breathes her balmy store the playful schoolboys wanton over the green where spreading poplars shade the cottagedoor the villagers in rustic joy convene amid the secret windings of the wood with solemn meditation let me stray this is the hour when to the wise and good the heavenly maid repays the toils of day the river murmurs and the breathing gale whispers the gently waving boughs among the star of evening glimmers over the dale and leads the silent host of heaven along how bright emerging over yon broomclad height the silver empress of the night appears yon limpid pool reflects a stream of light and faintly in its breast the woodland bears the waters tumbling over their rocky bed solemn and constant from yon dell resound the lonely hearths blaze over the distant glade the bat lowwheeling skims the dusky ground august and hoary over the sloping dale the gothic abbey rears its sculptured towers dull through the roofs resounds the whistling gale dark solitude among the pillars lowers where yon old trees bend over a place of graves and solemn shade a chapels sad remains where yon scathd poplar through the window waves and twining round the hoary arch sustains there often at dawn as one forgot behind who longs to follow yet unknowing where some hoary shepherd over his staff reclined pores on the graves and sighs a broken prayer high over the pines that with their darkening shade surround yon craggy bank the castle rears its crumbling turrets still its towery head a warlike mien a sullen grandeur wears so midst the snow of age a boastful air still on the warworn veterans brow attends still his big bones his youthful prime declare though trembling over the feeble crutch he bends wild round the gates the dusky wallflowers creep where often the knights the beauteous dames have led gone is the bower the grot a ruined heap where bays and ivy over the fragments spread twas here our sires exulting from the fight great in their bloody arms marched over the lea eying their rescued fields with proud delight now lost to them and ah how changed to me this bank the river and the fanning breeze the dear idea of my pollio bring so shone the moon through these soft nodding trees when here we wandered in the eves of spring when aprils smiles the flowery lawn adorn and modest cowslips deck the streamlets side when fragrant orchards to the roseate morn unfold their bloom in heavens own colors died so fair a blossom gentle pollio wore these were the emblems of his healthful mind to him the lettered page displayed its lore to him bright fancy all her wealth resigned him with her purest flames the muse endowed flames never to the illiberal thought allied the sacred sisters led where virtue glowed in all her charms he saw he felt and died oh partner of my infant griefs and joys big with the scenes now past my heart overflows bids each endearment fair as once to rise and dwells luxurious on her melting woes often with the rising sun when life was new along the woodland have i roamd with thee often by the moon have brushed the evening dew when all was fearless innocence and glee the sainted well where yon bleak hill declines has often been conscious of those happy hours but now the hill the river crowned with pines and sainted well have lost their cheering powers for thou art gone  my guide my friend oh where where have thou fled and left me here behind my tenderest wish my heart to thee was bare oh now cut off each passage to thy mind how dreary is the gulf how dark how void the trackless shores that never were repast dread separation on the depth untried hope faulters and the soul recoils aghast wide round the spacious heavens i cast my eyes and shall these stars glow with immortal fire still shine the lifeless glories of the skies and could thy bright thy living soul expire far be the thought  the pleasures most sublime the glow of friendship and the virtuous tear the towering wish that scorns the bounds of time chilled in this vale of death but languish here so plant the vine on norways wintery land the languid stranger feebly buds and dies yet there is a clime where virtue shall expand with godlike strength beneath her native skies the lonely shepherd on the mountains side with patience waits the rosy opening day the mariner at midnights darksome tide with cheerful hope expects the morning ray thus i on lifes stormbeaten ocean tossed in mental vision view the happy shore where pollio beckons to the peaceful coast where fate and death divide the friends no more oh that some kind some pitying kindred shade who now perhaps frequents this solemn grove would tell the awful secrets of the dead and from my eyes the mortal film remove vain is the wish  yet surely not in vain mans bosom glows with that celestial fire which scorns earths luxuries which smiles at pain and wings his spirit with sublime desire to fan this spark of heaven this ray divine still oh my soul still be thy dear employ still thus to wander through the shades be thine and swell thy breast with visionary joy so to the darkbrowd wood or sacred mount in ancient days the holy seers retired and led in vision drank at siloes fount while rising ecstasies their bosoms fired restored creation bright before them rose the burning deserts smiled as edens plains one friendly shade the wolf and lambkin chose the flowery mountain sung messiah reigns though fainter raptures my cold breast inspire yet let me often frequent this solemn scene often to the abbeys shattered walls retire what time the moonshine dimly gleams between there where the cross in hoary ruin nods and weeping yews oershade the lettered stones while midnight silence wraps these drear abodes and sooths me wandering over my kindred bones let kindled fancy view the glorious morn when from the bursting graves the just shall rise all nature smiling and by angels borne messiahs cross far blazing over the skies epigram addressed to the author of the note on the following lines of pope  let modest foster if he will excel  ten metropolitans in preaching well  by the rev mr henley while wisdom shines with light divine whatever scurrility may say good fosters name shall never decline then cease vain cur the moon to bay the shaft by the same by the side of the stream that strays through the grove i met in a ramble the blithe god of love his bow over his shoulder was carelessly tied his quiver in negligence clanckd at his side a handful of arrows he held to my view each winged with a feather of different hue  this fledged from the eagle he smiling begun  i aim at the heart that no dangers will shun  and this from the peacock all gaudy arrayed  the breast of sir fopling is sure to invade  when i aim at the prattler who talks void of wit  my shaft in the plume of a parrot will hit  and when i have a mind that the jealous should smart  i pierce with an owlfeatherd arrow his heart  for the youth in whom truth and fondness reside  from the breast of a dove my dart is supplied  this i value the most  twas this that i found  from you o my delia that gave me the wound iris to philus by the same if slighted iris can your pity move if slighted iris can recall your love if ever with joy you heard her softest vow renew the dear idea hear her now you once was faithful oh the tender bliss the sweet endearment and the thrilling kiss these witnessed once when i for ever true plighted my heart a prey to love and you and you untainted by the vice of art yielded to me in solemn faith your heart oh say the cause the cause i long to find you dear deceitful man why now unkind has iris for her philus now no charms for him no pleasures in her vacant arms methinks i see while torture wounds my rest methinks i see you clasping to your breast some rosy blooming maid whose beating veins throb with soft tumults with extatic pains while on her cheeks the deepening blushes rise and melting raptures sparkle in her eyes such were the joys when i incautious maid too fondly trusting was by you betrayed such were the joys oh call the scene to mind when iris yielding all her soul resigned ah then you swore the accents now i hear your turtles constant coo them to my ear that hoary time and joyconsuming age the ardors of your flame should never assuage but though unchanged by age or hoary time you slight my ripened charms my blushing prime all fondness once upon my breast you lay and sweetly sighed the hasty hours away but ah how changed my fate forlorn i am left of every kindlysoothing hope bereft whatever was wont to court the roving eye now swells the tear and heaves the unbidden sigh wherever i turn all natures charms seem fled the sun withdrawn the sunflower droops her head robbed of the prop where once she fondly clung the faded woodbine trails the earth along unchanged alone the mournful yew remains and midst each varying blast its hue retains its leaves unchanged my faithless swain reprove but ah they cannot teach him how to love if ever for her you felt the slightest care whose form too often you have pronounced most fair whenever i die and die ah soon i must whenever this body moulders into dust this only favor at your hands i crave with mournful yews to shade my untimely grave these mournful yews shall this memorial bear iris loved philus and she died sincere love elegy by the same ah cruel delia must i still remain in anxious doubt will naught your pity move must i still languish must i still complain still are you deaf to every plea of love a stranger to the odious wiles of art the coxcombs chatter and the beaus grimace i spoke the honest dictates of my heart nor masked deceit beneath the lovers face i never boasted heaps of treasured gold no dirty acres ever were my theme the sordid wretch beneath contempt i hold who dares with love such worthless trifles name and let the fair whom glittering dust delights in lieu of jointure barter bliss and peace insipid pleasures waste her tedious nights and jealous wranglings wear away her days not such the hours i hoped with you to share not thus to tread the vulgar path of life such base such brutal joys can never endear can never insure the fond the tender wife it is then o then we feel the inrapturd bliss when lost in soft confusion sweetly coy each virgin charm glows with the melting kiss and nature faints beneath the excess of joy though this would cloy if pleasures more refined forebore their influence over the breast to shed virtue alone secures the generous mind she with fresh transport crowns the bridal bed if words can tell let those whose hearts unite in virtuous love absolved from all control confess the pleasure the sublime delight the extatic sense of mingling soul with soul inscription under the shade of a lady given by her to the author by the same inventive love parent of every art that courts the fancy or that wins the heart by thee inspired a grecian dame of yore with tenderest arrow from thy sacred store each pain to sooth and joys oerpast renew her parting lovers shadowy semblance drew hence sprung design and paint its aid combined to inform the outline with the speaking mind but thou blessed maid can baffle all their boast their powers would all though reynolds strove be lost what stroke could make thy comely tresses flow with native grace what hue could teach to glow thy mild sweet blushes or attemperd break with purest white their softenings on thy cheek aught less than power divine might hope in vain the dewy lustrings of thine eye to feign or fix the timid swellings of that breast which may kind heaven no care but loves molest each charm shall memory in this shade supply braid the soft hair and languish in the eye bid the fair cheek bloom in its native hue the dovelike bosoms gentlest swell renew sweet fancy every attitude restore and give each varying grace to inchant the more to colonel r  s by s  b  esquire ere this can drown the tenderest husbands eyes and rend the fondest lovers heart with sighs no more shall those dear names my rapture move low in the grave and deaf to thee and love firm in thy countrys cause thy kings defense when honor called thy patriot virtues hence the slow disease which tainted then my blood in vain by all the powers of art withstood aided by grief more deadly creeps at length through every vein and undermines my strength already death has summoned me away and love fond love scarce gains an hours delay yet without dread deaths awful call i hear no dark presages chill my soul with fear no unrepented follies dread the grave and one short moment more with anguish crave prepared i am called from every terror free save that for ever i must part from thee but when on thee my thoughts reflecting rove and all the pleasures of our virtuous love to think how blessed we were how soon must part one deepfelt pang would pierce the dullest heart to cast one longing lingering look behind can be no guilty weakness of the mind methinks when heaven has kindly blessed us here fond love at parting sheds a pious tear still with each comfort will i cheer my heart resigned to god though trembling to depart short is mans knowledge of a future state perplexed with doubts and ignorant of fate this one important truth we only know bliss waits the good the bad eternal woe but what those blessings what those woes shall be through lifes dull casement since no eye can see let fancy paint the raptures of the skies and scenes of visionary transport rise still as was ever here my fondest joy let me for thee my every care employ still let me serve and though unseen be near not life itself imparts a charm more dear from every dangerous step those feet to guide which here to follow was my virtuous pride when wrath provokes or fortune proves unkind to lull the raging tumults of thy mind the sweets around of balmy sleep to shed when sickness binds thee to her painful bed to guard thee safely through the dreadful day when slaughter stalks from rank to

whom every friend forsakes i woo thee death in fancys fairy paths let the gay songster rove and gently trill the strain of empty joy  life and its joys i leave to those that prize them  at this hour this solemn hour when silence rules the world and wearied nature makes a general pause wrapped in nights sable robe through cloisters drear and charnels pale tenanted by a throng of meagre phantoms shooting cross my path with silent glance i seek the shadowy vale of death  deep in a murky caves recess lavd by oblivions listless stream and fenced by shelving rocks and intermingled horrors of yew and cypress shade from all intrusion of busy noontidebeam the monarch sits in unsubstantial majesty enthroned at his right hand nearest himself in place and frightfulness of form his parent sin with fatal industry and cruel care busies herself in pointing all his stings and tipping every shaft with venom drawn from her infernal store around him ranged in terrible array and strange diversity of

destroys at broad noonday these and a thousand more horrid to tell attentive wait and when by heavens command death waves his ebon wand sudden rush forth to execute his purpose and scatter desolation over the earth illfated man for whom such various forms of misery wait and mark their future prey ah why allrighteous father did thou make this creature man why wake the unconscious dust to life and wretchedness o better far still had he slept in uncreated night if this the lot of being  was it for this thy breath divine kindled within his breast the vital flame for this was thy fair image stamped on his soul in godlike lineaments for this dominion given him absolute over all thy creatures only that he might reign supreme in woe from the blessed source of good could pain and death proceed could such foul ills fall from fair mercys hands far be the thought the impious thought god never made a creature but what was good he made a living man the man of death was made by man himself forth from his makers hands he sprung to life fresh with immortal bloom no pain he knew no fear of death no check to his desires save one command that one command which stood twixt him and ruin the test of his obedience urged on by wanton curiosity he broke  there in one moment was undone the fairest of gods works the same rash hand that plucked in evil hour the fatal fruit unbarrd the gates of hell and let loose sin and death and all the family of pain to prey upon mankind young nature saw the monstrous crew and shook through all her frame then fled her newborn luster then begar heavens cheerful face to lower then vapors choked the troubled air and formed a veil of clouds to hide the willing sun the earth convulsed with painful throes threw forth a bristly crop of thorns and briars and insect bird and beast that wont before with admiration fond to gaze at man and fearless crowd around him now fled before his face shunning in haste the infection of his misery he alone who justly might the offended lord of man turned not away his face he full of pity forsook not in this uttermost distress his bestlovd work that comfort still remained that best that greatest comfort in affliction the countenance of god and through the gloom shot forth some kindly gleams to cheer and warm the offenders sinking soul hope sent from heaven upraisd his drooping head and showed afar a happier scene of things the promised seed trampling upon the serpents humbled crest death of his sting disarmed and the dank grave made pervious to the realms of endless day no more the limit but the gate of life cheered with the view man went to till the ground from whence he rose sentenced indeed to toil as to a punishment yet even in wrath so merciful is heaven this toil became the solace of his woes the sweet employ of many a livelong hour and surest guard against disease and death  death though denounced was yet a distant ill by feeble arm of age his sole support led slowly on not then as since the shortlived sons of men flocked to his realms in countless multitudes scarce in the course of twice five hundred years one solitary ghost went shivering down to his unpeopled shore in sober state through the sequestered vale of rural life the venerable patriarch guileless held the tenor of his way labor prepared his simple fare and temperance ruled his board tired with his daily toil at early eve he sunk to sudden rest gentle and pure as breath of evening zephyr and as sweet were all his slumbers with the sun lie rose alert and vigorous as he to run his destined course thus nervd with giant strength he stemd the tide of time and stood the shock of ages rolling harmless over his head at lifes meridian point arrived he stood and looking round saw all the valleys filled with nations from his loins fullwell content to leave his race thus scattered over the earth along the gentle slope of lifes decline he bent his gradual way till full of years he dropped like mellow fruit into his grave such in the infancy of time was man so calm was life so impotent was death o had he but preserved these few remains these shattered fragments of lost happiness snatched by the hand of heaven from the sad wreck of innocence primaeval still had he lived great even in ruin though fallen yet not forlorn though mortal yet not every where beset with death in every shape but he impatient to be completely wretched hastes to fill up the measure of his woes twas man himself brought death into the world and man himself gave keenness to his darts quickened his pace and multiplied destruction on mankind first envy eldestborn of hell embrud her hands in blood and taught the sons of men to make a death which nature never made and god abhorred with violence rude to break the thread of life ere half its length was run and rob a wretched brother of his being with joy ambition saw and soon improved the execrable deed twas not enough by subtle fraud to snatch a single life puny impiety whole kingdoms fell to sat the lust of power more horrid still the foulest stain and scandal of our nature became its boast  one murder made a villain millions a hero  princes were privileged to kill and numbers sanctified the crime ah why will kings forget that they are men and men that they are brethren why delight in human sacrifice why burst the ties of nature that should knit their souls together in one soft bond of amity and love yet still they breathe destruction still go on inhumanly ingenious to find out new pains for life new terrors for the grave artificers of death still monarchs dream of universal empire growing up from universal ruin  blast the design great god of hosts nor let thy creatures fall unpitied victims at ambitions shrine yet say should tyrants learn at last to feel and the loud din of battle cease to roar should doveeyd peace over all the earth extend her olive branch and give the world repose would death be foiled would health and strength and youth defy his power has he no arts in store no other shafts save those of war  alas even in the smile of peace that smile which sheds a heavenly sunshine over the soul there basks that serpent luxury war its thousands slays peace its ten thousands in the embattled plain though death exults and claps his raven wings yet reigns he not even there so absolute so merciless as in yon frantic scenes of midnight revel and tumultuous mirth where in the intoxicating draught concealed or couched beneath the glance of lawless love he snares the simple youth who naught suspecting means to be blessed  but finds himself undone down the smooth stream of life the stripling darts gay as the morn bright glows the vernal sky hope swells his sails and fancy steers his course safe glides his little bark along the shore where virtue takes her stand but if too far he launches forth beyond discretions mark sudden the tempest scowls the surges roar blot his fair day and plunge him in the deep o sad but sure mischance o happier far to lie like gallant how midst indian wilds a breathless corse cut off by savage hands in earliest prime a generous sacrifice to freedoms holy cause than so to fail tern immature from lifes meridian joys a prey to vice intemperance and disease yet die even thus thus rather perish still ye sons of pleasure by the almighty stricken than ever dare though often alas ye dare to lift against yourselves the murderous steel to wrest from gods own hand the sword of justice and be your own avengers  hold rash man though with anticipating speed thoust ranged through every region of delight nor left one joy to gild the evening of thy days though life seem one uncomfortable void guilt at thy heels before thy face despair yet gay this scene and light this load of woe compared with thy hereafter think o think and ere thou plunge into the vast abyss pause on the verge awhile look down and see thy future mansion  why that start of horror from thy slack hand why drops the uplifted steel did thou not think such vengeance must await the wretch that with his crimes all fresh about him rushes irreverent unprepared uncalled into his makers presence throwing back with insolent disdain his choicest gift live then while heaven in pity lends thee life and think it all too short to wash away by penitential tears and deep contrition the scarlet of thy crimes so shall thou find rest to thy soul so unappalld shall meet death when he comes not wantonly invite his lingering stroke be it thy sole concern with innocence to live with patience wait the appointed hour too soon that hour will come though nature run her course but natures god if need require by thousand various ways without thy aid can shorten that short span and quench the lamp of life  o when he comes roused by the cry of wickedness extreme to heaven ascending from some guilty land now ripe for vengeance when he comes arrayed in all the terrors of almighty wrath forth from his bosom plucks his lingering arm and on the miscreants pours destruction down who can abide his coming who can bear his whole displeasure in no common form death then appears but starting into size enormous measures with gigantic stride the astonished earth and from his looks throws round unutterable horror and dismay all nature lends her aid each element arms in his cause open fly the doors of heaven the fountains of the deep their barriers break above below the rival torrents pour and drown creation or in floods of fire descends a livid cataract and consumes an impious race  sometimes when all seems peace wakes the grim whirlwind and with rude embrace sweeps nations to their grave or in the deep whelms the proud wooden world full many a youth floats on his watery bier or lies unwept on some sad desert shore  at dead of night in sullen silence stalks forth pestilence contagion close behind taints all her steps with poisonous dew no smiting hand is seen no sound is heard but soon her secret path is marked with desolation heaps on heaps promiscuous drop no friend no refuge near all all is false and treacherous around all that they touch or taste or breathe is death but ah what means that ruinous roar why fail these tottering feet  earth to its center feels the godheads power and trembling at his touch through all its pillars and in every pore hurls to the ground with one convulsive heave precipitating domes and towns and towers the work of ages crushed beneath the weight of general devastation millions find one common grave not even a widow left to wail her sons the house that should protect entombs its master and the faithless plain if there he flies for help with sudden yawn starts from beneath him  shield me gracious heaven o snatch me from destruction if this globe this solid globe which thine own hand has made so firm and sure if this my steps betray if my own mother earth from whence i sprung rise up with rage unnatural to devour her wretched offspring whither shall i fly where look for succor where but up to thee almighty father save o save thy suppliant from horrors such as these  at thy good time let death approach i reck not  let him but come in genuine form not with thy vengeance armed too much for man to bear o rather lend thy kindly aid to mitigate his stroke and at that hour when all aghast i stand a trembling candidate for thy compassion on this worlds brink and look into the next when my soul starting from the dark unknown casts back a wishful look and fondly clings to her frail prop unwilling to be wrenchd from this fair scene from all her customd joys and all the lovely relatives of life then shed thy comforts over me then put on the gentlest of thy looks let no dark crimes in all their hideous forms then starting up plant themselves round my couch in grim array and stab my bleeding heart with two edgdtorture sense of past guilt and dread of future woe far be the ghastly crew and in their stead let cheerful memory from her purest cells lead forth a goodly train of virtues fair cherished in earliest youth now paying back with tenfold usury the pious care and pouring over my wounds the heavenly balm of conscious innocence  but chiefly thou whom softeyd pity once led down from heaven to bleed for man to teach him how to live and oh still harder lesson how to die disdain not thou to smooth the restless bed of sickness and of pain  forgive the tear that feeble nature drops calm all her fears wake all her hopes and animate her faith till my rapt soul anticipating heaven bursts from the thraldom of incumbering clay and on the wing of ecstasy upborn springs into liberty and light and life the day of judgment a poetical essay by dr glynn thy justice heavenly king and that great day when virtue long abandoned and forlorn shall raise her pensive head and vice that erst ranged unreprovd and free shall sink appalled i sing adventurous  but what eye can pierce the vast immeasurable realms of space over which messiah drives his flaming car to that bright region where enthroned he sits firstborn of heaven to judge assembled worlds clothed in celestial radiance can the muse her feeble wing all damp with earthly dew soar to that bright empyreal where around myriads of angels gods perpetual choir hymn halelujahs and in concert loud chaunt songs of triumph to their makers praise  yet will i strive to sing albeit unused to tread poetic soil what though the wiles of fancy me enchanted never could lure to rove over fairy lands to swim the streams that through her valleys weave their mazy way or climb her mountain tops yet will i raise my feeble voice to tell what harmony sweet as the music of the rolling spheres attunes the moral world that virtue still may hope her promised crown that vice may dread vengeance though late that reasoning pride may own just though unsearchable the ways of heaven skeptic whoever thou art who say the soul that divine particle which gods own breath inspired into the mortal mass shall rest annihilate till duration has unrolld her neverending line tell if thou know why every nation every clime though all in laws in rites in manners disagree with one consent expect another world where wickedness shall weep why paynim bard fabled elysian plains tartarean lakes styx and cocytus tell why halis sons have seignd a paradise of mirth and love banquets and blooming nymphs or rather tell why on the brink of orellanas stream where never science reared her sacred torch the untutored indian dreams of happier worlds behind the cloudtopt hill why in each breast is placed a friendly monitor that prompts informs directs encourages forbids tell why on unknown evil grief attends or joy on secret good why conscience acts with tenfold force when sickness age or pain stands tottering on the precipice of death or why such horror gnaws the guilty soul of dying sinners while the good man sleeps peaceful and calm and with a smile expires look round the world with what a partial hand the scale of bliss and misery is sustained beneath the shade of cold obscurity pale virtue lies no arm supports her head no friendly voice speaks comfort to her soul nor softeyd pity drops a melting tear but in their stead contempt and rude disdain insult the banished wanderer on she goes neglected and forlorn disease and cold and famine worst of ills her steps attend yet patient and to heavens just will resigned she never is seen to weep or heard to sigh now turn your eyes to yon sweet smelling bower where flushed with all the insolence of wealth sits pampered vice for him the arabian gale breathes forth delicious odours gallias hills for him pour nectar from the purple vine nor think for these he pays the tribute due to heaven of heaven he never names the name save when with imprecations dark and dire he points his jest obscene yet buxom health sits on his rosy cheek yet honor gilds his high exploits and downy pinioned sleep sheds a soft epiate over his peaceful couch see thou this righteous father see thou this and will thou never repay shall good and ill be carried undistinguished to the land where all things are forgot  ah no the day will come when virtue from the cloud shall burst that long obscured her beams when sin shall fly back to her native hell there sink eclipsed in penal darkness where nor star shall rise nor ever sunshine pierce the impervious gloom on that great day the solemn trump shall sound that trump which once in heaven on mans revolt convokd the astonished seraphs at whose voice the unpeopled graves shall pour forth all their dead then shall the assembled nations of the earth from every quarter at the judgment seat unite egyptians babylonians greeks parthians and they who dwelt on tybers banks names famed of old or who of later age chinese and russian mexican and turk tenant the wide terrene and they who pitch their tents on nigers banks or where the sun pours on golcondas spires his early light drink ganges sacred stream at once shall rise whom distant ages to each others sight had long denied before the throne shall kneel me great progenitor while at his side stands his descendant through a thousand lines whatever their nation and whatever their rank heroes and patriarchs slaves and sceptered kings with equal eye the god of all shall see and judge with equal love what though the great with costly pomp and aromatic sweets embalmed his poor remains or through the dome a thousand tapers shed their gloomy light while solemn organs to his parting soul chaunted slow orisons say by what mark do thou discern him from that lowly swain whose mouldering bones beneath the thorn bound turf long lay neglected  all at once shall rise but not to equal glory for alas with howlings dire and execrations loud some wail their fatal birth  first among these behold the mighty murderers of mankind they who in sport whole kingdoms slew or they who to the tottering pinnacle of power waded through seas of blood how will they curse the madness of ambition how lament their dearbought laurels when the widowed wife and childless mother at the judgment seat plead trumpettongud against them  here are they who sunk an aged father to the grave or with unkindness hard and cold disdain slighted a brothers sufferings  here are they whom fraud and skilful treachery long secured who from the infant virgin tore her dower and eat the orphans bread  who spent their stores in selfish luxury or over their gold prostrate and pale adored the useless heap  here too who stained the chaste connubial bed  who mixed the poisonous bowl  or broke the ties of hospitable friendship  and the wretch whose listless soul sick with the cares of life unsummond to the presence of his god rushed in with insult rude how would they joy once more to visit earth and though oppressed with all that pain and famine can inflict pant up the hill of life vain wish the judge pronounces doom eternal on their heads perpetual punishment seek not to know what punishment for that the almighty will has hid from mortal eyes and shall vain man with curious search refined presume to pry into thy secrets father no let him with humble patience all thy works adore and walk in all thy paths so shall his meed be great in heaven so happily shall he scape the immortal worm and neverceasing fire but who are they who bound in tenfold chains stand horribly aghast this is the crew who strove to pull jehovah from his throne and in the place of heavens eternal king set up the phantom chance for them in vain alternate seasons cheered the rolling year in vain the sun over herb tree fruit and flower shed genial influence mild and the pale moon repaired her waning orb  next these is placed the vile blasphemer he whose impious wit profaned the sacred mysteries of faith and against the impenetrable walls of heaven planted his feeble battery by these stands the arch apostate he with many a wile exhorts them still to foul revolt alas no hope have they from black despair no ray shines through the gloom to cheer their sinking souls in agonies of grief they curse the hour when first they left religions onward way these on the left are ranged but on the right a chosen band appears who fought beneath the banner of jehovah and defied satans united legions some unmoved at the grim tyrants frown over barbarous climes diffused the gospels light some long immured sad servitude in chains and dungeons pined or racked with all the agonies of pain breathed out their faithful lives thrice happy they whom heaven elected to that glorious strife  here are they placed whose kind munificence made heavenborn science raise her drooping head and on the labors of a future race entailed their just reward thou amongst these good seaton whose welljudgd benevolence fostering fair genius bad the poets hand bring annual offerings to his makers shrine shall find the generous care was not in vain  here is that favorite band whom mercy mild gods best loved attribute adorned whose gate stood ever open to the strangers call who fed the hungry to the thirsty lip reached out the friendly cup whose care benign from the rude blast secured the pilgrims side who heard the widows tender tale and shook the galling shackle from the prisoners feet who each endearing tie each office knew of meekeyd

in rude verse blazon those deeds thyself did never reveal for thee nor rankling envy can infect nor rage transport nor high oerweening pride puff up with vain conceit never did thou smile to see the sinner as a verdant tree spread his luxuriant branches over the stream while like some blasted trunk the righteous fall prostrate forlorn when prophesies shall fail when tongues shall cease when knowledge is no more and this great day is come thou by the throne shall sit triumphant thither lovely maid bear me o bear me on thy soaring wing and through the adamantine gates of heaven conduct my steps safe from the fiery gulf and dark abyss where sin and satan reign but can the muse her numbers all too weak tell how that restless element of fire shall wage with seas and earth intestine war and deluge all creation whether so some think the comet as through fields of air lawless he wanders shall rush headlong on thwarting the ecliptic where the unconscious earth rolls in her wonted course whether the sun with force centripetal into his orb attract her long reluctant or the caves those dread vulcanos where engendering lie sulphurous minerals from their dark abyss pour streams of liquid fire while from above as est on sodom heavens avenging hand rains fierce combustion  where are now the works of art the toil of ages where are now the imperial cities sepulchers and domes trophies and

thebes opened her hundred portals  tell me where stood seagirt albion  where imperial rome propt by seven hills sat like a sceptred queen and awed the tributary world to peace  show me the rampart

that azure vault with all those radiant orbs sinks in the universal ruin lost  no more shall planets round their central sun move in harmonious dance no more the moon hang out her silver lamp and those fixed stars spangling the golden canopy of night which often the tuscan with his optic glass called from their wondrous height to read their names and magnitude some winged minister shall quench and surest sign that all on earth is lost shall rend from heaven the mystic bow such is that awful that tremendous day whose coming who shall tell for as a thief unheard unseen it steals with silent pace through nights dark gloom  perhaps as here i sit and rudely carol these incondite lays soon shall the hand be checked and dumb the mouth that lisps the faultering strain  o may it never intrude unwelcome on an illspent hour but find me wrapped in meditations high hymning my great creator  power supreme  o everlasting king to thee i kneel  to thee i lift my voice with fervent heat  melt all

thy righteous wrath  and midst the wreck of worlds remember man to a lady going to bathe in the sea by george keate esquire venus most histories agree sprung from the ferment of the sea yet i confess i am always loath to think such beauty was but froth or that the ocean which more odd is should from a bubble spawn a goddess though hence my laura learned fellows of such its wondrous powers still tell us that every mother brings her daughter to dip in this specific water expecting from the briny wave charms which it once to venus gave these charms my laura strive to gain and that you may not bathe in vain i will here as well as i am able give you a moral to this fable would you a goddess reign over all from the wide flood its virtues call free from each stain thy bosom keep clear be it as this azure deep which no capricious passion knows but duly ebbs and duly flows though sometimes ruffled calmed as soon still constant to its faithful moon at whose approach with pride it swells and to

profane loquacious insolent and loud the grave jackpudding of a sniveling crowd who promised heaven in change for pence receive for those who teach to die know how to live the prude austere who shuns each forward spark meets less reserved her footman in the dark the gay coquet the coxcomb and the wit across lifes stage like airy phantoms flit applause nor pity sure their parts command the mark of scorn let affectation stand if then the finished man can sometimes err and make mistakes on the worlds theater desert himself as various passions call and prove at last no character at all we ask your candor if in us appears the imperfect growth of unexperienced years though buds yet learning like the sun has power to rear the stem and paint the future flower if john should not each stroke of guilt impart nor constance triumph over the feeling heart think in lifes happy morn we cannot know the sad extent of baseness or of woe boys as we are to us each scene is new if sometimes wrong even there we copy you to bold attempts be then indulgence shown and learn to pity faults so like your own epilogue to the same play spoken by constance by the same spite of court tricks of sorrow madness pain i

rise spurns the base earth and seems to reach the skies but when descending from the sacred theme of boundless power and excellence supreme they would for man and his precarious throne exact obedience due to heaven alone forbid resistance to his worst commands and place gods thunderbolts in mortal hands the vision sinks to lifes contracted span and rising passion speaks me still a man what shall a tyrant trample on the laws and stop the source whence all his power he draws his countrys rights to foreign foes betray lavish her wealth yet stipulate for pay to shameful falsehoods venal slaves suborn and dare to laugh the virtuous man to scorn deride religion justice honor fame and hardly know of honesty the name in luxurys lap lie screend from cares and pains and only toil to forge his subjects chains and shall he hope the public voice to drown the voice which gave and can resume his crown when conscience bares her horrors and the dread of sudden vengeance bursting over his head wrings his black soul when injured nations groan and cries of millions shake his tottering throne shall flattering churchmen soothe his guilty ears with tortured texts to calm his growing fears exalt his power above the aetherial climes and call down heaven to sanctify his crimes o impious doctrine  servile priests away your prince you poison and your god betray hapless the monach who in evil hour drinks from your cup the draught of lawless power the magic potion boils within his veins and locks each sense in adamantine chains reason revolts insatiate thirst ensues the wild delirium each fresh

but wealth and power your aims you even could make a solomon of james behold the pedant throned in awkward state absorbed in pride ridiculously great his courtiers seem to tremble at his nod his prelates call his voice the voice of god weakness and vanity with them combine and james believes his majesty divine presumptuous wretch almighty power to scan while every action proves him less than man by your delusions to the scaffold led martyred by you a royal charles has bled teach then ye sycophants o teach his son the gloomy paths of tyranny to shun teach him to prize religions sacred claim teach him how virtue leads to honest fame how freedoms wreath a monarchs brows adorns nor basely sawning plant his couch with thorns point to his view his peoples love alone the solid basis of his steadfast throne chosen by them their dearest rights to guard the bad to punish and the good reward clement and just let him the scepter sway and willing subjects shall with pride obey shall vie to execute his high commands his throne their hearts his sword and shield their hands happy the prince thrice firmly fixed his crown who builds on public good his chaste renown studious to bless who knows no second aim his peoples interest and his own the same the ease of millions rests upon his cares and thus heavens high prerogative he shares wide from the throne the blessed contagion spreads over all the land its gladdening influence sheds factions discordant sounds are heard no more and soul corruption flies the indignant shore his ministers with joy their courses run and borrow luster from the royal sun but should some upstart trained in slaverys school learned in the maxims of despotick rule full fraught with forms and grave pedantick pride mysterious cloak the minds defects to hide sordid in small things prodigal in great saving for minions squandering for the state  should such a miscreant born for englands bane obscure the glories of a prosperous reign gain by the semblance of each praiseful art a pious princes unsuspecting heart envious of worth and talents not his own chase all experienced merit from the throne to guide the helm a motley crew compose servile

knee to baal  should albions fate decree the baneful hour  short be the date of his detested power soon may his sovereign break his iron rods and hear his people for their voice is gods cease then your wiles ye fawning courtiers cease suffer your rulers to repose in peace by reason led give proper names to things god made them men the people made them kings to all their acts but legal powers belong thus englands monarch never can do wrong of right divine let soolish filmer dream the public welfare is the law supreme lives there a wretch whose base degenerate soul can crouch beneath a tyrants stern control cringe to his nod ignobly kiss the hand in galling chains that binds his native land purchased by gold or awed by slavish sear abandon all his ancestors held dear tamely behold that fruit of glorious toil englands great charter made a russians spoil hear unconcerned his injured country groan nor stretch an arm to hurl him from the throne let such to freedom forfeit all their claims and charless minious be the slaves of james but soft awhile  now cavendish attend the warm effusions of thy dying friend fearless who dares his inmost thoughts reveal when thus to heaven he makes his last appeal allgracious god whose goodness knows no bounds whose power the ample universe surrounds in whose great balance infinitely just kings are but men and men are only dust at thy tribunal low thy suppliant falls and here condemned on thee for mercy calls thou hearst not lord an hypocrite complain and sure with thee hypocrisy were vain to thy allpiercing eye the heart lies bare thou know my sins and knowing still can spare though partial power its ministers may awe and murder here by specious forms of law the axe which executes the harsh decree but wounds the flesh to set the spirit free well may the man a tyrants frown despise who spurning earth to heaven for refuge flies and on thy mercy when his foes prevail builds his firm trust that rock can never fail hear then jehovah hear thy servants prayer be englands welfare thy peculiar care defend her laws her worship chaste and pure and guard her rights while heaven and earth endure o let not ever fell tyrannick sway his bloodstained standard on her shores display nor fiery zeal usurp thy holy name blinded with blood and wrapped in rolls of flame in vain let slavery shake her threatening chain and persecution wave her torch in vain arise o lord and hear thy peoples call nor for one man let three great kingdoms fall o that my blood may glut the barbarous rage of freedoms foes and englands ills assuage  grant but that prayer i ask for no repeal a willing victim for my countrys weal with rapturous joy the crimson stream shall flow and my heart leap to meet the friendly blow but should the fiend though drenched with human gore dire bigotry insatiate thirst for more and armed from rome seek this devoted land death in her eye and bondage in her hand  blast her fell purpose blast her foul desires break short her sword and quench her horrid fires raise up some champion zealous to maintain the sacred compact by which monarchs reign wise to foresee all danger from afar and brave to meet the thunders of the war let pure religion not to forms confined and love of freedom fill his generous mind warm let his breast with sparks celestial glow benign to man the tyrants deadly foe while sinking nations rest upon his arm do thou the great deliverer shield from harm inspire his councils aid his righteous sword till albion rings with liberty restored thence let her years in bright succession run and freedom reign coaeval with the sun it is done my candish heaven has heard my prayer so speaks my heart for all is rapture there to belgias coast advert thy ravished eyes that happy coast whence all our hopes arise behold the prince perhaps thy future king from whose green years maturest blessings spring whose youthful arm when alloerwhelming power ruthless marched forth his country to devour with firm braced nerve repelled the brutal force and stopped the unwieldy giant in his course great william hail who sceptres could despise and spurn a crown with unretorted eyes o when will princes learn to copy thee and leave mankind as heaven ordained them free haste mighty chief our injured rights restore quick spread thy sails for albions longing shore haste mighty chief ere millions groan enslaved and add three realms to one already saved while freedom lives thy memory shall be dear and reap fresh honors each returning year nations preserved shall yield immortal fame and endless ages bless thy glorious name then shall my candish foremost in the field by justice armed his sword conspicuous wield while willing legions crowd around his car and rush impetuous to the righteous war on that great day be every chance defied and think thy russell combats by thy side nor crowned with victory cease thy generous toil till firmest peace secure this happy isle never let thine honest open heart believe professions specious forged but to deceive fear may extort them when resources fail but o reject the baseless flattering tale think not that promises or oaths can bind with solemn ties a romedevoted mind which yields to all the holy juggler says and deep imbibes the bloody damning faith what though the bigot raise to heaven his eyes and call the almighty witness from the skies soon as the wished occasion he explores to plant the roman cross on englands shores all all will vanish while his priests applaud and saint the perjurer for the pious fraud far let him fly these freedombreathing climes and seek proud rome the fosterer of his crimes there let him strive to mount the papal chair and scatter empty thunders in the air grimly preside in superstitions school and curse those kingdoms he could never rule here let me pause and bid the world adieu while heavens bright mansions open to my view  yet still one care one tender care remains my bounteous friend relieve a fathers pains watch over my son inform his waxen youth and mould his mind to virtue and to truth soon let him learn fair liberty to prize and envy him who for his country dies in one short sentence to comprize the whole transfuse to his the virtues of thy soul preserve thy life my too too generous friend nor seek with mine thy happier fate to blend live for thy country live to guard her laws proceed and prosper in the glorious cause while i though vanquished scorn the field to fly but boldly face my foes and bravely die let princely monmouth courtly wiles beware nor trust too far to fond paternal care too often dark deeds deform the midnight cell heaven only knows how noble essex fell sidney yet lives whose comprehensive mind ranges at large through systems unconfined wrapped in himself he scorns the tyrants power and hurls defiance even from the tower with tranquil brow awaits the unjust decree and armed with virtue looks to follow me candish farewell may fame our names entwine through life i loved thee dying i am thine wh pious rites let dust to dust be thrown and thus inscribe my monumental stone  here russel lies enfranchised by the grave  he prized his birthright nor would live a slave  few were his words but honest and sincere  dear were his friends his country still more dear  in parents children wife supremely blessed  but that one passion swallowed all the rest  to guard her freedom was his only pride  such was his love and for that love he died yet fear not thou when liberty displays her glorious flag to steer his course to praise for know whoever thou art that readst his fate and think perhaps his sufferings were too great blessed as he was at her imperial call wife children parents he resigned them all each fond affection then forsook his soul and amor patriae occupied the whole in that great cause he joyd to meet his doom blessed the keen axe and triumphed over the tomb the hour draws near  but what are hours to me hours days and years hence

but in vain all my hopes all my wishes are vain while the streams and the breezes thus hear me complain while the birds to my anguish reply from the bough he flies from my arms and regards not my woe  ah too easy to trust all the oaths that he swore when he vowed that no nymph had ever charmed him before be warned then ye fair nor too rashly believe think the men when they flatter but want to

thy bolts thy missive vengeance run which is not hallowed by the blood of thy beloved son monody to the memory of a young lady by mr shaw yet do i live o how shall i sustain this vast unutterable weight of woe this worse than hunger poverty or pain or all the complicated ills below  she in whose life my hopes were treasured all is gone  for ever fled  my dearest emmas dead these eyes these tearswoln eyes beheld her fall ah no  she lives on some far happier shore she lives  but cruel thought she lives for me no more i who the tedious absence of a day removed would languish for my charmers sight would chide the lingering moments for delay and fondly blame the slow return of night how how shall i endure o misery past a cure hours days and years successively to roll nor ever more behold the comfort of my soul was she not all my fondest wish could frame did ever mind so much of heaven partake did she not love me with the purest flame and give up friends and fortune for my sake though mild as evening skies with downcast streaming eyes stood the stern frown of supercilious brows deaf to their brutal threats and faithful to her vows come then some muse the saddest of the train no more your bard shall dwell on idle lays teach me each moving melancholy strain and o discard the pageantry of phrase ill suit the flowers of speech with woes like mine thus happily as i paint the source of my complaint my soul may own the impassioned line a flood of tears may gush to my relief and from my swelling heart discharge this load of grief forbear my fond officious friends forbear to wound my ears with the sad tales you tell  how good she was how gentle and how fair in pity cease  alas i know too well how in her sweet expressive face beamed forth the beauties of her mind yet heightened by exterior grace of manners most engaging most refined no piteous object could she see but her soft bosom shared the woe whilst smiles of affability endeared whatever boon she might bestow whatever the emotions of her heart still shone conspicuous in her eyes stranger to every female art alike to feign or to disguise and o the boast how rare the secret in her faithful breast reposed she never with lawless tongue disclosed in sacred silence lodged inviolate there o feeble words  unable to express her matchless virtues or my own distress relentless death that steeled to human woe with murderous hands deals havoc on mankind why cruel strike this deprecated blow and leave such wretched multitudes behind hark groans come winged on every breeze the sons of grief prefer their ardent vow oppressed with sorrow want or dire disease and supplicate thy aid as i do now in vain  perverse still on the unweeting head it is thine thy vengeful darts to shed hopes infant blossoms to destroy and drench in tears the face of joy but oh fell tyrant yet expect the hour when virtue shall renounce thy power when thou no more shall blot the face of day nor mortals tremble at thy rigid sway alas the day  wherever i turn my eyes some sad memento of my loss appears i fly the fatal house  suppress my sighs resolved to dry my unavailing tears but ah in vain  no change of time or place the memory can efface of all that sweetness that enchanting air now lost and naught remains but anguish and despair where were the delegates of heaven oh where appointed virtues children safe to keep had innocence or virtue been their care she had not died nor had i lived to weep moved by my tears and by her patience moved to see her force the endearing smile my sorrows to beguile when tortures keenest rage she proved sure they had warded that untimely dart which broke her thread of life and rent a husbands heart how shall i ever forget that dreadful hour when feeling deaths resistless power my hand she pressed wet with her falling tears and thus in faultering accents spoke her fears  ah my loved lord the transient scene is over  and we must part alas to meet no more  but oh if ever thy emmas name was dear  if ever thy vows have charmed my ravished ear  if from thy loved embrace my heart to gain  proud friends have frowned and fortune smiled in vain  if it has been my sole endeavor still  to act in all obsequious to thy will  to watch thy very smiles thy wish to know  then only truly blessed when thou were so  if i have doated with that fond excess  nor love could add nor fortune make it less  if this i have done and more  oh then be kind  to the dear lovely babe i leave behind  when time my oncelovd memory shall efface  some happier maid may take thy emmas place  with envious eyes thy partial fondness see  and hate it for the love thou bore to me  my dearest s  forgive a womans fears  but one word more i cannot bear thy tears  promise  and i will trust thy faithful vow  often have i tried and ever sound thee true  that to some distant spot thou will remove  this fatal pledge of hapless emmas love  where safe thy blandishments it may partake  and oh be tender for its mothers sake  will thou   i know thou will  sad silence speaks assent  and in that pleasing hope thy emma dies content i who with more than manly strength have bore the various ills imposed by cruel fate sustain the firmness of my soul no more but sink beneath the weight just heaven i cried from memorys earliest day no comfort has thy wretched suppliant known misfortune still with unrelenting sway has claimed me for her own but o  in pity to my grief restore this only source of bliss i ask  i ask no more  vain hope  the irrevocable doom is past even now she looks  she sighs her last  vainly i strive to stay her fleeting breath and with rebellious heart protest against her death when the stern tyrant closed her lovely eyes how did i rave untaught to bear the blow with impious wish to tear her from the skies how curse my fate in bitterness of woe but whither would this dreadful frenzy lead fond man forbear thy fruitless sorrow spare dare not to task what heavens high will decreed in humble reverence kiss the afflictive rod and prostrate bow to an offended god perhaps kind heaven in mercy dealt the blow some saving truth thy roving soul to teach to wean thy heart from grovelling views below and point out bliss beyond misfortunes reach to show that all the flattering schemes of joy which towering hope so fondly builds in air one fatal moment can destroy and plunge the exulting maniac in despair then o with pious fortitude sustain thy present loss  happily thy future gain nor let thy emma die in vain time shall administer its wonted balm and hush this storm of grief to no unpleasing calm thus the poor bird by some disastrous fate caught and imprisoned in a lonely cage torn from its native fields and dearer mate flutters awhile and spends its little rage but finding all its efforts weak and vain no more it pants and rages for the plain moping awhile in sullen mood droops the sweet mourner  but ere long prunes its light wings and pecks its food and meditates the song serenely sorrowing breathes its piteous case and with its plaintive warblings saddens all the place forgive me heaven  yet  yet the tears will flow to think how soon my scene of bliss is past my budding joys just promising to blow all nipt and withered by one envious blast my hours that laughing wont to fleet away move heavily along where is now the sprightly jest the jocund song time creeps unconscious of delight how shall i cheat the tedious day and o  the joyless night where shall i rest my weary head how shall i find repose on a sad widowed bed come laudanum theban drug the wretchs only aid to my torn heart its former peace restore thy votary wrapped in thy lethean shade awhile shall cease his sorrows to deplore happily when locked in sleeps embrace again i shall behold my emmas face again with transport hear her voice soft whispering in my ear may steal once more a balmy kiss and taste at least of visionary bliss but ah the unwelcome morns obtruding light will all my shadowy schemes of bliss depose will tear the dear illusion from my sight and wake me to the sense of all my woes if to the verdant fields i stray alas what pleasures now can these convey her lovely form pursues wherever i go and darkens all the scene with woe by natures lavish bounties cheered no more sorrowing i rove through valley grot and grove naught can their beauties or my loss restore no herb no plant can medicine my disease and my sad sighs are borne on every passing breeze sickness and sorrow hovering round my bed who now with anxious haste shall bring relief with lenient hand support my drooping head assuage my pains and mitigate my grief should worldly business call away who now shall in my absence fondly mourn count every minute of the loitering day impatient for my quick return should aught my bosom discompose who now with sweet complacent air shall smooth the rugged brow of care and soften all my woes too faithful memory  cease o cease  how shall i ever regain my peace o to forget her  but how vain each art whilst every virtue lives imprinted on my heart and thou my little cherub left behind to hear a fathers plaints to share his woes when reasons dawn informs thy infant mind and thy sweetlisping tongue shall ask the cause how often with sorrow shall mine eyes run over when twining round my knees i trace thy mothers smile upon thy face how often to my full heart shall thou restore sad memory of my joys  ah now no more by blessings once enjoyed now more distressed more beggar by the riches once possessed my little darling  dearer to me grown by all the tears thoust caused  o strange to hear bought with a life yet dearer than thy own thy cradle purchased with thy mothers bier who now shall seek with fond delight thy infant steps to guide aright she who with doting eyes would gaze on all thy little artless ways by all thy soft endearments blessed and clasp thee often with transport to her breast alas is gone  yet shall thou prove a fathers dearest tenderest love and o sweet senseless smiler envied state as yet unconscious of thy hapless fate when years thy judgment shall mature and reason shows those ills it cannot cure will thou a fathers grief to assuage for virtue prove the phoenix of the earth like her thy mother died to give thee birth and be the comfort of my age when sick and languishing i lie will thou my emmas wonted care supply and often as to thy listening ear thy mothers virtues and her fate i tell say will thou drop the tender tear whilst on the mournful theme i dwell then fondly stealing to thy fathers side whenever thou see the soft distress which i would vainly seek to hide say will thou strive to make it less to sooth my sorrows all thy cares employ and in my cup of grief infuse one drop of joy an evening address to a nightingale by the same sweet bird that kindly perching near pourest thy plaints melodious in mine ear not like base worldlings tutored to forego the melancholy haunts of woe thanks for thy sorrowsoothing strain  for surely thou have known to prove like me the pangs of hapless love else why so feelingly complain and with thy piteous notes thus sadden all the grove say do thou mourn thy ravished mate that often enamored on thy strains has hung or has the cruel hand of fate bereft thee of thy darling young alas for both i weep  in all the pride of youthful charms a beauteous bride torn from my circling arms a lovely babe that should have lived to bless and fill my doting eyes with frequent tears at once the source of rapture and distress the flattering prop of my declining years in vain from death to rescue i essayed by every art that science could devise alas it languishd for a mothers aid and winged its flight to seek her in the skies  then o our comforts be the same at evenings peaceful hour to shun the noisy paths of wealth and fame and breathe our sorrows in this lonely bower but why alas to thee complain to thee  unconscious of my pain soon shall thou cease to mourn thy lot severe and hail the dawning of a happier year the genial warmth of joyrenewing spring again shall plume thy shattered wing again thy little heart shall transport prove again shall slow thy notes responsive to thy love but o for me in vain may seasons roll naught can dry up the fountain of my tears deploring still the comfort of my soul i count my sorrows by increasing years tell me thou siren hope deceiver say where is the promised period of my woes full three long lingering years have rolled away and yet i weep a stranger to repose o what delusion did thy tongue employ  that emmas fatal pledge of love  her last bequest  with all a mothers care  the bitterness of sorrow should remove  soften the horrors of despair  and cheer a heart long lost to joy how often when fondling in mine arms gazing enraptured on its angelface my soul the maze of fate would vainly trace and burn with all a fathers fond alarms and o what flattering scenes had fancy feigned how did i rave of blessings yet in store till every aching sense was sweetly pained and my full heart could bear nor tongue could utter more   just heaven i cried  with recent hopes elate  yet i will live  will live though emmas dead   so long bowed down beneath the storms of fate  yet will i raise my woedejected head  my little emma now my all  will want a fathers care  her looks her wants my rash resolves recall  and for her sake the ills of life i will bear  and often together well complain  complaint the only bliss my soul can know  from me my child shall learn the mournful strain  and prattle tales of woe  and o in that auspicious hour  when fate resigns her persecuting power  with duteous zeal her hand shall close  no more to weep  my sorrowstreaming eyes  when death gives misery repose  and opes a glorious passage to the skies vain thought it must not be  she too is dead  the flattering scene is over  my hopes for ever  ever fled  and vengeance can no more  crushed by misfortune  blasted by disease  and none  none left to bear a friendly part to meditate my welfare health or ease or sooth the anguish of an aching heart now all one gloomy scene till welcome death with lenient hand o falsely deemed severe shall kindly stop my griefexhausted breath and dry up every tear perhaps obsequious to my will but ah from my affections far removed the last sad office strangers may fulfill as if i never had been beloved as if unconscious of poetic fire i never had touched the trembling lyre as if my niggard hand never dealt relief nor my heart melted at anothers grief yet  while this weary life shall last while yet my tongue can form the impassioned strain in piteous accents shall the muse complain and dwell with fond delay on blessings past for o how grateful to a wounded heart the tale of misery to impart from others eyes bid artless sorrows flow and raise esteem upon the base of woe even he lord lyttelton  the noblest of the tuneful throng shall

twas therefore said by ancient sages that love of life increased with years so much that in our latter stages when pains grow sharp and sickness rages the greatest love of life appears this great affection to believe which all confess but few perceive if old assertions cannot prevail be pleased to hear a modern tale when sports went round and all were gay on neighbor dobsons wedding day death called aside the jocund groom with him into another room and looking grave you must says he  quit your sweet bride and come with me  with you and quit my susans side  with you the hapless husband cried  young as i am it is monstrous hard  besides in truth i am not prepared  my thoughts on other matters go  this is my weddingnight you know what more he urged i have not heard his reasons could not well be stronger so death the poor delinquent spared and left to live a little longer yet calling up a serious look his hourglass trembled while he spoke  neighbor he said farewell no more  shall death disturb your mirthful hour  and further to avoid all blame  of cruelty upon my name  to give you time for preparation  and fit you for your future station  three several warnings you shall have  before youre summoned to the grave  willing for once i will quit my prey  and grant a kind reprieve  in hopes you will have no more to say  but when i call again this way  wellpleased the world will leave to these conditions both consented and parted perfectly contented what next the hero of our tale befell how long he lived how wise how well how roundly he pursued his course and smokd his pipe and strokd his horse the willing muse shall tell he chafferd then he bought he sold nor once perceived his growing old nor thought of death as near his friends not false his wife no shrew many his gains his children few he passed his hours in peace but while he viewed his wealth increase while thus along lifes dusty road the beaten track content he trod old time whose haste no mortal spares uncalled unheeded unawares brought on his eightieth year and now one night in musing mood as all alone he sat the unwelcome messenger of fate once more before him stood half killed with anger and surprise  so soon returned old dobson cries  so soon do you call it death replies  surely my friend youre but in jest  since i was here before  it is sixandthirty years at least  and you are now fourscore  so much the worse the clown rejoined  to spare the aged would be kind  however see your search be legal  and your authority  is it regal  else you are come on a fools errand  with but a ecretarys warrant  besides you promised me three warnings  which i have looked for nights and mornings  but for that loss of time and ease  i can recover damages  i know cries death that at the best  i seldom am a welcome guest  but dont be captious friend at least  i little thought you would still be able  to stump about your farm and stable  your years have run to a great length  i wish you joy though of your strength  hold says the farmer not so fast  i have been lame these four years past  and no great wonder death replies  however you still keep your eyes  and sure to see ones loves and friends  for legs and arms would make amends  perhaps says dobson so it might  but latterly i have lost my sight  this is a shocking story faith  yet there is some comfort still says death  each strives your sadness to amuse  i warrant you hear all the news  there is none cries he and if there were  i am grown so deaf i could not hear  nay then the spectre stern rejoined  these are unjustifiable yearnings  if you are lame and deaf and blind  you have had your three sufficient warnings  so come along no more well part he said and touched him with his dart and now old dobson

is blessed and calmly waits eternal rest alexis a pastoral ballad in two parts by a lady alexis the pride of the plain beside a clear brook lay reclined his complaint was fair daphnes disdain who had proved to the shepherd unkind his flock was no longer his care his pipe now no longer could please he neglected his dress and his hair and by solitude fed his disease  poor shepherd he wildly exclaimed  alas what avails all thy moan  the joys thy fond fancy had framed  with daphne for ever are flown  how could you o daphne deceive  a swain not unworthy your love  why did thou alexis believe  such a maid could thy passion approve  her form is replete with each grace  the diamond beams forth in her eye  the lily expands over her face  and the rosebud imparts its soft dye  no warbler can rival her song  philomela with envy complains  the streams glide in silence along  the glad zephyrs diffuse her soft strains  when daphne appeared in the mead  her presence enlivened the morn  now the winds roughly blow round my head  and the suns cheerful beams are withdrawn  no longer these meadows look green  now the warblers abandon the grove  the air breathes no longer serene  all summer is fled with my love  oh daphne you heard my fond sighs  you did not my passion disdain  when i gazed with delight on your eyes  my soft glances you did not restrain  but now you make sport of my woes  and laugh at the sufferings i feel  i enjoy not the sweets of repose  nor can i my torments conceal  farewell ye sad scenes of my love  i shall never revisit you more  adieu to the mead an he grove  twas here i first learned to adore  i will banish this wretch from her sight  i know not what fate may ensue  never more can i taste of delight  to every enjoyment adieu part the second with a torrent of heartbursting grief alexis continues his moan tears gave him some little relief yet he ceased not to sigh and to groan pastora by chance hastened by she saw the poor shepherds despair soft pity appeared in her eye she asked him the source of his care  what cause has alexis to weep with looks of compassion she said  have you lost ever a lamb or a sheep  or is tray the poor favorite dead  or perhaps your fair daphnes unkind  perhaps for her coyness you grieve  ah it is jealousy poisons your mind  but appearances often deceive the shepherd just raised up his head he thanked the kind maid for her care he confessed that all comfort was fled and nothing was left but despair pastora even wept at the tale and wished she could ease his distress could her interest with daphne prevail his suffering should soon find redress he gazed on the fair with surprise and admired the goodnature she showed when she went he withdrew not his eyes but with pleasure her footsteps pursued her sweetness her beauty and truth with daphnes late falsehood compared so charmed so astonished the youth that his heart for a change was prepared yet still his fond wish would arise  ah was but my daphne thus kind  i would wipe off these tears from my eyes  and give up my sighs to the wind he said and arose from the ground then instant returned to his cot soon in sleep every suffering was drowned and daphnes unkindness forgot with the sun the next morn he arose pastora he sought in the grove he repeated the tale of his woes and mourned the sad fate of his love pastora heard every complaint again he imparted his grief he talked without fear or constraint and found from her converse relief the friendship he felt for the fair each meeting still served to improve he then blessed his late cause of despair and became a true votary to love twas no longer for beauty he sighed he no longer to merit was blind twas his joy and a laudable pride that he valued the charms of the mind pastora with blushes confessed that she felt all the force of true love but that reason her passion suppressed yet that now she must own and approve she soon gave her hand to the swain who proclaimed to each shepherd this truth he had met a reward for his pain more lasting than beauty and youth when spring decks with verdure the mead love wafts milder fragrance around when summer invites to the shade love strews with fresh flowrets the ground in autumn through cornfieldsd they rove and their loves as in springtime appear though winter disrobes the known grove yet their love varies not with

protective care pleased when rude tempests vex the ruffled air for the warm roof to leave the naked grove kindest and last of summers tuneful train ah do not yet give over thy plaintive lay but charm mild zephyr to a longer stay and often renew thy sweetlyparting strain so when rough winter frowns with brow severe and chilling blasts shall strip the sheltering trees when meagre want that shivering

toils nor heeds fierce suns nor stubborn soils thee often i met in hertfords vale what time the tuneful nightingale recited sweet her solemn song the beeches and the oaks among upon the banks of lee

had joy no date and age no need then these delights my mind might move to live with thee and be thy love a poem by the same shall i like an hermit dwell on a rock or in a cell calling home the smallest part that is missing of my heart to bestow it where i may meet a rival every day if she undervalues me what care i how sair she be were her tresses angel gold if a stranger may be bold unrebuked unafraid to convert them to a brayde and with little more ado work them into bracelets too if the mine be grown so free what care i how rich it be were her hands as rich a prize as her hairs or precious eyes if she lay them out to take kisses for goodmanners sake and let every lover skip from her hand unto her lip if she seem not chaste to me what care i how chaste she be no she must be perfect snow in effect as well as show warming but as snowballs do not like fire by burning too but when she by change has got to her heart a second lot then if others share with me farewell her whatever she be in imitation of marloe come live with me and be my dear and we will revel all the year in plains and groves on hills and dales where fragrant air breeds sweetest gales there shall you have the beauteous pine the cedar and the spreading vine and all the woods to be a screen lest phoebus kiss my summers green the seat of your disport shall be over some river in a tree where silver sands and pebbles sing eternal ditties to the spring there shall you see the nymphs at play and how the satyrs spend the day the fishes gliding on the sands offering their bellies to your hands the birds with heavenlytuned throats possess woods echo with sweet notes which to your senses will impart a music to inflame the heart upon the bare and leafless oak the ringdoves wooings will provoke a colder blood than you possess to play with me and do no less in bowers of laurel trimly dight we will outwear the silent night while flora busy is to spread her richest treasure on our bed ten thousand glowworms shall attend and all their sparkling lights shall spend all to adorn and beautify your lodging with more majesty then in my arms will i enclose lilies fair mixture with the rose whose nice perfections in loves play shall tune me to the highest key thus as we pass the welcome night in sportful pleasure and delight the nimble fairies on the ground shall dance and sing melodious sounds if these may serve for to entice your presence to loves paradise then come with me and be my dear and we will strait begin the year morning by j cunningham in the barn the tenant cock close to partlet perched on high briskly crows the shepherds clock and proclaims the morning nigh swiftly from the mountains brow shadows nursed by night retire and the peeping sunbeam now paints with gold the villagespire now the pinetrees waving top gently greets the morning gale and the newwakd kidlings crop daisies round the dewy vale philomel forsakes the thorn plaintive where she prates at night and the lark to greet the morn soars beyond the shepherds sight from the claybuilt cottageridge see the chattering swallow spring darting through the onearchd bridge quick she dips her dappled wing lo the busy bees employed restless till their task be done now from sweet to sweet uncloyd sipping dew before the sun trickling through the crevicd rock see the silver stream distill sweet refreshment for the flock when it is sundrove from the hill ploughmen for the promised corn ripening over the banks of tweed anxious hear the huntsmans horn softened by the shepherds reed sweet oh sweet the warbling throng on the white emblossomd spray all is music mirth and song at the jocund dawn of day noon by the same fervid now the sunbeam glows drinking deep the morning gem not a dewdrops left the rose to refresh her parent stem by the brook the shepherd dines from the fierce meridian heat sheltered by the branching pines pendent over his grassy seat see the flocks forsake the glade where uncheckd the sunbeams fall sure to find a pleasing shade by the ivyd abbey wall echo in her airy round over the river rock and hill cannot catch a single sound save the clack of yonder mill cattle court the breezes bland where the streamlet wanders cool or with languid silence stand midway in the marshy pool but from mountain dell or stream not a fluttering zephyr springs fearful lest the piercing beam scorch its soft its silken wings not a leaf has leave to stir natures lulled serene and still quiet even the shepherds cur sleeping on the heathclad hill languid is the landscape round till the fresh descending shower kindly cools the thirsty ground and revives each fainting flower now the hill the hedge is green now the warblers throats in tune blithsome is the vernal scene brightened by the beams of noon evening by the same as the plodding ploughman goes homeward to the hamlet bound giantlike his shadow grows lengthened over the level ground over the mead the bullock strays free  the furrowed task is done and the village windows blaze burnished by the setting sun mark him from behind the hill strike the purplepainted sky can the pencils mimic skill copy the refulgent dye where the rising forest spreads round the timedecaying dome to their highbuilt airy beds see the rooks returning home as the lark with varied tune carrols to the evening loud mark the mild resplendent moon breaking through a parted cloud now the hermit howlet peeps from the barn or twisted brake and the curling vapor creeps over the lilyborderd lake as the trout in speckled pride playful from its bosom springs to the banks a ruffled tide verges in successive rings tripping through the silken grass over the pathdivided dale see the rosecomplexiond lass with the wellpoisd milkingpail linnets with
