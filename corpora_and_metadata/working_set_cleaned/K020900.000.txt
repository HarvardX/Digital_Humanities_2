the times  price one shilling and sixpence  the times a comedy  as it is now performing at the theater royal in drury lane  by mrs griffith  london printed for fielding and walker paternosterrow j dodsley pall mall t becket strand and t davies russel street covent garden  mdcclxxx  advertisement the favorable reception which the following comedy has met with from a candid and generous public calls for my warmest acknowledgements and though it may be of little consequence to them to know the source of so slight an amusement i think myself bound by truth and gratitude to own that the first idea of this piece was hinted to me by my everrespected and lamented friend mr garrick who mentioned goldonis bourru bienfaisant as a sketch that if adapted to our times and manners might be rendered pleasing to an english audience those who have read the french piece must judge how far i have profited by goldonis work but of this i am certain that had mr garrick lived to afford me that friendly assistance which he has done on former occasions my comedy would have been more worthy of the reception with which it has been honored i will however hope that with all its imperfections on its head the same indulgence which attended its representation will follow it into the closet and that the reader will allow me the only merit i presume to claim that of meaning well  i gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to my muchesteemed friend mr sheridan senior for his kind attention to the getting up my play my ill health not permitting me to attend one rehearsal but mr sheridans friendship wherever professed is not of modern growth  i have more than common acknowledgements to make to all the performers in my comedy particularly to mrs abington and miss pope who both cheerfully undertook parts out of their usual line of acting and in which they have both excelled i should be utterly unable to express my sentiments of mr king in the character of sir william woodley if i were not at liberty seriously to adopt the very words which he humorously but justly speaks of himself under a personated character in the critic  but it is impossible for language to do justice to mr king indeed he more than merited those repeated bursts of applause which he drew from a most brilliant and judicious audience  i flatter myself this little tribute to distinguished merit will not be deemed tedious or impertinent by the public for whose opinion i have the sincerest respect and to whom i have the honor to be  a much obliged and most obedient servant the author london dec         prologue spoken by mr king  to glow with ardour and attempt with zeal the reformation of the public weal is the high duty of the comic muse and though keen attic salt allowed to use to season precept and with art to tickle the sores she means to wash with sharpest pickle yet not the rosy pulpited divine nor lankhaird methodist with rueful whine is more intent to root out vice and folly and make ye all lead lives discreet and holy  yet why to clear the field were all their toil if weeds overspread not the luxuriant soil congreve or wesley whitfield or moliere in vain might prompt the laugh or bribe the tear if no man felt or in himself or neighbor some failing to call forth the zealots labor  if no fair dame descried midst her acquaintance some few who might be mended by repentance loose as the buxom air the youth from college comes fraught with all newmarkets hopeful knowledge in haste to spend the estate not yet his own compleats his ruin ere his beard is grown and when to foreign climes he spreads the sail it is not to enlarge his mind but scape a jail then blessed the poet happy the divine when folly gives the ton from fashions shrine but whilst the priest and satirist reprove those vices which provoke the wrath of jove our author like the patient angler sitting to catch small fry for humbler palates sitting has served a meal not seasoned high with crimes  taste it and if approved applaud the times epilogue spoken by miss farren  while gravepaced tragedy with ohs and starts flies at high game to move and mend your hearts we merrier folks with spirits blithe and jolly just perch upon some little sprig of folly for in this age so pious chaste and grave to rail at vice must surely be to rave yet thanks to here and there a modish fool the comic muse may glean some ridicule jews will be jews if dupes can yet be found and if one frail ones left on english ground she will find a phaeton and pair of ponies to elope  for all men are not maccaronies  those precious dears at least would make her wait  twould be so vulgar not to be too late our sex  but shall i charge the weaker kind or can those fail to stray whose guides are blind let men reform themselves they are our examples  and goods prove seldom better than their samples in former times the gallant british youth were formed for chivalry and love and truth  in such an age in such a

there  exit forward he seems devilishly flurried by that same letter i wish i could come fairly at its contents it is no billetdoux i am certain for i have never found him tripping that way since i have been in the family it must be some matter of business and if it is it may concern me as well as my master i have had my doubts that our affairs were going wrong for some months past our hall has been crowded with sturdy tradesmen and we have had sneaking jews closeted in the library  egad i will venture for where interest is concerned even my honor must give way  takes up the letter he may

have you made   woodley none colonel i shall not be there this meeting   col you amaze me   woodley aside would i had never been there i am sick of the diversion and shall never make another bett on the turf while i live   col why dont you dispose of your stud then it must be an enormous and now an useless expense   woodley horses are the least part of the extravagances incident to racing   col that is selon woodley for i have known several fortunes made on the turf   woodley true  but by those only who had none to lose they are surest to win who carry least weight   col take my advice then and sell your horses   woodley why faith i wish they were disposed of but yet i dont know i should be ashamed i think to advertise them as it might look somehow as if one could not afford to keep them ha ha ha   col ridiculous supposition   woodley ridiculous indeed that you know mountfort is far from the case but i really am tired of the sport and the meeting too is at a time of the year when there are so many more agreeable amusements to be met with in london so that i should be glad to get rid of them with all my heart   col let me dispose of them for you then i will be your auctioneer and try if i cannot emblazon their pedigree with a little of that true humor which charles surface bestows on his ancestors when he sets up their pictures to sale bucephalus the famous bucephalus gentlemen descended in a right line from the renowned quadrupede of that name which had the honor of carrying a greater brute than himself  the immortal alexander    woodley bravo colonel   col or shall we deduce his lineage from    woodley you had better consult tattersall for their pedigree as he is your only herald in those points heighho   col heighho this is but poor encouragement for me to enter on my new profession surely there is something malignant in the air at present for every man i have conversed with this morning seems rather to be depressed with the gloom of november than enlivened by the sunshine of april i have just now left jack knightly and will careless calculating not their nativities but their deaths   woodley i saw them both at boodles yesterday in good health   col not the more likely to live for that i assure you however it was not their natural existence but their necessary subsistence that employed their mathematics   mr woodley you astonish me  why it is but lately they came into possession of great estates   col true  but then they have traveled the modern short and easy road to ruin of granting annuities for this twelvemonth past and are now so nearly arrived at the last stage of their journey that i think jack said he had but two months to run and will flattered himself that as the summer was approaching he might be able to hold out four i advised their compounding the terms and running together for three months each   woodley poor fellows i am sorry for them aside would i could promise myself even so long a reprieve   col what moping again woodley you will infect me if i stay  where are the ladies  in truth my visit was to them for i scarce hoped to find you here are lady mary and your sister visible or shall i pass on to your uncles apartment and pay my respects to him i think there is a door of communication to his house from this room shall i go this way   woodley that may be a service of danger colonel for i fear sir william is not at present much delighted either with his vicinity or affinity to any of this family except my sister   col i am glad to hear you can except my sweet louisa for notwithstanding the brusqueness of his manners i have such an opinion of the old knights good sense and good nature that i cannot readily acquit those he is offended with as wholly free from blame   woodley i subscribe to your censure as far as it relates to myself but the asperity of his behavior to lady mary renders me extremely unhappy and not even my past obligations or future prospects shall ever make me acquiesce in his treating my wife with disrespect   col allow me to say woodley that persons so nearly connected ought to dispense with ceremony in favor of sincerity   woodley that is a dangerous tenet colonel and may be extended till downright rudeness may be considered but as the privilege of familychat   col i think you have no cause for such an apprehension in this case as sir william is quite as singular for goodness of heart as for a deficiency in that outward varnish which too often supplies the place of it but to compound the argument let us admit there may be faults on both sides  enter lady mary and louisa l mary my dear woodley dont i look like a hag today do you know that i have not slept an hour the whole night   woodley i am sorry for it my dear  i hope it was not any illness that prevented your rest   l mary no  i was not the least ill but the uncommon brilliancy of lady mushrooms earrings that i saw at the opera in the evening twinkled all night before my eyes and would not suffer me to close them   col vanity has her vigils i perceive ladies   louisa that is but fair colonel as her festivals seem to bestow such supreme delight on her votaries of both sexes   l mary i think now that a thousand pounds added to my own would make them outblaze lady mushrooms and i am sure my dear woodley will not refuse me such a trifle   woodley i can refuse you nothing  but well talk of it some other time  enter a servant and delivers a letter to mr woodley which he just runs his eye over and puts up l mary what makes you look so grave my love i should almost suppose that letter was from your uncle if he did not live in the same house and had not a peculiar delight in seeing the effect of his own ill temper   louisa the reprehensions of sincere friends proceed oftener from kindness than ill nature   l mary to woodley will you send for setwell tomorrow my dear if you are not at leisure today i must have this bar taken out the middle stone larger and the drop at least twice this size and pray hurry him for i must positively wear them at court next sunday   woodley musing it must be so   l mary you dont attend to me mr woodley   woodley o yes my dear i hear every word you say give me the earrings i will carry them myself to the jeweller   l mary here they are  but dont be too extravagant  i would not have more than a thousand pounds added on any account   col i give you credit for that last caution lady mary as it is uncommon to hear a wife restraining her husbands generosity to herself in this day   l mary his indulgence colonel has ever exceeded my wishes   woodley but never equalled my own aside my heart is breaking for her  enter a servant who gives a printed paper to lady mary servant with mrs bromleys compliments madam and requests you will do her the honor to call on her   l mary o it is the catalogue she promised to mark for me my compliments and i shall be at her door in a few minutes  louisa are you disposed for christes rooms this morning there are abundance of fine things and of course fine people to be there i delight in an auction one meets with so many things there one never thought one wanted before   louisa though it is not my passion i will attend your ladyship with pleasure   l mary looking over the catalogue see woodley what an unconscionable creature bromley is she has marked a whole side of the catalogue  a luster that holds a hundred lights i think i should like that now for our grand saloon in the country i own i should delight vastly to astonish our neighbors in dorsetshire  if ever we go there have you any objection my dear   woodley but one my dear  i am to settle with my banker to day   l mary no matter  mrs bromley shall be my banker her purse is always at the service of her friends  o here is the sweetest set of fillagree dressingplate  i must have that woodley instead of the one i have had these two years  it is absolutely gothic   woodley aside i cannot wound her by restraint   l mary dont you think mrs bromley a delightful creature colonel  two of the largest seve vases that have ever been imported i positively must have them how good it was in the dear bromley to note these articles  why dont you tell me how you like my friend  to the colonel col i have not the honor madam of knowing her sufficiently to judge of her character and therefore can only speak of it as doubtful   l mary doubtful colonel   louisa in some cases lady mary to doubt is rather to compliment than to censure   col and in other cases to doubt is to be certain   l mary you dont affect to be doubtful i hope miss woodley   louisa by no means i assure you mrs bromleys character is quite clear to me   l mary if you talk in this style louisa i shall certainly conclude that you are jealous of the dear bromley   louisa i know not on what account i should be so except in your good graces for i hope you dont think me vain enough to attempt rivalling her with her present cecisbeo sir harry granger   col that ridiculous compound of affectation and epicurism who ruminates upon every meal and tries to preserve the relish of his sauces by a repetition of their ingredients in every new company that admits him   l mary you are monstrously censorious colonel but i will allow that he is a little out of fashion at present and for that reason i have forbidden his ever coming into this house the bromleys dine here today my dear to mr woodley  but we lose time the auction may begin and some of the dear things i have set my heart upon be gone before we get there  i shall never forget that old frightful mandarin lord gobble for whipping up the seve china dejeuner from me at the last sale   col will your ladyship permit me to have the honor of attending you   l mary there is a vacant seat in the coach and you shall be welcome if you will not be spiteful good morrow woodley come louisa  exeunt ladies and the colonel woodley so  i am once more left at leisure for my own reflection solitude is said to be a relief to the unhappy but thought only serves to double my distress surely my poverty begins to be apparent or knightly would not write so pressingly  his note surprises me reads dear woodley i desire you will on receipt of this let me have the three hundred pieces you lost to me at our last meeting as i am just setting off for newmarket and must have some weight of metal to balance the scales on the turf i shall wait at home for you exactly one hour by the best going watch in europe and must have the cash by that time pos  yours ever t knightly     the peremptory style of this billet alarms me knightly used to be a careless liberal fellow but mountfort told me just now that he is on the verge of ruin his state however is to be envied in comparison of mine he falls alone no wife no family at once to share and aggravate his wretchedness i will go this moment and acquit me of his demand by parting with these toys  takes up the earrings how much my marys beauty added to their luster let me fly from the thought  going enter mr bromley bromley just on the wing my dear friend how lucky thus to catch you flying as it were   woodley the good fortune is rather mine mr bromley   bromley no no you compliment  but where are the dear the divine ladies  may not i hope to be cheared with one glance from their bright eyes  what a beautiful creature is lady mary  do you know she wants but little very little my dear friend to be the top of the tree the very paragon of fine taste and bon ton and i think she will very soon acquire that little my dame has an excellent hand at touching up the last polish   woodley i allow mrs bromley to be perfectly elegant   bromley no no there you are wrong  she is pretty lively and so forth but somewhat subsy you know  but lady mary lady mary is the thing  but what is here taking up the earrings  a new purchase i presume they are fine very fine indeed what now may the value be  some thousands i suppose   woodley they did cost a pretty large sum when they were bought   bromley not new then i perceive  but fine very fine indeed   woodley lady mary dont quite like the fashion  the setting i mean  and therefore i should not be sorry to part with them  and buy others   bromley aside o that alters the case considerably let us see  let us see why now upon examining them closely they appear but middling very middling indeed i dont wonder lady mary should not like them  no luster  very old fashioned  they will sell for little or nothing believe me   woodley they cost me fifteen hundred pounds about four years ago   bromley fifteen hundred pounds  you amaze me  you must have been sadly imposed upon very sadly indeed my dear friend what monstrous cheats these tradesfolks are  why these jewels now will not bring above three hundred   woodley that is more than the common disproportion between buying and selling i should think mr bromley   bromley i mean in the trade mr woodley among the trade diamonds are a drug a mere drug indeed and money is a rare jewel in all trades now i will assure you a gentleman or a friend perhaps might give more come for the frolics sake i will turn jeweller myself and offer you a cool five hundred for them what say you is it a bargain woodley   woodley aside i cannot bear the thought of carrying them abroad to sell  well if you really think they are worth no more    bromley nay i have overrated them but i never compute by pounds shillings and pence when dealing with a friend diamonds are as i told you before a mere drug and cash cash my dear boy your only valuable commodity here here it is looking in his pocketbook  i have not quite so much about me i find   woodley that is unlucky looking at his watch for i want three hundred of it this very instant   bromley aside does the wind sit in that point  i will see  i will see o here is just the three hundred cut and dry my boy you shall have the other two this evening at boodles well cut a card or throw a cast for it or how you will   woodley i shall not go to boodles tonight  nor do i think i shall ever play again   bromley aside the knowingones are taken in i would not have given so much for the jewels if i had thought so  what not play that is good very good indeed you have a sort of lovers quarrel to the dice i perceive but though they have i confess used you a little scurvily they will make you amends some other time one lucky hit you know may repay all your losses   woodley they have so often and so fatally deceived me    bromley that you will trust them again for all that   woodley i think not but we shall meet at dinner   bromley yes yes i obey the dear sweet lady marys invitation i shall bring the money with me besides i recollect that you and i have a little matter of business to settle but it shall not break in upon our pleasures though you shall have no trouble but just to set your name a memorandum is all i want my boy   woodley i have a particular reason for desiring that you will not mention the transaction of the jewels to my wife or even to yours   bromley secret  secret as the grave my dear friend  trusty as steel my boy you may always depend upon honest bob bromley we shall be with you at five though that is rather early going  nay no ceremony   woodley i am going out this moment  exeunt enter forward forward i have listened and pryed to good purpose i think and am thoroughly confirmed in my resolution of shifting my quarters tomorrow morning up tents and away then but i cannot help being a little concerned at leaving my master and lady because i am sure i shall never get so good a place again all masters  no servants  every one did as he liked it grieves me to think what a hand the rest of the servants have made of them there is the lazy housekeeper the drunken butler the cribbing coachman  but what signifies moralizing let me look about me a little and see if there be any small matters lying loose that are of no farther use to my master and may be of some to me  takes up a pair of lace ruffles these have been worn but never washed and he may miss them no that is not probable as he has at least twenty pair more than he knows any thing of  puts them in his pocket this snuff box too is but a bauble of more curiosity than value i shall accept of it as a keepsake  pockets it  enter sir william from the middle door sir will by the quietness in the nest the birds are flown and i am glad of it my apartment smokes a little today i will have the tables brought here and try if the game be recoverable though to be sure i have but little hopes for sure there never was any man so unlucky  waters   forward aside what is old squaretoes ruined too egad i should be glad of that   sir will seeing forward  why hey what are you doing here  waters i say    forward only removing a few useless things of my masters sir   sir will then you will certainly remove yourself for i know nothing half so useless as a pert coxcomical lazy valetdechambre   forward as your honor chooses to be alone i shall retire directly  exit sir will retire there is a phrase now for a footman but these puppies all mimic their masters even in their language and what is worse in their vices i will answer for it that fellow now is as idle as dissipated and extravagant as my nephew himself but why do i think of a man whose misconduct has so totally alienated my affections yet he was a sweet boy at eton and a fine youth at college his indiscreet marriage has ruined him  a fine lady  a lady of quality forsooth and without a fortune to support her vanity but no matter now  i renounce them both  waters  i wish louisa was removed from this scene of folly and extravagance and safely settled in the country there is no other place for a woman to be secure in  enter waters i wish you would advance mr slowboots i have called you at least a dozen times   waters i came the very moment    sir will well well well  apologies take up time  bring the backgammon tables here then go to counselor belford and desire him to come to me directly  waters going through the middle door  why dont you go the shortest way  pointing to the sidedoor waters your honor bid me bring the tables first   sir will of what use are they when belford is not here to play  waters going  no come back and fetch the tables and i will place the men just to show you how i was gammoned and i think you will allow there never was such luck   waters i am utterly ignorant of every point of the game sir   sir will stupidity in the abstract how often have you been in the room while belford and i have been playing had we been saying or doing any thing we ought not you would have picked it up fast enough i warrant you   waters indeed sir    sir will no words  i hate prate  fly to mr belfords  exit waters  i will go and show jones how it was for though she is my housekeeper now she is a parsons daughter and must understand backgammon i am sure she will be astonished at belfords move  exit end of the first act act ii scene continued enter at opposite doors mr woodley and mr belford woodley how truly do i rejoice to see my good friend mr belford but may i flatter myself that the honor of this visit was intended for me   belford i am sorry my dear sir that there should be a necessity for discriminating the person to whom my respects are paid in a family i so equally regard and which was once so happily united   woodley if indeed you regard this family or ever had any friendship for me  but i cannot speak   belford i am already apprized of your difficulties and would spare you the pain of even hinting at them were it in my power to redress them   woodley then be assured it is for amidst all my distresses nothing afflicts me half so much as sir williams implacable resentment against lady mary and me if he were but reconciled    belford that is in plain english my young friend if he could be reconciled to your expensive mode of living he ought in honor to assist in supporting it but that i doubt will never be brought to pass though sir william is both rich and generous    woodley to all the world but me   belford in this case then you should suspect your own conduct rather than his character  but remonstrances are useless now and i promise to use my utmost interest to bring about a reconciliation but i much fear that we shall not be able to get lady mary included in the familycompact for i know no man more resolute in what he conceives to be right than sir william   woodley my honor as well as my love obliges me to vindicate her and i here pledge them both that she is free from blame   belford i am glad to find you still a lover mr woodley but i who am but a friend in this question cannot help thinking that if lady mary had spent more of her time in dorsetshire and less at spa paris and other places of dissipation and extravagance she would have been more entitled to sir williams esteem and you would have had less need of his assistance   woodley the fault was mine alone  vain of possessing such a treasure    belford you childishly exposed it to the gaze of fops and foreigners  and let me tell you mr woodley you are a lucky man in these licentious times to have preserved such a gem pure and entire even at the expense of your other possessions but prithee why dont you now retreat into the country   woodley my wife is quite ignorant of my present circumstances  i have not resolution to acquaint her with them  and to propose quitting london in this gay season without assigning some cause    belford would in your situation be extremely prudent   woodley i cannot bear the thought of giving her uneasiness    belford and so cruelly prefer the evil to the cure  enter waters waters i humbly beg your honors pardon for my intrusion but i have been at your chambers and at the temple coffeehouse to look for you my master is quite impatient to see you sir and one of mr woodleys servants told me you were here   woodley this seems to fall out luckily i will not detain you a moment dear belford remember what a cause you have in hand   belford do not distrust my attention to my client though i cannot warrant success to the suit  exit woodley waters i cannot tell your honor how proud i am to meet you my good dear master has been as angry with me for not finding you at home as if i had committed the greatest of faults and i would die rather than vex him   belford i know my friends hasty temper perfectly well but i also know that his goodnature is an overmatch for it   waters o sir you dont know how good and generous he is   belford you are mistaken waters i am no stranger to sir williams benevolence   waters indeed sir with submission you are  for he takes as much pains to conceal his goodness as others do to reveal theirs he would never forgive me if he knew i mentioned it but my heart is so glad i cannot help telling your honor that he apprenticed my eldest boy last week and pays for the schooling of the two youngest   belford these are noble bounties i confess waters but i think your feelings on the occasion do as much honor to human nature as the knights generosity  for a liberal hand is more frequently to be met with than a grateful heart  but where is sir william   waters i left him going to take a turn in the garden and i dont in the least doubt but he will come in as cool as a cucumber though when he went down stairs he was as angry with me as if he had never done me any good   belford show me the way and i will go to him directly  exeunt through the middle door scene changes to a dressing room an elegant toilet lady mary and mrs bromley l mary taking up the dressing plate they are pretty i confess but even i think them rather dear   mrs bromley what an idea for my dear lady mary do you know now that the equipage of mrs stockwells toilet the brokers wife cost thirteen hundred pounds   l mary i remember her at paris  an overdressed thing  i thought she had been a jewellers wife and looked upon her as a stalking shewglass to expose her husbands goods for sale but the poor man i suppose was ruined by her extravagance   mrs bromley yes yes he was doneup very soon after but the woman had wit in her madness however for she secreted her paraphernalia and her chariot has rolled on her personal fortune ever since women are much wiser nowadays than they used to be  enter mrs williams mrs williams your ladyships masquerade dress is just come home maam   l mary let me see let me see   mrs bromley how beautiful my dear creature you will look a goddess and you will move a queen   l mary ah bromley i have just recollected that i cannot go as a sultana i have sent my earrings to be altered and the rest of my jewels will make no figure without them   mrs bromley hire hire my dear   l mary i dont understand you   mrs bromley what a baby mrs williams but it is a sweet baby we must allow why for fifty or a hundred guineas at most you may hire as many diamonds as would outblaze the throne of dehli   l mary a hundred guineas what a sum for one nights vanity no  i will go as a shepherdess   mrs bromley that would be a disguise indeed in these days of martial ardour when our whole sex have exchanged their old fashioned simplicity of dress and manners for the military air the smart cockade and lively regimental   l mary but one may be allowed to look innocent in masquerade i hope   mrs bromley ha my little fly one have i found you out  nothing but a corydon could have inspired such an idea   l mary all dresses i fancy are alike to mr woodley   mrs bromley mr woodley ridiculous why surely my dear you dont think of exposing yourself to be the jest of the whole town by going en groupe with your husband to a masquerade  would not the dear good natured sir harry granger or even the wise colonel mountfort make a better corydon for our sweet shepherdess think you   l mary how idly you talk  mountfort is louisas cecisbeo and sir harry i fancy would be proud to enlist under your banner in the same capacity   mrs bromley this is wilful blindness lady mary for you cannot avoid seeing that sir harry is your slave i pity him with all my heart and wsh you would do so too poor soul how he doats upon you   l mary you will make me angry mrs bromley  but prithee why must i be treated like a picture for a drawing room not to be hung up without its companion i want no corydon i assure you   mrs bromley no to be sure  quite lonely and discreet come come my dear lady mary you were not designed for a simple shepherdess  the sultana is your natural character  born to command and be adored but you must and shall be fine for let the men say what they will of native charms our diamonds add considerably to the luster of our eyes what say you mrs williams   mrs williams there never was a truer word spoken maam for though my lady wants no offsettings and looks like an angel in any dress    l mary a truce with your flattery williams  take away the dress  i shall consider of it   mrs williams aside nobodys flattery will go down now but mrs bromleys it seems  exit l mary i should like the sultana i confess but    mrs bromley but what   l mary cannot you guess you know i have been stripped at play and have squandered a great deal of money this morning i am sorry i bought these toys

century  here is a fuss indeed about a poor hundred guineas do you know now that i would not have this story told of you in any polite circle for treble the sum  if it should take wind you would be

money from sir harry granger  you cannot mean it   mrs bromley ha ha ha sure never mortal was so easily takenin as my dear lady mary you could not think me serious i hope  not but i know many wives

the finest woman in all that dear gay motley assembly tonight   l mary i thank you my dear bromley  i think the dress will become me  but i owe you a monstrous deal of money i am afraid already  how much is it   mrs bromley a trifle a very trifle indeed between such friends and i shall be apt to quarrel with you if ever you mention it again  let the men settle it  i shall bring the jewels with me at five till then adio mia cara   l mary mr bromley comes i hope   mrs bromley lord who knows any thing of a husbands engagements my dear but there is no doubt of his attending your summons on any occasion for my poor bromley dies for you you are quite a monopolizer lady mary  exit l mary what a rattle you are  exit scene changes to sir william s apartment sir william and mr belford at backgammon sir will i tell you i will hear no more of him  if he has destroyed his fortune he shall not destroy my peace  throws the dice cinque ace  come come it is your throw   belford it is amazing sir william that you can be so anxious about this trifling game and at the same time so indifferent about your nephew   sir will i am in earnest about every thing mr belford consequently in my resentment against my silly nephew who is a slave to his wife and a victim to his vanity will you take the box i say  hastily belford gently gently my good sir william  you have put yourself in a passion already  rises sir will no sir it is you that have put me in a passion  i hate gently and all the phlegmatic people in the world   belford and yet you and i have been friends these twenty years   sir will true true my dear belford  and perhaps i am indebted to your gently for our continuing so  but dont put my patience to any further trial at present  sit down i entreat you   belford but one word more and i have done   sir will well i am patient but dont harp again on the same string  no more of mr woodley   belford you have a noble fortune sir william   sir will yes thanks to providence more than i have occasion for myself and therefore i consider the overplus but as a bank for my friends  do you want money belford name the sum and take it   belford thank you sir william but it is not my wants i wish you to supply but those of your nephew   sir will what at it again i will not give him a doit  not a doit sir my fortune shall not be lavished to indulge his vanity or supply his prodigality   belford i am persuaded he has so thoroughly reflected upon his past folly that he would make a proper use of your future kindness   sir will let him alter his conduct first if he expects i should alter mine his repentance may merit my bounty but my liberality shall not prevent his reformation   belford but if mr woodley should be undone what will become of your niece   sir will let her share his fate as she has done his folly  she has earned it  an extravagant woman that could not be content to live at one of the finest seats in england but must frisk it to spa and paris forsooth like the rest of the silly english to squander their money and be laughed at by foreigners   belford i understood miss woodley had remained in england   sir will what louisa i did not speak of her  she is the best girl on earth  no no  she shall not suffer for other peoples faults if he has involved her fortune too i shall take care of her   belford do you intend she shall live with you   sir will no sir no  i will have no mistress in my house but old jones i would not displace her for a duchess  it would break the poor womans heart  but i shall take proper care of louisa  aside i wish she was well married out of the way   belford but now give me leave sir william    sir will neither now nor then mr belford the matter is all settled in my mind and the game gone quite out of my head i will send for louisa directly and talk this matter over with her  waters enter waters step in to mr woodleys and desire my niece to come to me immediately  exit waters belford i am sorry i have been so unsuccessful in my suit sir william and wish you a goodday   sir will you are not angry with me i hope belford  i am as sorry for my nephews indiscretion as you or any one can be   belford if you are you will certainly assist him aside but i know it must be all done in your own way   sir will dine with me and well play out our party after dinner   belford with all my heart but i shall be too many for you as usual  exit sir will if i had not the greatest regard imaginable for my old friend i should hate him abominably for always beating me at backgammon but let me consider now  she has ten thousand pounds of her own i will give her as much more at present and my whole estate after my death  no no  that will not be acting justly  woodley may have children  they have not offended me though their father has  and if they should be half so pleasant as he was when he was a child i should love them dearly as i once did him but i must strive to forget all that business now  here comes louisa  enter lady mary who keeps at a distance without sir william s looking at her sir will well child you know i suppose that my hopeful nephew is totally ruined    l mary sir   sir will why dont you come nearer i wouldnt have all the house hear me  she advances my nephew i tell you is ruined   l mary i could not have imagined sir when you did me the honor of sending for me that you meant to alarm or insult me   sir will looking at her i send for you i insult you  that blundering waters  no madam you are the last person in the world except your husband that i should think of sending for   l mary the respect i have for you sir as mr woodleys relation must make it extremely painful to me to know that i am so disagreeable to you   sir will respect for me madam i dont desire your respect nor deserve your respect  aside if she talks in this way she will stagger my resolution  i wanted to speak with my niece madam and my blundering servant    l mary has brought you one that is proud of that title sir   sir will you have a title of your own madam  i hate titles  and one reason why i never married was because i would not have my wife called my lady   l mary i see sir william that you are not inclined    sir will to converse with ladies madam  i would speak with louisa upon business   l mary i shall no longer obtrude on you sir but before i go must request you will explain what you meant by saying that mr woodley was ruined   sir will aside she knows nothing of the matter i find and i cannot bear to shock her  i think madam you ought to understand that matter as well as i  ruined  why it is a common phrase at present madam  dukes lords and commons nay the whole nation are ruined madam  it is quite the ton and i suppose that neither mr woodley nor you would choose to be out of the fashion   l mary i hope sir you will allow that mr woodleys fortune and my rank entitles us    sir will to be ruined in good company madam  aside she has touched the right key now i am no more afraid of her had she fallen acrying i might have been ruined too   l mary i am sorry to find sir that your prejudices against mr woodley and me are so strong that it would be in vain for us to attempt a justification of our conduct   sir will quite so indeed madam   l mary i shall therefore take my leave sir  going sir will aside you have mine with all my heart   l mary shall i send miss woodley to you sir   sir will no madam no i will send for her when i am a little more composed your servant  your servant madam  exit lady mary  waters  what a martyrdom has this fellow exposed me to  waters  enter waters  thou eternal blockhead dolt dunderhead    waters does your honor speak to me   sir will no to the door to the window to this table  matter itself has more intelligence than thou  enter a servant serve would your honor please to have dinner served it is quite ready   sir will let it wait   serve mr belford is below sir   sir will well well i will go then what a provoking blunder  exeunt scene mr woodleys dressing room mr woodley alone if belford should succeed with my uncle all may yet be well something must be done and quickly too i can no longer endure the agony of endeavoring to impose upon the world and myself by personating a borrowed character but here she comes who innocently adds to all my sufferings and tips the darts of poverty with anguish  enter lady mary l mary o my dear woodley such a trial ordeal as i have undergone i declare i would rather be buried alive in dorsetshire than endure such another teteatete he has done every thing but beat me   woodley i dont comprehend you  whom do you mean   l mary nay that is downright perverseness for i am certain there is not such another creature upon earth as your precious uncle   woodley i hope you have not quarrelled with him lady mary   l mary no truly he has spared me that trouble by quarrelling with me most outrageously   woodley aside then all my hopes in belford are at an end i am very sorry you happened to come in his way   l mary i am sure so am i mr woodley the interview was not of my seeking and though i was as mild as a lamb he was as rude as a bear the deuce take his blundering servant for bringing me into such a scrape   woodley i should hope that your regard for me would have prevented    l mary and so it did i assure you for i did not laugh though he said something so ridiculous about your being ruined the nation being ruined and all the world being ruined that i had much ado to keep my countenance however i behaved very decently all the while and even condescended to entreat that he would give you leave to justify your conduct to him   woodley and did my dear mary obtain his permission  with eagerness l mary your earnestness startles me mr woodley of what consequence can the oldfashioned opinion of an obstinate don choleric who hates us both be of to us i wish he would endow an hospital with his fortune that our solicitude to please might end with our expectations   woodley mine should not i assure you   l mary that must be as you please mr woodley but i declare that from this hour    woodley make no rash vows madam you know not how much you have been or may be indebted to sir william   l mary i indebted to him no mr woodley that i positively deny  enter mr and mrs bromley mr bromley entering and so do i with both my hands and all my heart for be the question in law physic or divinity i will pawn my life on it that lady mary is right   l mary i am much obliged to you for your good opinion mr bromley   mrs bromley and i wager on mr woodleys side were it only to keep up the argument the question then   mr bromley ay ay the question   l mary to mrs bromley there are secrets in all families you know my dear bromley   woodley and it is always prudent to keep them so lady mary   mr bromley very good very good indeed   mrs bromley curiosity thank heaven is not one of my failings it is ever a mark both of ignorance and illbreeding i am astonished how any one can be infected with such an impertinent weakness   mr bromley yes yes my dame is quite above all silly curiosity  aside the veriest eavesdropper that ever existed she will not rest till she has got the whole story and i shall have it the moment we get home  mrs bromley shows a box of jewels to lady mary l mary they are quite charming indeed i shall outblaze the queen of diamonds   woodley what jewels are these i hope you have not bought them lady mary   l mary you hope i have not bought them  what an odd speech mr woodley no i have only borrowed them and will lend you part if you will go en turc i can spare enough to ornament his turban cannot i bromley   mrs bromley surely you dont persist in making a family party lady mary   l mary to mr woodley you shall have these   woodley prithee dont teize me lady mary  i shall not go to the masquerade  exit l mary aside dont teize me something extraordinary must have disturbed him   mr bromley you will have a charming squeeze at your rout lady mary not a vacant chair to be found in the whole house i warrant you   l mary you flatter me no i believe there will hardly be any body do you know that i have had a hundred and ninetyone excuses within these two days   mrs bromley ay but you will have nine hundred and ninety people for all that i hope lady sitfast will not come that woman never orders her carriage till near one though she plagues the servant to call it up every five minutes after eleven   l mary then there is that poor drooping mrs henpeck who always loses and sits moaning over her losses and playing the aftergame till the servants are obliged to put her out along with the candles  enter forward l mary no more excuses i hope   forward dinner is served please your ladyship   mrs bromley is sir harry granger come   l mary o no he has no longer the entree here   mr bromley i am heartily sorry for it no man tempers a sallad like sir harry he is a perfect compendium of the whole art of cookery and has more good receipts in his pocketbook than ever were published by the celebrated hannah glass   l mary most excellent qualifications for a man of fashion   mr bromley true very true indeed eating is the rage the high ton at present and indeed is one of the most refined of our modern studies  will your ladyship permit me the transcendant honor of your fair hand   l mary i attend mrs bromley  exeunt end of the second act act iii scene a diningparlour sir william and mr belford at a table with a bottle and glasses sir will i am no drinking man myself belford but yet i do not approve of this water system of yours it keeps the spirits too low    belford to say or do any thing mad or foolish i grant it may but if water does not raise it never depresses the spirits can you say as much for your generous wine   sir will well well i will not dispute with you because i hate argument and as you are an honest fellow i can venture to take my glass cheerfully in your company though you dont partake of my liquor but i would give something ay more than i will mention that you would share only one pint of claret with me now   belford i have made no vows sir william and to humor a friend can easily dispense with rules of my own making so here is your fair niece louisa woodley in a bumper   sir will thank you thank you my good friend she is a most excellent girl and i like to have her toasted by such a man as you i wish she was well settled with all my heart   belford there can be no doubt of her marrying to advantage she is a fine young woman with a fine fortune   sir will and so may be sacrificed to some fine young man that may spend her fortune in finery as her hopeful brother has done and leave her a beggar no no  i will prevent that  i have thought of a match for her  fill your glass belford  a prudent sober sensible man  aside i wish he would take the hint   belford rare qualities indeed for a young man of fashion to possess in these days sir william   sir will who told you that he was a young man of fashion why sir there have been no men born at least for these last thirty years  all monkies and macaronies no hearts of oak now belford  all dwindled dwindled into aspens   belford your sarcasm is rather too general my good friend courage is the birthright of an englishman and while one acre of our soil remains both the oak and the laurel will thrive on it  we must not prejudge the rising generation and i have not the least doubt but your niece will make a very proper choice   sir will a choice i hope she has been better educated than to have a choice sir i was not consulted in her brothers match and you see the consequence  i shall dispose of louisa in my own way  i have a husband now in my eye for her belford   belford whoever obtains miss woodley will i dare say be a very happy man   sir will stick to that my dear belford  yes yes whoever marries louisa will be a very happy man and i am extremely glad you think so  aside i wish he would come to the point   belford you know sir william that i have long been acquainted with miss woodleys merit   sir will you charm me my dear belford i am glad you know her worth and you will therefore cherish it  she is mild and timid  but you will be kind and gentle to her even for my sake my good old friend   belford kind and gentle to her and your good old friend   sir will why are not you my friend   belford most certainly   sir will then why all this reiteration if you marry louisa    belford i marry her sir william   sir will yes sir  did you not this moment allow that who ever married her would be a very happy man and i suppose you can have no possible objection to being a very happy man mr belford   belford yes sir the strongest in the world if my happiness is to be purchased at the expense of anothers misery  but i am wrong for being serious when i am certain you do but jest   sir will in the first place sir i never said any thing in jest since i was born  and secondly sir i never was more in earnest in the whole course of my life i therefore request from you a serious answer  jest indeed no truly counselor i am no joker   belford why then sir i should think myself highly honored    sir will psha psha psha    belford patience my good friend    sir will no sir  i will have no patience with your nonsensical compliments  none of your honors i say   belford in a word then sir william the disparity of years between fortyeight and eighteen    sir will is just nothing at all  what need you tell her you are fortyeight   belford there will be no occasion i grant you  selfevident propositions need no proof   sir will harkye belford you fatigue me to death with your logic and sophistry  the point may be reduced to two words  will you marry my niece or no   belford it is a match so infinitely beyond my pretensions sir william    sir will i hope i may be allowed the best judge in that matter mr belford   belford by no means sir william your partial kindness toward me    sir will is almost worn out by your tiresome false modesty  and if i thought i should have as much plague with louisa as i have had with you i would renounce my project and leave her to die an old maid   belford the proposal is so highly favorable to me    sir will that you consent   belford were i certain that miss woodleys inclinations    sir will i told you before that i could dispose of them as i pleased so that if you have no other objection i shall carry my point and settle one of my family to my entire satisfaction at last   belford it is impossible that i can have any objection if she has none   sir will your hand then my dear belford  it is a match  order your clerks to set about the writings directly  your estate lies in staffordshire i think  you know i add ten thousand to her fortune   belford but surely my dear sir william miss woodley ought to be made acquainted    sir will why has she not been acquainted with you ever since she was born if i mistake not you were present at her christening  the wedding shall be next week  the sooner my dear girl is happily settled the better   belford your kindness overwhelms me  but still miss woodley    sir will shall be made acquainted with her happiness this evening i leave all the articles of settlement to your own honor  i know you will make a proper provision for my niece because it is possible you may die before her  but no pinmoney i charge you  it is but a prelude to alimony believe me   belford i shall endeavor to acquit myself as such a generous confidence deserves   sir will hurry hurry your clerks and bring this happy event to a speedy conclusion my dear nephew   belford i have the strongest motives to enforce their diligence as well as the highest sense of my obligations to your friendship   sir will no speeches  hasten the business and adieu  exit belford  i will speak to jones directly to prepare for the weddingdinner she cannot bear to be hurried and i would have every thing magnificent on that day which i shall deem the happiest of my whole life because it will be the first time i could ever get any of my family to know their own interest and act as i would have them  going off enter louisa sir will i am very glad to see you my dear child  and now what have you to say to me   louisa i was informed sir by my sister that you desired to speak with me and i am therefore come to receive your commands   sir will why my dear it will neither be questions nor commands but crosspurposes if you keep at such a distance as will make it impossible we should hear one another come nearer i say  what are you afraid of   louisa advancing sir    sir will so so  that will do  and now my dear child you cannot imagine what a heavenly temper i am in and what favorable dispositions i have toward you   louisa i am very happy sir    sir will so you will say my dear when you know all but you must deserve my kindness by your frankness  therefore first tell me whether you have any particular objection to matrimony   louisa it is a subject sir that i have never much thought upon   sir will that is singular now for i am told that the girls of these days think of nothing else but luckily there is no occasion for your considering about the matter as you have such a friend as i am to consider for you child   louisa sir   sir will and so i shall make your mind easy at once by letting you know that i have provided a husband for you   louisa aside now heaven forbid   sir will and such a one as is not to be met with every day i assure you  a man after my own heart  has not a fault louisa but that he is a waterdrinker but i will not anticipate by telling you his name he shall surprise you with it himself  why hey  what is the matter now you dont seem at all overjoyed  you are not hankering after a title i hope for believe me niece if there be either happiness or virtue left in the present world they are only to be met with in the middle ranks of life what makes you tremble so   louisa you are not unacquainted with my timidity sir   sir will yes yes i understand the timidity of your whole sex  aside doves before marriage and kites after  you will soon get the better of your timidity i will answer for it   louisa as i am certain sir that it is your wish to make me happy    sir will you are right my dear but it must be my own way your brothers want of respect to my opinion you see has been his ruin child dont attempt to copy him louisa   louisa if you would but condescend to hear me sir    sir will why child i know every thing already that you would wish to say your obligations to me and your modesty and your timidity and your settlement and all that    louisa dear sir i have not a thought about a settlement    sir will well well every thing shall be taken care of except a provision for a separate maintenance i bar that for if you cannot live happily with such a husband as i have chosen for you i should think you deserved to starve though you were my niece a thousand times   louisa but my dear uncle    sir will but my dear niece dont insist upon it for a woman who thinks of separation at the moment of her union does not intend to abide by her husband as she ought to do till death do them part   louisa i neither think of union nor separation sir    sir will modest and virtuous that    louisa hear me but one word sir    sir will enoughs said enoughs said my dear here take this bill to provide for your dress i would have every thing handsome the ladies are great belles in staffordshire and i would have my niece make as good an appearnace as any private gentlewoman among them why dont you take the bill it is for five hundred pounds and i hope you think that sufficient   louisa i have no sort of occasion for it sir and if you would but indulge me with a moments conversation    sir will psha psha psha  i hate all this affected delicacy take money from the old man whenever you can get it hasten your milliners and mantuamakers and get all your matters ready by this day sennight for i will not have the wedding deferred an hour longer delays are ever dangerous  exit throwing the bill on the table louisa what in the name of wonder can this dear kind cruel uncle of mine intend for me i almost doubt whether i wake or not married in a week to a man perhaps i never saw no that is impossible  he is too good to think of such an union possibly mountfort may have applied for his consent before he asked mine  too fond a hope i fear  i wish i could see counselor belford my uncle keeps no secret from him and he is a friend to all our family i will write to him to come to me instantly  fits down to the table enter mr belford without seeing louisa belford i cannot proceed on this business in earnest till sir william has had some conference with his niece it is possible she may dislike the match or perhaps be otherwise engaged  and then i should become the standing jest of all my brother benchers i must speak to sir william again   louisa my good mr belford i never was so glad to see you in my whole life i have been this moment writing to you   belford you make me the happiest of mortals madam  aside this brief opens well i need not be much afraid of being laughed at now   louisa there is something so particular  aside i know not how to mention it  mr belford my good uncle has    belford i find completed his kindness and acquainted you madam    louisa no sir but as you share his confidence i must entreat that you will inform me  besitates   belford aside her modesty distresses me vastly but i like her the better for it i wish i had a speech ready  did not sir william madam say any thing of matrimony to you   louisa you cannot imagine sir how he has surprised and terrified me by talking of my being to be married in a week   belford you might be surprised to be sure madam but i dont see any occasion for your being terrified any more than for such a violent hurry the writings cannot be properly engrossed in that time the law seldom keeps pace with a lovers wishes  and however impatient i may be to expedite this business you shall not be hurried fair lady but be at liberty to name your own day   louisa it shall be doomsday then  however i thank you sir for allowing me even a reprieve   belford aside heydey where sits the wind now  you have no absolute aversion to marriage i hope miss woodley   louisa i despise affectation sir and am above disguise with an old friend like you  i have no aversion to marriage when i can bestow my hand with my heart  but i would rather die than be sacrificed to a frightful fordid wretch who has trepanned my uncle out of his consent because he despaired of mine and takes me merely as an appendage to my fortune   belford aside how lucky was my coming back  but why should you suppose madam that your uncle would sacrifice you to a frightful sordid wretch your intended husband is a very different kind of man i will assure you madam   louisa let him be what he will sir i shall detest him   belford i never thought miss woodley that my conduct or character had in any instance merited your detestation madam   louisa detest you mr belford no that is impossible  but how are you concerned in the matter   belford not much at present madam  for i scorn to take advantage of your uncles engagements unless ratified by your consent   louisa oh mr belford   belford nay never whimper about it i own i suspected from the first that it was rather too good news to be true  but dont make yourself unhappy miss woodley for i would rather live and die a bachelor than marry the finest woman in england as is now the case bowing who was not equally ready to have and to hold   louisa generous worthy man   belford not more generous than prudent madam on this occasion but as i hope i have now deserved your confidence miss woodley tell me then if you have any particular attachment and i shall endeavor to serve you with sir william  though i know i shall for a time stand in the light of a culprit before him by declining the honor he intended me   louisa you overpower me with obligations mr belford   belford no speeches my dear madam if i was not sufficiently gratified by the honor of the act no acknowledgements could make me amends for the disappointment so frankly name the happy man who is to raise my envy and complete your happiness   louisa though i think that a wellplaced and mutual affection need not raise a blush upon the chastest cheek yet mine will glow when i name colonel mountfort   belford colonel mountfort i am sorry for it   louisa why so sir   belford because he is a very pretty fellow madam and for that reason may fall within your uncles chapter of coxcombs and prevent his consent   louisa then i shall never give mine to marry any man else   belford that is somewhat in the knights own style miss woodley but i heartily wish you success and shall show myself a warmer friend than a lover by using my best pleadings in my rivals suit   louisa accept my warmest thanks my good old friend  exit belford ay ay  i knew she would always think of me as her old friend  exit scene changes to mr woodleys a dining room mr woodley and mr bromley at a table with a dicebox woodley i will play no more   mr bromley why to be sure my dear friend luck has run confoundedly against you but i never saw you give out for such a trifling loss before   woodley seven hundred pounds is no trifle mr bromley   mr bromley a trifle indeed to a person of your immense fortune   woodley you have made a false estimate of my circumstances i am rather a distressed man at present mr bromley   mr bromley aside are you so then it is time for me to take care of myself  you surprise me vastly distressed did you say   woodley i hate to repeat it but it is so true that i had some thoughts of applying to your friendship to extricate me out of my present difficulties mr bromley   mr bromley command me command me my dear woodley every thing that poor bob bromley has in the world  aside except his money  is at your service  but let us clear as we go  settle our little matters first  just set your name to this paper  or will you take another throw my friend and let it be double or quit  enter colonel mountfort col for shame woodley  at hazard in your own house i thought you had enough of that at clubs   mr bromley play among friends is wrong very wrong i confess colonel but one cannot be always grave and wise  come my dear woodley let us make an end of our business  the pen or the box my dear boy   woodley aside desperate situations require desperate remedies  give me the box  they throw damn the dice   mr bromley it is double now you know my unlucky friend which makes upon the whole exactly the sum of seven thousand three hundred and fiftyfour pounds including the dear lady marys trifling debt to mrs bromley   woodley true sir   mr bromley well i have brought a bond with me and when i have filled up the blanks if you please well perfect it in the next room   woodley with all my heart  aside sure never man was so completely unfortunate never by heaven will i touch a die again   col then i give you joy of your losses for i know you are too much a man of honor to break your vow   mr bromley gamesters like lovers you know colonel  and after all now this is but matter of form between friends and men of honor like you and me  dont you think so colonel   col i consider all compulsive obligations between men as a disgrace to human nature but while there are such things as knaves in the world mr bromley we must submit to the mean securities of bars and bonds but between men of honor as you say    mr bromley certainly my dear sir men of honor are    col too often the dupes of knaves mr bromley   mr bromley aside i dont like him  well talk over the affair you hinted at in the next room command me on all occasions  ever  ever at your service but i must attend the ladies the ladies and the coffee are powerful attractions to me you will follow me i presume colonel  exit col yes with pleasure through my whole regiment with a drum at your heels i am persuaded woodley that fellow is a knave and i wish you would exclude both him and his flaunting wife from yours and lady marys society i cannot conceive why you are so partial to them   woodley the great civilities we received from them at spa first attached my wife to mrs bromley who was there in the first sets and even in london where people are more nice she keeps very good company i assure you colonel   col you will pardon me woodley  she is seldom seen in public but with some damaged dowager of quality who would be excluded from society if her title did not serve as a herald to make way for her ladyship  but enough of them i am come to speak to you on a much more interesting subject and to prove  what however i cannot doubt  your friendship for me   woodley be assured my dear mountfort    col i am so  you need not make professions  therefore with the frankness of a soldier i venture to ask the highest proof of your regard by consenting to make the fair louisa mine   woodley my sister   col you seem to hesitate mr woodley my fortune is    woodley as unexceptionable as your character colonel and as i truly love louisa and should rejoice in her happiness    col you consent to mine is it so my friend   woodley i know not how to answer you   col you alarm me extremely mr woodley for heavens sake speak out  what can be your objections   woodley none in the world to you but circumstanced as i am at present it would involve me in the greatest difficulties to be called upon so suddenly for ten thousand pounds   col that shall not be the case woodley i should think even louisa too dearly purchased at the expense of distressing you when i asked for your sisters hand i did not demand her purse nor shall i accept the one till i have signed a release for the other   woodley mountfort that must not shall not be i never will accept of such a sacrifice   col harkye woodley a soldiers character should be uniform and if there could be one who was not liberal i should suspect his courage to be of the mere animal kind my fortune is sufficiently ample and i would as soon mount my charger cry stand and deliver as take money i dont want from a friend who does   woodley your generosity colonel    col is of too selfish a nature to merit praise for i feel here laying his hand to his heart that the true luxury of fortune lies more in giving than in spending   woodley i will not lessen it by offering thanks but have you opened your trenches before the knight of the castle yet pointing to the middle door he used to speak well of you and his opinion is of some consequence in this business   col my sentiments are even with the good old knights i assure you i esteem his good qualities and do not dislike even his foibles as they are truly natural and unsophisticate but there perhaps you may see me play the usurer like any jew he may double or treble louisas fortune without the least impediment from any scruple or modesty of mine   woodley when do you purpose to make the essay   col as soon as possible for till i have paid the proper respect due to him i do not think myself entitled to throw myself at louisas feet   woodley may success attend

all   l mary every word i assure you but we shall soon make it up for ours are but lovers quarrels   mrs bromley lovers talk of love after four years marriage believe me lady mary it is all a farce   l mary no my dear mrs bromley i cannot give you credit against the feelings of my own heart i love mr woodley and i am firmly persuaded that he has a sincere affection for me notwithstanding the little peevishness of his behavior today which i own makes me apprehend that something must have ruffled him extremely   mrs bromley how did you like his peremptory resolve of passing the whole summer in dorsetshire   l mary not at all i confess it is frightful to think of it  though there is a tolerable neighborhood    mrs bromley of empty houses  no creature stays at their family seats nowadays unless it be some antiquated dowager who like an old gothic corner cupboard remains fixed to the freehold   l mary i vow i will not go into the country  it is quite mauvais ton  except you will come with us and then well fly about to all the bathingplaces and give a masquerade at one of them   mrs bromley i should like to pass a few weeks so well enough  and indeed my dear you will be quite forgotten if you dont do something in that way but are you sure that mr woodley would like it for i must say though i ask your pardon lady mary he is dull  absolutely dull indeed my dear   l mary why i own of late he has been rather gloomy  but he is vastly goodnatured and never before refused any request of mine   mrs bromley that may be  but had mr bromley talked to me in the same manner    l mary you would have loved him just as well as you do now   mrs bromley you are admirable at guessing my dear  for as that same romantic notion of love never was the band of our connection    l mary you startle me mrs bromley marriage without love must surely be a state of the greatest unhappiness   mrs bromley no i dont feel in the least unhappy  convenience is the best matrimonial cement and keeps many couples together for years whose love did not outlast the honeymoon  but these are mysteries into which you seem not yet initiated   l mary i hope i shall never know them by experience  enter louisa louisa my dear sister  sees mrs bromley i thought you were alone i had something in particular to tell you   l mary you alarm me vastly louisa  what is the matter my dear you know i keep no secrets from mrs bromley   louisa another time lady mary family affairs    mrs bromley pray my dear make no stranger of me  aside i hope mountfort has jilted he i die to know  has the gallant colonel deserted my dear   louisa colonel mountfort madam is no way concerned in the present question   mrs bromley aside then i would not give sixpence for the whole story   l mary you look distressed louisa  what can have happened i am all impatience   louisa though i had rather be excused lady mary yet as you press so earnestly to know my uncle    mrs bromley aside psha   louisa has insisted on my marrying    mrs bromley not himself hope   l mary giddy creature i whom my dear louisa   louisa counselor belford   mrs bromley and is that all i think it a monstrous good match   l mary monstrous indeed  why he is fifty at least   mrs bromley fifty fiddlestick what does that signify he is rich enough for threescore and money money my dear qualifies all disproportions   l mary this is by much too serious a subject for jesting mrs bromley  but sir william is not your sole guardian louisa and your brother i am certain will never consent to sacrifice you to his uncles caprice   louisa i would not on any account my dear sister have my brother oppose sir william in any thing as he is already but too much offended with him besides i am in hopes that there will not be any occasion for his interposing   mrs bromley aside she is coming round i find  enter a servant serve mr bromley madam has sent the carriage and desires to speak with you at home immediately  exit mrs bromley aside i am glad of the release  what now can he possibly want with me but i am all obedience though it breaks my heart to leave you but i shall return quickly before any one sits down to loo  and so my dear to louisa i leave you to settle your important matters which should be soon determined were you my sister  exit louisa thank heaven i am not  she is levity itself   l mary her lightness louisa extends no farther than her manners  her morals are irreproachable and when the mind is untainted its gaiety like a colored trimming to a grave suit serves only to enliven it   louisa you are too partial sister for i much fear that you will one day discover mrs bromleys manners and morals to be both of a piece   l mary no more upon the subject at present  and in truth i wonder how you can have spirits to talk of any thing else but your own melancholy situation  married to belford to your grandfather   louisa i should be sad indeed if such a marriage was to take place  but my intended has generously consented to break off the match at my request and to screen me from sir williams displeasure at the same time   l mary then the old barrister is charming and i think i could be a little in love with him myself but i cannot submit to this new insult from sir william what could he mean by disposing of you without deigning to consult mr woodley i shall insist upon an explanation of his conduct   louisa i again entreat you lady mary not to involve my brother farther with sir william  you do not know the consequences   l mary i am quite weary of all this temporizing louisa and as you are safe on shore you must allow me to guide the helm for myself at present  you will permit me at least to acquaint mr woodley with his uncles contemptuous neglect of him in this matter which i shall go and do directly  exeunt scene changes to sir william s apartments sir william and waters sir will well for once waters i will acknowledge myself the happiest man in england   waters i am proud to hear that your honor is so well pleased   sir will yes yes i am pleased and i will not be pleased alone  they shall be pleased too  they shall have a noble service of plate  louisa deserves

father was  enter colonel and waters i am very glad to see you my young friend set chairs waters  exit waters colonel i am much obliged to you sir william and happy to perceive by your looks that all inquiries after your health must be superfluous   sir will i thank you sir  i fancy indeed i do look tolerably well for serenity of mind goes a great way toward clearing up the countenance and i do not know when my spirits have ever been so harmonized as at this moment   col aside how fortunate  may i flatter myself sir william that the present happy temper of your mind will assist my suit and render you propitious   sir will propitious nonsense  you are an idle young rogue  with such a noble fortune as yours  but i will not scold now  you have been on the turf i suppose or fleeced at the gamingtable  but i hope the terra firma is safe i should be grieved to see my old friends estate in the hands of knaves or sharpers  what sum do you want i know you to be a man of honor   col you quite amaze me sir by suspicions which i will be bold to say are unworthy both of sir william woodley and me i am no gambler sir nor have i dissipated the noble inheritance derived from my ancestors   sir will i am heartily glad of it sir  i ask your pardon young man  aside what the deuce then can he want from me   col if i were so unfortunately weak as you for a moment seemed to imagine the respect i bear you would have prevented my applying to you upon such an occasion as your good opinion sir is of the greatest consequence to my happiness   sir will there you are wrong colonel  you had much better apply to me than to any one else  i am no cent per cent man  i never received a shilling interest from any friend in my life and i have my doubts whether i should even take it from the funds now that the nation is so poor  but come colonel if you dont want money in what other way can i possibly serve you i have no interest at court   col you have an interest sir in what is far dearer to me than either wealth or preferment  your lovely niece louisa sir    sir will aside thank heaven she is better disposed of   col you pause  do not keep me on the rack sir william   sir will i was only recollecting myself  am much obliged to you sir for the honor  i think that is the phrase  you intend my niece but she is married sir   col married sir william   sir will yes sir  married and settled in the country   col this raillery is rather cruel sir   sir will i never joke sir  i have passed my word that she shall be married this day sennight and if all the emperors kings princes and potentates in europe nay the great mogul himself were to demand her in marriage william woodley would not forfeit his promise so that married she is to all intents and purposes my gay colonel   col and has miss woodley consented sir   sir will ay to be sure i force nobody   col aside confusion  impossible sir   sir will why should you think so she is a modest dutiful girl it would be hard indeed if i was to have no comfort in my family but dont be disheartened colonel many a gallant soldier has met with a repulse before now   col if you could conceive the tenderness of my affection for miss woodley sir you would not treat my sufferings so slightly   sir will it may be a disappointment to be sure sir for she is a fine young woman i confess but my friend has her sir and you must think of her no more   col it is not in my power to obey your injunction  aside i wish it were false and ungrateful girl  but pray sir who is the envied man so doubly blessed in your friendship and miss woodleys love   sir will that is a secret colonel   col that i think i have a right to know sir   sir will what you want to exercise your valor a little  sa sa sa  by challenging your rival but keep your prowess for the common foe we cannot spare a soldier at present colonel   col this treatment is unlike yourself sir william but miss woodley i suppose will inform me  i presume she is not bound to keep the secret   sir will there you are wrong again my young hero for she really is bound by the strongest of all possible ties  the not knowing it   col you cannot now be serious sir and i will try if i have yet power enough over louisas heart to make her so  for i will know my rival adieu sir william  exit sir will your servant colonel huffcap what a hotbrained boy i am doubly glad louisa has escaped him  i would have no passionate man in the family but myself how lucky it is that louisa does not know her husbands name  women should ever be kept in ignorance to prevent mischief i have conducted this business most admirably  i have some doubts however whether my nephew should not be made acquainted with it but he does not deserve my confidence and he shall not vex me now  enter mr belford sir william runs and embraces him are all things going on briskly and cleverly as they should do my dear nephew   belford the swiftest bowl does not always hit the jack sir william and fair and softly is an established maxim in the law   sir will well well we must submit but i hope you will use as much dispatch as possible   belford dispatch is a term sir not to be found in any law dictionary that i know of and i fancy it will be a long time before the matters you talk of will be dispatched   sir will why surely you have a mind to try my temper with your fair and softly but if you knew as much as i do you would perhaps think it worth while to mend your pace a little for many things fall out between the cup and lip mr belford   belford aside so you will find presently  the most material point in this important affair does not appear to be yet adjusted   sir will now  what can he mean   belford there can be no marriage without the consent of parties and i dont find that miss woodley    sir will if i was not in the most heavenly temper you would put me in a rage have i not told you sir that she had no consent no choice but what i please to give and in twenty years acquaintance have you ever known me say an untruth sir my niece is all compliance and gentleness and you will be a very happy man my dear nephew   belford i should be unworthy of happiness if i could enjoy it on such terms sir william   sir will why what is the matter belford  your head seems to be turned with your good fortune and you want to turn mine no man that is unworthy can be happy    belford in short sir william    sir will ay ay that is the thing  now you talk sense i like in short  stick to that my friend if you want more clerks dont value expense i will clear all costs  you know i hate the laws delay   belford no law but that of honor has any thing to do in this case sir william and however irksome the task i must beg you will permit me to undeceive you   sir will then you acknowledge you have deceived me i am thunderstruck   belford no my good friend  it is you that have deceived yourself   sir will your proposition is false sir i never deceived myself nor any one else since i was born sir i scorn and abhor deceit mr belford but come sir let me know what all this roundabout tends to despise the chicanery of your profession and speak as if you was a witness on the table  not a lawyer at the bar sir   belford i fear i shall rather appear a criminal at the bar to you at present sir william   sir will what then you are married i suppose  have a wife already nay dont smile sir there is no joke in this matter and you ought to have been hanged if you had married my niece   belford i think so too though not upon the account you mention as i give you my honor i have no wife and if i continue in my present mood may venture to say that i never shall have one   sir will mighty well mighty ill mr belford you have rewarded my sincere friendly attachment    belford with true gratitude sir   sir will dont offer to say so what to spurn my niece with twenty thousand pounds let me tell you sir    belford that she is much too good for me   sir will why really i begin to think so   belford i rejoice therefore my dear friend    sir will no sir dont rejoice i am not your friend nor ever will be your friend you have broke my heart  frustrated all my schemes  disappointed my niece  poor girl i feel for her  young minds are easily broken by grief  you will have much to answer for on her account i assure you mr belford   belford i should have much more to answer for to miss woodley sir william if i did not decline the match   sir will decline zounds sir i will not bear so contemptuous an expression  aside i wish i had not been quite so peremptory with the colonel  if i could bring myself to unsay what i have once uttered i would give louisa to colonel mountsort to vex you   belford i agree with you sir william that it would be a more suitable match   sir will dont agree with me mr belford i will not suffer it   belford allow me at least to say    sir will no sir i will not allow you to say any thing but yes or no to this simple question do you accept or reject my niece   belford the phrase is rather too strong sir but i have already told you that upon mature consideration i decline the honor   sir will confound your honor and your consideration too  and now sir i decline any further conversation connection or correspondence with you and so sir i am  no  i am not your humble servant  exit belford his rage will soon subside and we shall be as good friends as ever i am glad his resentment is entirely pointed at me as it is probable that to make his niece amends for the loss of a husbnd she did not like he may give her one she does  and so ends exactly as it should the matrmonial schemes of an old bachelor  exit scene changes to mr bromleys a dining room enter mr and mrs bromley mrs bromley i wish you would defer it till

honest man and for a small token of friendship he has informed me that there will be six executions in the house to morrow   mrs bromley six executions nay then they are done up indeed and it does not signify much keeping any further terms with them yet i still wish you would postpone this ugly business till we are gone to the masquerade poor lady mary it will be a sad disappointment to her not to

that could render me unhappy   sir william aside so much the worse  the shock will be the greater i shall never have the courage to tell her  the suddenness of this event louisa    louisa do you know it sir   sir william ay but too well my dear   louisa you quite surprise me sir it is not above five minutes since it was determined   sir william yes yes it is more than that  above half an hour but though matters have taken an unexpected turn i would not have you fret or grieve child   louisa so far from it sir that i am quite rejoiced and flattered myself that you would be so too as i know it

before they go   sir william i hate all forms and ceremonies child  they have had my leave to go into the country these three years past and i am less displeased with your sister for her prudent resolution and so at your request my dear you may all breakfast with me before you set out tomorrow  aside i will defer acquainting her till then with belfords behavior   louisa i dont believe sir that they can set out so immediately but i am certain they will not defer a moment to accept your kind invitation on that account   sir william stop child stop i will not have them come to me till the very hour they are going if i were to see your brother often i might be weak enough to grow fond of him again so dont let him come i charge you till his boots are on i have trouble enough on my hands

make the good mans mind easy with regard to me  as i am perfectly resigned to your commands sir on every occasion i hope i shall never give you cause for any real trouble   sir william aside there now she will break my heart with her mildness  i hope for your own sake you will be resigned my dear but go child and tell your brother and lady mary that i shall be glad to see them on the morning they

will break my heart if you do  i was not my sault louisa   louisa dont talk or think of faults now sir  you know that before this disgraceful event happened in the family    sir william dont you talk of it in such a melancholy strain child  it is no disgrace i tell you   louisa it is too public to be concealed sir the bailiffs are but this moment gone out of the house   sir william what house this house your brothers house what have they carried him to prison i thought it would come to this   louisa no sir  colonel mountfort generously    sir william what had he to do with it why should olonel mountfort or any one else why didnt they send to me  but what have i to do wih your brother child he should have gone to prion   louisa he would not long have languished there sir believe me a broken heart would soon have rlased him   sir william psha psha  with your broken heart  you play the fool with me  my nephew perish in a ga but he has brought it all on himself you know child   louisa i grant that his imprudence sir has exceeded every thing but your goodnature   sir william confound my goodnature it is for ever bringing me into scrapes    louisa and bringing others out of them my dear uncle   sir william well well well  i want belford now extremely  every thing falls out unlucky  but what of colonel mountfort child   louisa i was going to tell you sir that he became security for my brother on the instant   sir william that is noble for he did not know that i would discharge the debt  nay for that matter i dont know that i shall  i promise nothing  but i like this action of the colonel   louisa i rejoice to hear it sir   sir william ay then perhaps you like the colonel be honest speak out  i should be glad to make you some amends for a loss you dont yet know of  but i can conceal it no longer  belsord has declared off  but he is unworthy your resentment the colonels father was my friend and a noble fellow he was   louisa and his son is every way worthy of such a father   sir william aside i rejoice to find her so easily reconciled  well that matter is settled for the present  but are you certain that your brother and lady mary will hold their resolution of retiring to dorsetshire   louisa you know sir it was their determined purpose before this misfortune happened   sir william that is something in their favor to be sure and i am glad you told me of it  one good act of choice is worth all the virtues of necessity in the world  i should be glad to make their minds easy tonight  but they would thank me and talk to me and discompose me and i should lose my nights rest  for i hate thanks  i should be glad to see colonel mountfort  his behavior has shown a respect to me and the family   louisa you will meet him now at my brothers sir where your presence will make them all happy   sir william well child i can deny you nothing  i like to make people happy when they will assist me in doing so themselves without which the best endeavors are but labor in vain  but the country is the place  you must settle in the country louisa  there is no safety for good folks in london believe me child   louisa i should hope sir that with prudence and virtue one might be safe any where   sir william a fig for your prudence  ay and for virtue too against example example child is the ruin of us all we naturally strive to ape those that are called our betters and so become worse than we otherwise should be  but this is no time for moralizing do you step in and tell your brother i am coming i will just wrap my cloak round me and follow you  exeunt severally scene changes to mr woodleys dressing room mr woodley mr belford and colonel mountfort belford fear not my gallant colonel mr woodley shall have ample vengeance upon that scoundrel bromley for as he has evidently altered the date of the bond we shall find a way to reward his ingenuity   woodley i know not whether i am most astonished at his villainy or at my own weakness in being duped by it   colonel the uprightness of your own heart my dear woodley is the best excuse for your credulity  enter lady mary and louisa louisa i come the happy messenger of joyful tidings my dear good uncle  but he is here  enter sir william sir william i am glad to meet you here all together for i have business with every one of you jointly and severally  and first for you colonel i am very much obliged to you sir and i scorn to be obliged to any man without making him some return for his kindness i therefore make you a present i refused you a few hours ago for the sake of old sir doubtful deliberation there  but do you take louisa and for aught i know you may make her as good a husband as he would have done   colonel i shall use my best endeavors sir to deserve    sir william that is right  stick to that  no thanks but deserve as much as ever you can  and as for you mr belford though i am confoundedly angry with you i must get you to settle this young mans affairs his debts of honor his post obits etc though perhaps it may be only affording him an opportunity for deranging them again  that is the modern phrase i think for being overheadandears in debt   woodley the sufferings my follies have brought upon me sir and the remembrance of your generosity will remain too strongly impressed on my mind to admit of my relapsing into my former errors as that would be adding ingratitude to extravagance and vice to folly   sir william well well i hope so  kindness should be the strongest tie to a generous mind and i suspect you not of any baseness in your nature  though to be sure you have shown a plentiful lack of wisdom in your conduct but misfortunes make solomons of us all  and now madam to lady mary to show you that the merit of your voluntary retirement into the country is not lost upon me i make you a present of this house for your winter residence   l mary your kindness sir    sir william stop there  i will not be thanked  i wish to do as i would be done by and as i should not like to be confined in the finest place in the world not even woodley park i would not impose such a restraint on one who i doubt not will hereafter merit my indulgence   l mary gratitude overwhelms me sir  i cannot speak my sense of your goodness as it deserves   sir william so much the better  there are nobler ways of showing ones sentiments   l mary they shall be demonstrated in my future conduct sir for the virtue that arises from the conviction of past errors must be at once sincere and permanent   finis
