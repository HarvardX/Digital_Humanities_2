of the use of riches  an epistle to the right honorable allen lord bathurst  by mr pope  london printed by j wright for lawton gilliver at homers head against st dunstans church in fleetstreet      price   s  an epistle to the right honorable allen lord bathurst who shall decide when doctors disagree and soundest casuists doubt like you and me you hold the word from jove to momus given that man was made the standing jest of heaven and gold but sent to keep the fools in play for half to heap and half to throw away but i who think more highly of our kind and surely heaven and i are of a mind opine that nature as in duty bound deep hid the shining mischief under ground but when by mans audacious labor won flamed forth this rival to its sire the sun then in plain prose were made two sorts of men to squander some and some to hide again like doctors thus when much dispute has past we find our tenets just the same at last both fairly owning riches in effect no grace of heaven or token of the elect given to the fool the mad the vain the evil to wrd to wtrs chrs and the devil what nature wants commodious gold bestows it is thus we eat the bread another sows but how unequal it bestows observe it is thus we riot while who sow it starve what nature wants a phrase i much distrust extends to luxury extends to lust and if we count among the needs of life anothers toil why not anothers wife useful we grant it serves what life requires but dreadful too the dark assassin hires trade it may help society extend but lures the pyrate and corrupts the friend it raises armies in a nations aid but bribes a senate and the lands betrayed oh that such bulky bribes as all might see still as of old encumbered villainy in vain may heroes fight and patriots rave if secret gold saps on from knave to knave could france or rome divert our brave designs with all their brandies or with all their wines what could they more than knights and squires confound or water all the quorum ten miles

perfumed and fine drive to st jamess a whole herd of swine oh filthy check on all industrious skill to spoil the nations last great trade quadrille once we confess beneath the patriots cloak beneath the patriots cloak this is a true story which happened in the reign of king william to an eminent unsuspected old patriot who coming out at the backdoor from having been closeted by the king where he had received a large bag or guineas the bursting of the bag discovered his business there  from the cracked bagg the dropping guinea spoke and gingling down the backstairs told the crew  old cato is as great a rogue as you blessed papercredit that advanced so high shall lend corruption lighter wings to fly gold impd with this may compass hardest things may pocket states or fetch or carry kings a single leaf may waft an army over or ship off senates to some distant shore a leaf like sybils scatter to and fro our fates and fortunes as the winds shall blow well then since with the world we stand or fall come take it as we find it gold and all what riches give us let us first enquire meat fire and clothes what more meat clothes and fire is this too little would you more than live alas it is more than tu   r finds they give alas it is more than all his visions past unhappy wh   n waking found at last what can they give to dying a citizen whose rapacity obtained him the name of vultur he died worth three hundred thousand pounds and left it to no person living but to the first son that should be born of the first daughter of his next relation being told by his lawyer that it would

skies in useless columns tossed or in proud falls magnificently lost but clear and artless pouring through the plain health to the sick and solace to the swain whose causeway parts the vale with shady rows whose seats the weary traveller repose who feeds yon almshouse neat but void of state where age and want sit smiling at the gate who taught that heavndirected spire to rise the man of ross each lisping babe replies behold the marketplace with poor overspread the man of ross divides the weekly bread him portiond maids apprenticd orphans blessed the young who labor and the old who rest is any sick the man of ross relieves prescribes attends the medicine makes and gives is there a variance enter but his door balkd are the courts and contest is no more despairing quacks with curses fled the place and vile attorneys now an useless race  thrice happy man enabled to pursue  what all so wish but want the power to do  oh say what sums that generous hand supply  what mines to swell that boundless charity of debts and taxes wife and children clear this man possessed  five hundred pounds a year this person who with no greater estate performed all these good works and whose true name was almost lost partly by having the title of the man of r given him by way of eminence and partly by being buried without any inscription was called mr john kyrle he died in the year      aged near

and die of rich and poor makes all the history enough that virtue filled the space between proved by the ends of being to have been when h  p  s dies a thousand lights attend the wretch who living saved a candles end shouldring gods altar a vile image stands belies his features nay extends his hands that livelong wig which gorgons self might own eternal buckle takes in parian stone behold what blessings wealth to life can lend and see what comfort it affords our end in the worst inns worst room with matt halfhung the floors of plaster and the walls of dung on once a flockbed but repaired with straw with tapetyd curtains never meant to draw the george and garter dangling from that bed where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red great villers lies  alas how changed from him that life of pleasure and that soul of whym gallant and gay in clivedens proud alcove the bower of wanton sh    y and love or just as gay at council in a ring of mimickd statesmen and the merry king no wit to flatter left of all his store no fool to laugh at which he valued more there victor of his health of fortune friends and fame this lord of useless thousands ends his graces fate sage cutler could foresee and well he thought advised him live like me as well his grace replied like you sir john  that i can do when all i have is gone resolve me reason which of these is worse want with a full or with an empty purse thy life more wretched cutler was confessed arise and tell me was thy death more blessed cutler saw tenants break and houses fall for very want he could not build a wall his only daughter in a strangers power for very want he could not pay a dower a few gray hairs his reverend temples crowned twas very want that sold them for two pound what even denied a cordial at his end banished the doctor and expelled the friend what but a want which you perhaps think mad yet numbers feel the want of what he had cutler and brutus dying both exclaim  virtue and wealth what are ye but a name say for such worth are other worlds prepared or are they both in this their own reward that knotty point my lord shall i discuss or tell a tale  a tale  it follows thus where the monument built in memory of the fire of london with an inscription importing that city to have been burned by the papists londons column pointing at the skies like a tall  bully lifts the head and lies there dwelt a citizen of sober fame a plain good man and balaam was his name religious punctual frugal and so forth  his word would pass for more than he was worth one solid dish his weekday meal affords an added pudding solemnized the lords constant at church and change his gains were sure his givings rare save farthings to the poor the devilish was piqud such saintship to behold and longed to tempt him like good job of old but satan now is wiser than of yore and tempts by making rich not making poor roused by the prince of air the whirlwinds sweep the surge and plunge his father in the deep then full

my ladys word and lo two puddings smokd upon the board asleep and naked as an indian lay an honest factor stole a gem away he pledged it to the knight the knight had wit so kept the diamond and the rogue was bit some scruple rose but thus he eased his thought  i will now give sixpence where i gave a groat  where once i went to church i will now go twice  and am so clear too of all other vice the tempter saw his time the work he plied stocks and subscriptions pour on every side and all the demon makes his full descent in one abundant shower of cent per cent sinks deep within him and possesses whole then dubs director and secures his soul behold sir balaam now a man of spirit ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit what late he called a blessing now was wit and gods good providence a
