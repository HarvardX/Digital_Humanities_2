with various weapons of defense or hate to serpents teeth to scorpions gave a tail to me my printer and my leaden flail hibernian dames are trained to cuff and kick and nature armed them  for their legs are thick the thirst of vengeance every breast inspires and bowls of whiskey feed their cruel fires lyaeus thus the theban dames possessed and goads and stings inflamed the madding breast revenge

train what terms of art the secret shall declare inform thy mind and yet thy blushes spare have thou not seen a vase of antique mold of parian marble or barbaric gold doomed to enshrine some lovers cold remains or pour libations at some mystic fanes such are those utensils ordained by fate the shameful engines of barbarian hate save that one handle more for use than pride shoots disproportioned from the vessels side l    from forging franks etc the third custom is that of forging franks which is pretty universal the ladies in particular use this privilege  t t i p       for offerings

frames and burnished gold on flowers of purple flames within the potter plants thy richards face and bids him stare in horrible grimace through lakes of amber as the face appears the face repentant seems bedewed with tears the listening figure by the painters skill attunes its fiddle to the purling rill sure had i trod the dire conatian wild the blood of twiss had savage hands defiled l    sure had i trod the dire conatian wild neither did i go into that quarter of ireland called connaught which comprehends the counties of mayo sligo leitrim roscommon and galway as i was assured that they were inhabited especially along the coast by a kind of savages and that there were neither roads for carriages nor inns undoubtedly the chief towns of those counties are more civilized  t t i p        but heaven in vision touched my trembling car some god inspired me with a prudent fear a form methought half beast half human stood and cried my son i warn thee for thy good a mighty stinkpot in his hand appeared and asss ears were on his temples reared once like thyself i traveled lied and wrote an author then though now a mountain goat but soon the victim of illmanners fell a youth of galway hurled me down to hell changed to a goat to travel mountains sent what was my pastime is my punishment if life is sweet the wilds of connaught spare beware of all of galway most beware yet thirst of railing greater than thy fear will speak though vengeance threats the votive ear untird intrepid as the taylors wife will deal invectives though they cost thy life the furious tailor plunged her in the tide her fingers railed when accents were denied in death unconquered showed the darling vice and seemed to crack imaginary lice not vainly was the warning fantom sent my backward course with timely fear i bent yet still in dreams the ideal terrors rise stain all my clothes and seal my blackened eyes and oaken cudgels whistle in the wind and sharptoed shoes assail me from behind now pinna seems to clasp me to her breast now pats my cheeks and whispers me to rest with sticking plaster heals her richards scars disgraceful tokens of unequal wars or seems the lenient flannel to prepare for love disdains not such a menial care foments my head still soft from weary blows and regions livid from eternal toes but say what springs this persecution move the hate of woman for neglected love here droning pipes the tortured organs wound and yells funereal through the vales resound no lemon groves with harp and viol ring no maids and striplings tonadillas sing their voice their touch disgrace the soft guitar my catches mangle my cantatas mar let not thy bosom harbor jealous flames my steady scorn repulsed the iernian dames my love of thee the love of music aids i spurn the addresses of untuneful maids a thousand sonnets spoke the tender fear but out of tune no sonnet reached my ear me more it charmed with beggarwench to stray in wanton dalliance all a summers day through darksome lanes that vie with tempes vales where frequent dramshop balmy cloud exhales and steaming whiskey trulls and butchers boys regales whiskey that mantles in the sparkling glass and blessed nepenthe chears the northern lass i tuned my fiddle with amphions arts to melt and harmonize barbarian hearts i would have taught the savage maids to move in graceful dance that paints the joys of love i would have taught them the guitar to string to troll the tonadil the catch to sing but screams of discord all my senses wound and rule disdaining sharps and flats confound this guilty cause inflamed the wives of thrace against thee musician of celestial race to teach them catches hapless orpheus strove they scorned his fiddle but they sought his love a song he gave them but a kiss denied so bard and fiddle down the hebrus glide each moment bade some indecorum rise some beastly custom shocked my tortured eyes heavens how i tremble chilled with panic fear when waterglasses at the board appear l     fandango which as mr twiss says est mel de certaines attitudes qui offrent un tableau continuel de jouissance  l     when waterglasses at the board appear the filthy custom of using waterglasses after meals is as common as in england it may possibly be endeavored to be excused by pleading the natural unsociableness of the british who if obliged to withdraw to wash would seldom rejoin their company but then it may be urged that no wellbred persons touch their victuals with their fingers and consequently such ablutions ought to be unnecessary  t t i p  0 and       how shall the hapless traveller escape undrownd when direful females spout the table round yes pinna yes conceive the soul disgrace a mouthful often was spurted in my face thus when a storm has ploughd the watery way and whales in fullness of their bellies play a thousand nostrils seem to threat the sky and laboring barks the spouting deluge fly too well my love thou know the guilty shore and  perils such as never errant bore and say what prize repaid the toil and pains what joy seduced me to the fatal plains no speaking picture crowns the lordly dome no breathing marble of old greece or rome no spreading towns the travellers eye delight no stately villas burst upon his sight along the road nor lord nor esquire waits to tempt the traveller to his open gates fled the last honor of the savage kind their only boast the hospitable mind some once invited never asked me more and some against me shut the niggard door some whispered while i played my favorite airs and some more civil showed me down their stairs but never will i mourn my toil and pains my weary wanderings on hibernian plains though dragged through lakes or into rivers hurled since there i saw the wonder of the world a wondrous trout exalts one favored lake and months and years i would journey for its sake l  0  a wondrous trout exalts one favored lake a species of trout called gilderoy are caught here and also in the neighboring lake with a gizzard resembling that of fowls i have nothing more to say about this river except that en passant i took a dip in it  t t i        of fish they talked with gizzard like a bird i went by doubtful faint emotions stirred heavens have i caught it rapture fires my mind gods gods the gizzard of the winged kind here smack your horsewhips let your cudgels fall hibernian squires for this i would scorn them all i gained the trout the precious trophy bore preserved in whiskey from the magic shore haste haste ye sages ye whom nature fires gaze on my fish and satiate your desires in vain his brethren seek a curious train the darling treasure from thy twiss to gain for when my pinna murcias bowers i see both trout and gizzard shall be fried for thee well might an artist

view the structure of a lowbackd car goods are conveyed about the city on small twowheeled cars drawn by a single horse the wheels are thin round blocks each about twenty inches in diameter the wheels of those cars which are used in the country are placed at a greater distance from each other than those of the city cars they are frequently used as vehicles for the common people on their parties of pleasure a bed or a mat is at such times placed on the car and half a dozen people sit on it with their legs hanging a few inches from the ground they are generally dragged a footpace  t t i p      l

have little besides their beauty and merit to recommend them for wives their fortune in general being inconsiderable men of affluent fortune who have consequently no need of being mercenary in their choice may find happiness in an union with these ladies provided they can convince themselves that they are disinterestedly accepted but on the other hand this polite education prevents many ladies from being suitably married for men of moderate fortunes cannot afford to maintain them in the style in which they were bred or reared often greatly superior to their station  t t i p    and       no
