shilling  advertisement the hint of the subsequent trifle is taken from the blaise le saveteir of sedan as is the hint of the clubscene from an essay of dr goldsmith and if the indulgent public find a few passable airs and allow the dialogue to be worthy of filling the intervals which are necessary in musical pieces to set off the songs i trust they will overlook the pictures of low life i have in a manner considered myself obliged to draw as the proper subjects for ballads which unless they are familiar and have something like character and contrast it is next to impossibility but they must be

housekeeper and every one of the other gentlefolks that i am acquainted with turn up their noses and dont they cry only think that such a comely young woman and one that has been so genteelly edicated should throw herself away upon such a fellow as snob the cobbler but it is always your way you dont know how soon mr nipikin our landlord    snob ha ha ha   alice what is the matter with you   snob ha ha ha i cannot help laughing if i was to die for it to think of the old fool going about talking of his consequence and smirking at every girl he sees   alice o as to that if report does not belie her old madam nipikin is as fond of smirking after the fellows as he is after the girls but as i was saying you dont know how soon he may take away the little we have   snob you are always dinning that in my ears as if it was through my misconduct that we are in such distress   alice why will you face me down that it is not through your misconduct are not all my misfortunes owing to you did not you come down into the country when i was in my first place and pretended that you were a young gentleman run away for killing your friend in a duel  and did not i because the butler was my sweetheart contrive to get you into the house  did not you persuade me to get a key to the pantry and was not i upon your account turned away  oh that i had never seen your bewitching face   snob well well but alice    alice and afterward when i lived at the squires at the same time you offered to take your oath that you loved nobody but me had not you a child by the blind fidlers daughter and was not i fool enough to give a years wages to make the matter up   snob alice i tell you    alice but henceforward sooner will i believe that a room can be clean without being swept that brasses will look bright without being scoured or that butter will come when the witch is in the churn than that truth or constancy can be found in man   air ah have you forgot then unkind as you are when housemaid i lived at the squires all the wine and good things that i cribbd with such care every morn when i lighted the fires and have you forgot how i leaned on my broom and in rapture heard all that you said till scolded i got for not sweeping the room and beat for not making the bed ii when you told me you would have me my brush and my mop kept time while with pleasure i would sing and soon twas the talk at the chandlers shop you had purchased the license and ring but when with such joy we returned from the church and with truth i could call you my own you swore that i never should be left in the lurch and i envied no queen on her throne scene ii snob the jade has suffered a devilish deal that is the truth on it and one way or other my circumstances are in a blessed way if my master nipikin should seize my goods as he swore last night he would it is all over with us  well it is to be hoped something else will turn up  this is now about my twelfth metamorphosis and faith i should be very sorry to throw it off for i have tasted more satisfaction under the habit of a cobbler than i ever did in any of my other characters though a soldier a mountebank an exciseman and an itinerant preacher were among the number   air like a tennis ball am i now sinking low now bounding high bandied here and bandied there to and fro and every where now on the topmost round of fortunes wheel i fly now am i grovelling found beneath her feet to lie still like a tennis ball i fare now on the ground now in the air bandied here and bandied there to and fro and every where contentment health and competence are rarely found in any lot and therefore will i learn from hence to keep and prize the one i have got scene iii alice afterward froth alice how i am used and after behaving to him as i do  he does not deserve such a true and faithful wife for i am sure though i have never mentioned a word of it that mr nipikin has been trying a whole twelvemonth to make me bad and i have always given him his own with a witness and as for dick froth the tapster if i would go off with him i am sure he would love me for ever and every body knows that dick on account of his townedication is the gayest young fellow in these parts i dont mind being poor a bit if i could but be used kind  i have it dicks mistress madam nipikin is as fond of him as the old fool his master is of me and so  but here he comes  your servant mr richard what have you done with my husband   froth why he is fairly set in with his guzzling companions and so i thought i could not take a more properer time than while you are left like a turkle here alone to show you the difference between him who deserts you and him who would wish to deserve you  was not that very prettily said of me   alice indeed mr richard i dont understand being affronted so i told you you know the last time you talked to me in this manner that i would tell my husband   froth oh my dear i have been too much among the bucks de sprits of the age to mind husbands besides my dear what you drink with your meals need not hinder you from having a cordial privately in your closet  prettily said again   alice i will be even with you for all this impudence  well mr richard you are so smart and so clever where the duce did you get all these winning ways   froth i dont know my dear they came naturally to me take pity on me for stamp my vitals as my lord huntingdon says in the play if i ent immensely in love with you   alice how can that be when your mistress    froth what you are jealous of her  dont name the old frightful jezebel  why i only say a few civil things to her now and then that i may be able to sport this appearance   alice and have you endured so much as you say upon my account   froth endured why my dear i have endured more than would kill ten horses what with your cruelty and the drudgery of making love to my mistress i have endured more than ever cannibal did when he passed over the whatyoucallems the frosty mountains

money and what i can wheedle from the old man will i settle snobs affairs and who knows when he finds i have done so kindly by him but he will repent of his follies and behave better to me for the future but suppose he does not  i must bear it as well as i can  for though i am not very wise i have sense enough to know that a woman who can consent to be wicked to revenge herself upon her husband only takes a thorn out of her finger to place it in her heart   air such usage as this is what wife but myself would put up with and not sigh and sob no cross in her pocket or food on her shelf or what husband would let her but snob and yet let me hope though for every crime he had more than there is days in a year that his heart is so good i should still see the time when a different man he would appear ii but if i am deceived while another guess wife so treated would scold and revile though poor though confined in a prison for life with him i would endeavor to smile i love him and every way i will pursue in my power his affections to keep and if then he should slight me i have nothing to do but to wish he was kinder  and weep scene v nipikin froth nip well now is every thing going as

froth oh they are as goodnatured as usual you have nothing to do but to set worcestershire perry before them and call it champaigne   nip i will not suffer you to say these things before me mr richard you dont consider that to the guests who frequent this house i owe all i have in the world and are under the same obligation to them all from the clubroom where they call for twelvepenny worth of punch to the best parlour where they give five shillings for a bottle of claret  but i must not stand idling here  see if your mistress has seen after the things  coming coming there   scene vi the

mrs nip why what did i do with it   alice you gave it to your lover mr richard froth who gave it to me   nip what do you mean   alice i will explain  air twas in a village near castlebury a cobbler and his wife did dwell and for a time no two so merry their happiness no tongue can tell but to this couple the neighbors tell us something did happen that caused much strife for going to a neighboring alehouse the man got druuk and beat his wife ii but though he treated her so vilely what did this wife good creature do slept snug and found a method slily to wring his heart quite through and through for dick the tapster and his master by the report that then was rife were both in hopes by this disaster to gain the coblers pretty wife iii while things went on to rack and ruin and all their furniture was sold she seemed tapprove what each was doing and got from each a purse of gold so when the coblers cares were over he swore to lead an altered life to mind his work never be a rover and love no other but his wife we have now nothing to do i think my dear but to thank you sir for releasing us out of all our troubles and you maam for giving us money to set up afresh   nip the whole of one accusation to my shame i confess   mrs nip and i own i cannot deny one particle of the other   snob i need not then advise you to be friends because one is as much to blame as the other as to the money take it alice do with it what you please henceforward i will be guided by you and if my neighbors ask me why i am so happy when they hear me sing as i work in my stall i will tell them it is because i have a wife of ten thousand   air snob joy shall henceforth spring around pleasure shall await our call and real happiness be found within a lowly coblers stall though sunk by fortune poor and low did great ones see our happy life they would wish their grandeur to forgo and imitate the coblers wife  mrs nip ii and what becomes of you and i our pride methinks is taken down we have held i fear our heads too high to be thus humbled by a clown if then what is past you will forget for youre not wronged upon my life i will mind the pattern she has set and imitate the coblers wife  alice iii it is well resolved and were the fair but one and all in the same mind twould save a world of grief and care wives would be blessed and husbands kind for to the cottage from the throne the same desires bring joy and strife one motive actuates alone his lordships and the coblers wife    nip iv now having caused this pretty rout with fear and trembling overcome i hardly know what i am about what shall i say when i get home i never felt the like before yet there is one thing would give me life nor would i fear disquiet more if you would applaud the coblers wife  finis
