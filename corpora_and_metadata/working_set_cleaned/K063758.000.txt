the history of the earl of warwick sirnamd the kingmaker containing his amors and other memorable transactions  by the author of the memoirs of the english court  to which is added the remaining part of the unknown ladys packet of letters taken from her by a french privateer in her passage to holland supposed to be written by several persons of quality brought over from st maloes by an english officer at the last exchange of prisoners  london printed and sold by j woodward in st christophers churchyard thredneedlestreet and j morphew near stationers hall   0   the preface the author of the following treatise having gained so universal an applause in her several pieces in most parts of europe that it would be judged superfluous to enlarge our selves in her praise i have only a few words to add concerning the history it self the reader will here meet with a most agreeable intermixture of passions which produced the most surprising events and revolutions in this island that can well be imagined so artificially and curiously interwoven within one another that the whole intertexture represents to you ambition courage love and constancy in their most exalted vigor and strength and that upon so exact a level that it is hard to judge for some time which is either the most predominant or the most likely to triumph over the rest at last love exerts her utmost charms and gives us undeniable proofs of the absolute sway she bares even in the most memorable actions of the greatest of men and the most stupendous events in the world you will here see king edward more than once venturing his crown for the love of madam gray and upon the point of losing it for ever you will see here i say the great earl of warwick who had the art of gaining of crowns forfeit them to his love as his fall is an undeniable instance that even in the transactions of the highest moment the passions of princes have often a greater share than the most profound reasons of state so it may serve as a warning to all favorites and make them reflect on the instability of their greatness which is built upon so slippery a foundation two great though unfortunate heroes are suing for your favor in hopes that since they have made so glorious a figure abroad we will not suffer to our confusion that their memory should be lessened among their own posterity i had almost forgot to add that since some of the ladys letters found in her cabinet could not be inserted in the memoirs of the english court least the book should have swelled to too great a bulk it was thought fit to annex them to this  memoirs of the earl of warwick part i henry of lancaster king of england had reigned peaceably near thirty years when richard duke of york whose ancestors were once in full possession of that crown resolved to lay hold of that favorable juncture which then offered it self to assert and maintain his right in conjunction with edward earl of march his son and richard neville earl of warwick his most intimate friend these having raised a good number of troops and backed by a strong party made war upon king henry it seemed as if fortune had pitched upon the kingdom of england to make it the theater of its capricious chance after several battles fought with different success the duke of york being upon the point of giving another to his rival andrew tralop an ancient brave officer in whom he much confided unexpectedly went over with all his forces to the king so that seeing himself thus weakened he had no other way left than to retire as fast as he could the earls of la march and warwick left him at that conjuncture the better to repair this sudden disappointment and having raised fresh troops marched toward london where having all this while maintained a secret correspondence they were admitted into that city and the king obliged to seek for shelter in the tower margarete of anjou his queen a lady of an undaunted courage having notwithstanding this found means to raise and put the king and her self at the head of a formidable army they sought for nothing more than to come to an engagement the two earls being no less eager for fighting they came to a battle near northampton fortune declared for the earls and the unfortunate king henry was taken prisoner  notwithstanding this good success the duke of york finding matters not altogether to answer his expectation was willing to come to an accommodation with the captive king but the queen more resolute and less tractable than the king her spouse and not able to brook a submission so little suitable to her courage and the high rank she bore in the world positively refused to come to london looking upon the orders sent by the king as forced from him by his enemies but instead thereof leaving no stone unturned to repair their disgrace at last saw her self once more in a condition to offer battle to the duke of york this prince despising to be challenged by a woman a bloody battle was fought wherein the queen proving victorious caused the heads of the duke and the earl of rutland his son slain in the engagement to be put over the gates of the city of york  from thence she hastened to london to see the king and deliver him of his imprisonment but receiving intelligence that the earls of la march and warwick had carried him along with them and were at the head of a good army she engaged them with the first opportunity obtained the victory but enjoyed not the fruits thereof for the earl of la march getting to london before her was there proclaimed king under the name of edward iv henry and margarete had no sooner notice of this unexpected news but they assembled all their troops and edward fully resolved not to suffer them to approach london marched with all possible expedition in conjunction with the earl of warwick toward tanton there he gave battle to henry which lasted two days and cost the lives of   000 men victory at last declared for edward who having now no more enemies to encounter in the field began to relish the sweets of an agreeable tranquillity and took effectual care to reward the fidelity of his friends  he was a prince endud with all the qualities requisite to make himself beloved his high birth and the crown he wore had a less share in the respect and love his subjects bore him than his goodly air and great qualifications he was very engaging sprightly of a sweet and tender disposition he was a little too much addicted to gallantry so that his various passions have sometimes been a reproach to him however his warlike inclinations always had the better over his love passion for he preferred martial exploits to all other considerations  it is easy to be guessed at with what demonstrations of joy this victorious prince was received at london among the rest of his faithful servants was general talbot earl of sop and this young monarch to reward his services and to show his acknowledgment to all the world bestowed not only vast riches upon him but also honored him with his confidence which made that general to be highly caressed at court  the earl of devonshire having at that time some business of great moment to transact at court sought all possible means of gaining general talbot to his interest which perhaps he would not have encompassed at a very easy rate he being a man of a blunt conversation who aimed at nothing more than to have the reputation of a faithful servant to his king and of a good soldier but happening one day to divert himself with walking in a garden near hampton court and meeting accidentally with the countess of devonshire he was surpised and quite dazzled with her beauty and charms as the earl of anglesey her father had kept her very retired at his own house ever since she had been married for fear this growing young beauty should produce some sinister effects at court so nothing but an accident could have given an opportunity to the general of seeing her  the generals mind equally divided betwixt love and respect would not permit him to accost her so he contented himself with walking up and down in a certain walk from whence he could see her thus quite possessed with the idea of this charming lady he returns to london and so to court the king was then playing at cards with several ladies attended by a great number of courtiers but the earl of warwick was got at some distance from the rest in order to enter a certain memorandum of consequence to himself in his table book i told you before that the earl of warwicks name was richard de neville but i did not tell you that being bred up along with the king this prince loved him beyond any of all his favorites and in effect he had greater obligations to him than to any other of all his friends he was the son of richard de neville earl of salisbury lord chancellor of england and alice the only daughter of thomas montague earl of salisbury though but young at that time he was already a widower his deceased lady being anne sister to the duke of warwick the earl whose history i am a going to give you was a person so far surpassing in his personal merits courage and generosity all others at court that he acquired the surname of the great never lived a man in greater affluence and splendour nor ever did any one things with a better grace than he he being so far from endeavoring to heap up riches or to husband his estate that he looked upon wealth as a thing not worth his care notwithstanding this indifferency he was the richest lord in the kingdom he had a genius so far predominant above the common rank of men that even those who had a prejudice against him and were ready at all turns either to contradict or at least not to credit him no sooner heard him speak but like enchanted men were compelled to agree to what he proposed he was both beautiful and finely shaped even to a miracle his magnificence and gallantry which was natural to him made him both lovely and dangerous the king loving him both by inclination and gratitude had made him not only his confident but also bestowed the greatest places in the kingdom upon him it may justly be said of him that nothing could have bin above him had he bin capable of applying his whole mind to business but his inclinations for love and a certain notion he had framed to himself that even the highest dignities are purchased at too dear a rate when upon that account we are forced to sacrifice the pleasures of our life made him sometimes stop in that carreer wherein otherwise he might have carried every thing before him at pleasure  this character upon which i have perhaps enlarged a little too much has insensibly drawn me away from general talbot he after having looked a little while upon the gamesters espying the earl drew nearer and told him you are too gallant a person for one to suppose you should write any thing else but some verses or other to your mistress and how happy are you my lord to be able to make them the earl looking upon him said smiling what is this general talbot has he got some relish in the tender effects produced by poetry he made no answer but lifting up his eyes toward heaven observed in the earls countenance all the marks of that ironical and malicious air which he was blamed for by some alas cried the general i intended to make you my confident but you are not indulgent enough the word confident raised in the earl an extreme desire of being admitted into the secret since by his sighs and other passionate motions he was sensible there was a love intreague in the case and he could not but be highly pleased to see such a savage creature to be taken in the snare of a young beauty dont be dismayed said he at my jocular way i can be serious upon occasion i guess in part at your thoughts you are in love and you may assure your self you shall find in me the only man in the world who is capable of giving you the best advice it is impossible replied the general i should be in love in so small a time it is not above three hours since i saw and that for the first time the person that makes me thus sigh but my lord continued he oh how beautiful is she she has a noble air without affectation there was never a better shape seen than hers her complexion the color of her hair her features to be short every thing is charming in her i went to hampton court to pay a visit to the duke of norfolk who has bin ill for some days as i was taking a walk in a garden i saw the earl of devonshire and his lady doing the same he having desired me to serve him in a business of his against one of my friends i did all i could to avoid meeting him as soon as i got sight of them and therefore turned off into a bywalk where i thought i was secure from being seen but alas within a few minutes i found him and the countess sitting upon a seat of green turfs for it being then very hot she was somewhat tired with walking the color of her cheeks resembled two white roses mixed with an incornation her eyes carried along with them so bright a luster that i never beheld any thing like it in all my life and to be short my lord must i tell you over and over again that she appeared to me a most ravishing beauty you shall tell it me replied the earl as often as you think fit for your own satisfaction i am extreemly pleased to see you so passionate for a handsome young lady and fancy i shall see you before long work at your needle as hercules did with omphalis alas said he i am at a great distance to see her as my omphalis you will see an unfortunate lover who is quite a novice in the very rudiments of that art wherein you excel dont talk of ignorance answered the earl it is enough for a man to love to render him quickly capable of attaining to every thing required in love and will you make me believe that you were never touched with any other beauty before no said he i knew not what love was i will declare it to you by all the most direful imprecations that can be he was actually a going to call heaven and earth to witness when the earl interrupting him said i believe you my lord i believe you i am convinced you never was in love before but pray let me know wherein i can serve you you can said he instruct me in what i must do to be beloved because you understand it better then any other man in the world to do this i should be acquainted with the countess of devonshire replied the earl i should converse with her and be admitted into her secret thoughts if i should serve you for a guide whereas now you put me into a foreign country where i am ignorant both of the language and manners of the people so that as the case stands i can scarce advise you to any thing but what must create new troubles to you  i had the satisfaction replied the general of meeting with a very favorable reception her husband as i told you standing in need of my assistance which i will give him to the utmost of my power but after all to please the husband is not always an infallible rule of pleasing his spouse after all said the earl it is a fair step in your way and it often happens that those who please the lady dont please the husband as on the other hand all that please the husband dont always please the wife he laughed very heartily at these expressions of the earl of warwick and said he since you give me such encouragement i am impatient to embark under the conduct of so great a master at the worst what hazard am i likely to run the loss of a liberty of what i ought to be weary long ago i know not said the earl whether you are weary but this i am assured of you ought to be ashamed of it  they were so intent upon the matter that they did not perceive the king had left off playing who approaching nearer and overhearing the last words asked them what it was the general ought to be ashamed of the earl was a going to divert the king with telling the whole story but that the general tipping the wink upon him to conceal it he told the king that he was blaming the general on account of his indifferency and that he had made him an offer to exchange with him some part of his sensibility for the generals insensibility the king replied with a smile he was obliged to the earl since he loved the general so well as to be glad to see him engaged in some love amusements  the description the general had given of the countess of devonshire raised in the earl of warwick an extreme desire of being acquainted with her he had indeed seen her before but she being very young seldom appearing at court and he at that time engaged with another person her charms had not made any impressions upon him it was no difficult matter for him to find out a plausible pretense to make her a visit he pitched upon a day when he knew the earl to be abroad a hunting he pretended some certain business and having contrived the matter accordingly he sent to know whether he might speak with the countess about some business that concerned her lord  she was then in a grotto at the further end of her garden and the season being very hot he found her resting upon a seat of green turfs in a silk night gown of rose color with silver flowers she appeared very negligent and pensive the countess of anglesey her mother sitting near her upon the same seat notwithstanding the earl was sufficiently prepared for such an interview by the praises and transports of general talbot this did not hinder him for relishing that excess of pleasure which is commonly occasioned by a surprise of this nature his eyes and heart both agreeing in this point that nothing in the world was comparable for beauty to madam devonshire and in spite of all his natural boldness for which the earl was reprehended by some and all his contrivance to give a specious pretense for this visit he stood so amazed that without being able to utter one word he did nothing but make his bows to the ladies considering all this while what to say without being able to find out where to begin  another thing that puzzled him was to find out a place were to seat himself the countess of anglesey would have engaged him to sit down next to her but judging he should not there have a full sight of her fair daughter he set himself down upon a large marble kind of basin which served for a receiver of water from another vessel placed above it here having taken his seat without reflecting upon what might happen he began to enter upon compliments or to speak truly upon such extravagant bombast stuff that the ladies did not know what to make of it however he went on in the same road till on a sudden finding himself cold and wet almost all over he stood altogether surpised at this new adventure you must know that the master of the waterworks seeing him under the grotto had made all the haste he could to make the waters play which falling from the uppermost vessel into that whereon he sat had wetted him to the very skin his surprise was such as to render him incapable of uttering one word more and the countess of devonshire who not only looked upon him but also hearkened to his discourse with a great deal of attention finding him speechless thought no otherwise than that he had bin very ill give me leave said she my lord to ask how you do he was a going to tell her he did very badly which in effect was no more than the real truth but was so much startled at the question that he knew not what answer to return doubtless said he to himself she is sensible of what has happened but if i tell her i am wet to the skin she will laugh at me and if i remain sitting in this cursed place i shall be worse ridiculed by and by whilst he was thus arguing with himself he spoke not one word so that the countess of anglesey imagining no otherwise than that he had actually lost the use of his tongue arose from her seat and threw some water in his face crying my lord do you hear me yes madam replied he bursting out a laughing at their fancy i both understand and see you very well and if i had bin ready to fall into a swoon your spring would have prevented it and so he arose all wet from head to foot backwards the young countess could not for bear bursting out into a loud laughter in spite of all the grave looks of her mother and this gayety of hers haing dispersed all the earls splenetick fancies and revived in him his natural vivacity he entertained them with that sprightliness of wit they never had met with before in any other in all their lives  the condition he saw himself in not permitting him to stay with them as long as he could have wished and remembering at the same time that the countesses husband was not to come home till after the next day he only told them part of his pretended errand desiring leave at the same time to refer the rest to another visit the countess was willing enough not to refuse so indifferent a favor to a person of his rank nevertheless she looked upon her mother before she would return an answer and the earl soon perceived that she staid for her permission the countess of anglesey told him they would look upon it as an honor and they were too much concerned at the accident that had beflan him not to be desirous to be forthwith informed of its consequences i am afraid my lord said the countess of devonshire you have taken cold your bath was not well managed he took leave of the ladies and returning to the place where he had left his chariot his people were surprised to see him so wet not being able to guess at the reason of it  he was no sooner come home but he threw himself upon the bed much less taken up with the thoughts of his health than of that lovely lady he had left behind whose idea had made so strong an impression on his mind that he fancied every moment to hear and see her he was turmoiling his spirits with a thousand confused thoughts which all tended rather to increase than to cure his evil but what most of all tormented him was that the countess of anglesey kept so watchful an eye over her daughter what must i do cried he with this argus twill be impossible for me to find out as much as one favorable moment to disclose my heart to her sometimes he would flatter himself that if the countess loved any thing at all it was not her husband and that according to that rule the husband was less to be dreaded than a rival lover but the more he thought of her the more his passion increased  his whole mind being insensibly taken up with these considerations word was brought him that the king was arising from supper so that without more ado he got up and went to wait on him he no sooner saw him but ordered him to follow him in his closet where he made him read aloud certain letters he had lately received from france whilst he was reading he asked because he seemed to be bloated and much out of order whether he had bin bathing himself the earl was not a little surpised at this question but not imagining the king could know any thing of what had happened in the grotto told him that it being a cold evening he had taken cold the king smiled with a malicious air and the earl being much discomposed blushed the king who observed it laughed outright and the earls color came more and more the king much pleased thereat do you know said he that the earl of devonshire has begged of me to forbid you to visit at his house he is not a little jealous since you have taken the liberty of bathing your self before his lady ah sir cried he if you are acquainted with my adventure they have given you information of a thing of very slender consequence how replied the king do you think i am not very well pleased to know which way you dispose of your self in good earnest my lord added he after a few minutes silence what is it you propose by visiting this fair lady have you any business with her lord yes sir replied the earl he was abroad a hunting and i had scarce one moments conversation with her you made your addresses in a very confused speech said the king you were not sensible of what you said the earl imagining that either the young countess or her mother had diverted themselves at his cost found himself so touched thereat that he replied these ladies were not surprising enough to put me out of order as your majesty imagines i find nothing uncommon in their persons i would not have you talk thus for your own reputations sake continued the king since it will be much better your disorderly addresses should be thought the effect of a surprise than of the confusion of your mind  being touched to the quick at these words he was meditating how to revenge himself upon the ladies when the king continued is it possible you should be in love with madam devonshire and take amiss her giving an account to her husband of what passed in his absence i dont part with my heart sir at so easy a rate replied the earl if the countess were much more lovely than she is i would first be very well acquainted with her before i entered into such an engagement the more you know her the more you will love her cried the king sighing nature never framed any thing more complete than her self she is one of her miracles these words were uttered by the king with such an air as surpised the earl to that degree that for want of strength to support himself he leaned against a cabinet unperceived by the king who being quite taken up with his own thoughts took no notice of the confusion the earl was in and he reading in the kings face every thing that then passed in his mind said to himself is it possible that my master should be my rival and that he has bin so dextrous in concealing his passion for the countess that i have discovered nothing of it hitherto whilst he was ruminating upon the odness of this miracle for it is no less than a miracle for a sovereign to love without noise the king cast his eyes upon him and with an air which would have appeared most charming and full of goodness in any one else but a rival told him my lord you are very dear to me i cannot agree to your destruction but look upon your self as lost if you fall in love with the countess i must withdraw my favors from you and you will never obtain any from her that haughty heart of hers disdains all slaves below the rank of kings and i believe she would look with scorn upon my own brothers sir replied he i am sensible as i ought to be of that charitable care your majesty is pleased to take to preserve me from suffering shipwreck but i sincerely declare to you that hitherto i have been in no danger it is possible that in time some fatal hour or other might have constrained me to surrender my heart to the countess in spite of all my reason against which what i have understood from your majestys own mouth will serve as a full counterpoise i would not have you imagine added the king that i disclose to you only half my heart i will give it you at full length and confess my frailties  i was abroad a hunting about windsor for the few days i staid there most of the gentlemen at court being busy in rehearsing a comedy with the ladies at court at my mothers the dutchesses lodgings and you laying ill of a fever i had no other attendance but those that were then in waiting these being but few in number i lost their company in the heat of the chase  the sun began already to deline the sky became cloudy the air pretty cool and it rained much i had rid very hard was quite out of sight of the hounds and heard the noise of the hunting horns at a considerable distance so that i thought it better to stay for their coming in a great road than go in search of them i soon espied some trees close and thick enough to keep the rain from me so i alighted and sought there for shelter but scarce was i got well underneath the trees when i heard a great outcry and saw a woman whose horse was running away with her and coming toward me i soon stopped the horse and casting my eyes upon the person i had saved out of danger i soon knew her to be the countess of devonshire trembling all over and looking so pale that believing she was very ill i lifted her in my arms from on horseback during the first emotions she did not know me talking of nothing but fear and danger cease madam to be afraid said i you are in a place of safety and i wish heaven would afford me the same security it has been pleased to bestow upon you but i am already too sensible how difficult it is to secure ones self against all these evils which are inseparable from the pleasure of seeing you whilst i was talking to her she had recovered her self sufficiently to take notice of the freedom of my conversation and casting her eyes upon and knowing me how is it to you sir cried she arising from the place where she was seated is it to you i stand indebted to for my life what words shall i make use of to show you my acknowledgment if you will give me leave said i to tell you what words i desire you would make use of you will find them free from all respect and submission my wishes are for something more uncommon and more tender she blushed desiring leave not to tarry any longer so near me what would the earl of devonshire think said she if he should find me with your majesty alone in so solitary a place he would think me more happy than really i am replied i but he would not think me more sensibly touched with your deserts and beauty  to speak the truth continued the king i never met with any thing more charming in all my life her hair tied up in buckles played over her shoulders she wore a closebodyd mans coat which discovered her whole shape which you know is to a miracle an incornation color which succeeded that paleness occasioned by her fear produced a mixture of roses and lillies and the contrary motions of fear and the succeeding joy of being delivered by me as i flattered my self proved a signal addition to those graces all the world allows her to be mistress of to be short i looked upon her with a satisfaction i am not able to express i would fain have detained her but was afraid of displeasing her because her lord who was in the next wood would doubtless go in search for her in all the corners thereof but seeing her upon the point of remounting her horse is it possible said i madam you should be willing to expose your self to the same danger you were in just now no madam i must not suffer it and if it be so that you have reason to avoid me i will rather depart notwithstanding the violence i put upon my self in thus leaving you but pray promise to afford me some other few minutes it would not be becoming to me sir replied she modestly to treat you with indifferency never was a man in a greater confusion than my self and whilst my attendants were looking for me in every corner i had a thousand distracted thoughts concerning what might become of the countess no said i i cannot plead in behalf of this imprudent piece of complaisance i have left her alone in the middle of the forest and that in such tempestuous weather how cruel was i to my self in letting slip so favorable an opportunity of staying along with her if any mischance should befall her how could i forgive my self it seems as if fortune and love had conspired to conduct her to that solitary place but i leave her without trouble and thus lose a jewel the loss thereof i shall perhaps have occasion to repent of all my life time  after my return to windsor i told them at supper to require the earl of devonshire to send me his hounds because having left at london my pack of large hounds i could not go a staghunting i did not question but that he himself would come along with them to court which he did accordingly and was received by me as the husband of a lady whom i loved and that to a high degree as i was obliged to act with all possible precaution in respect to the young countess i asked him where he had bin the night before and why he did not go abroad with me a hunting he told me that being not very well he went out in his chariot but that his wife being on horseback was in the greatest danger imaginable and owed her life to a peasant who had saved her  i did not spend much time with him but immediately went a hunting and directed the chase toward his at with so much eagerness that upon sight thereof it seemed to me as if it retreated backwards but not to give any suspicion i in spite of all my impatience followed the chase but with so much uneasiness for fear the stag should run at too great a distance thence that every moment i was ready to let fly at him oh love said i kill him with one of thy darts shorten the minutes that are to give me a sight of the countess thou can not do me a better piece of service i pretended to be displeased with the staggs being run down so soon and the earl inviting me to his house i gave him no opportunity of reiterating his request the noise of the hounds and horns had brought this young lady into a terrassd walk that lay level with her own apartment where she was walking with some of the neighboring ladies and her mother sir cried the earl of warwick interrupting the king what brought her thither she is no great lover of the country replied he but the earl of anglesey was not very well that is to say continued the earl with his eyes lift up toward heaven that every thing favored your majestys design i must own it added the king for the earl being altogether employed in ordering a magnificent collation for my entertainment afforded me an entire liberty of entertaining the countess  how uneasy have i bin upon your account said i alas madam i feared every thing after the danger i saw you undergo and how often have i reproached my self with that complaisance i showed in thus abandoning you it was absolutely necessary it should be so for every bodys repose answered she with a smile your majesty was not far off before my lord devonshire came to the place he asked me by what miracle i had escaped the danger of a furious horse i told him as it happened only sir that instead of naming your majesty i mentioned a peasant who had saved my life this secret you were pleased to keep i accept off as a happy omen replied i and i will flatter my self that in so doing you were willing to secure me against the suspicion of your overseers and it is impossible that since you would take care of my security in respect to them you should aim at my destruction in regard to your self she blushed at my discovery of these flattering hopes and said she i was in perhaps the wrong to make a mystery of so innocent a matter but sir persons of my age have so little experience that it is a hard task to act in every thing as it were to be wished ah madam cried i how cruel are these reflections of yours dont rob me of all hopes on your side whilst on mine i am resolved to love you with so much tenderness and so entire a resignation as shall fully convince you of my passion  she heard me all this while without speaking one word but now lifting up her eyes which she had kept steadfast to the ground and what will the world say sir said she when ever your passion should take vent they would say that i was more happy in pleasing you then in possessing the crown of england and continued she how will this be relished by those who have an absolute power over my sentiments let me manage that part with them said i do you secure to me your heart and i will secure you against all the world no sir no cried she no man living shall have my heart except he unto whom of right it belongs  i was so far engaged in discourse with her that her lord was within a few paces only from us when she seeing him approach without being in the least discomposed spoke as if she had answered me saying i am much delighted with hunting and go sometimes abroad upon sport the earl not imagining we were upon any other point desired me to enter a spacious room where a collation was ready at hand contrived with so much magnificence that i could have wished he had spared himself part of his pains but as i was almost distracted to see our conversation thus interrupted i thought of nothing else than how to renew it this was no very easy matter to do because the earl of devonshire was overdiligent in heaping his civilities upon me i proposed to play with the countess and took the spanish ambassador who came along with me for our third man because he understood no english the earl told me his wife being somewhat ignorant i should give him leave to instruct her how to play more quiet and better but i told him that was the right way to disoblige me since i could not bare any body should overlook the game so he went to take a walk with some of my attendants  he was no sooner gone but i acted my part so well that having persuaded the spanish ambassador i was weary of playing because some disputes were made about the cards i was at liberty to talk to the countess and she to answer me without being perceived by our third person alas said i my charming countess when you come back to london what will become of me unless i see you every day oh i am afraid you will leave me and that will cost me my life she smiled with a childish air not telling me what was to be done to see her without giving any occasion of disturbance as i was sensible was the thing that she dreaded most so the more i knew her fear the more i strove to make her sensible also of the impatience of a man not accustomed to obsticles of that nature but all that i could say was not sufficient to alter her resolution and if she told me nothing that was offensive she was very cautious in not saying any thing that was engaging so that with all my application i could draw no more from her than assurances of her respect  i had ordered one of the grooms of my bedchamber to dive into all the circumstances of that family which he did so successfully that having insinuated himself into the acquaintance of a certain old lady who had bin governess of the countess he found her of so covetous a temper that in all probability she would not withstand liberality at last after having talked with my lady devonshire for a considerable time i left her but so prepossessed with her high deserts that though she would not in the least flatter me with hopes of success i resolved to love her as long as i lived her lord attended me as far as windsor i told him i intended to go a stagg hunting the next day and that he should not fail to go along with me and spent some part of the night in ruminating upon what she had said and upon what i had further to do to insinuate my self into her favor  i did rise before the sun to the surprise of the whole court and was abroad so early that the earl of devonshire came too late however he made haste to find me out and met with a kind reception from me under pretense of talking of his seat i took the opportunity to enquire after his lady she was sir said he the occasion of my not being sooner with your majesty she is gone to london i knew not whether he took notice of my countenance but i am sure it changed most strangely however he told me that the earl of anglesey being ill when she came away from thence was now very desirous to have her near him because as he took delight in nothing so he hoped her conversation might divert him i recovered a little when i understood the occasion of her journey which caused me so much vexation but after having followed the chase for a little while i clapped spurs to my horse and taking a byroad soon found my self alone i alighted and placing my self under the agreeable shade of some trees gave my self an entire liberty of employing all my thoughts upon the countess what pleasures said i did not i promise to my self and must one moment rob me of what i love i have taken no care either how to see her again or how to write to her and must i thus be separated from her i ought rather to have feigned my self sick to get an opportunity of staying with her or ought to bring her back to windsor under any pretense whatever alas what am i the better for my sovereign authority if i dare not make use of it i was then taking some resolutions what to do for the future but these were soon gone when i considered they might be displeasing to her thus whilst i was struggling betwixt my desires and fear i saw my self fluctuating upon the boistrous waves of a sea that is never without storms all this while bewailing the departure of my charming countess twas just then i heard the noise of several horses and the voices of women i should have had but little curiosity to look after them but that coming so near me i arose to avoid them the first thing that offered it self to my sight was my lady devonshire at that very moment i felt all the pleasure of an agreeable surprise i run toward her and without asking whether she would alight nay without knowing what i proposed to do i took her in my arms and set her upon the ground but in a moment after reflecting upon what i had done i began to be uneasy however it being too late to be recalled i asked her pardon conjuring her at the same time to let me know what unforeseen good chance had brought her back she told me that the axletree of her chariot being broken by the badness of the road which required a days time to be mended she had resolved to return from whence she came i then told her what a condition her departure had put me into and that i had not left my company upon any other account than to give my self over to my secret thoughts and to bewail my self for having passed a day without seeing her she seemed to be touched with a thing which she could not very well doubt of seeing me in this solitary place where i could not be informed of the mischance that had happened to her chariot nor propose to meet with her at that time  among the women that were along with her i took notice of albine whereof i had had so lively a description that it was impossible for me to mistake her i had a great inclination to have secured her into my interest at that instant but great people labor under this misfortune that they can do nothing without being observed twas also for this reason that i would not detain the countess so long as i could have wished i told her all that can be said or called tender but could not discover in her any other disposition than what i observed the day before so i was forced to hope for some happy moment to see her in london in the mean while my eyes followed her as far as they could i sent a thousand sighs after her and then returned where the noise of the hounds called me  the earl of devonshire being ignorant of what mischance had befaln his ladys equipage i told it him and that i had met her upon the road thinking that it might prove of worse consequence to make a mystery of it than to tell it as really it was but i found my self in the wrong the earl acting here the part of a jealous husband imputed to our own contrivance the breaking of the chariot and our meeting in the forest and without reflecting that we could not guess the illness of the earl of anglesey which they knew nothing of till after i left them he resolved to remove her at a good distance from court i did not guess at his intention and soon put an end to the chase he had no sooner taken his leave from me but he ordered every thing to be got ready and unwilling to confide in any body but himself carried her away at midnight so that the poor lady saw her self exposed to those reproaches she deserved not  so soon as i got notice thereof i returned to court and the old albine who had espoused my interest told me the earl of devonshire had desired my lady anglesy to observe her daughter more narrowly for the future that we had had an interview and that doubtless she had answered my purpose this news pierced me to the very heart i writ to her she sent me no answer except that she prayed me with all possible violence to sacrifice my impatience to her honor judge you continued the king to what a degree i love her since till now i have kept this a secret from you i hear news from her every day and i shall certainly speak with her the first favorable opportunity that offers twas albine that told me concerning the visit you made her and that your appearing so much discomposed had raised in them a suspicion you were sent by me which would prove as unseasonable to me as to you take my word for it i will have neither confident nor rival love somewhere else and never visit my countess again    i have nothing to sacrifice replied the earl of warwick who by this time having had sufficient leisure to recollect himself and to consider of what he was to answer told him sir were the young countess as beautiful in my eyes as she appears to yours i would certainly never think of her any more as long as i live even if it should cost me my life but it is not i that am subject to this fatality it is general talbot it is true sir he loves my lady devonshire with so excessive a passion that wherever he finds you to stand in his way he will not be able to outlive his pain i cannot imagine what you tell me to be true answered the king who has told you the general is in love he who never was so before in his life a person the most cautious and indifferent of all men living it is a secret he entrusted to me one day when your majesty drew unexpectedly near us said the earl and i intended to have given your majesty the diversion of understanding it at that time but that the general making a sign of keeping the secret i began to talk concerning his indifferency instead of his passion  the king returned no answer his heart being divided betwixt love and generosity he loved the general out of gratitude but the charming countess by inclination such was his confusion that to conceal it in some measure from the earl whose over curiosity he not much liked he left the closet and went into the duchess of york his mothers apartment  the earl came home overwhelmed with a most profound melancholy never did a man pass a night with more anxiety and trouble cease cease unfortunate man said he to adore an inaccessible beauty she is beloved by thy master who notwithstanding all his greatness and addresses has not as yet the least certainty of being beloved and what then must be thy destiny if thou persists in so fatal a passion it is time to abandon it and to look upon this lovely person as a dangerous rock which will stave thy vessel to pieces he had scarce taken this resolution when retracting them as frailties unbecoming his courage and little suitable to that happy temerity which had so often stood him in good stead is my passion so weak continued he as to give way with so much ease to the torrent that opposes its progress have not i taken notice of some favorable looks in the countesses eyes i have no more to do than to persuade the king that if he continues to be a rival to the general talbot he will certainly die for grief and at the same time to make mrs elizabeth lucy sensible of the infidelity of our monarch that she may endeavor to reclaim him  this was a lady of quality whose family had bin famous for being employed in the greatest places of the kingdom in the year      richard de lucy lord justice of england was general of the kings armies during the civil wars and ever since that time this family being inseparably united to the house of york they were often out of favor upon the accession of edward to the throne they signalized themselves in their affection for his service this was the reason why all his favorites but especially the earl of warwick cast their eyes upon mrs elizabeth lucy to make her the kings mistress which they did without much difficulty this young monarch as i told you before was the most gallant prince of his age the best shaped the bravest and most witty of all men living elizabeth on the other hand was considered as a miracle of beauty nothing was comparable to her shape and her wit alone was sufficient to have set off her charms had they bin much inferior to hers it is true she had a great share of pride and haughtiness she looked upon it as her due to choose her adorers out of the royal family and that without doing her a great piece of injustice they could not wear any other fetters but hers the king not able to refuse her his heart at first visited her with much circumspection on account of her reputation but it was a hard matter considering the ambition of the lady and the love of her gallant to conceal a secret of this nature for any considerable time in short she was for having it out the king created her a marchionness of heresord which new title as it procured her a great court so it occasioned no less envy in others as now the king gave himself an entire liberty of showing his gallantry and passion to her so it was soon divulged every where and it is possible that this manner of loving so publicly took away the nicest and sweetest part of its relish  but whatever it were he was most passionately in love with the countess of devonshire and had a most tender concern for general talbot when he understood his passion for her he was most sensibly touched that it should be he who was likely to cause him so much pain and such was his generosity that he would have sacrificed his passion to him had it not bin beyond his power so to do he checked his inclinations and was vexed that his heart would not join with his reason in his cure to allay in some measure his pain he flattred himself that the earl of warwick whom he knew to be a bold and dextrous person perhaps made use of the general instead of a shield wherewith to shelter himself for said he there is but little reason to imagine that a soldier who never had any inclinations to gallantry should now enter upon so mad a project and that to so little purpose ought he not to consider that he is not master of any thing that may flatter him ever to be able to please the countess of devonshire she is one of the greatest ladys in the kingdom both for estate and birth nothing is comparable to her wit and beauty she is more narrowly watched than the golden fleece what is it then that can make him promise to himself such a conquest it is true he is a well made person but he is none of the youngest oh doubtless it is warwick himself that is the real lover who thus thinks to put the change upon me this notion afforded him some present consolation but to be secure of the matter he resolved to try all means of diving into the generals sentiments  the earl of warwick having by this young monarchs last discourse to him understood that one of my lady devonshires women was not of a very difficult access he judged he might engage her in his interest by giving her greater presents than the king had done looking upon this as the most necessary point for his repose in hopes to interrupt the correspondence by letters betwixt his master and the countess and in lieu thereof to settle his own with her he took also a full resolution not to mention one word to the general of what he knew for fear he should resign every thing to the kings passion a piece of generosity he looked upon as not very suitable to his present design he went early to wait on the king and spent the rest of the day in the apartment of the marchioness of hereford but could not meet with an opportunity to tell her she had a most dangerous rival as it was absolutely necessary to set her to work to prevent the kings engaging any further in this new passion and being uncertain when he might have a favorable time to entertain her he ventured to write to her these lines  madam it has not bin my fault that i am not now in a condition to save you the trouble of knowing that the king is unfaithful i have bin so bold as to represent to him what regard he ought to have to his oaths and how much he was in the wrong to prefer the countess of devonshire to you since her charms are so much inferior to yours what is to be said in the matter madam love is blind and the king is apt to believe that my inclinations to support your interest makes me careless of his thus my councels become suspected nothing but your reproaches will be able to bring him back to you if that proves unsuccessful i advise you to tell him that you will make such a noise of it as will sufficiently revenge your wrong dont be negligent in the matter madam but above all dont sacrifice me since you have not any one friend more devoted to you than my self   elizabeth de lucy had bin sensible her self that the king had not the same passion for her but his intreague with the countess of devonshire had bin carried on with so much secresy that in spite of all her endeavors she had not bin able to learn any thing of it this letter of the earl of warwicks all at once unraveld those points which had occasioned to her of late a thousand torments though in effect her case was not much amended by it being naturally of a fierce temper she had muchado to choose the milder way but as she had never as yet had any contest with the king so she like a cunning woman rightly judged it more proper for her to try the kings temper before she discovered her own so she retired into her closet for fear of discovering her sentiments to those that were then making their court to her  as for the earl of warwick he had had so little rest that being seized with a violent pain in the head he was not able to rise and therefore gave orders that he would see no body soon after in comes the general talbot and his servants believing that a person of his character was excepted from their masters orders they let him go in the general appeared to be beyond his wits at the earls indisposition which perhaps at another juncture he would not have bin but now looked upon him as his faithful guide who was to conduct him through a country where he as yet was unacquainted with the roads since that time i saw you last my lord said he i have met with a world of adventures and you will be perhaps surprised as well as my self how dexterously i got over them i never thought love could have made me so cunning and designing and yet you will be obliged to own that it has go on my lord as long as you think fit said the earl i can much better hear than answer you  as i was last night making my court to the king said the general i found him busy in looking upon some pictures painted upon glass he called me as soon as he saw me have you any skill said he in this kind of workmanship i drew nearer and told him that the light of the candles was not very proper to make one see the true perfections or defects of the painting these are only copies replied the king so there can be no great loss in them but among all the rest i have a peculiar fancy for this said he showing me the picture of my lady devonshire the seller knows not whose it is without he goes to the italian painter to enquire for whom he sells them i have too lively an idea of that lovely person continued the general not to know the picture which cast me into such a confusion that i could scarce recover my self the kings curiosity made me tremble so i was very careful not to name her and told him doubtless it was some foreigner why replied the king would you not have her to be an english lady it seems to me added i that she being so exceeding handsome she must have appeared somewhere or other i assure you continued he i have some confused remembrance to have seen her somewhere or other perhaps in france or holland said i but for the most part picturedrawers draw their pictures according to their own fancies such as bare some resemblance to every body the king made no answer but fixing his eyes upon the picture seemed to be in a deep study and so was i how unfortunate am i  said i if i should have such a rival a king so lovely in his person is more likely to be accepted of than i is it possible he should so soon leave his mistress  the earl of warwick did within himself admire the oddness of this adventure how general talbot should just come to the king when this pourtraiture of the countess of devonshire was brought to him he could not immediately satisfy himself what made the king pretend he did not know her since some of those that attended his person at windsor knew he had bin treated with a collation at her house but he concluded at last that the general knowing nothing of that matter the king did it to be satisfied concerning what he had told him of that generals passion whilst he was ruminating upon all these matters the general being amazed to see him so surprised what is the matter my lord said he will not you speak to me i told you before replied the earl i was not fit for company i am satisfied added the general provided you will tell me only what makes you to be so much surprised at what i tell you the reason is replied the earl  having recovered himself a little because it seems very odd to me how any one could offer the picture of the countess to sale since considering how narrowly she is observed i most question whether they would suffer her picture to be drawn be that as it will answered he the king bought the pourtraiture and charged me to carry it into his little closet where he intended to keep it like a jewel of great value had he taken the least notice of my countenance he might easily have discovered the disorder i was in as i heard him give his orders to bring the limner who had made that piece to him i did not question but that he intended to enquire after the name of this fair lady there needed no more to make me rise early in the morning i went to the picturedrawer and having gained him into my interest by a very large present and bought the original whereof the king has only the copy to tell his majesty that this piece was drawn for the fair rosamond the daughter of the earl of clifford the famous mistress of king henry ii of england and that though the drapery was somewhat too modern for those times he should tell him he thought fit to dress her according to the mode that it might sell the better to be short by the help of my instructions he answered all the young monarchs questions to a miracle whereof i was a witness with an intention to help him out upon occasion the king would tell me several times truly rosamond was a lovely lady i dont wonder that king henry would never forgive his wife the murder of so charming a creature queen eleonore replied i looked upon her with a jealous eye yes said the king but as for my self i admire her see what difference there is betwixt our sentiments i made scarce any answer to this being afraid lest if i should put rosamond too far in his head he might thereby find out the way to the beautiful countess of devonshire so i endeavored to divert him from these thoughts by proposing a match at tennis betwixt him and the duke of gloucester my only comfort is continued he that he thinks no further than rosamond and that the countess of anglesy who is very sensible of her daughters beauty and what impression it might make upon a young prince so much inclined to tenderness does keep her up very close without suffering her to come to court and that upon that score she makes all the world believe she is most frequently indisposed  but continued he as for my own concern i know how to manage the matter and intend to enter into a strict friendship with the earl of devonshire i told you before that he stands in need of my assistance in a business of great consequence wherein if i should oppose i might turn the balance on which side i please it is this that has made him entertain me with all imaginable civilities and when i went to visit him he entreated me to visit his lady in her apartment i must confess to you that her charming wit accomplished what the charms of her person had begun before i was so far beyond my self and so bewitched that nothing less than her husbands presence could have hindered me from declaring my love upon the spot however i checked my sighs but with so much violence that i was in danger of being choked certainly never did a man of my age undergo so hard a novitiat alas i am no more surpised now that love should even exert its vigor among the tigers and bears you may judge now if i should be condemned to a much longer silence whether i would not immediately prefer death to life and at the same time it is no easy task for me to get an opportunity of speaking to her unless you will do me the favor to go along with me and entertain the earl whilst i do the same to the countess  this offer was too pleasing to the earl of warwick to refuse it for he had made several trials of seeing her again and went at diverse times to pay her a visit but my lady anglesey who was an experienced overseer had taken such measures that setting aside his first visit when to speak the truth she surpised them she had always some excuse or other at hand to send him away handsomely so that when the general who had got a great ascendant in that family desired him to go along with him he was highly pleased with it the person he was to act in amusing the duke of devonshire was indeed not altogether suitable to his wish but he would certainly have gone under much worse conditions flattering himself that at least he might by intervals say something or other that would abundantly recompense his labor  the general took him in his coach because the earls livery should make no show at the door and for the same reason they took none of their servants along with them so that coming to the gate my lady devonshire thought she should see no body but the general and though my lord was then abroad her mother and she looking upon him as no dangerous person admitted him without any further ceremony the earl of warwick was too nearly concerned not to take particular notice in what manner his reception should be made he found them nettled at his presence they both showed him a great deal of civility but the young countess would scarce lift up her eyes to look upon him and if she happened to look at her mother she cast down immediately her eyes again toward the ground and changed color there is not the least question but that the sprightliness she showed in his first visit being not approved of by my lady anglesey she had given her perhaps a lesson upon that account which proved not very favorable on his side so that he found himself under no small uneasiness but the pleasure he felt of beholding so lovely and so extraordinary a person soon got the better of that veneration which was occasioned by the serious looks of the countess  the general talbot was not a little vexed also to meet with my lady anglesey in her daughters apartment but resolving to make the best however of the earl of devonshires absence he told them at his first coming into the room that he was come to entertain them with an affair of moment and being placed next to the countess of anglesey he judged he could do no less than enter upon something that might divert and make some favorable impression upon them the main subject of his discourse was such as he loved to speak of most as for instance the famous siege of orleans wherein he was so much concerned in conjunction with the earl of salisbury where the maid of orleans began to signalize her self in so miraculous a manner as also in the battle of patay where the earl of suffolk lost the day the general did here wonders and they were both taken prisoners by this heroine neither did the general forget to enlarge upon the taking of roan by the count de dunois for it was he who together with the duke of somerset did most bravely defend that place and who was delivered up as an hostage for the payment of  0000 crowns of gold but the english would rather have mortgaged half the kingdom than left him in the lurch whom they knew to be one of their best generals and whom they commonly used to style the english achilles these being all matters sufficiently known and the countess of anglesey was better acquainted with them than most people being a lady of great sense and of an eminent rank at court however she would not interrupt him and as he was very apt to speak very passionately of a thing wherein he had acted so great and noble a part and that the presence of the countess of devonshire had raised in him an extraordinary vivivacity he would sometimes talk so loud that the countess of anglesey who set next to him was not a little disturbed with the noise  the earl of warwick was sure to improve these happy moments in saying now and then some engaging thing or other with a low voice to the countess and therefore under pretense that he used to chaw tobacco held his handkerchief before his mouth for fear her mother should suspect something of the matter he told her he adored her that he desired nothing else in return but her permission to serve her with the same respect as they do the gods and that he hoped his unfeigned and dissinteressed passion deserved something of her goodness she pretended not to mind him but understood very well all he said and the earl was so much taken up with whispering that the countess of anglesey spoke more than once to him without receiving the least answer her daughter was much concerned thereat and though perhaps she was not displeased with what he told her she would have bin very sorry to see the mystery unravelled what proved an additional satisfaction to the earl was when he considered that he had thus bubbled both the mother and the general and thereby had got sufficient opportunity of declaring his passion their visit was so long that it exceeded all the bounds of your ordinary visits the earl of devonshire did not come home nevertheless they made no motions as if they intended to go at last my lady anglesey told them not without some marks of uneasiness it was very late and perhaps her soninlaw would sup in the city at these words they arose and went their ways  the general vexed to the heart at the ill success of this visit was ready to quarrel with the earl on account of his sitting next the young countess alleging that since he loved her no body else ought to pretend to that place but this ill humor was so far from displeasing his rival that he was highly delighted with it  my lord of warwick having discovered fresh charms in the countess both in reference to her wit and person was afflicted to the heart at the thoughts of her so dreadful overseer meaning her mother and as he saw no means how to be rid of her alas cried he alas is this the prospect of my approaching happiness i am afraid i shall be exposed to abundance of trouble without the least certainty of being recompensed according to my desires he was not only perplexed with his own misfortune but also forced to bear his full share in that of the general he came to awaken him at day break to tell him several things which would have proved but very indifferent entertainment to him had it not bin for the name of the countess which being often intermingled in his discourse did somewhat allay his ill humor the general had not bin able to hit another opportunity to give her a visit because the earl of devonshire understanding how long they had staid for his coming home had made him several visits one after another and as the general was not very happy at contriving love intreagues so whatever pains he took to find out a specious pretense his stock was quite exhausted so that he came to the earls in a very bad humor i am almost desperate said he to him the earl of devonshire has bin so often with me that we have nothing more to say to one another i have settled his business much more to his advantage than he could have done himself and thereby have dealt unjustly with one of my best friends and after all i dont find all this to be looked upon as deserving any thing at this jealous fellows hands i have a great mind said he frowningly to pick a quarrel with him for what benefit do i reap from the obligations he owes me i see his lady no more and i protest to you i am ready to be choked and this forced silence makes me lose every thing that might be pleasing to her to embroil your self with him said the earl would be a very odd method to hope for a favorable reception from her but you being better acquainted with him than i let us pretend that we have heard he has a mind to sell his fine seat near windsor and that i am willing to purchase it let us go to see him together and if he is at home you shall amuse him in discourse whilst i will talk to the countess and prepare her to give you a favorable reception if he be abroad you may lay hold of this opportunity your self  the general highly satisfied with this expedient embraced it with all his heart so they sent to the earl of devonshire to know whether he were at home and were told he was not this happening much to their wish they went thither immediately but found him come home this news put them almost in to despair the coach being already within the gates of the courtyard instead of alighting they began to consult what was best to be done one was for going straightways into the countess of devonshires apartment the other was for going back without seeing any body whilst they were thus disputing the countesses people looked at them out of the windows at last the earl of warwick so far prevailed with the general that he was to alight alone and make a short visit but mention not one word concerning the countryseat the matter was performed exactly as they had agreed together the general staid but a very short time with the earl of devonshire which seemed to him a year and then came back to his coach almost like a madman i am almost reduced to despair said he to the earl i meet with insurmountable obstacles in my way were they made on purpose to plague me above all other men i have always heard them talk of love as of a secret passion full of pleasure without any considerable intermixture of pain i thought it was sufficient to love to be beloved again to declare ones love and to have the liberty of taking a walk together i have known a thousand who courted their mistresses without much difficulty and a thousand mistresses that were not known but by the name and merits of their lovers but in my case every thing is very different i meet every where dragons in my way whom i am forced to combat i could not speak to her i adore and my patience is put to the hardest trial that ever was i have done my lord i am quite tired of this way of living so far different from what i was used to till now i am resolved to think of nothing but the recovery of my liberty this shall be my only mistress for the future and i am strangely mistaken if ever i part from her again  he would have continued talking with the same violence all the remainder of the day had they at their coming to court not immediately espied the king the earl of warwick quite tired with the generals complaints and his own vexation for not having bin able to see the countess made all the have he could to approach his majesty who seeing him alight out of his coach asked him soon after with a low voice from whence do you come sir replied the earl your majesty may easily guess since you see me with the general i understand you said he but you are in the wrong not to endeavor to cure him of his passion i know you are malicious enough to encourage his love by some flattering hopes or other there is no great occasion for that said the earl laughing he is apt enough to indulge himself in what he thinks a pleasure to him  whilst they were thus talking the king entering into his closet told him i could not have believed the general would have embarked on so weak a bottom especially at such an age as his and therefore the other day having a mind to be satisfied in that point it succeeded according to my wish for i had the picture of the countess of devonshire drawn without her knowledge which the picturedrawer pursuant to my instructions sent to me to be sold the general happening to see it was much discomposed but what pleased me best was that he did all he could to deceive me the next day he went to the limner unto whom he gave a good sum of money charging him to make me believe it was drawn for rosamond king henry ii mistress who has bin dead above  00 years ago i cannot forbear laughing when i consider how pleased he was when he believed me to be so easily imposed upon and i have now no more reason to doubt that it was his interest that made him conceal my lady devonshire from me i know all that your majesty has told me said the earl the general proud of having acted so nice a part came on purpose to tell it me in hopes of being applauded for his conduct and for my part i was not backwards to show my self a man of complaisance he will be obliged to you for it as long as he lives replied the king but you came from the countesses pray what news there she was invisible to us replied the earl she did not appear but her husband did the general was ready to quarrel with him because he had so little breeding to be at home when he thought he had bin abroad  the king returned no answer to the earl but after pondering a little upon the matter at last told him you see how all my mirth is changed at once into sadness i am uneasy at what the general is likely to suffer when he comes to be acquainted with the intreague betwixt the countess of devonshire and i then you are happy sir cried the earl no hitherto i live only on hopes replied he and were it not for albine who gives me some comfort i would certainly act aboveboard with my mistress for what is it i have to fear and after all how do i know whether her governess does not deceive me your majesty is above all this said the earl but consider whether it be not the hight of pleasure to a heart sensible of the nicities so love to know that you are perhaps the only monarch in the world whose love is unreveald yes answered the king i should extremely delight in it and relish this kind of mystery in its utmost perfection were i happy but let us change the theme i am perhaps the only monarch who has patience enough to sigh so long without knowing more of his destiny than i do i suffer my self to be guided by an old woman i am afraid of disobliging the countess and suffer a great deal in hopes of one happy day it is true added he this day is not far off for i am to send the earls of anglesey and devonshire to york though under a slender pretense their business being to inform themselves concerning some differences arose in those parts whereof they are to give me an account probably your majesty said the earl will visit the countess without any further precaution so soon as they are gone i see only one obstacle in the way that is my lady anglesey who keeps a very watchful eye over her daughter but we must give her a dose of opium you divert your self at your own pleasure replied the king you may be assured i am not acquainted with the temper of that old dragon but i have contrived the matter thus with albine the same night i have sent the father and husband to york i am to come to a little gate leading into the garden and in disguise and so must you how sir said the earl will your majesty take me for your companion perhaps to divert the good old governess much thereabouts said the king for you must knock at the great gate in disguise and ask to speak with her so soon as she comes to you you are to tell her your nephew has killed a gentleman in a duel they are in search after him he is hard by and desire you would shelter him here only for one night he intends to go aboard a ship before daylight and you will conduct him safely into the netherlands hereupon the old woman is to run mumbling to the countess of anglesey to beg her to suffer her nephew to come into the house and if she can get the key of the little gate i am to go up by a private pair of stairs to the countesses apartment but supposing her mother should refuse to let you come in sir what will you do then said the earl o she certainly will for she loves albine and will certainly pity her case  the king having spoken these words went immediately into his bedchamber and the earl to his house but so pierced with pain and vexation that he threw himself upon his bed accusing his ill destiny and upbraiding himself for having delayed so long to bring over albine into his interest he could likewise not guess at the cause of mrs elizabeth lucys silence all which joined together made him imagine himself the most unfortunate of any man living i shall never know cried he the utmost extent of my disgrace it is my master that is the cause thereof who has pitched upon me for his confident and will have me go along with him to a place where i am not able to see him without dying upon the spot what must i leave him at the countesses after i have taken all the pains that possibly i can to get him admittance i would sooner throw my self into the thames but after all will not it be better to be there present because i flatter my self that some accident or other may thwart the happy success of this interview thus the earl tormented himself sometimes sitting sometimes arising but all this while so overwhelmed and entangled in grief that he knew not what resolution to take his great mind not used to buckle was not so much afflicted with having the king for his rival as with the tenderness he supposed the countess had for this young monarch o your beautiful eyes cried he what was it you would fain have told me at the very first time i saw you what did you mean the other day by those piercing darts so full of sprightliness and tenderness oh why would not you cast your angry looks upon me when i told you that it was you alone i adored i should be apt to believe continued he that she hearkened to me for no other reason than to sacrifice me to the king and to tell him the wole matter but she has kept the secret tohwhat purpose is all this mysterious contrivance what can be the reason she should be careful of me of one side when she stabs me on the other and supposing i should bring over albine to my interest what benefit shall i reap by it since her mistress loving the king so well as she does she will find out means to see him in private thus he passed half the night without coming to any fixed resolution when on a sudden something came into his head that afforded him some fresh hopes and a little comfort he looked upon the success thereof as a kind of a miracle which might produce a considerable change in his present afflicted condition and his heart which seldom used to despair was willing to flatter it self with good success  so without troubling himself for the present with the concerns of the family of my lady devonshire he did not oppose the going of the father and husband to york but immediately went to see mrs elizabeth lucy how madam said he since you have thought fit to sacrifice your reputation in passing for the kings mistress will you suffer with patience to see him snatched away from you your conquest will be attended with nothing but shame at this rate it is this night madam that is to decide your fate the king has not bin able hitherto to entertain the countess of devonshire in private but now every thing is prepared for his secret entrance there will you let this go on with the same tranquillity wherewith you have neglected my first council my lord said she i have not bin insensible of the misfortune that threatened me i flattered my self that my dissatisfaction and my tenderness might efface my rival out of that heart whereof i once had the absolute possession i staid for some favorable opportunity of disclosing my self to the king but since the case is so pressing i must send to desire him to make me a visit that i might load him with reproaches that i may cry and that i may threaten i will kill my self before his face if he leaves me nothing can be better madam said the earl but i beg you let me but see you act one part of this comedy that either i may applaud or correct you for you know i am a critic at plays no no my lord cried she this is no matter of diversion to me i never was so much concerned at any thing in all my life but said she after having paused a while i know not how the king came to the knowledge of the countess nor how it came to pass that she loved him so you must instruct me in this point the earl approving her proposition gave her an account of his hunting at windsor and at the same time charged her not to mention any thing of this evenings meeting because the king would certainly charge him with the discovery thereof having communicated the secret to no body else but himself  there was no great occasion for the earl of warwick to encourage mrs elizabeth lucy she was too nearly concerned in the matter not to make use of all her arms and she resolved to take all the advantages she could her nght gown was of gold and blue silk trimmed at the edges with precious stones her head was carelessly dressed without hiding the luster of her coalblack hair she wore the kings picture on one of her arms and in short consulted her looking glass so well that she had never appeared more beautiful in all her life having sent a messenger to the king to desire him to make her a visit he did not fail to come accordingly for no man could have paid her more respect than he did and notwithstanding his new passion she had an almost uncontrollable ascendant over him he was not a little disturbed at the earnest message she sent him and turning toward the earl of warwick what does she want with me said he cannot you guess sir answered the earl my guess is that she that is a mistress of so young and handsome a king as you are does desire nothing more than to see him to please him and to take care of a heart in the possession whereof consists the felicity of her life for the rest i cannot tell whether she has any other business which has obliged her to send this compliment to your majesty i will go thither and pass away half an hour said the king for i am resolved that nothing shall come in my way to hinder this nights appointment the earl being highly dissatisfied at these words to detain the king the longer put him in mind that he had promised to give audience to the spanish ambassador who was ready to come to court and that he had better to pay his visit to the young elizabeth after the audience was over  accordingly the king delayed his visit but no sooner was the ambassador gone but he went to his mistress whom he found singing in a melancholy tone so soon as she saw the king she left off but the king desired her to go on as the swan said she near the banks of the river semander bemoans his death by his last song so i foretell mine this day yes sir i foretell it and reproach you with being the cause thereof he blushed at these words and gave her a tender look what is it said he you mean to reproach me thus undeservedly she then laid open the matter to him with tears in her eyes the king surpised to see her so well acquainted with the whole matter stood it out nevertheless most boldly telling her that nothing in the world was more false that he had never seen the countess of devonshire except for one moment at her own house whilst he was at windsor and that ever since that time he had not so much as ever thought of her that if it were true that he had bin so far struck with her beauty as she imagined it would perhaps not have proved impossible for him to have seen her again but his opinion was that some body or other had contrived to make her kill her self with her own weapons because they knew he was a declared enemy against such like inquisitive practices the marchioness touched to the heart to see him stand it out so stiffly to conceal his infidelity began to be in a most furious rage and would not suffer him to stir out of the room and so soon as he began to talk of going made most doleful lamentations and outcrys declaring she would kill her self before his face as he knew very well that my lord angleseys and devonshires journey would take up some days he considered that there would be no great difference in his enjoyment if he deferred to see the countess of devonshire till the next night so that he did not part with mrs elizabeth lucy till very late which appeased her anger a little for the present and the earl of warwick very inquisitive after every thing that was transacted there understanding that the king had ordered his supper to be served up there did not question but that the neck of the other intreague was broken at least for that night  upon this surmize he disguises himself as much as possible he could and taking along with him mr berincour one of his gentlemen who for a considerable time past had bin his confident in his nocturnal rambles tells him the whole concern and so trusting to his good fortune away he goes to the little gate of the garden of the countess of anglesey and immediately sends berincour to speak to albine the action he was upon was so full of temerity that he himself durst not make a due reflection upon the danger that might attend it he was to deceive the young countess in personating the king when at the same time he knew not the place of their appointment and whether it were to be by the light or in the dark he could not but dread every thing from his master if the thing should come to his knowledge besides a thousand unforeseen accidents as dangerous in their consequences as any of the rest but his natural intrepidity and his love making him consider all these dangers for no other end than to outbrave them he went on as fast as he could without hesitating upon the matter so soon as he was come near the garden he stopped a little to stay for berincours return from albine who had managed every thing with so much dexterity that the earl heard her coming much sooner than he could or durst have expected and turning a key a thousand times in the lock without being able to unlock it albine never made use of that key and now was so much discomposed at this accident that she did not know what to do all the pains she took to open the lock proving to no purpose she at last broke it she was then forced to tell him through a cranny of the door that it was impossible for her to open it being in the dark and not daring to fetch a light and that for this time she knew not what could further be done the earl almost reduced to despair considering that in case he lost this opportunity he could not meet with another so suitable to his purpose since the kings coming in person would soon unfold the riddle and understanding what had happened would bear him as much ill will as if he actually entertained the countess  he was very tall and large the wall was none of the highest and he had observed that day when he found my lady devonshire in the grotto that there were some nails fastened into it so he got upon the shoulders of his gentleman who being none of the least he scrambled over the top of the wall though not without a good many scratches he no sooner got into the garden but he emptied his pockets that were full of gold desiring albine with a gentile air to keep them for him she believing him to be the king was very ready to accept them though at the same time she was under no small apprehension lest this intrigue if discovered might prove fatal to some body or other and upon that score was so far overwhelmed with thoughts that had she seen the earl she would scarce have known him he went along with her to a private pair of stairs when the old gentlewoman remaining below told him he would find my lady devonshire in a room above he was considering with himself how to justify this treachery against the king and her self when approaching to a door some body took him by the hand he followed softly into a chamber where without giving him leisure to speak he was told what will you think of me my lord i dare not as much as ask it the steps i now make ought to appear to you so criminal that i am perhaps upon the point of losing all that esteem you gave me such assurances of when you came hither along with the general talbot the earl of warwick was surprised to such a degree at what he heard as to remain under the greatest uncertainty what answer to give by what accident said he should this person know that i am not the king for though she does not see me she is too well informed of the whole matter thus to mistake me is this a snare wherein to catch me am i with my charming countess or with some body else that intends to trap me he had not much time to consider of his present circumstances because the lady expected his answer in order to continue their conversation i am so far confounded at this excess of my good fortune said he to her that instead of entertaining any thoughts that might be injurious to you i find my tenderness and acknowledgment increased to such a degree as is impossible to be expressed however madam in the midst of all my happiness i must confess to you that i want the pleasure of seeing you which i beg of you to afford me with all my heart replied she i will go and fetch a light she went out to call albine who trembling for fear had no power to come up but had stood all this while at the bottom of the stairs and was now ready to run out of her wits when she was ordered to bring up a torch for now she thought her self lost for ever the reason was this  you must know that at the first visit the earl of warwick made to the countess of devonshire that fatal star which sometimes enforces a heart to enter upon an amorous engagement for the remainder of ones life had such a powerful influence upon hers that she did not take all the necessary precautions to defend her self against that destiny which we ought to resist with all our might on the contrary she cherished her passion and as she had her mind wholly taken up with the earl she told albine she would have no body speak to her of the king this old governess ready to run distracted at the thoughts to lose all at once the benefit of such rich presents took care not to contradict her mistress judging that this would prove a means to unfold a secret she intended to make her self mistress of for her own benefit your aversion to the king said she is not the effect of your considerations madam but of something else that pleases you pray put an entire confidence in me i will never misuse it or give you any occasion of repenting alas replied the young countess of what an easy temper am i albine hear me with patience for i shall ease my self a little when i tell you that i am charmed with the deserts and wit of the earl of warwick as i am resolved never to enter into an amorous engagement with him i will shun him with all my power making my duty the only rule of my conduct so i am prepared to undergo the most cruel torments that can be ah what comfort it is for one to discharge ones whole mind to an affectionate and faithful friend i entreat you to let the king know how uneasy my family is upon his account and that i beg him not to entertain any further thoughts of me this being the only favor i request at his hands in recompense for all the respect i bear him  albine was at a stand what to do since to break off an intrigue she judged she had almost brought to its period was altogether against her interest she had a nephew who being a sensible fellow she made him a partner in the secret it was then agreed betwixt them that nothing should be told to the king concerning the countesses indifferency for him and that the better to conceal the matter they were to open her letters written to him and in lieu thereof send some of their own making written in her own name though this was a very hazardous project yet was it well relished by albine who was prolonging this intrigue at any rate but as albine knew very well the kings impatience to see the countess and her aversion to such an interview she pitched upon the following stratagem madam said she to her if you will preserve the earl of warwick from destruction you must your self explain your mind to him for flattering himself that his addresses his passion and time will produce in you some favorable sentiments for him this makes him commit every day a thousand extravagancies to the uin of his fortune and of your reputation you are ell enough acquainted with my lord devonshire s temper so soon as he gets the least discovery that the earl is in love with you he will certainly believe that you love him also and therefore i advise you to see the earl and to declare to him that his hopes are very ill grounded oh albine said the countess what advice is that you give me after i have disosed to you the deplorable state of my heart is his the way to cure me to have an interview with so ovely an enemy no no let what fate will atend him it is better than to run the risque of seeing him my eyes would certainly contradict my words and what a shame would it be for me to betray my own infirmities it is enough that i am sensible of them my self and therefore ought to take all possible precautions against them but madam replied this dangerous woman consider what an injury it would be to him if the king should take an aversion against him and my lord devonshire against you and why should he hate me returned she with an air full of sweetness am i mistress of my own inclinations which have capvated my heart in spite of all the power i have am ot i rather to be pitied than blamed no madam continued the old governess you would not deserve any bodys pity if you refuse a moments interview to he earl of warwick to tell him your self that he atters himself with vain hopes and that he ought the sooner the better check his passion but it may be by that time he has forgot you you will continue still to emember him o kind heavens cried the countess with tears in her eyes i am afraid the remedy you prescribe has a mixture of poison in it nevertheless continued she because thou shall have no reason to upbraid me upon that score i will spend a quarter of an hour in an interview with him and  was upon this expression the old governess told the king he might come to see the countess  she was under no small uneasiness when she began to reflect upon the success of this appointment how the king would relish the matter to be brought thither under the notion of being the earl of warwick and how the countess would dispense with this disappointment when she discovered the deceit she looked upon it as one of the most difficult points that had been managed for some ages but after all she remained resolute to venture at all flattering her self that perhaps the whole intrigue might not be immediately unfolded or that at the worst her lady could not be very angry at seeing so tender and amiable a king instead of the earl of warwick  notwithstanding all this when the countess called for light she stood amazed like one struck dead however having soon recovered her self resolved without any more to do to unfold the whole riddle so throwing her self at the countesses feet and holding her by her night gown she with a thousand imprecations asked her pardon for the innocent deceit she had put upon her saving it was owing to nothing but to her z and affection to see her placed in so eminent a station above the rest she then told her trembling that it was not the earl of warwick that stayed  her in the room but the king who had continued constant in his love to her this put my lady devonshire into such a passion that she told albine s would never forgive but hate her as long as she lived and so without suffering her to say one word more away she flung into another room and shut the door after her  the earl of warwick was much surprised to find the same person that spoke to him not to come again and he durst not go in search after her for fear of meeting some body else than what he looked for whilst he was thus waiting for the issue with much impatience he heard something coming near him which said with a low voice sir i am almost in despair my lady devonshire is so capricious that she will not come here again what have i done said he she should shun to see me her head is full of chimeras added that person concerning your passion for mrs elizabeth lucy if your majesty will be pleased to take my advice i would go out of the garden immediately and leave the rest to my management to persuade her into a more complaisant humor the earl being a person of singular vivacity of wit immediately discovered the bottom of the intrigue so he told albine that he loved the countess too passionately to give her as much as one moments uneasiness and that he would desire her to deliver a billet in his behalf to the countess desiring at the same time some light pens ink and paper and that as soon as he had written he would leave the room the old governess much pleased with the opes of his speedy departure went to fetch a light but guess at her surprise when in lieu of the king whom she expected to meet she saw it was the earl of warwick she stood stupifyd like a stone without any motion except of her eyes and mouth but without being able to utter one word i am sensible albine of the whole matter said he though i want time to explain my self at this juncture pray find out a way for me to see your mistress and i will make peace both for my self and you follow me my lord said she but go softly i hope there is one door or other left unlocked for us to enter nor was it long before they found a private door which leading into a wardrobe they went forwards and surprised my lady devonshire all melting in tears and lying upon a couch the earl threw himself at her feet before she was sensible any body was near her is it possible said he my divine countess i should be so unfortunate as to see you shun me all these hazards i expose my self to in coming hither should not they be looked upon as the true effects of my passion how cried she you must come along with the king oh i little thought my lord you would have acted his confident here though i am not quite ignorant madam replied the earl of his sentiments for you yet i declare to you i should have expired with grief before i could come along with him no madam i am alone and come for no other reason than to seek your aid i stand so much in need of to support my self under those pains which are inseparable attendants of an unfortunate passion i neither will nor can afford you any help my lord said the countess neither did i give my consent of seeing you upon any other account but to clear you at once of those flattering conceptions you have taken in respect to me go on madam make an end at once replied he stab me to the heart here is my sword and since i have bin so bold as to lift up my eyes to adore you dont refuse me the grace of being punished by your own hands but if your goodness would afford me some few moments to enter upon my justification i could madam make you sensible of the sincerity of my passion do you remember my lord said she interrupting him that you talk to the countess of devonshire who cannot be innocent as long as she hears you talk at that rate then cease for ever to love me and to tell me that you do for i can make you no other returns but those of ingratitude oh madam cried the earl i know too well that i have flattered my self you can admit of no slaves under the degree of kings you judge not rightly of my inclinations answered the countess since it is my duty that engages me and i dare be so frank as to tell you that were i in a condition to make my choice betwixt the king and you my lord you should have no reason of complaint but after all dont presume upon this account for no body will reap the least benefit by it these words occasioned an inexpressible confusion in the earl in spite of those few glimpses of hopes he conceived in some of her expressions in entertaining him at so late an hour and in so secret a manner but she still entreated him to desist and not to disturb her repose by such addresses for which she should think her self but little obliged to him the earl answered to every particular with so much respect and passion that at last she could not refrain from telling him with a very melancholy air oh my lord how came i to know you what a strange fatality to happen to a young person who always led a retired life alas madam permit me said he to bear some share in your solitude i should think my self too happy and it should be the only endeavor of my life and all my care to allay the hardships of your retiredness by a thousand complaisant actions oh god replied she the comfort you propose is too full of danger you must shun me my lord and i must shun you  the earl was so much surprised with admiration at a thousand other pretty things she told him that the time passed away very fast and as according to the old proverb a lovers watch goes seldom exact so had it not bin for albine they had scarce parted at yet though it was already break of day the earl would have given any thing in the world to have given enjoyed the charming company of the fair countess for a few hours longer but no time was to be lost for fear of being overheard at going away so he parted but with so much grief and vexation as is scarce to be expressed  berincour stayed for the earls coming under the wall but there was no occasion for his helping him over it as he was obliged to do before albine who attended him having found means by this time to open the little door and being by his great promises entirely engaged in his interest she told him she would by representing to the king the indifferency of the countess for his person endeavor to cure him of a passion which has a much greater share of inconveniences than pleasure in it  my lord warwick now overjoyed at his interview with my lady devonshire goes home to bestow the best part of the night in indulging his fancy with the fresh remembrance of so charming a person he was scarce fallen a sleep when very early in the morning one of his servants came in to tell him that the general must of necessity speak with him immediately after he enters the room with so much gaiety in his countenance and actions that the earl who knew him always to be of a grave deportment not knowing what to make of it looked steadfast at him not without some signs of surprise and the more he observed the general to take notice of it the more he appeared to be pleased at it what an alteration cried the earl what is the matter my lord may one be permitted to know some part of your secrets ah my dear my lord said he embracing him you see here before you the most happy man in the world look steadfastly upon me for without vanity there is not a man now living up on earth who can match my good fortune i understand you replied the earl you have found out a cure for that troublesome passion which so lately played the tyrant over your heart a cure do you say replied the general abruptly i would rather choose to die you may take my word for it i am more lovesick than ever i was then you have made some considerable advances said he toward the heart of the countess of devonshire oh said the general there you have hit it right pray mind how the intrigue was carried on  the imner who sold me the picture of this lady judging by the great value he saw me put upon it and by the instructions i gave him to persuade the king that it was the fair rosamonds picture that all these things were not done without very weighty reasons on my side and that therefore my heart bore great share in all these assiduities at last began to be satisfied i was in love with the countess of devonshire as he was not ignorant of how difficult an access she was so he proposed to me the removing of these obstacles which otherwise might prevent my having an interview with her i need not tell you whether i was ready to embrace his offer or whether i engaged him further into my interest by very large presents it is enough to let you know that this last night when it was pitch dark he conducted me into the lady angleseys garden and from thence into a grotto by the help of some lights here i beheld the countess with a more beautiful luster than the sun it self that gives us light she showed a thousand engaging complaisances for me and at last asked me for my large diamond which she put upon her finger and in lieu thereof presented me with this small turquoise cut in the shape of a heart a thing i shall always look upon inestimable  dont you wonder continued he at the oddness of chance how that things that seem to be sometimes at the greatest distance from our hopes are brought to pass by such unexpected means for pray my lord consider who could have imagined that a little picturedrawer should have the management of a person that is the wonder of our age i asked him how it possibly could happen so he told me frankly that in all probability she would not have admitted him for her confident had she bin at liberty to choose another but that he having worked for a considerable time for my lady anglesey he was considered in the family as one of their old domestics and had the liberty of talking with the countess without being in the least suspected by any that considering how lavishly i paid for the picture it came into his head i must needs be in love with her that he took the boldness to discover his opinion concerning me to the countess who fetching a deep sigh told him alas i am not so happy he thinks of no other passion than what relates to glory that he thereupon recalld to her remembrance the amors of mars and venus and hercules and omphale upon which she replied what you tell me are nothing but fables now judge my lord added the general what an infinite pleasure such an unexpected accident must cause within me all my hopes were before this confined to no more than to adore without displeasing her but now i think i dare promise my self i am not hated by this beautiful lady  the earl of warwick could hold no longer but burst out a laughing a thing he would not have bin fond of at another time but that he had bin with the countess the same night i find said the general without giving him leisure to speak by your mirth you are overjoyed at my good fortune i am replied he to such a degree that i should be less sensible of my own the general embracing him my lord said he i believe my self the only man in the world who has so good a master so beautiful a mistress and so tender a friend the earl was ready to burst to keep himself from laughing at the generals fancy of being beloved by the countess and at his being thus imposed upon by the limner this made him most seriously reflect upon the frailties even of the greatest men in the world when once they are seized with a violent passion and had his own for my lady devonshire not got quite the ascendant over him he would have abjured and vowed not to engage in it as long as he lived i dont question my lord said he to the general that by the assistance of this limner you will have frequent opportunities of seeing the countess this is so great a blessing replied he that were it only in my power i would not miss a day of seeing her but she is obliged to act with so much precaution that i dare not urge that point too far for fear her complaisance should turn to her great prejudice some other discourse passed betwixt them all relating to the same subject then the general took his leave and the earl got out of bed in order to pay forthwith a visit to mrs elizabeth lucy being very impatient to know the success of the kings visit from her own mouth  she was still in bed but he had immediate access because he visited her frequently and that often by the kings order well madam said he have you got the victory was it possible he should hold out against such powerful charms as yours have you still a rival in being oh my lord cried she you cannot imagine to what a degree the king loves her i know too much of it not to be sensible of every thing and not to have penetrated in the very depth of his heart what is it i have not discovered there i was ready to run distracted but barbarous man as he is if my lameutations at certain intervals touched his heart the idea of my lady devonshire returned with such an irresistible power that in his very eyes i could read his secret anger if not his hatred against me but after all i would not have him imagine that i will tamely fall a sacrifice to him but am resolved to venture at every thing my despair suggests to me how madam said the earl and could not you get from him as much as one positive assurance that he would love nothing but you so far from it said she that he would not as much as own his passion but concealed it to the utmost for fear i should give disturbance to a person that is so dear to him he is not much in the wrong on it answered the earl smiling you seem to me not the fittest person to be entrusted therewith i am a going to write a etter to him said she and i will desire you to deliver it no said he dont let him know of my coming here for as the least accident might  so it would diserable  well  by another person  present when it is given to the  and writ the following lines  is it possible it should  so  and your majesty has not as yet  messenger to know at what time i died last night certain it is that and body else but my self would have died of grief though i am so  as to survive it i will flatter my self that  serves me to taste the pleasure of revenge yes sir i am not ignorant of the means to punish the person that robbs me of your heart a loss that is irrepairable to me which since it has happened i put not the least value upon my life my rival then must dread the utmost efforts of my despair and your majesty blame himself for ever for having bin the occasion thereof   the earl of warwick was no sooner come to court but passing by the kings closet he was called in and his majesty senting himself in an elbowchair told him have you heard nothing of the pretty parts the young elizabeth acted before me no replied the earl i know nothing of it i have nothing replied the king but reproaches cries lamentations and violence i would above all things fain know who is her counselgiver since i cannot imagine who should think it his business to tell her of my being in love with the countess of devonshire and what is more who it is that knows it albine understands her own interests better than to betray this intrigue and her self and the young lady cannot be so simple to divulge it who then could this be i hope sir said the earl your majesty does not suspect me no said the king though in loveconcerns you are none of the most  at least replied the earl i was so in this i tell you again continued the king i dont mean you ut am extremely vexed to see this young woman in so dismal a condition i am afraid she will not outlive it the earl who had a mind to dive into the true sentiments of his master told him with a smile i am apt to believe your majesty ought not to be much afflicted if she should die since you loving another she will be pestering you continually with a thomsand reprouches in my opinion nothing is more troublesome than to please two mistresses it is true replied the king as my passion is always sincere so i shall find it troublesome enough but as for you who are the greatest dissembler in the kingdom you would be able to have a dozen or two at once and impose upon them all so that none of them should be the wiser for it he had scarce spoken these words when mrs lucys billet being delivered to him he first perused it by himself but after a little pausing upon the matter read it aloud there is a young lady in a violent passion said the king what is your opinion of her the earl who saw in his eyes some infallible marks and returns of his tenderness for her told him sir i hope if she continues in the same humor she will scarce live till night what is it said the king she would have she frames a world of chimeras on purpose to plague her self has she observed me less passionate less generous or less frank in my addresses what is it makes her believe i am in love with another go you and pay her a visit assure her in my behalf that if she loses me it is by reason of her mistrust and to be short endeavor to make her as easy as possibly you can but sir said the earl if you are so much delighted in that new passion you have embraced why will you trouble your self with another were it not much better to leave her to her own despair go said the king and perform what i ordered you to do  my lord of warwick rejoiced to the heart at this commission went straight to mrs elizabeth lucys unto whom having given a full account of all that had passed betwixt them they soon agreed upon what answer he was to return to the king he in the mean while diverting his thoughts with walking in st jamess park the earl soon perceived him advancing a great pace without talking to any body but no sooner espied the earl when he asked him how does this young extravagant lady do sir said he she appeared to me not at all disturbed we soon entered upon the point of the affections and goodness you had for her person and i conjured her to believe you were the same now without the least change that these insinuations proceeded from her enemies who infused false notions into her on purpose to disturb her repose possibly thereby to check your passion for her that therefore she ought to be upon her guard and not to be imposed upon at that rate she told me with much unconcernedness that to her certain knowledge she was informed of all the circumstances of the whole intrigue that she flattered her self your majesty would have made a sincere return to her but now she could hope for nothing her resolution was fixed and so continued he she turned away and would not answer me one word more to whatever i could say so after having staid for sometime longer i went my ways but as i was going along her gallery which is pretty dark i felt something pull me back and looking backwards found it to be eleenor with tears in her eyes my lord said she my mistress has certainly some sinister designs in her head she intends to put an end to her life she ordred me to get her some opium but to mention it to no body how cried the king do you think she will be so foolish as to poison her self do you question it sir said the earl is not your majesty sufficiently acquainted with the temper of the english women who despise death as much as those illustrious roman ladies that died by their own hands without the least regret or fear  i must confess to you said the king with a very melancholy air i am not proof against this trial i love her and she is desperate what must i do in this case sir replied the earl you must love her absolutely whom you love best and let the other perish or do as well as she can or will oh i cannot do that cried the king and so leaning against a tree continued in a deep study for sometime till he who used to receive the countess of devonshires letters presented one to him at the sight of this dear character recovering himself he opened the packet with much precipitation but found nothing therein that pleased him for she told him as has been agreed upon betwixt her and albine that the countess of anglesey had made her a bedchamber so near to her own that they must pass through the last into the first and that since she must be lost for ever if this intrigue should be known in the family she begged him not to disturb her repose by doing an action the noise whereof must needs cost her infinite vexation and troubles and that he would be pleased to stay for a more favorable conjuncture  the style of this letter being very different from that of the preceding ones put the king actually in a passion he tore it to pieces saying she deserved not the respect he had always shown her and that the whole savouring very much of a fickledness he would make her repent of it and that after having ruined her reputation by the publishing of his passion for her he would complete her destruction by his indifferency that he intended to go see her in person and to upbraid her in the face of the whole court with her inconstancy that would prove an infallible means said the earl of the death at least of three people elizabeth lucy will certainly poison her self general talbot will die for grief when he understands that your majesty is likely to traverse his love and the earl of devonshire out of madness and jealousy will kill his lady no matter said the king i am resolved once in my life time to follow the inclinations of my own heart without hearkening to a thousand reasons that are contradictory to my satisfaction i dont presume so far sir answered the earl as to engage your majesty into what i propose in good earnest madam elizabeth lucy is not deserving enough for you to offer any violence to your inclinations general talbot has acted a very unwise part to give way to such a passion and as for the countess of devonshire i would advise your majesty to make love to her with trumpets sounding though she was to be poisoned within a quarter of an hour after whilst he was talking thus the king remained in a ruminating posture without answering a word and soon after returned to his palace  immediately after dinner he went to pay a visit to his mistress whom he presented with a very rich jewel it was an excellent piece of engraving upon a large ruby of a most exquisite luster besides which there was a fine diamond cut in the shape of a heart the whole devise represented a moon in a vast sea with this inscription she causes my calms and my tempests he told her at the same time a thousand engaging things conjuring her for the future not to load him with reproaches he deserved not the marchioness received it with equal demonstrations of joy and acknowledgment she was overjyd to find the devise applied to her notwithstanding which with tears in her eyes she made some few gentle reflections upon the king and he thinking he had done enough for one day would not urge her at that time to discover to him the persons who had given her information of these things though at the same time he continued in his resolution of finding it out it was so late before all the articles of peace were well regulated that they supped together when the earl came to pay his respects to the king and found himself at full liberty to speak his sentiments my thinks said he to the king i see in your eyes the conquest of madam elizabeth lucy and the defeat of my lady devonshire no replied he you are mistaken in your sight there is still remaining in my heart a very agreeable idea i am not able to efface so soon as i would but sir said the earl dare i take the liberty to ask your majesty if really you could wish it so the king after pausing a while replied i dont very well know what i could wish for i imagine to my self an absolute felicity in pleasing the countess but on the other hand am dissatisfied with her and fear lest mrs elizabeth lucy should die for vexation unless she has the preference before the other what then intend you to do sir said the earl i am resolved to talk with my lady devonshire added the king this being the very thing the earl dreaded most either for fear of the noise such a visit would make in the world or the jealousy the duke of devonshire might conceive thereat or out of a just apprehension lest the countess might be overtaken with the deserts and grandeur of this young monarch but on which side soever he considered it it appeared very dangerous to him sir said he you may write to the countess to let her know that unless she will find out some opportunity for you to see her you know how to pitch upon a time your self let the consequence to her prove what it will by this means you will oblige her to act with all possible diligence and to surmount all obstacles you may see her without making a noise in the world and you may save both your mistresses the king liked his advice being well pleased not to give any real occasion of pain to one whilst he sought to please the other  the earl was no sooner returned home but he writ to his charming countess every thing a heart full of love is able to inspire into a man especially when he flatters himself not to be hated by the party beloved he being a person of an uncommon vivacity of thoughts and most refined wit his expressions were so nice natural and noble that his wit proved as great a charm to the countess as his person being ready to die with impatience he desired permission to see her again but things were to be done with so much circumspection that they durst not so soon venture at another nocturnal rendezvous which might prove of very ill consequence  however they having found means to get the print of the key of the littlegardengate before it was returned to the countess of anglesey albine sent it to the earl who charging berincour to have one made immediately after the same pattern he spoke about it to a locksmith who after a great many exceptions to enhaunce the price of his labor at last made one according to the mould  the earl being extremely glad to see himself master of a key that could give him entrance into the garden now expected with the utmost impatience the next favorable opportunity to make use of it when the king sent him a messenger before day break to order him to come to court he made all the haste he could and found the king already in his closet much disturbed at the news he had received that king henry his rival had obtained a certain number of troops from the queen of scots besides  000 french auxiliaries sent him by that king at the intercession of renault d anjou king of sicily his fatherinlaw with the queen that amazon of our age at the head of them they have by this time joined all their forces said he to the earl and are preparing to march against ours go then and with all possible speed join your brother in order to make a powerful opposition against the efforts of the enemy the earl used always to show a great deal of satisfaction whenever he was to leave london on account of appearing in arms for the king but upon this occasion he was too sensible how much the goddess of love prevailed over the god of war the king much surprised at his silence and heavy countenance what is the matter said he you are so much altered that i scarce know you it seems as if you were troubled at the choice i have made no sir said he i am very sensible of your goodness and am resolved to acquit my self so well of my duty that you shall have no reason to repent of having preferred my services to the rest ah said the king i find how it is you are in love you have found nothing sir replied the earl with a smile i am preparing to obey your orders he went straightways home but full of trouble and vexation he sent berincour to speak with albine and to promise her any thing she could desire in the world provided she would find out but a few favorable moments wherein he might bid adieu to his fair mistress she left no stone unturned to do it but in spite of all her care and industry no opportunity did offer and my lady devonshire would not give a helping hand to procure one he writ her a letter as full of passion as respect unto which after some irresolution she returned an answer wishing him a happy journey and a fortunate campaign  of this she was even ready to repent as soon as it was done and told albine what would become of me should this billet be intercepted it is not enough for one to be innocent but one ought to act so as not to appear blameable to any madam replied the old governess you torment your self with things at a great distance dont you know that you have always reason enough to be satifyd within your self if you have acted nothing that is really blameable but good god albine continued the countess how can i be so was it fitting for me to write to my lord of warwick in short could i wish the earl of devonshire now to be my confident this and such like discourse passed betwixt them whilst her letter was delivered to the earl who was so delighted therewith that for a time he could read nothing else but that  however in spite of all his endeavors not being able to compass an interview he saw himself under a necessity of going for the army and having joined the marquess of montague his brother a battle was fought near exham wherein king henry having the misfortune to be routed was forced to seek for his safety in his flight leaving most of his faithful friends to the mercy of his victorious enemies whereupon henry duke of sommerset robert earl of hungerford and thomas rosse had their heads cut off by king edwards order  whilst the unfortunate king henry was endeavoring to save himself by flight queen margeret his spouse who had during the battle outbraved all dangers seeing all lost thought now of nothing so much as the preservation of the prince of wales this young infant being now to her the dearest thing she had left in the world she took him before her on horseback and making the best of her way to a spacious forest lay concealed there for several days never stirring forward but in the dark of the night but what should they do for sustenance the forest afforded nothing but some wild fruits and the child not being able to resist much longer the want of wholesome nourishment and the great fatigues it had endured the disconsolate mother sent up her most servent prayers to heaven and imagining that nothing could be superadded to her present misery in traveling forward fell in among a gang of highwaymen who at first appeared not a little surpised at their meeting with a lady of so majestic an air and in so magnificent an attire in so solitary a place notwithstanding which they stripped her to her very peticoat but a contest arising betwixt them about the sharing of the rich jewels they had taken from her whilst they were preparing to fight for the booty she laid hold of this favorable opportunity to make her escape so taking her son in her arms she run notwithstanding this burden which love rendered light to her into an adjacent wood here wandering about till all her strength failed her she was forced to lay down upon the ground it is in this place my dear child said she to the prince bathing him with her tears and squeezing him betwixt her arms it is here the queen of england and the heir to the crown must end their lives she had scarce spoken these words when one of the highwaymen passing by the place alone where this princess uttered her lamentations she took courage and told him take my friend ake this child said she presenting to him the rince save the kings son this man touched with compassion and respect received with much satisfaction this dear pledge from this princesses hands who being supported by him made shift to get to a river where she embarked aboard a vessel which carried her to luyce from whence she went to bruges leaving her son behind her in that place for fear he should not be able to undergo the fatigues of a long journey she intended to take to solicit fresh succors of men and money as for the unfortunate king henry he retreated into a remote place of wales but finding he could not time enough reassemble his friends and broken forces went away in disguise but was immediately after discovered taken and carried to london king edward shut him up in the tower where he endured a long captivity  the earl of warwick having left the command of the army to his brother to disperse the broken remnants of the enemys forces upon his return to court could not reap the full fruits of his victories by reason of his passion for the countess of devonshire though king edward received him with a thousand demonstrations of friendship and esteem and bestowed uncommon praises upon his conduct and bravery the countess of devonshire her self taking no small share in his glory and safe return was not averse in her self of seeing him but there being certain impossibilities which made the earl languish to a very high degree he wrote such engaging letters to this lovely lady as served to remove all further indifferency from her heart  thus matters stood when the king going to a hunting match in oxfordshire happened to pass by so near a certain country seat then inhabited by the duchess dowager of the late duke of bedford regent in france under henry ivth king of england his uncle that he had a curiosity of paying a visit to her the name of this lady was jacueline of luxenburgh eldest daughter to peter of luxenburgh count of s pol who notwithstanding the great luster of her family had bin by the irresistible power of love constrained to condescend to the marrying of a private gentleman named richard rivers and that at a time when the most illustrious families both in france and england sought for her alliance she had by this gentleman several children and among the rest elizabeth rivers a ladv endowd with all the advantages of mind and body that render a person of her age most accomplished her parents being not masters of an estate sufficient to make her appear at court married her to one mr john gray a person no wise superior to her self and of an indifferent estate but being naturally inclined to jealousy constantly lived at his own country house and when he was obliged to be at his post in the army used to leave his wife with the duchess of bedford he happening to be slain in an engagement whilst she was yet very young she continued with her mother so that this family enjoyd the innocent pleasures of the country in a most perfect union though her present station appeared very different from that high rank the duchess of bedford was once placed in in the world for besides her lords and her own estate she had a yearly pension of   0000 crowns a prodigious sum in those days  the king had taken a fancy to hunt in one of the fittest days for that purpose the air being gloomy no wind stirring and without being incommoded by the dust or heat he was then attended only by the duke of gloucester his brother and the earl of warwick the rest being left in an adjacent wood to expect his return thither madam gray happened to be walking in a long walk with thomas and richard her two sons in each of her hands being both so young and beautiful that they resembled the amors that are said to be of venus her attendance she was in a plain but very neat dress and her person appeared all over extremely engaging having never seen the king nor any of those that were along with him the first thing she did was to pull a large vail over her face after which she saluted them but without stopping in the least or casting so much as one look at them the king equally taken with her modesty and beauty notwithstanding he knew her no more than she did him alighted and accosted her with that polite and noble air which distinguishes those that are masters of it from the common rank of men after having saluted her he asked with a gallant air whether being alone she feared not some paris or other should act over again his part with the fair helen she told him that these adventures were suitable only to the age of homer and that in this solitary place they had neither a paris nor a helen the longer the king heard her speak the more he delighted in hearing her and asking after the duchess of bedford understood beyond expectation that madam gray was her daughter  as they came nearer to the house the duchess who looked out of a window of her closet was not a little surprised to see her daughter betwixt the king the duke of gloucester and the earl of warwick she went out to meet them and to pay her respects to the young king which madam gray perceiving was under no small confusion considering she had not paid him the respect due to his person he who took notice of every thing she did soon guessing at her thoughts told her a thousand engaging and gallant things upon that head and that with so much vivacity of wit that she never had met with any thing comparable to it in all her life but this so agreeable a conversation lasted not long the king turning on a sudden very pensive in spite of all his endeavors against it however he took up the two young sons of the young window and bestowed his carasses upon them whilst his looks were very attentively fixed upon the mother the earl of warwick not so much prepossessed as the king talked with the duchess of bedford and at the same time took particular notice of his growing passion he conjured the two ladies to come to london i assure you said he to the duchess of bedford that the duchess of york will be overjoyed to see you again you having passed the best of your days together it is but reasonable you should both recall those times to your memory and that now i am king i may do that for your children that i was not in a condition to do whilst i was yet earl of march madam bedford and gray returned their thanks with all the marks of acknowledgments and the king fearing lest notice might be taken of the satisfaction he took in the company of these ladies he took leave though with much reluctance but could not forbear to speak a thousand times of the fair widow as an entire piece of perfection  some few days after he told the earl of warwick she had made so lively an impression upon him that he could not live unless he saw her again and yet he feared to displease her if he should come thither again so soon desiring him therefore to consider of some way or other to bring them to court the earl who had a very piercing wit told the king that the whole family having no considerable estate the only way would be to bestow some preferments upon the father and brother of madam gray and a pension upon her children to be bred at court and a place upon the duchess of bedford under the duchess of york and that madam gray engaged by all these favors done to her family would easily quit her solitude to enjoy the pleasures of the world the king relishing the earls advice in a little time heaped favors upon favors upon that family the duchess of bedford with her husband and children came to london but the young widow who was the person most desired there remained in the country the king vexed to the heart at her absence went on purpose to fetch her he made her a thousand reproaches on account of her indifferency but at the same time omitted nothing that might engage her to come to court you are too dangerous sir said she to him with a gay and most charming air hitherto my virtue was never put to the trial living alone at my own home at the bottom of a village intent upon nothing but how to please my husband and to lament his loss i have seen nothing hitherto that gave me the least occasion of fear but i am very sensible sir should i see you often i should have great occasion to dread you i am also no less sensible that my virtue will never stoop so low as to be your mistress and that my fortune is not exalted enough to aspire to a throne i disclose continued she to your majesty at once what another perhaps would not have told you till after some years but i shall at least have this satisfaction not to give you any cause of vexation by entertaining you with vain hopes  the king who was not used to be so frankly dealt withal having paused a little upon the matter told her she might expect every thing from her deserts that he could never be happy without her that he would give his promise to marry her but that it must be kept secret and not to be disclosed upon any account whatever since he had as yet many enemies who would not fail to improve his marriage with her to his disadvantage that therefore he conjured her to put confidence in the word of a prince who adored her and that unless she came to london he was resolved to find her out every day in the country the lady looked upon this condescension in the king  not rejecting her proposition of engaging in so unequal a match as so signal a favor that she had no longer power to refuse to come to court where she came to live with the duchess of bedford her mother the several visits the king had made to this fair widow the satisfaction he expressed at her coming to london together with the care he took in fitting up her lodgings occasioned an extreme jealousy in mrs elizabeth lucy on the other hand madam gray who had no less her own interest in view judged it very requisite to engage the earl of warwick on her side which she effected by giving him peculiar marks of her esteem and confidence in him such as she was sensible he could do no otherwise than repay with acknowledgment she conjured him to cultivate for ever a strict friendship with her and to give her some insight concerning those persons she ought to fear most  the earl overjoyed at this proposition represented to her the countess of devonshire as the person for whom the king had the most passionate inclination he desired her to keep this as an absolute secret promising to advertise her from time to time of whatever was likely to impair her interest so that as often as he observed in the king some relapses of his tenderness for this countess he gave notice thereof either by word of mouth or by letters to madam gray who made use of tears and sometimes of threats that she would retire into the country all this was done so seasonably that the king took all imaginable care to conceal from her the frailty of his heart though at the same time he let slip no opportunity of obliging the countess of devonshire he would write to her by the assistance of albine sometimes in the language of a lover sometimes of a sovereign master but always like a king full of passion but the deserts of my lord of warwick had made so lively an impression upon her heart that in spire of all her endeavors to banish him thence he was always there present this being the only thing she now took any satisfaction in and all the rest proving indifferent to her she would not take the trouble of dressing herself nay she would blame her self to appear in any set dress since it was not done to please him neither was there any conversation she so much delighted in as in that of albine because it was to her alone she could speak concerning the person she had already loved too much for the tranquillity of her life  the countess of anglesey who narrowly observed all the actions of her daughter did not impart to any body living the surprise she was in to find so strange an alteration in her daughter but resolved to discourse her upon that point believing that considering her tender age and most excellent education she would not fail to make an ingenuous confession so without insisting upon any further preliminaries in the matter she took her daughter one day into the garden at an hour when it was yet too hot to take much diversion in walking for any considerable time and leaning upon her went into the grotto under pretense of being scorched by the heat of the sun and of having a mind to rest a little there but in effect to talk to her in that place with the more freedom it is impossible for me said my lady anglesey as soon as they were seated to see you any longer in the condition you are in without asking the reason of it i dont do this out of curiosity or severity to make you stand in awe of me no my dear daughter my intention is not either to chide or to reproach you it is an easy matter for one of your age to commit a fault that is perhaps not well understood i aim at nothing else than to provide you with arms to encounter it i would be acquainted with your pain with an intention to ease it believe me daughter that in laying open your heart to me you run not the least hazard but in shutting it up against me you are in great danger give me entrance there and be not afraid lest if i should meet there with a stranger i little look for it should either surprise or raise me into a passion i will mingle my tears with yours i will be to you instead of a shield to protect you against the most dangerous darts of an enemy whom perhaps you alone are too weak to resist  whilst she was a talking the young countess was ruminating what answer to give her and what was best to be done in so pressing a case as this she knew very well her mother to be a woman of great sense and penetration she knew her to be aughty positive in her opinion and one who would not be removed from what she had once conceived to be true let her say what she would but to sacrifice the earl of warwick was such an affliction her heart could not in the least consent to since this confession must for ever rob her of the pleasures of seeing him after all her mothers discourse drawing to a conclusion an answer must be given unless she would make her self appear guilty by her silence she took immediately a resolution what to do and throwing herself at her mothers feet madam said she to her i own my self guilty of a great crime in not having immediately revealed to you a thing wherein i ought to have had recourse to your conduct it is that alone i blame my self for being for the rest sufficiently proof against any impressions contrary to my duty i will then confess to you in all sincerity that which puts me into so melancholy a humor of late is that i am so closepursued by the king you will discover in this letter his sentiments for me and mine for his person you will be sensible of his design of noising the matter abroad i tremble at the misfortune of my father and husband i lived in hopes to tire him out by my rigorous proceedings without provoking his anger but madam see see how angry he is with these words she put the kings last letter into her mothers hands which was delivered to her by albine who having perused it burst out into tears for joy and embracing her daughter my dear child said she to her dont fear any man living we are too happy in so virtuous a daughter how few are there that would not be puffed up with the passion of son amiable a king but how dangerous it is to trust him you see his unfaithfulness to the fair elizabeth lucy and the lovely madam gray both which he loved so passionately being charmed with their beauties rest satisfied that you would not be in a condition to fix him as well they because they have much more cunning and understand the affairs of the world much better than you let let the king alone though at the peril of all our lives the good mother spoke these words with a great deal of passion and affording a free course to her tears the young countess could not refrain to do the same she remained all this while at her feet and were laying over the matter with a great deal of vehemence when the earls of anglesey and devonshire entered the grotto  they were surprised to find them in this posture the countess of anglesey perceived it and judging rightly that nothing could prove more prejudicial to her daughter than if the earl of devonshire should get it into his head that she had bin reprimanding her daughter concerning her ill conduct especially since she knew him to have conceived some jealousy already at the accidental meeting of her daughter with the king in the forest and that he had told some hard and reflecting words to her upon that account she desired the earls of angiesey and devonshire to give attention to what she was a going to discover to them you will i dont doubt continued she commend the countess of devonshire for her firmness and sincerity look here upon this letter from the king she communicated to me full of threats in case she continues to treat him with indifferency the earl of devonshire took the letter a color rising in his face which sufficiently discovered his uneasiness and being well acquainted with the character of his master had the satisfaction of being an eye witness of his complaints he told my lady anglesey he never questioned his wives conduct knowing the sincerity and good inclinations of her heart and that it was an action worthy herself to prefer her duty to all the airy ideas of greatness the earl of anglesey on his side was not able to express his satisfaction the young countess said little but at that juncture secretly blamed herself for not sacrificing the earl of warwick in the same manner as she had done the king  their conversation being over she retired into her apartment to tell albine every thing that happened she failed not to give immediate notice thereof to the earl of warwick who judged not without great reason that the countess and her family would now not stay longer in london since every thing would appear suspicious there and that he must prepare for a most cruel separation what he had foreseen came soon to pass the earl of devonshire told his fatherinlaw that since the king would not be easily repulsed the best means to make him to think no more of the countess would be to let her mother carry her along with her to twittenham and his advice being fully approved by the earl of anglesey every thing necessary for their departure was got ready with great secrecy in the mean while the king continuing to labor under no small uneasiness would fain have visited my lady devonshire nor would he have delayed the matter had it not bin on account of madam gray for whom his passion gathered new strength every day and the earl of warwick left nothing undone on his side to persuade the king that nothing could be more beautiful nor more fit to be beloved than her every word of hers he represented to the utmost advantage and made the nicest remarks upon what she never said nay what she perhaps never thought of  the countess of devonshire being told by her mother that they intended to carry her into the country was most sensibly afflicted at this piece of news she disclosed her pain to albine but forbid her at the same time to let the earl of warwick know of it but the treacherous old governess having but little regard to her mistresses orders not only discovered the matter to him but also gave him to understand that her mistress would not be able to bid him farewell unless some unforeseen opportunity should offer it self the earl was ready to run distracted at this piece of news and walking very fast up and down the room when the general came in abruptly looking very heavy and melancholy ah my lord said he i have heard something that much disturbs my mind my lady devonshire is to go along with my lady anglesey to twittenham i have it under her own hand but what is worst of all is that there is a suspicion of an interview betwixt us so that being the occasion of her lords jealousy and of the severity of her mother i am resolved to see her no more what a change of fortune is this for a man who was so very happy but lately i compassionate you replied the earl but after all you are fully assured of being beloved that is but a slender comfort replied the general perhaps it will not be long before she returns said the earl and imagine how acceptable that will prove to you rather imagine cried he what i am to suffer during her absence i am to see her to morrow to take my leave of her and this faithful limner has bin forced to take a great deal of pains to procure me that happy moment the earl congratulated him and his head being too full to permit him to detain the general by insignificant questions he only told him that he was as much concerned at this mishap as if it were his own and that he hoped that he would do him so much justice as to believe that he was as sensibly touched with it as himself cold be  so soon as he was at liberty he made use of all his wit and charms which he knew how to make appear in their utmost luster when he resolved to do it to persuade the countess that if she departed without permitting him to see her he should infallibly die of grief she being most sensibly touched with the tender and submissive expressions of this letter would perhaps have bin inclinable enough to afford him this favor but knew not how to hazard a thing of that consequence in a house which then contained so numerous a family she consulted about the matter the same evening with albine the old governess had scarce patience enough to hear the countess putting her in mind of the jealousy and courage of the earl of devonshire and that in case the earl of warwick should be discovered he would be but scurvily used albine i say having a greater share of avarice than prudence replied let the worst come to the worst the earl might pretend he was sent thither by the king and so he need not fear any ill usage since that would be the way to provoke the king to the highest degree the countess did not give her consent without a great deal of reluctance having observed for several days last past that they were more jealous of her than formerly and knowing that upon the least suspicion the whole family would take the alarm but how easy is it to overcome a young woman prepossessed in the favor of him she likes albine promised to remove all obstacles adding that the earl of warwick would infallibly die for grief if he should be made sensible of her positiveness in this point and there needed no more to convince the countess that she might see him without much danger  you will easily imagine he would not miss the assignation for though that was to be late at night he failed not to rise very early in the morning and such was his impatience that he thought the day would never be at an end what did not he say to the sun every thing a lover was capable of in his amorous frenzies he called night a thousand times to his aid and no sooner had the sky covered it self with its black vail but wrapped up in a cloak and attended only by his faithful berincour he comes to the little garden gate not questioning but that his new key which he had never tried before would open it without trouble but all this care and pains proved fruitless for the key broke in the lock what was now to be done after such a mishap nothing else but to get over the wall or else to return from whence he came but as he would rather have chosen to die in attempting the first than to free himself from all danger by the last so without hesitating upon the matter he clambred up to the top as he had done once before and was just upon the point of leaping into the garden when he saw abundance of people with flambeaux who appeared as if they were searching after something in effect my lady anglesey having lost the pourtraiture of the duchess of york she constantly wore on her arm had not perceived it till after it was dark and having caused but in vain to search all the apartments she ordered all the walks of the garden to be narrowly viewed for fear the weight of the gold and diamonds might make it sink into the sand  as all the domestics were not equally intent upon the matter some who happened to look upwards perceived the earl of warwick just ready to leap into the garden and not doubting but that he was a thief cried out as fast as they could the earl seeing there was no better way to choose than to retire in all haste but his gentleman being at some distance as not imagining he would return so soon he was forced to get down without his assistance so that by a fall he wounded his arm in so much that he thought it had bin broken but though it proved excessive painful he made all the haste he could to get away from that fatal place where he had flattred himself to get sight of his so dearly beloved lady he walked very fast and sometimes looking behind him would ask his gentleman whether they were pursued by any body this being overheard by a certain person that passed by accidentally and he believing them to be thieves gave notice thereof to the watch who fell upon and surrounded them before they could make use of their swords to defend themselves the leader of the watch being a brutish fellow and drunk asked the earl who he was from whence he came and where he intended to go it was thought fit to return him no answer partly out of disdain partly out of necessity not to make a noise they being as yet but at a little distance from the garden and they supposed as actually it happened that the earls of anglesey and devonshire knew by this time there had bin some body seen upon the wall besides some going to take a view of the little gate of the garden and finding a key broken within the lock this caused no small uneasiness in the family and the matter being canvassd over and over the earl of devonshire discovered somewhat of a secret jealousy the poor countess saw her projects vanish into smoke and the necessity of departing rendered her almost inconsolable besides she durst not discover her trouble so that though she concealed it as much as she could yet there appeared in her eyes a certain emotion which might easily have bin observed  but to return to the earl of warwick who finding himself surrounded by the watch thought it his best way to get rid of them by bestowing a good handful of money upon the leader not questioning but that so he might be dismissed without being put to the trouble of discovering his name he had filled his pockets with gold pieces he intended for albine but missing of her offered them to the leader of the watch but his profusedness proved mischievous to him for this man now judging they had committed some great robbery and perceiving him to be wounded in the arm and to be very careful in hiding his face was resolved to detain him it being a custom here to stop and keep in custody all such as will not discover themselves if they are met by the watch in the night time there are certain benches fastened on every corner of london streets to the walls of the houses whereon such as are taken upon suspicion are to sit with their legs put through certain holes made in two boards fitted and joined one above the other a diversion not very well agreeing with those who are used to more convenient seats the earl perceiving what quarters were prepared for him once more took the head of the watch aside and told him that if he would not put him into that place but let him go he would entrust him with his name and that he was the earl of warwick upon this the head officer who did not take notice of his garter nor of the embroidered star the knights of that order always wear upon their coats not doubting but that he was an imposture go said he did not i suspect thee before to be a rogue thy impudence to assume the name of so great a man fully convinces me of it and so without harkening any further to his discourse he put his legs into the stocks with a resolution to carry both him and his gentleman to my lord warwick as soon as it should be daylight  i give you leave to guess at the confusion he was in upon so odd an accident did ever since the beginning of the world said he to berincour happen any adventure like this i would be tolerably well contented had i but taken my leave of the countess but now am so unfortunate as not to be able to see her before she is carried into the country besides that the wound i have in my arm will require some time to be cured so that all the unlucky accidents seems now to center in mine i defy thee capricious fortune cried he to treat me worse than thou have done however after some short reflections added he who is it in all england that would not choose to be in my place and be at this very time where i am now seated upon a bench at the corner of a street with my legs put through so many holes and locked close within the boards and this is the station those who would wish themselves in my place must be in in spite of themselves for i can assure you i am here contrary to my inclinations my lord said his gentleman this will be over by daylight and he that could be my lord warwick upon this condition would have no ill bargain of it for the remainder of his life i know not what you may think of it said he as for my part i would rather choose to be a porter for he works all day and at night relishes the pleasures of a sweet tranquillity more than a general after the gaining of a battle he has no master and consequently is under no constraint of pleasing him has he a mistress he goes to see her without control he enjoys health and is never without a good appetite if his wifes obstroperous he beats her into good manners he dreads neither the great ones nor the thieves his fortune is always in the same station his prince knows not whether there be such a man upon earth and that place is the best to him where he can live best now what comparison is there betwixt such a man and a courtier such as i am such as you are my lord cried berincour was ever a man born under a more fortunate planet the king stands indebted to you for his crown and all what he can do for you is below what you have done for him i am nevertheless to be pitied at this time replied the earl and i cannot but admire the capriciousness of fortune it seems to me as if caprice and chance play against one another for us mortals and that they decide our fate at their own pleasure they were thus talking together to divert their spleen when they heard not far from thence some body cry out murder watch help the watch gang being not far off run immediately that way and in a moment after brought hither a man who appeared to be very refractory  the earl and his gentleman not being over curious to see him turned away their faces because they were unwilling to be seen themselves but the head of the watch who brought him along told him laughing you will have no reason to be dissatisfied with your company general talbot for here is the earl of warwick and another lord who will be glad of your conversation so you may discourse together of the court till day break when i shall have the honor of seeing you again at these words he locked his legs into the stocks and took his leave of the three prisoners  whoever thou art said the earl of warwick to him that have occasion to try the same fate with mine pray tell me how did thou fancy to get out of the hands of these myrmidons by telling them you were the general talbot and thou who art so curious and importunate returns he what makes thee ask so unseasonable a question since thou had confidence enough thy self to assume the name of the earl of warwick the earl was so well pleased with this answer that he could not refrain from laughing and his laughter having something in it that was peculiar and easy to be distinguished i now am sensible continued the person that spoke before why thou did make use of his name because thou laughest very like him thou art in the right on it said my lord warwick i have bin often flattered that i was like him and at a pinch one lays hold of every thing but continued he though thou did act by the same motives as i did pray tell me what made thee imagine thou could get off by taking upon thee the name of general talbot because there was not the least probability in this pretense i made use of the first name that came into my head replied the other i am sorry said the earl you did not pitch upon that of the earl of warwick as well as my self that we might have seen who had the best title to it the other prisoner made no further answer and the earl only said with a low voice to his gentleman that when the watch came by the next time they would try once more whether they could get out of this troublesome place  whilst they were discoursing together their brotherinaffection who having bin overheated and now had had time enough to cool himself began to cough most violently the earl heard him not without some surprise if i have the laughter of the earl of warwick said he i am sure thou have general talbots cough do thou know him well enough to be a judge of that replied the man with the cough no man that has bin a soldier can be mistaken in that point said the earl they were thus talking together when the watch passing by they called to them to desire to be conducted to their respective places of abode you are a company of rogues said their leader you are likely to stay here till daylight but fearing lest something should be defective in the lock of the boards wherein their legs were enclosed he viewed it narrowly with his lanthorn at this instant the prisoners casting their eyes about knew one another to their utmost surprise on both sides  the watch being gone they both gave a great cry at the same time and taking each other by the hand how is it you how is it you said they what happened to me added the general is past all belief were we alone i would ease my self in telling you my adventure you may rest assured said the earl that the third person here is both deaf and dumb when ever i think fit and that is enough to secure you against any thing from him i am so impatient to relate it to you replied the general that upon your word i am a going to tell you the whole story  you are not unacquainted with that passion i have bin entangled in for some time passed i i say who had kept my self free from it all my life time before i was not sensible of the effects it would produce in my heart and consequently so little feared the consequences thereof that i cherished it as my greatest happiness it is true the obstacles i met with to see the countess of devonshire appeared to me so full of difficulty and trouble that i was resolved to cure and despise my frailty but this unfortunate painter having in some measure dived into my true sentiments and found by experience that a person of my temper was the fittest object of increasing his fortune came to me to facilitate as he said every thing for an interview betwixt the countess and my self i accepted his offer and it was agreed he should come in a coach to my backgate i went into it without any attendance being ashamed my domestics should have the least suspicion of my extravagancy he conducted me into a beautiful garden and thence into a grotto where i saw the countess of devonshire so full of tenderness frankness and modesty that being seized with the most profound respect for her person i thought my self only too happy she would afford me no other favors than the satisfaction of seeing and sighing for her and i insisted upon no more for i despise all women that suffer themselves to be withdrawn from their duty and not withstanding that height of passion i had conceived for her i should have shown nothing but aversion to her it having at all times bin my opinion that virtue and modesty are the essential parts of a good woman she questionless had bin acquainted with my temper and therefore always kept herself within such strict bounds that she would never allow me the liberty of touching as much as her hand unless when i put some rings with precious stones upon her fingers when i spoke to my limner concerning her reservedness he told me in his country the ladies were much more cruel and to speak of an italian woman and of a tiger was the same thing i was not good natured enough to be like him but gave him the hearing but to be short my lord you know i told you this morning that i was to take my leave of her to night accordingly i went to the grotto attended by by my old guide where i found the countess but in a moment after saw come in an ancient man followed by four lusty young men well armed the father without taking any notice of me turning to his daughter unfortunate woman said he what could engage thee to dishonor our family by thy ill conduct art not thou treated both by thy mother and my self with all the tenderness thou could expect under thy circumstances thy life shall pay for the shame thou have made us undergo with this drawing his dagger gave her a stab before i could put it by though i had my sword drawn but i wounded one of the young fellows who assaulted me i saw my self immediately surrounded by the father and the other three so that i found my self engaged at great odds and for whom i give you leave to guess to wit for an inconsiderable jilt who so nearly resembled the countess of devonshire that to find out the real difference betwixt them one must be undeceived in the same manner as i was i thought it therefore my best way to think of retreating and i cannot tell whether they knew me or not but certain it is they were not very pressing upon me to hinder my retreat thus i had come off well enough had it not bin for two old women who being brought thither by the noise pursued me so closely with their outcries that the watch heard it i happened to meet them at the corner of a street which i crossed with much haste though i knew not where i was for my roguish italian who stood centry for me was run away and in all probability will never appear no more in london after the game he has played me but be that as it will i soon saw my self beset on all sides by the watch and having not much time to consider how to answer those questions they commonly put to those they meet in the night time i thought it the shortest way to be plain with them i am such a one what a cry did they not set up at my name i know the time when to ingratiate themselves with general talbot they would almost press me to death and you may now see that in the place where i am they have almost done so in good earnest  the earl would have bin much more surpised than now he was at this recital had he not known beforehand that this woman being a supposititious countess of devonshire the unravelling of this intrigue was not likely to happen without noise so that being actually prepared against any surprise he pretended nevertheless he was and acted his part to the greatest nicety if you will follow my advice said he i would have you endeavor to cure your self of a passion which has served hitherto only to torment you and to impair that great character unto which you were born it is certain said the general i was not made for these sorts of amusements i am so much ashamed of it that should any body else but your self my lord be acquainted with my frailties i should not be able to endure it you may therefore believe that i shall not seek to nourish those flames i so much despise as good fortune will have it the true countess is a going into the country i am sure i will not go to meet her by the way and it shall not be my fault if ever i see her again but continued he what chance drew you into this ambush i need not tell you replied the earl you may be sure it was an assignation well at least added the general i hope you saw the party you looked for no said he and am besides that much wounded in the arm so we have both sufficient cause of dissatisfaction replied the general but i wish i was so far a conjurer as to guess at the subject and to tell in what place we now are as to what relates to my self replied the earl there needs no conjurer who deals with hell or the devil it is known to every body long ago that i am much addicted to adventures dont you remember what happened to the king and my self whilst he was yet earl of march one sweet night above all the rest being taken up by the watch we were forced to tell our names but they had too much ill nature to believe us so they would needs carry us to the very lodgings of the duchess of york who though she was asleep these beasts would needs speak with her here madam said they take your son and keep him at home for if we meet him again we shall not bring him hither i remember the thing said the general and know this is not your noviate though i confess it is altogether a novelty to me and should be sorry to the heart if a burlesque account should be given of a thing which is sufficiently ridiculous in it self and in which i have bin engaged in good earnest let this matter happen as it will said the earl it will do you no harm  whilst they were thus talking the time away daylight began to disperce the darkness of the night and this increasing their impatience of seeing themselves relieved from so ill a post they were ready to break their legs in trying how to get them out the watch happened to come just in the nick of time under the same leader but attended by another set of watchmen being upon the point of parting among these there happened to be two who knowing both the general and the earl very well were ready to drop down for fear having scarce strength enough left to let the head of the watch know the fault he had committed the fellow turned pale like one that had received sentence of death and threw himself at their feet the two earls seeing him almost desperate told him he should be satisfied and take care to open the lock of the boards that kept in their legs and that without any loss of time the poor fellow was so much frightened that he neither understood them nor remembered what he had done with the key at last it was found and that in the very nick of time since otherwise they had bin caught in that place by the earl of devonshire  this lord more disturbed by his jealousy than eased by sleep had not bin in bed all that night under pretense of giving the necessary orders for their journey thus he passed the greatest part of the night in a very ill humor and raised his motherinlaw and wife so early out of their beds that they passed through the same street where the general and the earl had had their quarters within a few minutes after they were dismissed the head of the watch was still sitting upon the same bench tearing his hair like a madman the countess of anglesey compassionating his condition stopped the coach and called to him but he refusing to come near them she desired the earl of devonshire who was on horseback along with them to speak to him since she thought she knew him for he kept the watch not far from their house having a little recovered himself he related to the earl of devonshire what misfortune had befallen him saying he lookd upon himself as lost for ever and that he was resolved to go out of england the earl could not give credit to so strange an adventure and what rendered it quite incredible to him was that general talbot was mentioned in it whom he believed to be much wiser than to ramble in the streets in the night with the earl of warwick so that he looked upon the fellow as frenzical he told his opinion to the countess of anglesey who thought the same but the young countess of devonshire knew too well how the matter lay her grief increased to a high degree when she understood what had happened to the earl and especially his being wounded in the arm she endeavored but in vain to conceal it but you might have read in her eyes the secret thoughts of her heart her mother asked her what was the matter she told her she was very ill and she being supposed to be then with child there was no further enquiry made at that time  the earl of warwick had much ado to get home his legs were much crampt and his arm full of pain but his worst distemper lay in the head and mind he much feared that some of the watchmen would talk of this accident and that thus the whole mystery might be unfolded which it was his utmost interest to keep concealed the general talbot had a thousand chimeras to struggle withal and being resolved not to make any one the confident of his troubles he kept the whole closed up within his own breast however he saw himself freed from the fetters of the countess and this passion had bin sufficiently tormenting to him not to relish the sweet of this new tranquillity in the mean while the earl of warwick took the departure of the countess of devonshire so far to heart that he was forced to keep his bed but what proved a great addition to his grief was that putting his hand into his pocket to feel for a jewel he had he found it not he guessed he must either have lost it or else it was stolen out of his pocket but however it happened he was almost desperate about it he ordered berincour to leave no stone unturned to find it out and in the mean while continued to be almost beyond himself  the king was no sooner risen but he asked for the earl of warwick so they went to fetch him but being told he had a fever the king who loved him extremely was not long before he gave him a visit in his lodgings he had already bin informed of the departure of the countess of devonshire by albine whereat being most sensibly afflicted he wanted to talk with the earl about it at last said he they have carried away the countess i am surpised at my self i should relent her loss after the usage i have received from her and therefore am apt to believe it is not her person so much as the satisfaction of revenging my self which i regret at present forget her sir said the earl in a languishing tone she is unworthy of your tenderness and i am sensible she will be sufficiently punished in the country for her inconstancy in london that does not satisfy me added the king i will know what it was that made her use me at that rate you had better stay for her return replied the earl your majesty knows then what to do best this delay not suiting the kings impatient temper and anger he was sometimes for making her to come back again in a moment after for going to see her and after all he was for sending his favorite thither but soon changing his mind again he was struggling with these different thoughts for several days madam gray was not insensible of this distraction of his mind and she was sufficiently inclined to make her complaints to him but was afraid of checking the kings passion and that being used to see her in tears so often he might not regard them for the future she was of opinion that nothing could be of more dangerous consequence to a mistress and that an unfaithful lover who takes care to conceal his infidelity is more likely to return to his former passion than one who quite breaks off upon that score besides that the earl who had all along animated her anger was not now so pressing upon that point for he feared no more the kings progress in this passion since the departure of my lady devonshire and now employed all his care in settling his own  what disturbances did he not meet with in his heart when he considered she was not to come back in a considerable time and that there was not the least opportunity of seeing her but what must prove very dangerous as well to her as to himself and that they must fear every thing from the countess of anglesey whose strict virtue could not permit her to dispense with the most insignificant frailty in so dear and beautiful a daughter he would often shut himself up in his closet to abandon himself entirely to thee melancholy refections his grief increased every day albine writ to him no more he was for trying every thing to see the countess or at least to send to her his gentleman whom he knew to want neither courage nor conduct but his fear of meeting with some sinister accident stopped his designs and betwixt these various irresolutions his evil rather increased than decreased  after the earl of devonshire had left the headwatchman before mentiond he traveled immediately forward to a wood through which they must pass to twittenham here alighting from his horse he gave it to a little page that attended him whilst he walked along the great road with a slow pace ruminating upon the thief that had bin seen upon the wall the broken key in the little gardengate and at last upon the fancy of the headwatchman who believed he had taken up the earls of warwick and sop if he had mentioned only the first said he i would not in the least question it but the last of these two has more wit than to be caught in so odd an adventure as he was frequently looking about to see whether his motherinlaws coach followed him he observed something that cast a more than ordinary luster in his pages hands drawing nearer to him he saw it was a large jewel of gold set all over with precious stones a piece he had often seen in the earl of warwicks hands he inquired not without some disturbance from the page where he had it he told him frankly that he being one of the first who got into the street after the thief had bin seen upon the wall the luster of this piece made of gold and covered with diamonds had made him look that way and perceiving what it was he thought he might take and keep it the earl took it and looking upon it for a considerable time it at last seemed to him of that thickness as to contain a double bottom he tried to open it with a sort of uneasiness whereof he already began to suspect the cause and being gone at some distance from the page at last opened and found enclosed within it the picture of his lady with these words engraven round about it she is much better in my heart  at this fatal sight he turned pale he shivered his soul was exposed a prey to the most cruel reflections that could be he loved my lady devonshire he was sometimes inclined to justify her but could not accomplish it for said he the master of this jewel must doubtless be the same person who having got a key to the littlegate of the garden was endeavoring to open it but finding it broken in the lock scaladed the wall and afterward run away and the jewel more than sufficiently shows it must be the earl of warwick what could he think after so many convincing proofs especially since the picture of his lady fell into his hands by so extraordinary an accident he was a going to abandon himself quite to despair when hearing the noise of my lady angleseys coach he remounted his horse and spoke only a few words as they passed by him being resolved to hide his grief till he had discoursed her about the matter the little page vexed to the heart that his master had kept the jewel could not forbear to speak of it to albine whose kinsman he was and he extolled to such a degree the value thereof that the old covetous governess was heartily vexed thereat since she would fain have bin mistress of it her self let the consequences have proved never so dangerous so soon as she had an opportunity of speaking to her mistress she told her of this unfortunate accident and never were so many prevailing circumstances joined together to discover any man as there were here against the earl of warwick am i not to be pitied said she to albine that my compliance with thy advice should cost me all the tranquillity of my life what was it that moved me to consent that the earl should take his leave of me heavens are my witness that notwithstanding my inclinations for him i would not save his life by one criminal sigh and ever since that fatal moment when i saw him first i have left nothing unattempted to put him out of my mind but finding my self not in a condition to encompass that i have always stood upon my guard to observe my self being sensible that my heart was only too much inclined to him albine what have thou done when thou did persuade me to entertain him this so charming and at the same time so dangerous sight made such an impression upon my soul as increased all my pains i suffered before upon his account was not i unfortunate enough unless you had taken so much pains to speak to me concerning him why did thou find out an opportunity to bring him into the house his jewel being now in my husbands hands is there any room for him to doubt but that what the headwatchman told him is actually true he will for the future look upon me only with scorn and the secret reproaches i shall load my self withal will serve only to make him discover the confusion i am in you must not madam said albine to her torment your self at that rate it will be no hard task for you to persuade your whole family that if the earl had attempted to come into the garden it must be by the kings command and without the least knowledge of yours and that the ingenious confession you have made concerning his majestys sentiments ought to be a convincing proof that you had not the least share in all that had happened no cried the countess i cannot maintain a lie with the same confidence as i did the truth my mother will read in my eyes all what is within me alas could she as well discover there my innocence and misfortunes what is it i need then to fear whilst the young countess was thus afflicting her self the earl of devonshire full of impatience to impart the secret to my lord and my lady anglesey took them into a remote walk and having discovered to them what real cause of suspicion he had of his wife he showed them her picture within the jewel of the earl of warwick the sight thereof overwhelmed them with grief they found it very difficult to speak in her justification but after all my lady anglesey could not resolve to condemn her without being heard so she desired her soninlaw not to take the least notice of it to her till she had discoursed the point with her which was to be done the next following day  my lady devonshire soon perceived that when my lady anglesey locked her self up with her in a room this was the time she was to undergo the trial of a most severe inquisition she trembled and the paleness of her face was an undeniable token of her disturbed thoughts after having patiently endured a thousand reproaches without in the least interrupting the countess when she saw her picture within the jewel she could no longer hear with patience her mother upbraiding her with having presented it to the earl she fell out into such a passion and spoke upon that head with so much vehemence though without losing the respect due to her mother that she began to be fully convinced of her innocence my lady anglesey now fully satisfied of the truth of what her daughter had told her promised to omit nothing that might conduce to make the earl of devonshire to have a favorable opinion of her the countess begged with tears in her eyes to do her what service she could with her lord she was several times in a mind to desire the favor of her to dismiss albine but fearing lest this malicious old creature might still more exasperate the earl of devonshire against her by putting into his head certain malicious constructions concerning her easiness in consenting to an interview with him during her fathers and husbands journey to york and consequently make the breach wider this proved the only motive that made her keep near her a monster which could not be kept at too great a distance  my lady angelsey not only urged the matter home and with extraodinary strength of reason to her sonin law but also engaged her word for his wives innocence all the fault being laid upon the king and it was true in effect that my lady devonshire knew nothing of the mystery of this jewelcase and that no body could have showed more dissatisfaction than she did at the earl of warwick upon that point for she would often say to albine what must the limner think who drew this picture he will certainly believe this favor was obtained with my consent o unfortunate i cried she what was i a doing when i had so much complaisance as to hearken to the earl how dearly am i likely to pay for it i shall lose my husbands esteem he will from hence forward be always inclined to jealousy which all my precaution and good conduct will not be able to remove oh what signifies it to you madam if he is jealous said albine provided you have nothing wherewith to reproach your self if you have committed an error in something or other you may give a free course to your tears but supposing the earl of warwick had your picture there is nothing blameable in your regard in the case are not the pictures of sovereigns seen every where and dont they even make presents of them without being blamed for it these general instances have no relation to my particular case replied she a queen may do abundance of things which are innocent in her would be interpreted as criminal in me i am neither so blind nor so foolhardy as to regulate my self by such like examples then you have now conceived a hatred against the earl said albine were i come to that point of hating him replied she i should not be disturbed to that degree as i am but there is still a certain remembrance and that so dear to me that it follows me every where i feel still within me a frailty not to hate him and am in vain upon my guard against my own heart nothing but time and absence can cure me  my lady devonshire understood by the countess of anglesey all what had passed betwixt her and her soninlaw your conduct for the future said she to her must make good every thing i have engaged for for my dear child i had rather see you dead than to find you bewitched to the best man in the world as i am of the same opinion with you replied she the greatest favor you can do me is to let me live in the country i will avoid the king i will fly the world and i will avoid every thing that may robb me of this happy tranquillity and may make me to displease you my lady anglesey embracing her with a great deal of tenderness told her she highly approved her resolution that it would be necessary to keep at a distance from court for some time and that the king would certainly forget her but added she has the earl of warwick no share in the intrigue is it possible he should so far expose himself as to get on the top of the gardenwall to suffer himself to be seized by the watch and run the hazard of so many ill consequences that attended it barely to be serviceable to his master he who a long time ago was always used to follow his own inclinations and not to obey the kings commands any further than he found them suitable to his own satisfaction add to this your picture in his jewelcase if it was the kings what made him keep it it is possible madam replied the countess not without some confusion seeing her mothers head so full of jealousy it is possible the king might stand in fear of his mistresses curiosity to avoid which he gave it to his favorite the old countess seemed well enough satisfied with this reason and going out of her chamber left the daughter in her closet entangled in a thousand vexations  ought it not have bin sufficient for me said she to her confident to obey with submission without going about to give counsel against my own tranquillity i desire to live in the country all the remainder of my life to be watched and to be debarred from all manner of liberty if they do accordingly how can i complain and if it be done why should i live that cruel dart that has wounded me still sticks in the very innermost part of my heart and i shall see no more him whom i am not able to forget albine how unfortunate am i she cried for a considerable time and her governess who longed for nothing more than to be always managing an intrigue whereby she might make her advantage did not fail to make use of this critical juncture to propose to her to give an account in a letter to the earl in what a condition she was in the countess not only rejected her proposition but also forbid her ever to recall to her mind an idea she intended to efface out of her remembrance  the departure of the countess of devonshire had at first raised the kings anger but hearing her scarce ever spoken of and believing himself not well used he made all his addresses to madam gray who became so intoxicated and haughty at this unexpected return of the kings passion that without the least regard to her best friends she sacrificed every thing to her own humor and interest as among the rest it happened to the earl of warwick  the head of the watchmen who had made the earl to pass his time so scurvily in the late nocturnal adventure dreaded the consequence thereof might turn to his utter ruin unless he could counterballance the earls authority by some powerful protection at court his sister happening to live with madam gray he told her the whole story and what apprehensions he was under and this young woman fearing no less than the ruin of her brother by the great power of the general and the earl threw her self at her mistresses feet conjuring her to take compassion of her family and to interceed with the king in behalf of what had happened to her brother out of ignorance madam gray was too well pleased with this story not to impart it to the young king and to represent the whole under such circumstances of her own invention as proved very diverting to him after having laughed very heartily for some time he was very curious to know from whence the general and the earl came at that time of night and as he knew the first to be a person of downright honesty he judged he might with much less difficulty unfold the mystery by him than by the earl of warwick who would be sure not to discover his intrigue to him  so soon as the king saw the general he took him into his closet and told him with a very obliging air that he was somewhat dissatisfied with him because he should keep him in ignorance of what was known to all the world besides viz his quarrel with the watch if you have a mind to make your peace with me continued he you must deal frankly and let me know at least from whence you came at that time sir replied the general your majesty would have put me to the greatest nonplus that can be had you asked me such a question as this sometime ago but at this time now i have broken those chains that proved too weighty for me and am freed from a tyrannical passion so little suitable to my natural inclinations i am free to own that the most surprising beauty of the young countess of devonshire did rob me of the true use of all my reason he then like a blunt truebred soldier laid open before the king his whole passion for that lady his inquietudes and how he had bin managed by the limner but dissembled his knowledge of the kings being his rival judging that in point of policy he ought not to touch upon that string the king interrupting him told him with a smile oh my lord you forget to remember me in this love concern the general was somewhat surpised but soon recollecting himself your majesty says he knows so well how to conceal the secrets of your heart that i could never be acquainted with what share your majesty had in this intrigue we will ask rosamonds picture continued the king smiling perhaps she will be more sincere than we are the general being not a little netled blushed sir said he the sincere confession i have made without concealing the least thing from you i hoped would not have bin recompensed with such reproaches from your majesty i am much ashamed of it and you will actually save me a great deal of trouble if you will be pleased to believe that that time whilst i was sighing for my lady devonshire is to me now like a dream the idea whereof vanishes as soon as you are well awake as i dont remember what is passed so i might easily forget to mention some circumstances without the least design that this must be attributed rather to the defect of my memory than to any want of inclination to give entire satisfaction to your majesty concerning what you are desirous to know well let that be as it will replied the king tell me whether the earl of warwick was along with you at this charming assignation no sir said the general we were both equally surpised to meet one another at this pretty seat nay we talked together for some moments without knowing one another and i could with all the eagerness i showed not get out of him a reciprocal confidence to tell me from whence he came  the king who listened to him with much attention began to conceive some jealousy at the earl of warwick but would not give way to it for fear of giving to himself some real occasion of trouble his tenderness for the earl did suppress his jealousy and he would even have bin dissatisfied with being informed of the real truth thereof so that his mind fluctuating betwixt uncertain hope and fear he did not in the least alter his obliging manner of correspondence with this favorite but the earl whose passion increased in proportion to the multitude of obstacles that obstructed his happiness could think of nothing else than how to encompass another interview with the countess of devonshire and as he took but little notice of those that came to make their court to him so the king found him much different in his temper from that pleasant charming and engaging humor which rendered him so agreeable to all the world he observed not without vexation that not only his deportment but also his person was much changed that his spirits seemed suppressed that his health was but in an indifferent state and in short that his pensiveness and distractions carried him beyond himself sometimes past all recovery he was heartily disturbed thereat and it came more than once into his thoughts that perhaps the earl might have bin wanting in the respect and fidelity due to him in respect of my lady devonshire and that he secretly loved her but as i told you before he would check these considerations and continue to give him such demonstrations of his tenderness as would have made him esteem himself infinitely happy had his heart not bin engaged so far as it was  one day when the king had bin talking to him a long while concerning a matter that acquired a great deal of attention being the subject upon which he was to make a speech to the parliament the better to help his memory he thought fit to dictate it to the earl for him to write it but happening to stop at certain intervals the better to think upon what he was to dictate upon that head the earl who was so far from thinking upon what the king said that he minded nothing else but his own affairs meaning the countess was on a sudden seized with some splenetick thoughts which nearly affecting his soul he without considering that the paper he had in his hand must be perused by the king himself writ these following words hymen has reduced you under the laws of a husband your heart is his and it is not in your power to love a lover he had questionless gone on had not the king begun afresh so that the earl making a new article writ what was dictated to  and stopping again for a while to ruminate upon the matter and to render his speech the more persuasive and insinuating the earl who was quite taken up with the countess writ again these lines love not a husband whose dreadful power does snatch from thee thy heart in spite of thy self and who without consulting thy heart offers violence to thy inclinations  the king concluded the speech which the earl writ without considering it was upon the same paper where he had set down these verses and it being late his majesty folding it up without reading it and putting it up in his pocket went to pay a visit to the duchess of york his mother the earl of warwick went home at the same time from whence he sent immediately a messenger to the duchess of norsolk sister to the countess of devonshire he knew that this lady was then enquiring for a complete gardener for the countess of anglesey who now wholly applying her self to the diversions of the country had a mind to have their gardens quite altered the earl of warwick having then a house or rather to speak more properly a palace at chelsey near london adorned with all the beauties of art and nature especially by its most delightful situation upon the very bank of the thames he spared no cost nor care to make it one of the most charming places in the world it was for this purpose he had obtained out of france the designs and scheme of that celebrated gardener who had the management of those famous gardens of agnes lorez mistress to king charles vii of france appertaining to a fine country seat near vincennes two gardeners being likewise sent him out of france to be employed in the designing of his gardens he sent one of them to the duchess of norsolk to show her the draughts they had brought along with them the gardener being a sensible fellow so well discharged himself of his commission according to the earls instructions that my lord norfolk soon agreed with him to be sent to my lady anglesey and the gardener desiring to have a fellow allowed him to assist him she willingly consented to his request this employment being designed for berincour a native of france his language perfectly suited with his masters intention but it was not the same with his habit for being very well known at court where he used frequently to attend the earl and of a gentile make it was not an easy matter to manage his disguise so as to be past all hazard of being discovered however this point being encompassed almost to a wonder away he goes along with the gardener to execute his masters commission and to deliver a letter to the countess of devonshire full of those most respectful and passionate expressions that were due to a lady of her merit and birth and suitable to represent his passion in the most lively terms that could be invented  the king staid not long with the duchess his mother but soon having engaged her at play wherein he went halves with her soon left the apartment and straightways went to that of madam gray who gave him a slender check for staying so long dont be out of humor said he to her i have bin busy in very serious matters and i staid but a very little while with the duchess of york because i would be here so soon as possible i could i will read to you the speech i intend to make at the opening of the next parliament because i have had no time to peruse and revise it as yet i hope sir said she caressing him you will read it aloud which the king did but coming to that passage where the earl had witten his verses he was surpised beyond expression what do you think of this said he to his mistress is it by chance or done on purpose who is it he speaks of and who is it he is so much in love with madam gray read them with the utmost attention and without consulting a conjurer soon guessed at the true meaning thereof oh traitor cried she he intended to make me his bubble the king was touched to the quick with these words for knowing madam gray to be one of the most able persons in the world he suspected an intrigue betwixt her and the earl so that at last his passion for the countess of devonshire was revived quite overwhelmed with these thoughts he with a fierce countenance looked upon the fair widow without sparing all the reproaches his rage could inspire him with or affording her any time for her justification and so arising on a sudden from his seat was a going to leave her she then throwing her self at his feet and embracing him with tears in her eyes i am resolved said she not to live unless your majesty will hear me sir i am not guilty the words which i let drop without considering the matter concerning the earl of warwick have not the least relation to me but only to his treachery to you at these words the kings anger seemed to be somewhat appeased the beautiful eyes of madam gray all overflown with tears had touched him to the quick and he now blamed himself for being the occasion thereof so he sat down again and madam gray laying hold of this favorable disposition with tender looks intermixed with sighs told him i was unacquainted sir with your passion for the countess of devonshire and i might have bin so for a great while longer had not the earl of warwick taken so much pains to inform me of it by many of his letters i am a going to show to your majesty it was he also that told me you intended to fetch her from twittenham and thus i acted in concert with him in order to thwart your design twas he that plagued me to load you with reproaches and without him i should have showed much more tenderness and respect but when he told me i was upon the point of losing you i like a desperate woman was soon persuaded that he had so much respect for me as to be altogether in my interest and that this was the only motive that made him hazard every thing in trusting me with a secret the discovery whereof would in all probability make him forfeit all your favors i would have concealed it within my breast were it not that now i am convinced what was it that engaged him to make me his confident wherein affection had not the least share it is so far from it sir that he should have a passion for me that he loves the countess of devonshire he is your rival and i his shield to be interposed betwixt you and her in order to cure your old passion by a new one dont disdain to call to mind his conduct when you laid open your heart to him look into these letters reflect upon these verses hymen has reduced you under the laws of a husband your heart is his and it is not in your power to love a lover  you see sir said she how every thing agrees to what i tell you he thinks the countess loves her husband that he fears he shall never obtain her that this touches him to the heart and that thereupon he has scarce any regard to what your majesty dictated to him but overcome by his passion he writes those very things he had much better have kept secret and that upon the same paper you have now in your hands nay you see him carried to such a pitch of extravagancy that he goes on and writes these lines love not a husband whose dreadful power does snatch from thee thy heart in spite of thy self and who without consulting thy heart offers violence to thy inclinations  this doubtless is said in relation to the countesss sudden departure he knowing her to be dissatisfied upon that point like a man of sense makes use of this as an argument to cool her affection for her husband now your majesty sees continued she how little i deserved these reproaches you loaded me with to so high a degree and how small a share of affection the earl bore to me she might have held on talking thus till night without being minded by the king who soon perceiving that his jealousy was illgrounded and this his jealousy changing to a most furious anger continued all this while  a deep study madam gray being too well acquainted with the cause thereof to interrupt him in his thoughts kept silence for a while till the king broke out on a sudden as if he was speaking to the earl o perfidious man is this the return thou make me for all the kindness i have shown thee for the entire confidence i have put in thee for the riches and other favors i have heaped upon thee what a piece of treachery is this he has snatched from me a young mistress whom i loved and unto whom i was not altogether indifferent he has left no stone unturned madam to rob me likewise of your heart could any letters be more cunningly devised than these he has written to you how miserable is the condition of princes being either hated out of fear or else despised when they enter into a familiarity with their subjects so that they scarce ever taste the true relish of thinking themselves really beloved  he paused at these words a little and his melancholy reflections increasing with the considerations of what favors he had bestowed upon the earl and how ill he had bin rewarded by him he sighed much dissatisfied within himself for retaining still some kindness for a person that deserved it so little at last turning his eyes with a tender look upon madam gray he begged of her not to remember what he had told her during the first motions of his jealousy she appeared satisfied thereat but was not a little discomposed at the kings melancholy which she endeavored to disperse by her pleasant and engaging conversation which at any other time but this would have bin very diverting to him but now had but little if not a contrary effect upon him for he took his leave of her not without some dissatisfaction because she had laid open to him the ill conduct of his favorite  the earl of warwick appeared not at court that night being wholly taken up with making the necessary dispositions for berincours journey he opened no less than three times the letter he was to deliver to the countess of devonshire making every time certain additions and so many superfluous repetitions as took away a great part of its first beauty he also sent a letter to albine and a jewel of a good value and yet after all was not contented with what he had either written or done fearing less some sinister accident or other should disconcert all his precautions or that the countess of devonshire might be exasperated at his proceeding  the king passed that night under a thousand inquietudes which would not suffer him so much as to think of sleeping the beauty grace and engaging air of the countess of devonshire coming a fresh into his mind tormented his soul with an irresistible power he understood by the verses of the earls that he had not as yet made any sufficient progress there to make him happy and on the other hand reflecting upon his late conduct he had all the reason to fear he should not be more happy himself entangled in these different considerations his passion at last gave place to his anger on account of the earl of warwick he took a resolution to banish him into the most northern parts of scotland among those dreadful mountains where the inhabitants at that time were distinguishable only from savage beasts by their human shape here it is said he where he shall entertain the rocks with his passion here he shall send forth his sighs to the sea whilst i will remain deaf to all his complaints till i have made him to do a long penance for his infidelity but after all considering the many obligations he owed him this obliged him to alter his opinion and to make him acknowledge only and repent of his fault however whilst he continued struggling betwixt gratitude and anger for fear the last should again get the upper hand against a person whom he was inclined to pardon if he would in the least render himself worthy of it he resolved rather than to speak to him himself to engage some body else to do it in his behalf  he pitched upon the earl of pembroke to undertake this task he was also the kings favorite a man not inferior in point of magnificence and gallantry to any person at court he was witty of a charming conversation young handsome and who spared nothing to render himself agreeable to the fair sex and that with good success the king having ordered him to be called to court early in the morning he was yet in bed but made all the haste he could being impatient to know what the king had to command him he was no sooner admitted into his bed chamber but he told him your best friend has betrayed me the earl of warwick never merited the tenderness i showed him i made him a partaker in my heart but my favors were very ill bestowed the earl of pembroke hearkened to the king with a great deal of trouble because he entirely loved the earl of warwick what is it you tell me sir cried he is it possible he should be wanting in what is owing to so great a king certainly he was not engaged in restoring king henry and queen margarete to the throne ah i dont doubt but that some body or other envious of his good fortune has insinuated something to your majesty to procure his ruin believe your own eyes replied the king giving him the billets he had written to madam gray and his speech with the before mentioned verses the earl stood surpised to the highest degree with his eyes fixed to the ground without uttering one word i am well pleased said the king to see you so much concerned there being but few favorites so generous as to share the misfortunes of those whom they think powerful enough to do them a mischief but since you are so much concerned for him go and advise him to merit his pardon by an ingenuous confession of his intrigue with the young countess of devonshire this being the only means to appease my anger i am a going to conduct him hither at your majestys feet answered the earl no cried the king let him show never so much repentance i will not speak to him and i could find in my heart never to see him again but rather to send him into some dreadful solitude where he might at his own leisure reflect upon his fault but that some remnants of tenderness plead within me for his better treatment in short let him be sincere and he may be saved  the earl of pembroke went immediately to the earl of warwick but so much overwhelmed with grief as is scarce to be expressed to give the reader the better idea of the true occasion thereof i shall be obliged to give an account of the whole adventure from its first original  the earl of pembroke after his return from rome where he had spent some months into england received the visits of many persons of note and among the rest of my lord stanley brother to the countess of devonshire this lord took notice in the earls apartment of a certain most curious picture representing psyche in a most magnificent palace said to be built for her by cupid adorned with all the embellishments that could be invented nothing could appear more lovely than this young princess her self in short she was such as might inspire love to love it self my lord stanley was so much taken with the picture that not being able to keep his eyes from it he shortened his visit and returned home with a full resolution to have the picture cost what it would though he could not well devise how to encompass it they being rivals and consequently not overcomplaisant for one another they both made love to a very charming actress named lelia who having always shown more inclination for my lord stanley than for my lord pembrook occasioned this jealousy betwixt them my lord stanley rightly judged that lelia might easily get the picture from a person who had always distinguished himself by his generosity and who would not refuse her such a thing even though he had not bin in love with her my lord was not backward in caressing and telling his mistress every thing he could think of in case she could get the picture so both moved by joint interest and inclination mrs lelia had the picture from the earl as soon as she asked for it she scarce gave her self leisure to cast her eyes upon it being highly impatient to satisfy my lord stanleys curiosity with all possible diligence in which she had succeeded to her desire had it not bin for a sinister accident that intervened  my lord pembrook happening to return my lord stanleys visit happened just to be in the room when mrs lelias messenger came in with the picture being eager to deliver it in hopes of a good present so that though my lord made him a sign of going back with it as soon guessing it was the picture of the beautiful psyche the fellow opened the coverture and exposed it to the earl of pembrooks sight who appeared not a little nettled thereat they both blushed together my lord appeared surpised and the earl smiled with a malicious air i should have bin vexed said he if i should have seen my picture in another place but i think it but reasonable that lelia should amuse you by such like small presents when i have reason to believe that she bestows upon me other favors of much more value than yours i am not surpised at what you tell me replied my lord i always thought you more happy than my self and even your absence has not bin able to procure to me the least advantage with her the earl who knew very well how the matter stood soon put an end to the conversation wherein he could take but small delight and going straightways to lelia overloaded her with a thousand reproaches according to her deserts to all which she answered with indifferency she having conceived a certain opinion that if any thing could fix that erring star or planet of my lord stanleys it would be this sacrifice she had offered to him  about that time all the discourse in london was concerning that stupendous structure the earl of warwick was a building at chelsey every one found out some new embellishments and beauties in it every day and there were very few but what would go to take a view of it before he had lodged there some of his beautiful mistresses and consequently rendered it inaccessible he had a great number of workmen there but at the same time seldom came there himself being obliged constantly to attend the king  the earl of pembrook vexed to the heart at lelia without being able to cure himself of his passion for her resolved to make this a retiring place to indulge his grief after having walked for a considerable time he seated himself on the bank of a rivulet which flowing through the green fields over a sandy bottom and being curiously planted with many large trees near the edge made this place both very shady and refreshing in the hot season looking upon this place as very suitable to his present circumstances he past some time in a very pensive condition till at last he writ certain verses in his table book he happening then to hear the voices of diverse persons coming that way he got up and being resolved not to be seen by them moved from them with so much haste that none of them could perceive him near hand though they guessed by his habit that he must be a person of quality these proved a company of ladies who soon saw themselves not mistaken in their guess when the countess of devonshire who walked a few paces before the rest saw upon the ground a table book the outside whereof was plated with and engraven in gold set at the edges with diamonds of a considerable value  the countess of anglesey committed her daughter to the care of the countess of oxford to take her along with her to chelsey in company of the countess of bath mrs howard and my lord stanley they being all satisfied that the earl of warwick was gone abroad a hunting with the king the countess of devonshire showed them the fine table book but finding it fastened with a very small lock and no key in it there was no possibility of opening it unless they would break it all to pieces they were all inclined to do it except my lord stanley who opposed it alleging that without doubt he that owned and had lost it would soon come to enquire after it so the countess of devonshire kept it after they had taken several turns my lord stanley told his sister and mrs howard with a low voice that they would turn into another walk and no sooner had they done so but he asked for the table book i have added he a small key which i believe will open it i would not discover the thing to the rest of the ladies because if i am not mistaken i have some share in the secret but i will remain mistress of it said his sister with a smile and therefore can do no more for your satisfaction than to make use of it and as i take a singular delight in unfolding of mysteries so i should be much pleased to meet with a diverting secret when they opened it they found the following lines upon the first leaf the object of my love is offensive to me i was not able to engage her i will be for change it is a pleasure to revenge ones self by a happy indifference  our unknown is dissatisfied with his condition said the countess of devonshire laughing but he takes his own way and i suppose he is happy in his liberty by this time ah madam replied mrs howard that is no sure rule i have heard people talk upon that head who have found themselves more than once in their life time put to such trials they were free to own that the wounds of the heart are far different from others and prove very hard to be cured i conjure you brother said the countess of devonshire turning to my lord stanley tell us in good earnest your thoughts upon this point i am afraid i shall speak against the fair sex and thus you intend to expose me to the indignation of the most aimable person in the world said he looking upon mrs howard you cannot say nothing amiss in what you are a going to tell my lord said she i have already conceived such an opinion of you as with all the art you have you will not be able to alter i will tell you then continued he you are under a great mistake if you imagine that people fix their love now for any considerable time they tell us indeed that in former ages people were absolutely true and faithful that let their fetters be never so heavy they worshipped them whether well or ill treated it was no matter they loved many years successively without being able to make their reason so far to get the upper hand of their passion as to incline to a change but at present we take quite contrary methods to those and such as prove much more commodious commonly the person that changes first is scarce a few moments beforehand with the other he has loved we now love our mistresses as butterflies do flowers if a loving couple now part without falling quite to pieces and exposing themselves to the public they say they have done the finest thing they could do and that they ought not to be dissatisfied with one another  if i had the least inclination for an intrigue said mrs howard this description of yours would cure me of it for all my life time there is no general without an exception replied my lord and i my self madam dare undertake to be one of the first who can give you an instance that there are even now those who know how to love at another rate than what i just now spoke of i cannot tell whether you can or not added she but this i am sure of i shall make no trial thereof look here said the countess interrupting her some more verses let us see whether they are of the same stamp with the preceding ones lelia is prodigal of her charms in the arms of a triumphant rival ah let us take revenge let us hasten to sacrifice her before his eyes but alas how many tears will this fury of mine cost me by delivering up what i love to my most cruel despair but no matter let us revenge our selves since this inhumane creature has not as much as vouchsafed to make one step to allay my pain and despair  the countess being not ignorant that her brother was in love with lelia she told him with a kind of a malicious smile you were in the right to concern your self so far as you did in what might be contained in this table book you see it complains of your mistress but is it you that is the occasion of it or is your condition no better than that of this unfortunate lover you reveal my secrets without my consent replied he and what would mrs howard think of me if i should say i had reason to be contented she would interpret it perhaps as a piece of vanity the person you speak of my lord is not so very valuable for her conduct replied she from thence to infer the least disadvantagious consequence in boasting of your happiness it is true said he people have conceived some prejudice against her conduct but notwithstanding this what she does for me deserves acknowledgment for she prefers me to the earl of pembrook who you know has generally the preference before most of the other courtiers he then told them what had happened concerning the picture of psyche truly brother said the countess i begin to fear the consequence of this affair he seems to me most furiously angry and as doubtless he will come this way to look for his table book so if he finds you here it will prove an additional trouble to him i conjure you by our friendship to leave us and i will go back to the countess of oxford and desire her not to tell him who i am and do you think he does not know you said mrs howard no added the countess i come so seldom to court that if he has seen me at all i dare say he does not remember me my lord stanley desired his sister to be satisfied which she promised she would provided he would stay no longer with them he was no sooner gone but she told mrs howard i think i did not amiss in not suffering the earl of pembrook to have the dissatisfaction of meeting with a happy rival who is the subject of his complaints in these verses mrs howard commended her prudence telling her that she should have bin afraid of a quarrel betwixt them  in the mean while the said earl having not without much inquietude discovered the loss of his table book he hastened back to the place from whence he came and where he made use of it but not finding it there and not questioning but that the ladies whom he endeavored to avoid had found it he made up to a walk where he saw them they proved to be the countess of oxford and the countess of bath who expected the return of the countess of devonshire he accosted them and after having signified his satisfaction at their happy meeting begged them to restore to him his table book we found it said the countess of oxford without knowing that it belonged to you my lord we were so far mistresses of our own curiosity that if you have any secrets in it be assured we are ignorant of them i dont pretend madam replied he to deserve the trouble you could give you of the least concerns in my affairs so i am not in the least surpised at your indifferency upon that account we are not so indifferent as you imagine replied the countess of bath we were actually for breaking it rather than not have it opened but my lord stanley opposed it  at these words the earl changed color and had these ladies bin in the least acquainted with both their concerns they might soon have discovered both in his eyes and countenance the discomposure of his mind but as they knew nothing of the adventure of the picture they told him it was the countess of devonshire who had found and kept it she is walking in the next wood said they with mrs howard and my lord stanley where you may ask for it he parted from them with a most profound reverence but not without some vexation considering my lord stanley was with the countess of devonshire and fearing lest he might have opened the table book and read his complaints against lelia in order to divert himself with her at his cost  distracted with these considerations he came to a shady walk which my lord stanley happening to cross at the same time but so as to endeavor to avoid being seen by they earl and this creating in him a suspicion that he had the table book and intended to keep it for his diversion he followed him apace crying after him stay stay my lord and so advancing in a threatening posture with his hand upon his sword demanded the table book of him my lord replied fiercely he had none of his table book and so likewise laying his hand to his sword they without further ado drew upon one another and attacked one another with such resolution that in all probability had proved fatal to them had not the countess of devonshire and mrs howard who were not far off run to them and with most violent outcries for help thrown themselves most courageously betwixt their swords to part these two rivals  my lord stanley had no great reason to be dissatisfied as having the preference before his rival with mrs lelia and as for the earl of pembrook he had no sooner cast his eyes upon the fair countess of devonshire but struck with admiration at her beauty this so entirely razed out of his mind all the remembrance of lelia as if his heart had never sighed after any thing but the countess who now stood before him and whom he had seen several times before without being struck with her perfections whether it were that he did not then take so much notice of her as now or whether the fatal hour of surrendering his heart were not then come we will not determine but now taking the point of his sword in his hand he presented it with a most gallant and respectful air to the lady and with one knee bent to the ground i am vanquished madam said he i beg at your hands a life i could wish to sacrifice in your service i did not intend to disarm your person said she but only to allay your indignation entreating him to rise from the ground but my lord since you have given me encouragment to desire a favor of you grant my request and be friends immediately with my brother i am satisfied it will not be his fault if you are not so and the subject of your quarrel being so inconsiderable i should be much ashamed to have undertaken this reconciliation without succeeding in it you are capable of doing every thing replied the earl you are absolute mistress of my destiny at these words advancing some steps toward my lord stanley he did the same toward him and so without enlarging further upon the matter they embraced and talked together like very good friends when the countesses of oxford and bath somewhat surpised at their long stay came to look after them being soon informed concerning the quarrel betwixt the earl and my lord they obliged them once more to embrace one another and engaged their honor for their being good friends for the future the earl of pembrook being very forwards in making the first step because he flattered himself that by going along with my lord stanley he might find an easy access into the earl of devonshires house  the countess of oxford had a magnificent supper ready for her guests in the best appartment of the house adorned with many fine statues and pictures and among the rest a most excellent piece of psyche the earl of pembrook looking very attentively upon it i am afraid said the countess of devonshire least this picture should revive in you certain motions of spite against my brother ah madam said he i am far from reflecting at this time upon the subject of our quarrel no i have no more passion for lelia i dont regret the loss of my psyche but the felicity of love madam since i could wish my self to be in her place i would wound a certain female mortal which appears to me to be so far placed above the rest of her sex that nothing less than an immortal ought to presume to please her your thoughts soar very high my lord replied the countess but this must be attributed to your high deserts she gave him no further leisure to continue his discourse his eyes sufficiently betrayed his sentiments and whatever care he took all the remaining part of the evening to come near her she was so dexterous in shunning all opportunities though without the least show of affectation that he could never meet with her but in the company of other ladies he was not insensible of it love makes use of perspectiveglasses which discover at a distance such things as indifferent persons would scarce take notice of he was not much acquainted with this kind of reservedness his great qualifications joined to the charms of his wit most commonly sheltred him against such like disagreeable accidents and his passion being as yet in its beginning he flattered himself with success if he could apply himself in good earnest in the pursuit of his expected happiness  he managed matters so well with my lord stanley that he conducted him to the countess his sister but found it a much more easy task to oblige my lord devonshire for whom he had no more than a general complaisence in point of policy than to please her whom he adored her deportment toward him was kept in so exact a balance betwixt a handsome decorum and an exact reservedness that he had not the least occasion either to complain or to flatter himself at the same time there was nothing that could have proved a greater affliction to him considering it was impossible for him to quit these flattering hopes that supported his passion he wanted patience to hearken to her discourse with complaisance because he even wanted resolution to discover his passion having missed a thousand opportunities that fell in his way for fear of displeasing this beautiful person thus smothering his secret in the very innermost recess of his heart the only comfort he had to allay his pain was that he flattered himself her indifferency to be the same to all the world that time might afford him some unlooked for assistance and that at least he should have the pleasure of seeing of her very often but notwithstanding his silence the countess was sensible of his tender sentiments for her which perhaps might have made some impressions upon her had not the merits of the earl of warwick so far touched her heart as to put it beyond all capacity of taking notice of the earl of pembrooks passion    this was the state of affairs at court when the king told the earl of pembrook that he was in love with the countess of devonshire as well as the earl of warwick and ordered him as i told you before to go to the said earl and to engage him to make such an ingenious confession as might merit his pardon it was then the earl of pembrook began to call to mind how often he had observed the countess of devonshire in a pensive condition how often he had heard certain sighs that seemed to escape her unawares what unseasonable answers she used to give and with what satisfaction she used to hear them talk of the earl of warwick as he was ignorant that she knew him so he little suspected of suffering any thing upon his account on that side but at this very moment he began to be fully convinced of his approaching misfortunes since he met with a rival in the person of his best friend and such a one whose inevitable destruction was at hand if the kings indignation were but never so little heightened against him he stood in need of all his generosity to espouse at this conjuncture the interest of the earl of warwick which perhaps he would not have done had not his masters passion for the countess threatened him with the same dangers so that considering how blameable it would appear to his own heart if he should be instrumental in adding to his disgrace which so sensibly afflicted him already he resolved to sacrifice love to friendship and be serviceable to his rival as long as he continued to be unfortunate but to break with him as soon as he should cease to be so  he understood that the earl of warwick had not bin gone to bed till within two hours before having spent the rest of the night in giving instructions to his gentleman concerning what he was to say to the countess of devonshire and to albine he was so very careful not to forget any thing that he repeated the same thing a thousand times and now after his departure thinking to take some rest was soon disturbed by the earl of pembrook after having given him an account of the whole matter dont think added he of justifying your self by disowning the thing for the king has ordered me to produce before your face the witnesses of your passion for the countess and of your breach of faith to him he is resolved to be well informed of the whole even to the meanest circumstance and then he will consider whether to do you justice or afford you his pardon the earl of warwick enraged at the sight of the letters he writ to madam gray that perfidious woman cried he has made me a sacrifice she was in the right on it to imagine that it was not on account of her own person i should scarce have taken so much pains for her but time will come when i shall make her sensible of my indignation it is now no time to think of revenge said the earl you must find a way to appease the king and how is that to be done replied the earl of warwick he knows already that i love my lady devonshire and how can i then make it known to him and as for my renouncing this passion all the joint powers upon earth shall never compel me to do it the king wants to know whether you are beloved said the earl of pembrook beloved replied the earl of warwick i know nothing of that but if i am not i dont despair of being so the earl of pembrook found himself touchd to the quick at these words however he so well dissembled the torments of his mind that he discovered nothing of it at that time questionless added he you are entered into a very pleasing correspondence with this fair lady it is true said the earl i have writ to her and she has sometimes sent me an answer and that full of tenderness said my lord pembrook no answered he she acts with a great deal of circumspection and mistrust how can this be consistent replied he with the liberty that was given you to have an interview with her in the night time how i cried the earl yes you replied he the king knows the whole intrigue alas what then would he have more of me replied my lord warwick with an impatient countenance he would have said the earl an exact account of all the transactions belonging thereto from the greatest to the meanest circumstance  the earl of warwick pausing a while upon the matter and afterward turning his eyes toward him with a settled assurance my lord said he i respect the king as my sovereign and as my master and i may say it without vanity that without me he had perhaps bin neither one nor the other but i love him besides all this as the best of my friends i beg of him to take pity of the frailties of my heart which not always consults reason before it surrenders it self i fell in love with the countess of devonshire before i knew any thing of his majestys passion for her when he did me the honor to make me his confident therein it was too late for me to hope for a cure i rather cherished my fetters and concealed them with all possible care not so much out of fear to disoblige the king as out of a desire of pleasing the person i adored at last her departure threw me into so deep a melancholy vexation and extravagancy that i discovered my self in writing certain verses instead of the speech the king dictated to me madam gray has taken this opportunity to contrive my ruin by showing my letters but after all what is it they can do to me as long as i am prepossessed with the same passion as i now am nothing but what has a relation to that will have any effect upon me all the rest whether good or bad whether rewards or chastisements all this i say will not affect me and this is perhaps the only thing in this intrigue the king is not acquainted with as yet and this being all i can tell him pray let him know it from me the earl of pembrook who was his real friend desired him to alter his resolutions and by an account without reserve to appease his majesty he told him he could say no more that he was not happy but that if his fortune should prove more favorable all the most cruel torments should not force from his mouth as much as one word that might prove injurious to the honor of a lady that was so dear to him and that it could not but vex him to the heart to find the king to have so ill an opinion of him as to think him capable of betraying the favors of a lady the earl of pembrook represented to him the ill consequences of his obstanacy but he told him he would expect the stroke with tranquillity having this secret satisfaction that he knew nothing wherewith to reproach himself  these ambiguous answers made the earl of pembrooks thoughts fluctuate betwixt hope and fear sometimes he thought the earl no more happy than himself and at other times he did not doubt but that he lived in certain hopes of being beloved but as all this remained in an incertitude so the more he abandoned himself to these reflections the more matter of trouble he encountered with in unfolding the mystery alas said he i have not had courage enough to speak nay not so much as to suffer my eyes to make known my present condition and the earl has writ to this countess nay has had an interview with her in the midst of a dark night for though he did not absolutely confess it who can doubt it after what has happened when he was taken up by the watch see how i pay for my timidity my respectful silence is punished as if it were a crime thus comfortless he goes back to the court with so dejected a countenance as if he had bin very sick the king was surpised at the sight thereof and could not for bear to show him some peculiar marks of good will for being so perfect a friend when he gave an account to his majesty of what had passed betwixt the earl and him he left nothing unattempted to allay the kings indignation and wrought so effectually upon the king that he resolved not to banish so far off as he at first intended nay he begged the king to send him only to chelsey but the king being too well acquainted with that seat as not to know what pleasures he might enjoy there he pitched upon caerleon for a place of his banishment this had bin in former ages a considerable city in south wales seated upon the river vsque but whereof nothing being left now but ruins and miserable remnants of antiquity this proved not a very convenient place for the entertainment of a person so much accustomed as he was to pleasure and magnificence  the king now exasperated to a high degree ordered the earl of pembrook to return immediately to the earl of warwick and to tell him from him that within two hours he must depart for caerleon he was somewhat doubtful whether he had best accept of this commission or whether he should desire the king to employ some body else in it but at last fearing lest his friend might not receive this command with so much submission as he ought to do and that the same might be afterward ill represented to the king in hopes of consummating the ruin of a disgraced favorite most frequently practiced among courtiers he was contented to undertake this order the better to take care of his friends interest he thought it but requisite to bring in by way of introduction certain things commonly made use of to prepare peoples minds against an ill piece of news to what purpose serve all these precautions my lord cried he when i told you this morning that nothing could actually afflict me unless it related to my lady devonshire if nothing that is amiss has befaln her speak without fear for i am prepared against all events you are to be sent out of the way said the earl of pembrook embracing him i am overjoyed at it replied he and has the king done me the favor to pitch upon a place remote from all conversation with the world a desert where i may employ my thoughts day and night where i may send forth my sighs and complaints for not seeing the countess and where at last i may not come near that dangerous shefavourite of his the presence whereof will be always odious to me your wishes are accomplished said the earl of pembrook caerleon is the place designed by the king for your banishment and it is his pleasure you should depart within two hours the time is very short said the earl but no matter i shall be pleased once more with the sight of the river vsque pray tell the king that within two hours i will be no more in london and that i shall be very well pleased with my place of abode they did bid one another farewell with all the tenderness imaginable for the earl not knowing my lord of pembrook to be his rival there was nothing that interferd with their friendship on his side he left london with so much precipitation that he would not so much as take his leave of the archbishop of york and the marquess of montague his brothers for he feared that they being incensed at his ill treatment might urge him to go over to calas whereof he was then governor and by putting himself under the protection of the french king revenge himself of king edward  the earl of warwicks gentleman coming to twittenham with letters from the duchess of norfolk to my lady anglesey thought not fit to deliver them himself for fear of being known but gave them to the french gardener his pretended master to give them to that lady whilst he kept at a distance in one of the darkest corners of the room the countess of anglesey much pleased with the draughts this gardener showed her pitched upon one for her garden ordering him to begin it the next day the fellow was very well pleased with it being born and trained up in this kind of work but agreed but very indifferently with berincour he being but little used to hardship especially since the countess being very eager to have it brought to perfection and there being abundance of weeds to be cut up and other matters to be done he that was to survey the work used often to check him after a very rough manner his best comfort was that he saw the countess of devonshire taking a walk every day in a shady wilderness at the end of the place where they were at work but in so melancholy a condition and accompanied by so many surveyers that he durst not speak to her for fear of being discovered as for albine she did not appear for a considerable time being detained in bed by an ague so that the poor earl who impatiently longed for some news in his solitude could not hear of any a good while that might be pleasing to him berincour knew that albine was sick at last took an opportunity to let her know by a young woman with whom he dined some times that if she pleased he could cure her provided she would let him apply certain herbs to her wrests which would produce an almost stupendous effect so she sent for him and he after some superstitious ceremonies applied the herbs to her wrests but at the same time did not forget to revive her eyesight with the luster of the jewel his master had sent her by him which he held in his hand so as to be seen by no body but her self the old albine dazzled with the brightness thereof soon got out of bed into the garden where she called for the gardeners man under pretense that he should assist her in supporting her to walk whilst they might talk of the most stupendous operations and cure performed by his herbs  so soon as he had an opportunity of speaking to her he told her that the earl had no other hopes left but what he expected from her assistance having sent him on purpose to acquaint her with every thing that passed that he was afflicted to the heart because he heard no news from my lady devonshire since she had left london and therefore had given him a large letter directed to my lady and a jewel for her things have fallen out so unexpectedly answered albine and the young countess has so possitively forbid me to entertain any further correspondence with the earl that this joined to the impossibility of writing without being discovered by so many arguss as we have about us i saw my self constrained to be quiet when i wished i could have done otherwise she then told him what had happened with the watch the unfortunate accident of the jewel and picture the jealousy of the earl and the vexation of the countess of devonshire and how she had bin reprimanded by her mother what must we do my dear albine said berincour my master cannot live if your mistress perseveres in her rigor i conjure you by all that is good to procure me a moment to speak with her or at least take my letter and let me have an answer i can promise you nothing said albine you may be assured of my zeal for your service for fear their conversation should have created some suspicion if it had continued longer albine went out of the garden but failed not to come again every day and would talk with berincour under some favorable pretense or other  i told you before he was a handsome fellow so that notwithstanding the sun had made him as tawny as a tawnymoor and his being much harrassd with continual labor the old gentlewoman took a great fancy to him she supposed nothing could be more proper than to make a match betwixt the he and she confidents of two rich lovers that the earl being in a condition to make his gentlemans fortune my lady would show no less liberality and goodness for her to be short she had got the match so far in her head that she took but little concern in the affair of the earl of warwick and whenever she found her self urged by berincour she would tell him she was forced to act with a great deal of precaution what makes you said he detain me thus here you know what danger i am in if i am discovered i am obliged to work from daybreak till night i am ready to die for vexation and am convinced you dont intend to do any further service to my master how impatient are you replied she and how little concern you show and the trouble i take of coming so frequently to talk with you alas were your heart as inclinable to gratitude as mine is you would not be so eager for going but would make the best use of the present opportunity at these words berincour was ready to burst out a laughing but having forborne it with much ado he told her that all this time his thoughts were taken up with his masters affairs but that for the future she might be sure of all his applications and that she should be satisfied how passionately he loved her albine being uncertain whether she had best believe him or not and how can i be assured replied she that you will love me if you dont love me already i should much suspect a passion that is so much at your command he told her that his seeing and loving her were of the same date that if she would dispatch him quickly he would soon return on purpose to court her this promise set the old gentlewoman to work for the same evening she told my lady devonshire that neither her silence nor her coldness being able to check the earls pssion he had left no stone unturned to hear some news of her and that his gentleman was there in disguise to deliver her a letter which she had undertaken to give to her  the countesss color changed at these words will you ruin me albine said she have you already forgot how much i have suffered only for having acted with less reservedness than i should have done and though i have nothing that is material to upbraid my self withal it is nevertheless too much to give the world real cause of suspicion dont speak to me any more of the earl of warwick my stubborn heart is too apt to do it without you how madam said albine to her will you refuse to accept his letter yes i will refuse it replied she give it back to him who brought it to you and order him from me to be gone albine not a little surprised at this resolute answer you will then prove the cause of his death said she or perhaps he will commit such a piece of extravagancy as you will have occasion to repent of as long as you live and how long is it replied the countess with an angry look since men have that liberty of persecuting a woman that is inclined to adhere strictly to her duty leave me at rest albine the force i put upon my inclinations is ready to put an end to my life but what matter is it added she with a very melancholy air since i have nothing that should render life more desirable to me at these words the tears beginning to stand in her eyes albine looked upon it as a favorable minute to engage her to open the earls packet madam said she throwing her self at her feet dont you refuse to read this letter my lord warwick will otherwise think you slight him and how do you think a man of his haughty temper can digest such a usage as this perhaps his love may turn into hatred oh let him hate me cried she it is all i desire him to do but all this while her heart not being strong enough to retain her sighs within her breast and albine watching narrowly every one of her motions did not fail to tell her a thousand reasons to engage her to open the packet but seeing the countess would not do it she did read it aloud before her the countess had weakness enough to hear it read but could not be prevailed upon to return an answer  albine having given a full account of all that had passed to berincour he found such an agreeable mixture of tenderness and virtue in this proceeding of my lady devonshire that he could not forbear to compassionate her condition and to wish that his master would desist from pursuing the matter any further notwithstanding which he failed not to entreat the old gentlewoman to renew her temptations to obtain a few lines from her hands and she was not sparing either of her arguments nor prayers but the countess tired with her importunity threatening to acquaint her lord with it she found now there was nothing to be done for berincour but to return to his master and to give some color to his departure the head gardener pretended he had occasion to send him to london to buy some things he stood in need of  berincour knew nothing of his masters exilement but being informed thereof at london he went straightways to caerleon coming thither he understood he was walking on the banks of the river vsque and the gentleman as he went in search for him found on several trees engrave the ciphers of the countess and diverse verses he had composed upon her the earl no sooner espied him but full of impatience ran to meet him asking what answer he brought from the countess of devonshire whereupon berincour desired him to have patience to hearken to what he had to say the account he received from him serving only to make him think himself more unhappy than really he was threw him into a very deep melancholy and he now began to fansy that albine out of a motive of self interest had flattered him with all those tender relations she said she had understood in conversing with his mistress and that it was too true that she had no more than a bare indifferency for him because she would not write to him this opinion being backed by many circumstances threw him into a most violent anguish thus he spent three days under the greatest incertitude what to do till at last he resolved to send back berincour to the countess and to fill his letters with such urging complaints and declarations of respect that she should not remain insensible thereat his gentleman who not very well liked his errand represented to him but in vain how little likelihood there was for better success in this second than in his first journey but he upbraiding him with want of affection he departed in the old disguise of a gardener the better to conceal himself from every body  during his absence my lady devonshire who was with child narrowly escaped being killed by a fall so that upon his arrival there he was told by albine that it would be very difficult for her mistress to find a favorable opportunity of speaking to him because she was very seldom left alone but added she what happens very fortunate is that i shall often see you so we must talk concerning our marriage and if we cannot accomplish the earl of warwick and the countesses business at least we will take care of our own make not the least account upon that said he to her with an angry look my fortune depends on the success of this negotiation and unless my master be satisfied i will never think of marriage these words having added new life and vigor to the old gentlewomans desires she immediately acquainted her mistress with the news of the return of the earls gentleman which proved a fresh occasion of trouble to her she commanded her positively not to take his letters and that if he did not withdraw from the house forthwith she would make him repent of it the old confident seeing her so resolute could do no otherwise than tell berincour that he had best to depart with the first opportunity and that all the earl would be able to do for the future would be in vain because the countess had taken this opportunity of his absence to hearken to her reason that she made every day more and more progress in recalling her inclinations from him and therefore was resolved not to read any of his letters lest his passionate expressions should revive in her heart an idea she had found too dear and too dangerous for her repose  berincour had nothing to object against what he was told by albine but being too well acquainted with his masters temper to venture at his return without some more comfortable answer he told her that since his so sudden departure would be infallibly attended with some remarkable ill consequences he only desired some time to do it at his own leisure and when he saw a fit opportunity to do it and albine managed the matter so far with my lady devonshire that she gave ear to this proposition the countess had done all that possibly could be done when she refused with so firm a resolution to read the letters of the earl of warwick but notwithstanding her real desire of remembering him no more nay even of hating him it is certain that not a day passed but she felt within her self certain strong inclinations for him no said she to her confident i would never forgive my self for these sentiments i still preserve for him were it not that by the violences i daily impose upon my self i were sufficiently convinced that one is not mistress of ones own inclinations a certain fatal constellation has made me see the earl and since that unhappy moment neither all the reflections i can make in respect of my self nor the motives of my duty nor the advantage of his absence have bin able to raze him out of my thoughts albine being a person who preferred her own interest before all other considerations was so far from urging her mistress to keep steadfast to her resolution that she excused her frailty alleging many instances of that nature which instead of perfecting the cure might serve rather to increase her distemper  this was the condition of this fair lady when she just had got strength enough to take the air in the garden the very place where berincour watched all her motions being resolved to take the first favorable opportunity of speaking to her he happened to meet with one one day when he saw the countess reading in an arbor her woman being at a good distance from her to gather a nosegay he at the same time run immediately to the place where he knew the choicest flowers were took care to gather such of them as he judged by their odoriferous scent and various colors might be most agreeable to her these he presented to her in a basket and she casting her eyes first upon the flowers and afterward upon the gardener was soon convinced he was the earls gentleman she blushed at the sight of him and was a going into the next walk but besides that she had not recovered as yet her full strength the suddenness of so surprising a sight had so far impaired the use of her limbs that she saw her self obliged to sit down again in the same place madam said berincour to her you know very well who i am and what it is i hope for from your goodness what is it you would have with me said she with a trembling voice has not albine spoke to you concerning me but i cannot believe added he what she tells me since i cannot imagine madam the earl of warwick to have given you sufficient occasion to hate him to such a degree as to procure his death in refusing to read his letter and giving me an answer no replied she abruptly i will have no manner of correspondence with him what is it i have done to him that he should thus persecute me in a solitude which ought to shelter me against the danger of his remembrance let him be happy at court but leave me in repose you dont know then madam replied he how much he deserves your compassion the king has banished him into a kind of a desert where he would live contented would you but take the least share in his pain the countess stood surpised for though this piece of news was well known in the family they had concealed it from her because they would not mention the earls name alas all her preceding resolutions of indifferency could not stand the brunt of this surprise the air of her face nay her voice began to change into a milder disposition she took the letters berincour delivered to her and having hid them carefully immediately left the arbor and garden being very impatient to see what the earl had writ to her the whole packet contained no less than six letters but it will be sufficient to insert one which may save as a pattern to give a judgment of all the rest  when you hear the news of my banishment you will doubtless pity me madam and will believe that i look upon it as a disgrace but i have not so much sense left as to be sensible of it the sentiments i preserve for you make me indifferent to every thing that does not concern you and i am so far from being alone in this dismal solitude that i am in better company than ever i was at court yes divine countess i am entirely possessed with your idea i carry it every where about me and it is my constant entertainment neither could i wish for any thing in the world that would please me better since i am deprived of seeing you any more so that i dare affirm that if i am unhappy it is owing only to your indifferency alas madam what crime have i committed against you to cause me so much pain i love you and that is my crime but dont we also love the gods and they are not offended at it and though i pay you the same respect as we do to them you treat me more rigorously than they would do afford a few lines of your own hand writing to the violence and purity of my passion this being the only remedy i desire to allay all the evils you make me suffer   my lady devonshire had no sooner read the earl of warwicks letter but she called albine into her closet who seeing her mistress all in tears could not conceive what fresh occasion of grief was befaln her dont be surpised said she these tears i shed are too reasonable to be stopped i am afflicted to see my self still guilty of so much weakness the earls exilement touches me to the heart his exilement madam replied albine berincour has not said one word of it to me i wish continued the countess this secret had bin kept from me as well as it has bin from you i should then have no occasion of reproaching my self with having read a letter from a person whose correspondence occasions so much trouble to the earl of devonshire albine then made use of all her rhetoric to persuade her mistress that she could not without much injustice refuse her pity to an unfortunate man she extolled the earls merits above the skies and this dangerous confident so continually tormented and disturbed her with her arguments and entreaties that in spite of all her former resolutions not to write to the earl she could not forbear to send him an answer in these words  if that esteem which i have hitherto preserved for you deserves an acknowledgment dont remember my lord that you ever saw me and permit me to enjoy a tranquillity i am not mistress of now i cannot imagine why you should persist in persecuting of me for so i must call those demonstrations of a passion which is offensive to me and which had before this produced my hatred against you were i in a condition of hating you however the impossibility i am under of loving you because i ought not and of hating you because i cannot deserves all the compassion you are capable off assist me then in finding out such a disposition to indifferency as may prove the glory and repose of my life   she left off in all probability sooner than she intended because her tears stopped the course of her pen her heart checking her hand for an action so opposite to the promise she had made to her mother and husband she told albine she would tear the letter for fear of some sinister consequences and she was actually going to do it when albine clapping her hand upon it took and hid it in her bossom no madam said she i must not give it you again there is no reason you should so suddenly alter your resolution in behalf of a person who has done nothing to displease you you forbid him to love you he ought to have it under your own hand and then he will have no reason to flatter himself and i am almost certain this is the way to cure him do thou believe so albine replied the countess much concerned then i will not send the letter but soon recollecting her self what is it i say continued she what did i say what are my intentions would i suffer my self to be beloved by any other person but the earl of devonshire whilst the countess was thus fixing her resolution to break off all correspondence with the earl and to begin with the burning of the letter she had writ just before albine considering she could do no greater piece of service to berincour than to give it him in order to deliver it to his master slipped out of the closet unperceived by her mistress and running straight into the garden put the letter into the gentlemans hands  during berincours late journey to caerleon the beforementioned french gardener was fallen in love with a handsome young english damsel and as it is a hard task to keep any thing from what one loves this gardener was not altogether so much taken up with his courtship but that he would sometimes talk of his companion and this young woman taking particular notice of this gentleman in disguise began to like him so well that she thought if she were born a gentlewoman she could be much better satisfied with him than with a country fellow at last she could not forbear to speak concerning him to her mother and it would have bin death to the old woman not to tell the secret to her husband so the gardener perceiving the thing to have taken vent thought it his safest way to declare the whole truth thereof himself to the earl of devonshire he was touched to the quick at this news not knowing what to resolve upon sometimes he was for cutting berincours throat before his ladys face and then to carry things to the utmost extremity soon after he was speaking to the earl of anglesey to desire satisfaction of him on account of his daughter love jealousy honor tenderness and hatred entered into a most cruel combat within his breast distracted with these various agitations of his mind the chevalier d hereford his kinsman and one of his most intimate friends comes to twittenham to spend two or three days with the earl who looking upon his arrival as one of the most seasonable things that could have happened desired him to take a walk upon the side of the river thames they were no sooner come at some distance from those that attended them but after a few moments silence you see the most unfortunate of mankind said he to the chevalier i came to this river with no other intention than to throw my self to the bottom of it to put an end to those misfortunes i was not born to hereford looking upon him like a man amazed what has happened to you my lord said he you know i am absolutely yours let me be a sharer in your discontents perhaps i may help you to support them with the more patience oh said the earl my pain owes its original to a cause which exceeds all ordinary pains that excess of friendship i always had for my lady devonshire is now the deadly cause of my grief how cried the chevalier you dont complain of her i cannot imagine what reason you should have for it hear me said the earl interrupting him and i will leave it to your own judgment he then gave him an ample account of the whole matter intermixing his relation with tender reproaches and violent threats no otherwise than if he had bin talking to his lady whence it was easy to guess that it would prove very difficult to moderate his anger however the chevalier having a fixed and singular esteem for the countess was resolved to undertake the task  you are not in a condition to act in your own person said he to the earl because the point in question too nearly concerns you your senses are impaired and you will see your ladys innocence even when you would not see it well supposing the earl of warwicks gentleman to be in your house disguised like a gardener doubtless his master sent him either to assist him in coming hither incognito or to receive his letters and to deliver his answers it will be no hard matter for you to find out the true reason thereof give him but a little opium and having got his papers into your hands you may take the best measures you can without the least noise if the earl of warwick replied the earl keeps him here to favor his coming privately into the house there is no way to find it out unless by the confession of this gentleman no matter replied the chevalier let us begin with my proposal and we will end as you shall think fit the chevalier prevailing with the earl to follow his advice it was agreed to mix some opium in the gentlemans drink by the assistance of one of their faithful domestics who met with no great difficulty to perform his promise berincour who had worked very hard all that day in the garden being much tired at night and eager for his supper to go to bed in good time because he was to rise next morning before daybreak in order to depart with the so much desired answer of the countesss he was to deliver to the earl  the chevalier de hereford desired the earl of devonshire to leave the whole management of this affair to his conduct so that entering the pretended gardeners chamber in company of that person only who had procured the opium he found a very large packet about him what had increased its bulk was that the countess being resolved not to keep the earl of warwicks letters and having not resolution enough to burn them she sent them back along with her own letter the chevalier much surpised at the sight of the packet was at a stand whether to give it to the earl or not being ignorant of the contents thereof which he feared might turn to my lady devonshires ruin it was then he made a thousand melancholy reflections upon the misfortunes unto which too often the imprudence of young people exposes them and had he thought himself sure of his opinion he would certainly have avoided to give new cause of trouble to his kinsman but the worst was that besides that the domestic who went along with him had seen the packet the earl of devonshire would not be satisfied at an easy rate and it proved so on the sequel for he waited for him in a long gallery where disturbed with his inquietudes he walked up and down apace and no sooner saw the chevalier but laying his hand to his sword not knowing very well what he did or what he would have asked him abruptly for the letters i am a coming to give them to you said the chevalier and then delivering them to the earl he tore the covert and signets and soon knew the first the earls and then his ladys hand writing at the last of which he stood very much surpised whilst the chevalier was highly pleased thereat  you see my lord said he the countess is not guilty the earl of warwick persecutes her he sends his gentleman without her knowledge she forbids him to love her she is angry with him she will not so much as keep his letters which would appear pleasing to any other woman but her self what further satisfaction can you desire you represent to me replied he my wifes conduct on the fairest side but let us take the thing as really it is what can you say for a young lady who suffers a gentleman of so dangerous a person as the earl of warwick is to stay in her family who lets him abide there in disguise who keeps his secret who receives his letters and who in effect tells him that she loves him in telling him that she cannot hate him in what country besides this would such kind of freedom be allowed of with patience the chevalier let him go on in his discourse without the least contradiction for fear of exasperating him the more in case he should endeavor to convince him by strength of reason which seldom takes place with persons infected with jealousy but only conjured him not to disturb the repose of his whole family by noising the thing abroad at last he put him in mind that the countess had acquired the general good opinion of all the world as a person who in all respects answered the character of that education she had by the care of my lady her mother but that if he suffered this matter in the least to take vent the public rumor which always makes a monster of a fly would also upon this occasion not be spairing to aggrandize the story that if he would follow his advice he ought to manage the point with the utmost address and nicety and to contrive how to make a breach betwixt her and the earl for since it was evident by her letter that she preferred her duty before all other considerations it would be no diffiult task to secure her in that opinion accordingly it was agreed betwixt the earl of devonshire and the chevalier to keep the whole secret from the knowledge of the countess and to write these few words in a womans character to the earl of warwick let me be at rest i will never hear you as much as to be spoken of  they folded the paper and having made up the packet just as it was before sealed it with just such another seal as that of the countesss the earl who had given it to her happening to have the fellow of it every thing being thus contrived they put it again into berincours pocket unperceived to him and so according as he had proposed the night before he went away to satisfy his master who expected his return with the utmost impatience  i give you leave to guess at his surprise and resentment at the reading of so rough and harsh a farewell how barbarous woman cried he do i undergo this cruel exilement for your sake i have lost the kings favor i was willing to sacrifice my repose and my whole fortune to the satisfaction of pleasing you you are not ignorant of it my letters and addresses have sufficiently told it you and you repay me with nothing but disdain no no dont imagine me to be not able to forget you i break your chains and nothing shall be remaining of them but the shame of wearing them he added a thousand reproaches to these words appearing for several days like a man in a frenzy who was combating nothing but airy phantasms sometimes discomfited sometimes victorious not knowing what resolution to take he would spend whole nights near the river vsque addressing himself to the trees and rocks without being sensible for the most part of what he said  at last this distemper the most dangerous of all sorts of fevers began to abate by degrees his reason which had lain concealed for a great while began on a sudden to take its proper station and display its charms twas now he began to compassionate his destiny and be sensible of its hardship the same desert which so lately had appeared to him the most delightful place in the world was now turned to the most disagreeable of all others hitherto the days seemed too short for him to ruminate upon his passion but now they were insupportable to him and if now and then he thought of the countess it was in spite of himself and to find out her defects he did not think fit to ask the intercession of his brothers with the king in his behalf but pitched upon another method he sent berincour to such friends as he knew could be serviceable to him but more especially to the earl of pembrook to desire him to acquaint the king that he was ready to make a sincere confession at his feet of every thing he had a mind to know concerning this intrigue and that he would promise his majesty never to love the countess of devonshire any more this news caused no small satisfaction to the earl of pembrook who saw himself thus freed from a most dangerous rival without which he had but little hopes of meeting with a favorable reception from the countess this engaged him to make his application to the king with the utmost of his zeal however that prince did not think fit to grant a request made so late but would have his penance bear some proportion to his fault and that he should purchase his pardon by his reiterated prayers which he refused to hearken to at present  the chevalier having engaged the earl of devonshire upon his honor not to show the least indifferency or anger to his lady and every thing being agreed betwixt them in relation to the further management of this affair he went to london but came back into the country soon after twas about the same time that the earl of warwick being recalled from his exilement those that were the most intimate friends of the earl of devonshire were the first who gave notice thereof to the said earl they further told him that the earl had never appeared more gay in all his life time and that he was fallen in love with one of the maids of honor of the duchess of york a beautiful young lady and of a very good family the earl of devonshire was very ready to read these letters before his lady who at that time diverting her self with making some silk embroderywork was put into such a confusion by this unexpected piece of news that she made some roses she was then working at of a blue color and jessamins and jonquilles green without being sensible of her mistake the earl perceived it to his singular regret and would questionless have discovered the most violent marks of his resentment had not the chevalier come into the room at that very juncture of time his presence checking the effects of his indignation he gave him an account of what he had observed no said he there is no room for flattering my self any longer that ungrateful creature loves him she has too much betrayed the inclinations of her heart i will be revenged but the chevalier so far prevailed upon him by his most earnest entreaties that he was appeased for that time  within two days after the chevalier de hereford as he was walking with the countess in the garden looked upon this as a favorable opportunity to manage his design he told her he was sorry he should prove the occasion of giving her some disquiet but that he could not without blaming himself forbear to acquaint her with the actions of the earl of warwick who had so little regard to her favors as to show her letters abroad that one of them being by good fortune fallen into his hands he had kept it and was now come on purpose to restore it to her the countess judging no otherwise than that he had bin set on by the earl of devonshire to feel her pulse was a going to check his boldness but soon perceiving her own hand writing she turned as pale as ashes but soon after a sudden redness overspreading her face and bosom were sufficient demonstrations of her confusion and indignation my intentions were too sincere and unblemished said she to the chevalier in writing this billet to have the least occasion of disowning it and i dare promise my self that every thing being duly considered it will turn rather to my honor than disgrace at the same time it makes me sensible of the baseness of the earl of warwick against whom i from this time vow an implacable hatred he must certainly be one of the basest men living to play me such a game but i will assure him it shall never be said he contrived my ruin for his own diversion since i will make him feel the effects of my resentment madam replied the chevalier if you will give me leave to advise you stifle this matter for fear it should come to my lord devonshires ears you know him to be a man too nice in certain points and the last time we came hither he told me some part of his affliction upon the road believe me madam the securest way a lady of your age and birth can take is not to give any occasion of her being much talked of in public since there are not wanting every where such as will put the worst interpretation upon the most innocent actions that can be you live in a numerous family and the best way to obtain their commendation is not to make your self a public discourse at court and that it may not be said the countess of devonshire has bin quarreling such a day and such a day with the earl of warwick because he showed a letter she had written to him  whilst he was talking to her she kept her eyes immoveably fixed on the ground and then bursting out into tears she thanked him for his advice assuring him that she would follow it being resolved not to appear any more at court but to pass all the remainder of her days in the country the chevalier told her it would not be for her good thus to resolve upon such an extreme since she could not refuse to go along with the family if they went to london she answered she was resolved not to go thither unless the earl her spouse should oblige her to it which she supposed he would not for twittenham being not above eight or nine miles from london he might go and come at pleasure without the least inconveniency the chevalier finding her so resolute thought it more convenient to seem to approve of her design than to contest any longer in vain especially since he knew the earl of devonshire intended to keep her in the country for a considerable time  she was no sooner gone but the chevalier returning to the earl of devonshires apartment gave him an account of their whole conversation and they were both extremely well satisfied both with this first good success and with the resolution they had taken of breaking off the correspondence with the earl of warwick by furnishing them with occasion of mutual complaints whereas if they had made a noise of the matter it might have served rather to cement their affections and chevalier de hereford being apprehensive that his kinsman might make some false steps contrary to what had bin agreed on betwixt them seldom left him alone taking all opportunities of allaying his anger  my lady devonshire returning into her closet and throwing her self upon a couch without saying one word to albine and she perceiving some remarkable alterations in her looks begged her to impart to her the reason of her grief oh unhappy woman said the countess with a surious look it is thou that art the cause of my grief thou have plagued me to receive the earl of warwicks letters and it was thou who did engage me in spite of all my foresight to return an answer to them this perfidious man has sacrificed my letter to his mistress which would have bin handed about every where had not the chevalier de hereford so far concerned himself in my honor and quiet as to put a stop to it perhaps it might by this time have bin in my husbands hands i am so highly exasperated at so notorious an injury that i will never either forget or forgive it whilst i live albine appeared like thunderstruck without being able to utter one word and her eyes being shut she appeared like one petrified or struck with death whilst my lady devonshire quite overcome with her own grief little troubled her self with her confident at last madam said she and has the earl of warwick treated you thus unworthily twas then upon that account only he sent his gentleman hither to get one of your letters into his hands to boast of your favors i protest to you i will not as much as mention him any more unless it be to conjure you to continue and increase your hatred to him there is no need for thy intermedling any further in the matter said the countess thy business is not so much as to remember his name in my presence leave the rest to my care and i will acquit my self in such a manner that no blame shall be laid at my door  if it were possible replied albine after having paused a while to doubt of what one sees with ones own eyes i must confess to you madam i should scarce so absolutely condemn the earl of warwick without being heard none but such mean and selfinteressed souls as thine said the countess can be guilty of thus imposing upon themselves as to my self who give thanks to god have nothing in me that resembles thee have fixed my resolutions to hate him for ever and not to see him again whilst i live you will meet with no small difficulties to keep either of these resolutions replied albine it is not an easy matter to hate what one loves i love him cried the countess with some impatience it is true i have admitted of his importunities and this is the only thing i have to accuse my self of and to reproach you how unfortunate are persons of my age continued she if they happen to have women of so much complaisance as yours had thou given me a foresight of the precipice i was going to i had stopped in time to avoid the danger and had not had any occasion now of finding my self betrayed but instead of giving me wholesome advice thou made it thy business to make me sensible of the merits and passion of my enemy  these various reflections caused in her a thousand melancholy thoughts which afflicted her to such a degree that not being in a condition to appear in any strange conpany she went to bed and albine told the family that having a most violent headache she required some rest her husband who did not question but that it was an effect of her dissatisfaction was not very forward to see her being highly exasperated against her and had it not bin for the chevalier de hereford it would have come to a rupture betwixt them  the earl of pembrook who bore a share in every thing that related to the countess soon got notice of her being ill of a consumptive fever attended with such symptoms of melancholy as seemed to be past all hopes of a cure and not doubting but that it was that change of the earl of warwick that was the real cause of it what an odd story is here cried he she writes to him a rigorous letter that she will not as much as hear any body name him his good fortune is such as to take the right course and to cure his passion she no sooner knows it but is ready to run distracted but perhaps continued he this sudden fire which burns now with such violence in her heart for the earl of warwick may be much abated if she meets with a lover who is passion is limited within the bounds of virtue such as she has always professed and it is possible that the earl being too forward forced that rigorous answer from her as for my part i fear nothing of that kind for as i love without hopes so i shall be well pleased provided she will not be displeased with me  there being a great intimacy betwixt him and the earl of devonshire he took often the freedom of paying him a visit at twittenham which being a village but a few miles from london he asked leave of the king to go thither for some small time you will then see the countess of devonshire said the king to him i would have her come to court again because i find her beauty is much out of order i know her eyes are grown very hollow her complexion and lips pale and that she is so lean as scarce to be known to be the same person thus i see my self sufficiently revenged upon her and to complete it pray tell her that i intend privately to marry madam gray that i heap favors upon favors upon her that i love her most tenderly and that if she had used me well she might triumphed at court at pleasure whereas now her husband keeps her shut up in the country  your majesty charges me with a commission said the earl which would easily break off my small journey for how is it possible for me to put such hardships upon her if you are resolved to go thither added the king it must be to serve me as an interview to her the earl told him he would do it in the most gentle way he could and so leaving the kings apartment met with the earl of warwick as he was passing through the guardchamber having a mind to sound his inclinations concerning his former passion for the countess i am a going said he with a low voice to lie at the lady angleseys this night have you any commission to entrust me with the earl being somewhat surprised did not answer immediately but soon after told him he was a going to see a fair littlelyrness and that he envied not his fortune you are angry my lord replied the earl of pembrook and i find there is more of passion than of indifferency in that you say of the countess of devonshire you know but little returned the earl coldly if this is your real sentiment dont you know that i am all of a piece and know not what dissembling is the earl of pembrook having a mind to pry further into his inclinations told him you think your self cured when you are still very sick i am not such a novice replied he not to know my own condition i read over her obliging farewell every day and it is there i meet with what is sufficient to support my reason and to augment my scorn then you still stand in need of a counterpoison cried the earl of pembrook you are not quite clear say what you will this is to insult over me returned the earl with a serious look sure you take me for a mean spirited fellow i assure you i dont so much as think any more of her i knew she was ill and i heard it not without some satisfaction which sufficiently convinces me that thanks to heaven she has no farther power over me it were happy for me added he could i be cured now as well of my hatred as i have bin of love i should then have but little occasion to dispute with the king as i now do about madam gray and though he adores her i dont question but to be revenged of her first or last according as a favorable opportunity offers how said the earl of pembrook and do you still keep in remembrance what she did against you i shall never forgive her said the earl till she has well suffered for it and till then i will give my self the satisfaction of being the most cruel of all her enemies  by this time several persons coming in to interrupt their discourse the earls of warwick and pembrook parted the last being extremely well satisfied at what he had heard his rival say but scarce was got down the stairs when hearing himself called by some body found it was the earl of warwick i conjure you said he to him not to miss of this opportunity of telling her how far i am bewitched to my new mistress for i would have madam devonshire know that her fetters are not everlasting that i had power enough to change them nay that i am almost inconsolable to have ever worn them that is enough for me said my lord pembrook to tell her what will please her much and why please her said the earl of warwick that is the least of my intention i am satisfied said the earl of pembrook with a malicious smile she will be overjoyed to hear you think of her no more the earl of warwick not being able to contain himself told him with a deep sigh alas my lord how happy are you not to be in love with this cruel woman i would i never knew her or at least never loved her at the price of half my life but farewell i must leave you the recital of my weakness would prove to my confusion  having said these words he went up to the king whilst the earl of pembrook remained immovable leaning against the wall quite confounded at the last words of the earl of warwick not questioning but that he had flattered himself in vain it is certain said he to himself he is still affected with the same passion and it is nothing but selflove that makes him despise her who despises him for how is it possible that so ardent a passion should be quite extinguished at once perhaps when the countess writ what she did it was not without the greatest violence to her self how can i tell whither not some indispensible reasons obliged her to it o god what torments do i endure what obstacles am i likely to encounter what difficulties am i not to surmount whether am i a going my fetters being already so weighty if i see the countess and declare my passion to her and she should be offended thereat should i not then be much more unfortunate than i am now  a thousand objections came into his head against the intended journey to twittenham but at last let my treatment be what it will i shall have at least the satisfaction of having declared my passion to her so that if i suffer she will know it is for her i suffer and of all the misfortunes this is greatest to love and to conceal it whilst he was taking this resolution he espied my lord stanley and asked him whether they should not go together to twittenham he embraced the offer and they were received with singular kindness by the earl of devonshire who was very glad of good company to divert his spleen which most afflicted him when he was alone  the earl of pembrook did not see the countess that night because she did not stir out of her chamber and if without being guilty of ill manners she could have refused the visits of those that came to her fathers house she would have bin extremely glad of it the earl of pembrook asked how she did and told my lord stanley to persuade her not to use so much reservedness to him as she did to others put her in mind said he smiling that it was upon her command i left you in the quiet possession of the fair lelia and dont you think it not reasonable she should show some particular regard to me my lord said she ought and promised to introduce him to his sisters apartment the next morning so soon as she should be awake  to perform his promise he went to a little wood where the earl had bin passing his time ever since daybreak near a cool spring where the countess used often to divert her self he saw aurora dissipating by degrees the darkness of the night whilst the sweet singing birds seemed to revive nature it self during the coldness of the morning when the sun beams being as yet feeble rather delighted than offended the eyes the earl addressed himself to the stars and told them his pain and perplexity he would have thought his condition sufficiently happy to find himself in the same place where his admired countess had her habitation had she bin more sensible for him or less for another but this reflection was like to kill him upon the spot had it not bin that he remembered those few cruel words she writ to the earl of warwick this being the only foundation whereon he built the hopes of his success in the intended declaration of his love  my lord stanley finding him among a set or kind of arbor of trees near a cascade in a very pensive posture told him i am sorry my lord if i disturb your thoughts because i am sensible your mind is taken up with something that touches you very near the earl of pembrook sighed and without answering his question only told him with a forced smile that indifferency was the happiest thing in the world i easily guess at your meaning returned my lord stanley you are in love and have reason of complaint the earl fearing he might dive too far into his sentiments thought fit to divert him by making him his pretended confident and relating to him an old adventure of his as if it were one of a very late date  i must own to you said he that to forget the ungrateful lelia i resolved to enter into an amorous engagement in good earnest with a lady who might really deserve it twas not long before i got acquainted with a widow a most charming creature who though she was passed the first flower of her youth yet still retained a thousand beauties whose luster was increased by her lively wit and most engaging conversation she gave me great demonstrations of her esteem though she pretended to a most severe virtue but in hopes that time would produce more favorable sentiments in her i courted her with all the ardour and application that could be but one day happening to come to her house when she did not expect me i entered the door and in a great lookinglass that hung in her bedchamber and faced the entry i espied a certain young pedaut who being lately come out of some universitycolledge she had made a tutor to her son if you had but seen his lank greesy hair you must have owned he would make but a very loathsome bedfellow for so nice a lady besides that his face was so ugly as was enough to frighten me so away i went immediately but did not forget to write her every thing that anger could inspire me with and to give her to understand the reason of it and my constant aversion to such pretended virtuous ladies she touched to the quick and thinking it less disadvantagious to make me her confident than to let me have a sinister opinion of her virtue sent to me one of her relations being the only person that was privy to her marriage with this fellow who gave me a full account of it i protest to you that i was more surpised at this than at the first but you may believe i made the best use of it  was to cure my self of my passion it being contrary to my inclinations to love what i cannot esteem however i am forced to offer constant violences to my heart and have taken a positive resolution to avoid all ladys as the bane of our tranquillity and whenever i feel but the least inclination for any one i am sure i will never see her again whilst i live  you threaten the fair sex very hard and i believe more than you are able to perform replied my lord stanley i think we may both defy them said the earl abruptly my sister will give you a favorable reception replied my lord if she be but acquainted with your resolution how returned the earl would she not have one love that which is lovely no added my lord she is such an enemy of all manner of gallantry that nothing can be more terrible than she to a lover come then let us go to see her and do you make her sensible of your rare resolution had my lord bin sensible what affections these words caused in his friend he would have acted with more caution and he might soon have discovered the symptoms thereof in his very eyes had he but looked at him but little guessing at his intentions he thought no further on the matter  whilst the earl of pembrook was going toward the countesss apartment he was oppressed with such a confusion of thoughts as is scarce to be expressed are not my chains already weighty enough said he to himself must i go to see her to augment my passion and can i flatter my self that the earl of warwick is absolutely indifferent to her it is true she has writ to him in harsh terms but alas this may be the effect of anger jealousy or some error committed by him these things are soon passed by when a person truly loves so that the resolution i have taken of disclosing to her my passion may prove perhaps the most fatal action of my life he was a thousand times upon the point of changing his dangerous resolution but the pleasure he proposed to himself got the better over all the considerations of danger and thus as he was entering the countesss bedchamber he had much ado to forbear running straightways to the fair ladys bedside where she appeared in a negligent dress attired with nothing but her own charms with somewhat a pale countenance enough to discover her grief but in the midst of her languishment there appeared still such a luster in her eyes as proved dangerous in effect to all that beheld them  the earl of pembrook is come to tell you something that will charm you said my lord stanley as he was entering her chamber he hates love and flies all opportunities relating to it he is got away from court to seek for shelter here i am afraid i have not chosen my ground very well to fight in replied the earl interrupting him but madam my lord talks at random he ought to tell you the reasons that engaged me into these resolutions which i intend to justify to you alone keep to your resolution replied the countess to love no more dont alter your design and if my brother would follow my advice i would have him do so too i dont desire to engage you whilst you have such a second said my lord stanley to his sister adieu i am a going a hunting and if i meet with some solitary place it may be i may bestow the day there upon my thoughts so he went out of the room leaving the earl at full liberty to entertain the countess it is certain twas the only thing in the world the earl was desirous of yet found himself at a stand for though he knew very well what he intended to say he knew not whether she would mind it so their conversation was at first upon indifferent matters  by your absence madam said he the court is robbed of its chiefest ornament every thing looks very melancholy there since you have left it i used to appear there so seldom replied she that i can scarce be missed it is far madam from what you guess at said he the king often speaks of you and the earl of warwick cannot forget you what is it you tell me my lord said she with a blush the king saw me by chance at a seat near windsor where he was received with that respect as was due to his person and has never looked after me since the earl came along with general talbot to pay a visit to my lord devonshire and i never saw him above twice or thrice in my life i cannot but conclude from what you say added the earl that you have quite razed him out of your memory and rejoice at it as at a piece of good news  at these words the countess not questioning but that the same letter which was restored to her by the chevalier de hereford was also fallen into the hands of the earl of pembrook she was so afflicted thereat as to break forth into tears oh cried the earl kneeling before her bedside what is it i see you are in tears my divine countess you weep this happy mortal has cost you many a sigh dont misconstrue my just indignation by false appearances said she to him and believe me that i hate the earl of warwick as he deserves you hate him madam yes i hate him said she the very remembrance of him is insupportable to me he is still happier than i replied the earl sighing you dont hate him till after having honored him with your particular esteem whilst you look upon me with so indifferent an eye as if i was not worth your hatred but madam continued he since he has bin so bold as to love you and you have known it without being offended at it may not i be permitted to say that i feel for you all that admiration the most passionate respect and a most sincere passion are able to inspire a man with i dont propose to raise my fortune upon the ruins of his or to deserve any thing at your hands at the price of his destruction though he be a very dangerous rival i have within me a certain generosity that does not in the least agree with such actions but give me leave to declare to you my real sentiments they being such as will not wound your virtue and the flame of that great light which affords us the satisfaction of the day is not composed of a purer matter than that which burns in my heart my lord said the countess interrupting him you have taken too much the advantage of the confusion and trouble you saw me in you have told me what highly displeases me and what convinces me more and more in my opinion that there is not a more unfortunate person upon earth than my self were the earl of warwick of a more honorable temper than he is he would not have forgotten to tell you when he spoke of our conversation that i never gave him any occasion of bragging of his good fortune and that i omitted nothing to deliver my self from his persecutions but that fatal star which bestowed upon me something of beauty did it doubtless to my destruction it would be more happy for me to be hated by all the world than to be beloved after the same manner i am now but be it as it will my lord i have too high an esteem for you to quarrel with you i will forget every thing you told me provided you promise not to see me any more what an odd sort of pardon is this madam replied he abruptly what to promise to avoid seeing you no no i am not any more thus far master of my own actions as to engage my word for a thing of such a nature alas what is it i have not endured since i saw you in the wood near chelsea in the utmost luster of your beauty you may talk what you please answered the countess were i not in bed i would leave you but my mind is taken up with such variety of things that it is an easy matter for me not to hear you  this indifferency or rather slight more nearly affected the earl than if she had broken out into violent expressions oh madam cried he i am too sensible that you pursue your own resolutions you cannot persuade me that you hate love but you may convince me with ease that you hate me it is time to dye continued he i must dye and so bowing his head to the ground remained immovable like a man without his senses the countess fearing he might be surpised upon his knees near her bedside desired him to take his seat i am so unfortunate said she to him that even the most innocent things become criminal if they have any relation to me and i hope you will not augment my pain by adding new ones to it the earl took his seat but spoke not one word more so that this dumb conversation beginning to prove tedious he arose on a sudden made a profound reverence and so left her chamber and immediately after the house finding himself not in a condition to carry on matters there without danger of being discovered by some of the family in his intentions  he came not to london till it was late that he might the better keep concealed for some days in his own house which time he spent in endeavoring to calm the tempest in his mind after that he came to court where he met with a favorable reception from the king who asked him whether he had acquitted himself of the commission he had charged him with the earl told him that he could find no opportunity of speaking to her alone and that it seemed as if she knew his errand by her being so cautious in avoiding it she was not much in the wrong of it said the king smiling but you cannot but own that she is much altered and so i am revenged of her the earl of pembrook who had reason enough to wish that his master might think of her no more replied she was scarce to be known and that it seemed almost not natural for so handsome a person to grow so ugly her extravagant love for the earl of warwick is the cause of it said the king but do you imagine that she still loves him sir replied he i had sight of her but one moment she seemed to be full of grief but spoke not a word of the earl of warwick he will not be concerned at it added the king he loves her no more his predominant passion is to plague madam gray he hates her mortally and would always persuade me that she is unfaithful but i am too well acquainted with the cause of his hatred to believe him i would have you tell him that i dont like it that every thing he says upon that head appears suspicious to me and that if he will oblige me he shall make his court to her  the earl of pembrook being very well inclined to execute the kings command went immediately to the earl of warwick who received him with all the marks of a tender friendship what news do you bring me said the earl from madam devonshire is she still in the same humor against me she is in so languishing a condition replied the earl of pembrook that i believe she has not strength enough left to love or hate any thing and i never saw her but in company where there was no opportunity of talking of you i am overjoyed you have no news to tell me from her continued the earl of warwick which might have stopped my progress in what i have advanced within these few days it is true my lord i have almost quite forgot her i congratulate you answered the earl of pembrook coldly but can scarce believe you i have since made many serious reflections upon every particular relating to that affair added the earl of warwick and find nothing but matter of trouble and vexation in it you know what i have told you before upon that head i never enjoyed one day with content i was forced to hazard every thing to get sight of her but for one moment and that even against her consent i was surrounded by the king and the general on one side and by her husband and madam gray on the other judge what a sort of entertainment this was for one not acquainted with disappointments however i loved her too well to be checked by these difficulties none but her self could have altered my resolution you know how she managed the matter and what a most gracious farewell she bestowed upon me whilst i suffered such a harsh banishment upon her account all these reasons have had such an influence upon me that i begin to relish the sweets of a real indifferency add to this my engagement with a lovely person who treats me as well as the countess did ill you cannot but agree with me that i could not do better than to take a fixed resolution of consulting my own repose  the earl of pembrook hearkened to his words with a great deal of pleasure oh said he to himself and why should the fair countess not be acquainted with the earl of warwicks indifferency for her it is possible a noble and generous anger may plead in my behalf then remembering the kings command believe me said he my lord you should give a visit to madam gray and if you cannot prevail so far upon your self as to forgive her in good earnest do it at least in outward appearance it is no small trouble to the king to see his favorite and his mistress always at open war and you talk of her to him in so disobliging a manner that instead of making your court you displease him i am sensible of it as much as your self replied the earl and know my self in the wrong to take so much pains to cure him of a passion which will carry him too far for his glory i am also willing to own to you that i should scarce be so zealous in the matter were it not to revenge my self for what she has done to me so tht as the case stands i can do no otherwise than to be her declared enemy after your return from caerleon replied the earl of pembrook you gave your word to the king that you would live in a good correspondence with her and so i would said he did she use me well but is it not an odd thing that he is dissatisfied with me because i am sensible of her immensurable ambitious designs you are prevented by passion replied the earl of pembrook it is hard to imagine that her designs reach so high she being the widow only of a private gentleman no matter for that said the earl of warwick she to well knows her own strength so they parted the earl of pembrook being highly rejoiced at what he had heard the earl of warwick confess during this conversation so that thinking himself freed of a dangerous rival he made his court to the king but did not neglect to infuse into the king such sentiments concerning madam gray as might make him be upon his guard  whilst every thing was in tranquillity at court fresh matter of vexation arose at twittenham the chevalier de hereford we have had occasion to mention before being of the same family with the earl of devonshire a mutual confidence and friendship had bin contracted betwixt them but to render this durable the chevalier must either never have seen the countess of devonshire or proved less sensible of her charms he looked upon the first beginning of his passion only as an effect of compassion for her knowing that a woman of so haughty a temper as she must needs resent highly the unjust jealousies of a husband when he saw the letter she writ to the earl of warwick this augmented his esteem seeing she intended to check his passion and that if she had a particular value for him before others her heart nevertheless had kept it self within the strictest rules of her duty these confused thoughts by degrees being met in good order he looked upon the countess as the most beautiful person in the world who being shut up in the country might by little and little be accustomed to hearken to his passion  twas this that made him so anxious in taking that occasion of setting her at variance with the earl of warwick for a secret lover has gained a good step if he can remove the person beloved by his mistress every thing succeeded according to his desire my lady devonshire misled by the honorable deportment of the chevalier conceived a hatred against the earl of warwick she detested his perfidiousness as on the other hand she thought her self obliged to the chevalier for having restored her letter to her this obligation joined to the confidence her lord put in him induced her to see him frequently and even to talk to him with an absolute sincerity several months passed thus the chevalier being not as yet fully acquainted with his own sentiments i told you before he thought it was only esteem and compassion that engaged him in her interest to inveigh against the earl of warwick and make her raze him out of her remembrance but love is an evil that will not lie concealed he began to be sensible that he was caught in the snare himself he did all he could to cure his passion but it proved too late on the other hand the countess showing him a thousand innocent marks of her friendship to acquire his each of these proved a snare wherein the chevalier saw himself entangled past all hopes of getting out for upon his return london where he intended to stay for some time every thing proved as irksome to him as if he had bin in a strange country his only satisfaction in the world now being to see the countess  all this while he loaded himself with a thousand reproaches to abuse thus the friendship of the earl of devonshire his dear kinsman who had opened his very bosom to him no would he cry sometimes i will see her no more i will choose a voluntary banishment from that house where my reception is such as to disturb all my repose he staid for some time at london and thought to divert himself with appearing constantly at court but all this was unpleasing to him he was forced in spite of himself to return to my lord devonshires whilst he was thus struggling with the most violent passions that ever a man did he fell most dangerously ill at twittenham the countess being just then upon her recovery and of a very grateful temper being sensible also that to take care of the chevalier was in effect to oblige her husband would sit whole days together by his bedside which piece of goodness was so far from accelerating his cure that as often as she came into the chamber his fever increased at last his condition became so dangerous that the physicians advised him to be carried to london  the countess of devonshire being the first who told him of the physicians advice she perceived him to be highly concerned thereat what is it makes your countenance change thus says she madam replied he i am very ready to obey you and to disclose to you the cause which has reduced me to this condition you see me in it is the pain i feel of being removed out of your sight without any hopes of ever returning hither again dont tell me a thing that must needs afflict me replied she your health is not in so desperate a state we shall see one another again chevalier and i shall be overjoyed at it i should dye too happy said he durst i flatter my self with this hope but you will soon hate me madam when i have declared to you that i love you yes added he i love you to such a degree that the violence i have offered to my self not to disclose it is that which has reduced me to that state you see me in if you have any remnants of compassion to plead in my behalf conceal from me your resentment or rather dont conceive a hatred divine countess against one whose death will be a suffering revenge to you  he said no more after having uttered these few words his eyes seeming as if he looked for mercy in madam devonshires face and she actually looked upon him with more compassion than anger i have some obligations to you chevalier said she i cannot forget in spite of the displeasure you give me at this time but he assured i never received any that affected me more alas i considered you as a faithful friend in whose conversation i might find some relief against those vexations which have so sensibly afflicted me for some time past and now i must lose you oh that unfortune beauty which to another would prove an object of satisfaction is to me a constant source of pain which are renewed every day to me the abundance of tears that fell from her fair eyes intermixed with sobs and sighs would not give her leave to say more but the chevalier taking the word what is it i see cried he madam you cry and i am in some measure the occasion of it will my death be a sufficient expiation of my crime i dont wish for your death replied she but for your cure and so perfect a cure that you may never speak to me again in the same manner as you did just now i have not power enough to make you such a promise said he it will be much easier for me to avoid the sight of you than to stifle a passion i shall be forced to cherish in spite of all your rigor why was not i made the earl of warwick is it possible said the countess not without some symptoms of indignation that if you have those sentiments for me you just now discovered is it possible i say you should envy the fortune of him who is the most cruel enemy i have in the world alas madam said he to her you deceive your self if you believe you hate my lord warwick that secret concern i had in diving into your real sentiments has often made me speak of him without any diffidence or dissimulation i have bin too sensible that he is still very dear to you and it has often brought me to the brink of despair but madam the esteem i bore you made me keep silence i durst not make you sensible of your own sentiments my fear of discomposing or displeasing you was such an untrespassable law to me as to fain that i did not perceive the ascendant he got over your heart and though i was very assiduous in removing those jealousies which so much afflicted the earl of devonshire i talked to him against my own knowledge but i spoke to him madam for your repose being ready at the same time to sacrifice all mine to yours  though you are very much mistaken in your guess said the countess interrupting him i think my self nevertheless obliged to your conduct both in respect of my husband and my self but i can assure you were you less prejudiced than you are or better acquainted with my present inclinations you would not accuse me as you do of so much weakness to return any favorable sentiments for the most dishonorable person in the world nay i would sooner have pardoned him for having contrived my death than for having endeavored to stain my reputation in the world then you dont love him replied the chevalier sighing i hate him passed all recovery said she if it be so continued he may i hope for nothing from your compassion you may be assured answered she that i will forget every thing you told me to day provided you give me no reason of complaint for the future i rather will choose a voluntary exile said he i am not in a condition to keep my word upon that point as you require i must then madam forbear seeing you and the earl of devonshire will perhaps not be in a better humor for i have often calmed his rage and no other but my self would have known how to merit something from you upon that score but said she interrupting him is it possible you should bare so little respect to him as to talk to me at the rate you do i protest to you i can scarce believe it and that of all mankind who are subject to such frailties you were the last one i suspected in that kind i cannot justify my conduct said he if it is a crime madam i suppose i shall soon expiate it by the loss of a life that has bin for a long time odious to me he had scarce uttered these last words when falling into a swoon all his senses left him and the countess divided betwixt compassion and resentment called for help but at the same time left the room and retired to her own chamber where she found albine who then had not as yet forfeited all her credit with her  alas albine said she to her full of trouble what a strange scene has bin acted here my misfortunes instead of diminishing increase every moment the chevalier de hereford has made to me such a declaration as puts me quite beyond my self him i looked upon as my best friend but he proves as indiscreet as the earl of pembrook besides i am under a great dilemma how to deal with him for if i use him roughly he will perhaps be revengeful and you know my lord hearkens to and believes every thing he says if i show him some complaisance what construction will he make of my indulgence and what is it i must not fear hereafter this will render my condition but worse and after all am i mistress of my own heart of that heart i say so often revolts against all the dictates of my reason which is so very frail as to make me to this day discover some merit in my most mortal enemy yes albine it is not is my power to hate the earl of warwick how happy am i in not seeing him how much am i in love with this solitude it is true i suffer here but no matter as long as i preserve here my innocence  hitherto albine durst not speak in behalf of the earl of warwick for her mistress seeming so highly exasperated against him she did not believe he had retained so good a place in her heart as she found he did so she would not neglect this opportunity perhaps said she madam the earl is not so guilty as he has bin represented to you remember now it was the chevalier de hereford who rendered him thus criminal in your eyes and is it not very probable that at that very time he might have his secret designs of ruining him in your opinion no no cried the countess i remain unalterable in respect to the earl of warwick his behavior has bin such that i must be blinder than any woman in the world to be deceived in it neither do i deceive my self continued she i only deplore the excess of my misfortunes that i should meet with so many enemies amongst those very persons who owe me the most respect she then kept silence in a pensive posture without giving the least attention or answer to what albine further told her  immediately after the earl of devonshire coming into the chamber and seeing the dangerous state of his kinsman was much afflicted thereat and being the only person whom he had made the confident of his jealousy he resolved to go along with him to london and to stay there till his full recovery he told the countess that he intended to go to london because he should not enjoy himself in the country if he should let him go alone and that if his distemper should prove of any long continuance he desired madam anglesey and her to come to town likewise she answered coldly that he might have dispensed himself from going by committing him to the care of some trusty person but that he was his own master and that her credit was so inconsiderable with him that she durst not attempt to engage him to stay at twittenham he gave her a surly look and without speaking one word went out of the room soon after hearing a noise in the court she found it was the chevalier de hereford and the earl of devonshire both upon their departure for london the first in a horselitter and the other in his coach they were no sooner arrived there but the earls of warwick and pembrook being the first that got notice thereof this served to revive their passions for the earl of warwick could not flatter himself to speak to the countess as long as her husband arguslike watched her himself and the earl of pembrook imagined that being now at liberty she would enjoy the advantage thereof and afford him a more favorable reception  he was so far from making the least mystery of his intended journey to twittenham that he visited the earl of devonshire upon that account who gave him some letters to his lady however he concealed it from the earl of warwick whom he still looked upon as his rival notwithstanding the hatred he bore to madam gray and the pains he took to encompass her ruin seemed to divert his passion a contrary way as she was not ignorant of all the steps he took for that end and on her side repaid him in the same coin the king was constantly troubled with the complaints of his favorite against his mistress and with hers against him he was engaged in the same interest with mrs elizabeth lucy a lady of quality and of extraordinary beauty the king whilst he was yet earl of march entered into an amorous intrigue with her which was not interrupted by the luster of his crown but the charms both of mind and body joined in the person of madam gray did not a little dazzle and prevail over those of the young mrs lucy she resented the matter like an injured mistress and would frequently engage the earl of warwick to give the king an account of the sinister conduct of madam gray but this coming from a suspected hand whom he knew to be her enemy the king would say this lovely widow is faithful to me why would you have me check my passion for her and who can you think of should be the person she would prefer before me if love and reason did always go hand in hand replied the earl your majesty might rest assured that madam gray was sensible of her good fortune and that what i say against her was not consonant to truth but sir love is blind put her to the trial and to such a one as may put it beyond all doubt that you are in full possession of her heart or at least that may justify her conduct the king tired out with these repeated accusations told him one day that he owed him no obligation for the trouble he gave himself i desire no reward from your majesty replied he with a great deal of frankness but i shall at least have the satisfaction of having done my duty oh said the king your zeal is very troublesome you may show it upon other occasions and not disturb me any further in matters relating to my mistress but all this did not check the earl of warwicks resolution he often told the king many things of her which proved most generally false but at the same time furnished no small matter of vexation to the fair widow and what most of all afflicted her was that he was ready upon all occasions to extol the merits of mrs elizabeth lucy who she feared might one time or other alienate the kings inclinations from her so that she was at open enmity with the earl  thus matters went at court when the earl of devonshire and the chevalier de hereford came to london the earl of warwick who still retained in his mind the charms of the countess of devonshire and who most passionately desired to speak with her to reproach her rigor and to recover his credit with her if it were not entirely lost would certainly have given her a visit at twittenham had it not bin that he looked upon the destruction of madam gray as the most essential point on which depended both his repose and grandeur he had already made such steps toward her removal from the kings favor as would have proved infallible with any other person except the king quite prepossessed with an high opinion of her but being daily in hopes of finding out something that might tend to the disadvantage of his enemy he delayed his journey to twittenham for some time  the earl of pembrook had also not laid aside his design being desirous to dive into those of the earl of warwick entered into discourse with him concerning my lady devonshire and the earl not in the least imagining that he talked to his rival told him without the least reserve that were it not for some business of the greatest consequence he had at court he would endeavor to see the fair countess in disguise pembrook overjoyed to find the earl employed otherwise resolved not to lose a moment to accomplish the design he had laid of carrying away the countess to one of his seats where he intended to keep her secretly as long as possibly he could without hearkening to or valuing the danger which his reason laid before him for he was in love and that is all as can be said in his justification  to encompass his end he had caused a kind of a barge to be built finely painted and gilded after the same manner as they were said to be used in the indies that so having nothing of the european modal in it the ladies might be surprised with its novelty as well as with the habit of him who was the pretended master thereof who represented both in his garb actions and looks an english indian merchant lately come from those parts the disguised earl was no sooner got up the river with his barge as far as twittenham but he sent his interpreter to invite the countesses of anglesey and devonshire aboard her to take a view of what rarities he had to dispose of accordingly they came aboard her the next day where their eyes being glutted with great variety of rich indian stuffs and other rarities the merchant told the young countess that if she would come without her mother the next day he would show and sell her the richest silks that ever she saw in her life and why would not you have my mother come along with me said she because replied he at my departure from the indies i made a vow to our gods not to dispose of any of these richest stuffs but to young persons the countess laughed at the merchants fancy and did not come again the next following day so her curiosity brought her thither the day after attended only by some few of her women  whilst she was busy in viewing and picking out what she liked best they had hoisted sail and the barge went forward apace before she perceived it but dreaming of nothing asked the indianmerchant whether they were a going to the indies madam replied he the emperor my master sent me on purpose to carry you to him the countess laughed at it taking it for a jest but perceiving they went on as fast as they could she began to be frightened in good earnest dont think to carry me any further if you do i will kill my self the earl of pembrook seeing her so resolute told her madam dont fear it is the earl of warwick who has sent me he must either see you or dye and he has ordered me to convey you to some delicious place where you will see him more amorous and more faithful than ever  the countess more enraged than before told him she would not see him while she lived and that before they could bring her to the place where the earl of warwick was she would either drown or kill her self with her own hands the excess of her despair discovered it self both in her countenance and actions it is true she did not cry but casting most furious looks to the water showed that she aimed at the river the earl of pembrook lay at her feet not daring to discover himself for fear of increasing her fury but did all he could to appease it telling her he would carry her back to twittenham if she was positively bent upon it she vouchsafed him not one word but on a sudden threw her self into the thames good god what a surprise was this to her passionate lover he little thought she would have taken so fatal a resolution and now despising his own life leaped in after her being a good swimmer he soon got hold of her gown as she was rising in the water but not withstanding this they had both bin drowned together had not some of their watermen come timely to their assistance  the women of her attendence seeing their mistress without sense or motion sent forth most doleful cries to heaven and the earl of pembrook seeing that since the plot would not take under the name of the earl of warwick there was but little hopes for him resolved without discovering himself to set the countess down where he had taken her up madam said he to her after she was come to her self again you need not have thus hazarded your life by throwing your self into the river to force me to turn back to twittenham our intention was to make you happy but since youre against it there is no reason we should incur your hatred when our business was to deserve your good will live madam live for a jealous husband fly your truest friend it is your ill star that rules you and you will have occasion enough to repent of it hereafter away away impostor said she go and try your skill upon some less virtuous or more credulous person than my self and thank heavens i am of the weaker sex or else i would make you feel the effects of my just resentment for the game you were going to play me whilst they were talking thus they were got so near the bank of the river that by the help of a long plank the countess and her women could get conveniently out of the barge the earl of pembrook having changed his indian habit for that of an european did the same not long after on the opposite side and night approaching gave them an opportunity of unloading the cargo and having set fire to the vessel they all got to london without which they might have soon bin discovered and taken by the country people  in effect the countess of devonshire her self immediately prepared her self against the ill consequences which she foresaw would attend this attempt for some of the inhabitants of twittenham had seen her go into the barge which immediately made the best of her way down the river others had seen her plunge her self into the river and the indianmerchant after her all which causing no small surprise the news thereof was soon carried to the earl of anglesey the old countess uneasy to know what was become of her daughter run to the riverside where she found her wet all over just after she was scarce well got out of the boat and asked her very abruptly what a fine walk she had taken the young countess appeared much discomposed which creating a suspicion in her mother she told her without staying for her answer she had played some trick of youth wherein love had a greater share than reason i protest to you madam replied the countess of devonshire you do me the greatest piece of injustice in the world you have taken a prejudice against me were it not so you would believe what i am a going to relate to you concerning this adventure but i am almost assured you will not give credit to what i say you ought not to be judge of my thoughts answered my lady anglesey speak only and i shall soon guess whether you are sincere or not in the condition i am now in added she it will not be proper to give the whole recital thereof immediately but i will justify my self when we come to your apartment so they got into the coach the young countess being in such a confusion as if she had bin actually guilty though every thing considered especially her attempting to drown her self there was but little cause of suspecting her to have had a hand in the plot  she was no sooner got home but she went to bed where she felt her mind distracted with a thousand reflections concerning the earl of warwick the attempt he had made appearing to her unpardonable according to the rules of virtue and good manners to carry away a married lady of her quality and conduct appeared to be so presumptuous an action as could not take rise but from a love without bounds she fancied she saw him at her feet vowing an eternal respect to her and to excuse himself on account of his love to have bin wanting in it notwithstanding which she remained much exasperated against him how to carry me away by force said she to the old albine what an opinion must he have of me and if he has how can he love me but if he thinks well of me which way could he suppose i would remain as much as one moment in his power alas continued she all what has happened will be laid at my door and at that very time i endeavor to forget the earl of warwick and even deny my self the pleasure of thinking of him they will imagine that i was willing to follow him to some solitary place how happy had i bin added she had i not bin saved from the danger i underwent this very day it would have saved me a world of disgrace during the whole course of my miserable life having spoken these words she cried most bitterly albine then taking the liberty to interrupt her twould be unjust said she to charge you with a thing you have no share in no madam dont disturb your self your innocence will confound your enemies and if the earl of warwick be never so much irritated against you he cannot but admire and publish your virtue lovers in their anger give an but indifferent character of their mistresses besides whatever he can say of me will be looked upon as suspicious but albine what will the earl of devonshire what will my mother think of it i am sure they will judge me guilty oh fatal day to my repose oh cursed attempt what is it i have committed to draw this misfortune upon me  whilst she was in this agony the countess of anglesey came into the room the confusion she observed in her at first meeting near the riverside had made her resolve to go to the utmost extremity with her daughter but upon further considerations thought it best to shut her self up for some time in her chamber to restore to her mind that tranquillity she thought absolutely requisite in an affair of this nature the young countess perceiving her to be pretty calm her fear was changed into a reasonable confidence so kissing her mothers hand several times she gave her a sincere account of the whole transaction and notwithstanding her inclinations for the earl of warwick did not forget to tell her that he was the author of it believed it was sufficient to speak the truth to persuade her mother that she did so but the old countess recalling to her mind the picture dropped out of the earls pocket with many other circumstances which made her then suspect a correspondence betwixt them now thought she was fully convinced that her daughter had the misfortune of being in love and to be beloved her austere temper could not suffer the foresight of the dangers she supposed her daughter would be exposed to so that instead of condoling her she broke out into reproaches she told her the confession she had made her seemed to her an affect only of constraint since she had told her nothing but what must be divulged a course but that she could very easily see through that affected air of simplicity and ingenuity that she might rest assured she would always side with my lord devonshire to keep her under seeing she had bin so unfortunate as to suffer her self to be led away by such sentiments as must make her blush the young countess remained so highly afflicted at the construction her mother upon put her sincere confession that she was not able to speak one word more in her own behalf her silence serving only to accomplish her mothers suspicions against her she left her convinced as she thought that the earl of warwick had not made this attempt without her consent after all this though the countess of anglesey judged her daughter guilty of this error she was too wise a woman not to take all possible precautions to conceal it from the earl of devonshire she was willing to reduce her daughter within bounds without being accessory to her ruin  in the mean while the earl of devonshire had scarce ever bin at twittenham the illness of the chevalier his friendship for him and his indifferency for his wife kept him constantly in london he attended constantly at court and had he not bin sensible that the countess was the most lovely person in the world he might perhaps have looked out for another engagement but there are certain charms the characters whereof are indelible thus he might perhaps never have heard of the attempt made upon his wife had not the earl of pembrook after his return to london distracted with spleen and malice resolved to find out the cure of his passion in his continual application of making his fortune for though the king had a peculiar regard to him he might have bin much more in his favor had he taken the true course for it but his lovepassion for the countess being to him instead of every thing he took more pleasure to employ his thoughts upon her in his closet than to pursue his advantage by attending constantly at court  he now began to relent at the time he had lost and the desire he had of being revenged of the earl of warwick who stood betwixt him and the kings absolute favor made him enter into a strict friendship with edward woodwill earl of rivers a person more remarkable for his high deserts than for his being the brother of the fair widow for the rest his fortune being not very considerable and the earl of pembrook who was one of the richest lords in the kingdom making him a sharer in his whole fortune this act of generosity so far affected madam gray that she thought the earl wanted nothing to make him complete in her eyes than to have an extreme aversion to the earl of warwick the earl also had given her to understand that had he met with a less rival in his way than the king he should have made his addresses to her and as she was for nothing less than a match she could have wished he had bin her spouse he being a person well shaped magnificent and engaging in conversation so that every thing concurred to settle a good correspondence betwixt them  the earl of pembrook knew very well what subject of complaint madam gray had against the earl of warwick and endeavored to hate him as much as she did having perhaps as pressing reasons for it as she among other things he took delight to relate to her as if it had bin a true story the attempt that earl had made for carrying madam devonshire away without her consent he would give her a description of the boat with some other circumstances that attended this enterprise as he pretended viz how by mischance she fell into the river which broke all their measures madam gray was surpised to understand that so unaccountable an action performed within eight or nine miles of london should have made not the least noise and that the earl of devonshire who was the person most concerned therein should be so little acquainted with it as to continue at court she was no less surpised at the earl of warwick he had in all appearance made all his applications to his new mistress he had fixed his business and pleasures in the same place his whole deportment and air appeared altogether composed is it possible said she a man should be so perfect a master in the art of dissimulation who could have suspected him whilst he feasts all the ladies at court and is scarce ever out of their company he should contrive how to carry away one in short it being agreed betwixt her and the earl of pembrook to divulge the thing he gave her a full account of all the particulars relating to it and who could better do it than himself nothing was omitted as she was a declared enemy of the earl of warwicks she told the king of it who showed a greater concern thereat than she desired is it possible said he that a person of his capacity and extraction should thus far bid farewell to reason as to seek thus his own destruction for ever if she had once taken a resolution to allow her self full liberty why did not she pitch upon my heart before that of so indiscreet and inconstant a man these words being not very pleasing to the fair widow she blushed more than once but thought it best to say nothing  the king was so full of this news that the first time he saw the earl of warwick he spoke to him of it and the earl being much surpised thereat the king thought it had bin feigned to avoid to come to a sincere confession so that there wanted but little of his being in a great passion and as the earl of warwick could not devise how such an adventure wherein he had not the least share should be laid to his charge he was so taken up with his thoughts thereupon that not observing the king was in earnest he turned the whole story into ridicule though at the same time he resolved to find out the bottom of the design on the other hand madam greys hatred to the countess of devonshire was such as not to suffer her to let slip so fair an opportunity of revenging her quarrel she took effectual care to make the earl of devonshire acquainted with what had happened at twittenham and as he was very apt to believe his own misfortune he communicated it to the chevalier de heresord who bore his full share in his afflictions whilst the earl of pembrook kept the key of the whole secret in his own hands twas he that had the satisfaction of seeing so many persons concerned in the interest of my lady devonshire reduced almost to despair and himself thus revenged for her cruel treatment though it is certain he would scarce have carried the matter so far had it not bin to oblige madam gray for whom he began already to have a most singular esteem  the earl of warwick once more felt the true symptoms of jealousy he thought himself cured of his passion he amused himself with another not without some satisfaction but now found himself more afflicted and more unfortunate than ever for supposing no otherwise than that he had bin slighted by the countess because she was engaged with another lover he had a thousand chimeras in his head upon that account which continually tormented him what projects of vengeance did he not contrive sometimes he was for advising the earl of devonshire how to deal with his wife sometimes for finding out his rival to stab him before the countesss face and at last concluded that this attempt had in it something so bold and irregular that he ought to reproach himself for retaining the least esteem in regard of a person who could expose her self to such an adventure the earl of pembrook ambitious to triumph over his rival went to give him a visit and the earl of warwick impatient to see and tell him of the attempt made upon the countess of devonshire and how it was laid at his door scarce would give him time to shut the door of the closet it is true said the earl of pembrook you are charged with it and truly it seems not very extraordinary if such a paris as you should ravish such a hellena as she is if even i loved her still i should be too much concerned for her reputation to expose her thus but as i dont love her any more it seems extravagant to lay a thing to my charge an action of so nice a nature what then can it be added the earl of pembrook that could raise this suspicion of the thing being transacted by your orders it is that what i am ignorant of and what i will endeavor to find out said the earl and you must assist me in it since i hope that in confessing your self a friend to madam gray to such a degree as you do you may nevertheless continue in the same tie of friendship with me as before the earl of pembrook told him that he would sooner renounce her than his friendship that he must own that when he first heard the relation of what had happened at twittenham he had believed it as all the rest did but that since he desired it he would endeavor to find it out thus they parted like the best friends in the world  the end of the first part memoirs of the earl of warwick part ii in the mean while the chevalier de hereford being sooner recovered of his illness than of his passion for the countess of devonshire and not able to resist this despair occasioned by the news of the attempt made upon the said countess thought of nothing more than how to satisfy his own revenge under the pretense of espousing the earl of devonshires quarrel dont love any things cruel womans love nothing would he say often by himself the misfortune of my rivals will he an allaying to my sufferings but dont fancy you are at liberty to make so unfair a choice for i will never suffer the e of warwick to enjoy alone the felicity of pleasing you what projects did not he frame upon that account alas unfortunate countess whose virtue and innocence were not sufficient to protect her against the furious assaults of her husband and her adversary the more she was beloved the more she was reputed guiy and the more they set their engines at work against her the earl of devonshire and the chevalier de hereford going together to twhittenham upon their approach to that seat where the countess was were seized with so furious a resentment that to calm their spirits they thought it necessary to stop for some time in a little wood it being after sun set and pretty cool they alighted and seated themselves under the trees after a few minutes silence the earl addressed himself thus to the chevalier i hope you will now no more oppose my just resentment and vengeance i hope i may now without injustice cloister up for ever this unfaithful woman and treat her in such a manner as the affront she has put upon me deserves i should not be well pleased my lord replied the chevalier to see you otherwise disposed than now you are there is no den dark enough for your wife you must chain her like a little lioness and make her taste the sour sauce i am afraid of her mothers tenderness for her added the earl it is not likely she will suffer her house to be made a prison for her daughter my lord stanley will take his sisters part and it will be but ill becoming my quality to aim at such a thing without being able to go through with it what you say is very judiciously considered replied the chevalier but you must bring them over to your side what can they say against it when you tell them that you are informed of her ill conduct that this late attempt makes a great noise at court that you are scoffed at by the earl of warwick and that your enemies triumph over your misfortunes it is an easy matter to find excuses to make up a breach in a family but believe me since it has once made so much noise we will not be over cautious we will carry away in our turn and we will be too nimble for her friends the chevalier highly approved his resolution and it was pretty late before they left off talking the countess of devonshire used almost every day to walk the same wood there to condole her disgrace and to give vent to her grief darkness and silence seeming to afford her some comfort in her present circumstances though her mother had restrained her within very narrow bounds she had nevertheless allowed her the liberty of withdrawing at some distance from those that attended her and to tarry by her self as long as she thought convenient the same chance that had directed the earl of devonshire and his kinsman very near to the place where she was seated would have it so that they should not see her and that she at the same time should hear every thing they discoursed together for though they talked not very loud yet being separated from them only by a number of thick hedges or shrubs or single trees they might have easily seen her it was scarce to be determined which was the greatest her despair or surprise she found her misfortunes to augment by a thousand additional circumstances one after another she now found to her cost that it was not enough to be innocent to avoid being accused or persecuted she was sensible she should furnish matter sufficient to the world to censure her conduct and she was convinced above all that her husband was going to take violent resolutions against her and that the chevalier de hereford being exasperated against her took this opportunity of being revenged for the indifferency she had shown him she at last was forced to see that the earl of warwick who had drawn upon her so many misfortunes and who was acquainted better than any other man in the court with what she had been capable of doing rather than fall into his hands remained an idle spectator on the injustices offered to her  these various reflections crouding in upon her spirits she was so confounded that at last she resolved to abide the thunderbolt that was striking at her head and to suffer her self to be carried whither the earl of devonshire should think convenient what matters it said she whether i die in a tower or in a den whether i am made away by dagger or poison let me be carried where i will let my death or destiny what it will my comfort will be in a good conscience i shall be satisfied i have nothing to upbraid my self with and that i suffer undeservedly these misfortunes that befall me is not all this sufficient to depart this life without regret but soon after considering with her self that her reputation lay at stake unless she could justify her self and that she ought not to neglect any means to maintain her innocence she took a firm resolution so to do looking upon it as a thing altogether worthy her care no said she i cannot resolve to put arms into my enemys hands if i make them masters of my destiny i shall never be in a condition to efface those suspicions the world has conceived against me is it not therefore much better to fly them and to conceal my self in some place or other does not heaven who thought fit i should overhear the discourse betwixt my husband and his kinsman seem to ordain me to make the best use of it every moment is now very precious to me having lost too many already but which way shall i secure my self how shall i get out of the wood without being perceived good god what am i a going to do to get out of one labyrinth i entangle my self in another  she arose trembling all over not daring to stir from her place but her husband and his kinsman being altogether taken up in discourse and the wind making such a noise among the leaves as not to permit them to hear what passed at a small distance from them she at last resolved to go and so moving gently from the place where she was made all the haste she could toward twittenham but was under no small perplexity whether she was to take the convenience of that river or to shelter her self in one of the adjacent cottages but notwithstanding this irresolution and the foresight she had of what danger she intended to avoid and what hazard she was likely to run she made all the haste thence that possibly she could a lady of her quality so young and so handsome as she to become a fugitive to fly like a criminal to avoid the rage of her husband could not but imagine that such a resolution would meet with a favorable construction in the world but the dread of a prison was such to her that she thought nothing too much to avoid it  at the same time she heard some noise and looking about her found them to be two horses without their riders and not doubting but that they belonged to the earl of devonshire and the chevalier de hereford they proved actually the same and being got loose were going back toward london she got upon one of them as slipping the bridle of the other for fear of being pursued she galloped away like lightning to lose no time being in a deadly fear and frightened at every thing she saw being a good horsewoman made a shirt to get to london sometime before day breaking and alighting from her horse which she let loose went to one that had been her nurse but was now a rich citizen in london one whom she knew to be very faithful and absolutely devoted to her service however for fear of being discovered she got her immediately to buy a suit of mens clothes which she wore and hid her long hair under a cap perriwigs being not in use in those days she appeared so very handsome and well shaped that every body that saw her was struck with admiration for she carried much of majesty in her whole body in her deportment appeared a certain mixture of haughtiness and sweetness and in her eyes an uncommon luster and vivacity of spirit and this disguise seemed to be so natural in her that all the world might have been deceived in it notwithstanding all this fearing least this might not prove a sufficient security against the vigilance of the earl of devonshire she told her nurse what apprehensions she lay under and the whole cause thereof hereupon it was agreed betwixt them she should write to one madam digby her friend who lived in the country to let her know she intended to send her son to her house because he had been engaged in a quarrel desiring she would give him a kind reception till the matter could be made up she having never seen this son it was an easy matter to impose another upon her in his stead so my lady devonshire left london for fear of being seen by some persons from whom she would carefully hide her self for that end she took no body along with her except an old trusty servant of her nurses who having brought her to madam digbys house and so returned to london but before we speak of her reception we must return to thwittenham  my lady devonshire being accustomed to pass many hours together near a brook which run cross the wood twas very late before her family began to wonder at her stay so that nothing but the fear they conceived of her being seized with a sudden illness made them go in search after her they were not a little surprised when they met there with the earl of devonshire and his kinsman who asked them whether they had not seen their horses and commanded them to look after them whilst some obeyed their orders the rest run through all the places of the wood whether the countess used to retire most frequently but in vain she was gone as i told you just now and the horse whom she had left behind finding himself without a bridle was run away the earl of devonshire knew nothing of his wifes having bin that evening in the wood so that when he was told that she was not to be found and that no body knew what was become of the horses he was surprised to the highest degree and it came immediately into his head that the thing was not an effect of chance but of her own choice and that she was more concerned in it than any body else he discovered his sentiments to the chevalier who was not of his opinion but said she might perhaps be gone back alone to the house that their best way was to go thither since if they had a mind to pursue her they had no horses so that he judged they could do no better than to go thither to be better informed concerning the whole matter  this being the first time the earl of devonshire and the chevalier came to thwittenham after what had happened upon the river every thing looked but with an indifferent aspect there my lady anglesey dreading her husbands anger in behalf of her daughter sent her one of her women to advise her not to stir out of her chamber till she had sounded the disposition of the earl but the person she had sent soon returned and whispered her in the ear that she was not there nor to be found any where having bin in the same wood at the same time the earl was there  this news proved the cause of fresh inquietudes and dreading all the sinister events for her daughter she could think of she changed color several times and what pains she took to conceal the disturbance of her mind served only to discover it the earl of devonshire and the chevalier de hereford went not without their share in these troubles the last asked how the countess did and whether she might be seen without incommoding her at these words my lady anglesey no longer able to keep silence oh my lord said she to her son in law you know better than any body else what is become of your wife i am not ignorant that you met with her because she comes not again what dreadful things have you told her you see she is not come back you dont do justice either to her virtue or merits the earl turning coldly toward her told her only in a few words that had he met with the countess they should have come home together that he was very uneasy at her absence and that he begged of her to let her be looked after and that he might go away with the rest so leaving the room he gave orders to hasten to the wood with lighted flambeaux this happened very well for the countess of devonshire who whilst they spent their time in searching for her in the wood had leisure given her to secure her self after a long search at last word was brought to the earl of devonshire that certain fresh prints of a horses hoof being traced in the more unfrequented parts of the wood it was likely the countess had taken that way in her flight the earl and the chevalier approving their opinions resolved to follow her themselves being unwilling to entrust any other  the tract they followed brought them to a steep hill where seeing no more signs of a horses hoof and it being now daybreak they alighted and seated themselves near a rivulet soon after they espied the chavalier de herefords horse running along full speed without saddle or bridle so that the chevalier who had not shaken off his passion for the fair countess thought he should have died for her tis no otherwise my lord cried he your lady has laid violent hands upon her self on this hill i just now have found out the whole mystery of it she did overhear our discourse in the wood and dreading your revenge took the opportunity of saving her self upon my horse doubtless she let him run where he would for all her aim being to secure her self by flight she did not care whither alas he has carried her into this desert and thrown her out of the saddle down one of the precipices you see not far from hence  though you might have read grief in his face the earl was so intent upon what he said that he little minded it all circumstances seem to concur to persuade me what you say to be true replied he but there are certain things that must not be divulged without an absolute certainty this is one of that kind if i should tell them my wife lost her life in such a manner as you tell me i know not but that the world may have malice enough to suspect me to be the author of it and if your conjectures should prove false if she is alive and appears again i shall be ridiculed beyond what a man is able to bear it is therefore my advice that after we have tried all means to find her out to retire to a certain old seat i have in the midst of a wood till we hear further how matters go  the chevalier approving of this proposition they continued to search in all the adjacent places but finding all their endeavors to prove in vain went to a village beyond the hills when coming to a little house with those that attended them they dispatched some to london and to several other places to go in quest of the countess  this done the earl and the chevalier remounted their horses and as they were going along spoke not so much as one word to one another their hearts being so full that they did not know where to begin the earl feared if you will believe him that his wife had killed her self and the chevalier dreaded it unto such a degree he had all the reason in the world to be convinced that he was not cured of his passion as he had flattered himself he was jealousy and hatred had possessed the earls mind love and fear were the predominant passions in that of the chevalier is it possible said he you should lose the most amiable person in the world that you should know she is dead and should carry it off with so much tranquillity who told you replied the earl that i have lost her and that i enjoy so much tranquillity i am the main person in this scene the part i am to act in it is so melancholy that it is not to be done indifferently this is one of those kind of afflictions which ought to be closed up within the inmost recesses of our heart without exposing them to public view you might give me a share in your misfortunes said the chevalier our friendship is such as not to allow of such a reserve and i cannot but be offended thereat i know not what your opinion is replied the earl coldly but this i know that you are disposed to accuse me unjustly he little dreamed that the chevalier could have given him sufficient reasons why he was more nearly concerned in the matter than himself but this had more consideration than to make him his confidant in this case his business being at this time to conceal from him the true condition of his heart  at last they came to the earls house in the wood a house built in the most unaccessible place of a forest so that they wanted a guide to conduct them thither the earl having been there but once before in all his lifetime the situation and appearance of this old house was such that it seemed to be chosen on purpose for a seat and nursery of melancholy  whilst they spent their time in this dismal place the earl of anglesey and his lady were ready to run distracted at twittenham at the uncertainty they lay under of what was become of their daughter and the more they loved her the more ingenious were they to torment themselves the earl of devonshire whose return they expected not without good reason had taken another way with his friend whence they conjectured that his conscience accused him of some ill action done by him to his wife and that therefore he would not abide the sight of them they caused search to be made for her in all corners and my lady anglesey finding herself every where uneasy left the country and went to london but could not leave her anxious thoughts behind her  twas next to an impossibility that an accident wherein so many persons of the first quality were concerned should not be known at court the king was soon acquainted that the countess could not be found and that her husband lay under a suspicion of having played her some ill game he compassionated heartily the misfortune of so lovely a person and the earl of warwick happening to come into his closet at that very moment whilst he was reflecting upon this odd accident he told him my lord what have you not to answer for on account of my lady devonshire it is believed she is dead and that your extravagant attempt to carry her away has been the occasion of it the earl was so surpised thereat as not to be able to give an answer for some time all the merits and charms of the countess appeared again so fresh in their utmost luster to his mind that the same fires which was thought to have extinguished was rekindled at once dont imagine sir said he that the change you observe in my face or the confusion you see me in is owing to any thing i have to reproach myself on account of what your majesty told me i never in my life made the least attempt of carrying away the countess nay i resented to the very heart the weakness i found she was guilty of upon this occasion for another person but myself and i actually flattered myself that this consideration cured me of my passion for her but sir i am sensible of all the effects of her charms by that direful fear i am in never to see her again it is this that puts me into the most deplorable condition in the world his eyes then were covered with tears which the king observing told him warwick you cry no sir replied the earl i am not guilty of so much weakness oh cry on cry on said he it is no crime in a lover that is cherished by his mistress to bewail her i never had any occasion to consider her upon that point continued the earl for she always slighted or at least showed an indifferency for me which made me engage in another amor and thought i had almost razed her out of my heart but i must confess to your majesty that the uncertainty of her destiny puts me into such a degree of despair i am not able to overcome be it as it will answered the king whether you did intend to carry her away or whether you have been otherwise the cause of her ruin i am concerned for you and the best thing you can do is to wean yourself of your passion the earl answered only with a deep reverence i knowing it to be a thing he should find very difficult to encompass and his heart being quite overcome with grief took his leave as soon as possibly he could  as he was passing through the privy garden next adjacent to the court he meets the earl of pembrock in a shady dark walk and hoping to find some consolation in discoursing his friend upon this subject matter he accosted him with so melancholy an air that the other immediately perceived he had something of ill news to bring that very near concerned him alas my lord said the earl of warwick i shall see her no more whom do you speak of replied the earl of pembrock interrupting him i can speak of no body but of her continued the earl of warwick could there have been any misfortune like that of losing her the earl of pembrock not apprehending what person he meant to make him unfold the riddle told him i understand you your young mistress is a going to leave the court in order to be married and you are afflicted at this separation would it please heaven cried my lord i had no other occasion of grief you should see me bear that with a great deal of courage but the case is quite different in respect of the countess of devonshire it is she it is she whose destiny i lament her husband having carried her away from her fathers house no body knows whether it being the general opinion that he has made her a sacrifice to his jealousy and what is more i must bear the blame as if i had been the occasion of it but it is not the public rumor but the loss of her person in particular that affects me dont you recall to mind my lord continued he that majestic air that noble and engaging deportment those charms which made her to be admired and respected by all the world with all these perfections in the midst of her native country nay of her own family there is no body appears in behalf of this poor lady this bugbear like me of a husband keeps all her friends in awe and his cruelties gain a dreadful respect among them well i will be then the man who by myself will venture at her protection but i will do it to such a purpose that the earl of devonshire and all his adherents shall have occasion to remember me he had scarce said these words but quite transported with choler and not remembering that he intended to consult with the earl of pembroke upon the matter he did fly away like lightning the earl of pembroke was not dissatisfied thereat since it saved him the trouble of counterfeiting and restraining his true thoughts before him  as soon as the earl of warwick was got out of fight he lay down under a tree to indulge his melancholy thoughts it is true he had sufficient cause of affliction since it was his too violent and indiscreet passion that had proved the cause of the loss of the repose if not the life of the countess he fetched very deep sighs and shutting his eyes remained immovable like one struck with death his new friendship with madam gray received such a check by the remembrance of the high deserts of the countess of devonshire by the high esteem he had of her person and by that compassion he felt within himself for her misfortunes that he wished a thousand times that the period of his life was at hand to justify by a solemn and sincere declaration the innocence of the oppressed lady yes said he i will publish to the world the extravagancies i have committed i will expose myself to the fury of her husband to the kings indignation to the violence of his mistress and the revenge of the earl of warwick i would be hated by all the world lose all my friends and fortune and after all this i own myself not sufficently punished  he was tormenting himself in this manner heaping reproaches upon reproaches when he found himself interrupted by madam gray the king had told her with what trouble the earl of warwick had received the news of the loss of my lady devonshire which she embraced with an excess of joy that she was scarce able to contain her self she took a solitary walk the better to enjoy the pleasure of seeing herself revenged and she fancied she saw her mortal enemy in this miserable condition before her eyes when espying the earl of pembroke the instrument of her vengeance against the earl of warwick she made up toward him with a gay countenance we are at last victorious my lord cried she you will say the earl of warwick is likely to pay very dear for the evils he intended against me when i tell you with what trouble and vexation of mind he received the news of the countess of devonshires absence from the king and that it was supposed her husband had offered some violence to her you may judge of my satisfaction  the earl of pembrock opening his eyes and hearing her discourse with the utmost impatience may i presume to tell you madam replied he you are too full of revenge alas what crime has she committed against me how returned she is it not a crime to have been beloved by the king and is it not another to love the earl of warwick this perfidious man who owed me so many obligations not only in regard of his constant profession of kindness to the house of lunenburgh from which my mother is descended but also of the many good offices i have endeavored to do him has contrived my ruin you know too well what ridiculous stories he has told of me to the king these are unpardonable things and i profess to you that all he suffers and whatever may happen to the countess is too little to satisfy my revenge well cried the earl of pembrock if you want another victim to allay your anger make use of me madam i desire death at your hands as the only good that can befall me dont think me less guilty than the earl of warwick i love the countess of devonshire better than the earl of warwick and yet have condescended to be the instrument of your hatred both against her and my rival what horror dont i feel within my breast for having been guilty of such a crime which i committed without the least reluctance my resentment caused by her indifferency toward me jealousy which tormented me and in short the power of her charms are the cause of my present misfortune if my grief does not rob me suddenly of my life i intend to make known all over the world how the whole matter was concerted  madam gray hearkened to the earl of pembrooks discourse with so much surprise that she could scarce imagine what she heard to be real she was a considerable time before she could speak a word but at last broke out into most violent reproaches and threats he heard her patiently without being in the least moved thereat without making the least excuse or telling her any thing to induce her to forget what he had said quite overcome with spite and rage she was a going to leave him but considering with herself that if he should disclose the matter to the earl of warwick she might be brought in for her share in raising the report about the attempt made upon the countess of devonshire and though she judged herself so well fixed in the kings affection that it would prove a hard task for any body to make him conceive the least prejudice against her yet knowing what an influence the earl of warwick had upon his majesty she thought it the safest way not to put it to a hazard so assuming a more gentle air she desired the earl of pembrook to conceal the matter at least for some days longer you run no hazard in so doing said she and i shall be obliged to you you will have time enough to speak in behalf of your so much admired countess he soon found she was touchd to the quick since notwithstanding her resentment and haughtiness she could condescend so far as to make a request to him he tod her that in the condition he now was in he was so far from being capable of concealing it that he would rather choose to withdraw into the country than make her a promise he might be apt to break and that if she would get but the kings leave he would go to retire from all the world at one of his country seats  madam gray well satisfied with this expedient engaged to speak to the king about it which she did accordingly but found him not much disposed to grant it you see said he unto what a melancholy state the earl of warwick is reduced the report of my lady devonshires death having almost bereaved him of his senses he is not in a condition to attend me often and i hoped that the earl of pembrook would supply his place till his recovery madam gray told him she had perceived the earl of pembrook to be out of order for several days last past that the change of the air would much contribute to the recovery of his health and consequently to his sudden return to court in short she being resolved it should be so the king at last granted her desire the young widow was very diligent in dispatching the earl for the country and told him at parting she would not have him come back till his head was quite clear of his chimeras and that she in the mean time would take care of his fortune act in that as you please madam said he coldly i am so far from any ambitious designs that i desire nothing but death and i should think myself much more obliged to you if you would hasten it than let me linger away in the most unhappy life upon earth am i the occasion of it replied she with some impatience but i will pardon you in spite of yourself i look upon you as one that having lost his senses is not master of his own affections go fetch them where you left them and return in such a condition as may engage me to pardon what is past the earl of pembrook took his leave without answering one word not being able to forgive her what she had made him do against the poor countess of devonshire  he was no sooner gone but madam gray began to be sensible at least more than ever she had been before that the earl was not indifferent to her she was afraid that instead of shaking off his spleen in the country he might rather contract such a habit as might endanger his health he is going said she to some place or other remote from all the world to bury himself in his thoughts of the countess of devonshire twill be a hard matter to get her out of his head and so he will fall into some distemper nay for what i know it may cost him his life alas perhaps he may die  these reflections caused no small symptoms of pain and grief in her being surprised to feel within herself such tender inclinations for the earl and she would have reproached herself upon that head had not the consideration of making her fortunes over balanced the rest for the widow of a private gentleman to be married to a person of  high a rank in the kingdom  disturbed with these reflections she sends for her brother the earl rivers one of the most accomplished lords at court and in great favor with the king as he began to be considered already as one of the kings growing favorites who had bestowed great favors upon him this occasioned such a jealousy in the earl of warwick that they were upon the point once of deciding their quarrel by a duel had they not been prevented by the kings authority who to stop their rage had prescribed them certain rules which neither of them was to transgress on pain of his displeasure notwithstanding which there remained a certain grudge betwixt them which being carefully maintained by madam gray they were become irreconcilable enemies twas upon this consideration she judged she could not put the earl of pembrook into surer hands than his to make him avoid all manner of correspondence with the earl of warwick  so soon as he was come into her chamber she told him she intended to give him an opportunity of putting an obligation upon her that the earl of pembrook being seized with a very deep melancholy was a going to retire to some solitary place where instead of diminishing he would increase his spleen that she being his friend desired him to carry the earl to his fine seat called grafton and to stay with him there for some time you will perhaps tell me continued she you cannot be absent from court without great prejudice to yourself since in so doing you will leave the earl of warwick as it were absolute master of the field of battle but rely upon my words brother i will talk of you so frequently to the king that upon your return out of the country you shall find your affairs in a better conditi than when you left them  there needed no more to engage the earl rivers to act as madam gray had desired he told her this opportunity of obliging her he looked upon as too precious not to embrace it that he would go immediately to the earl of pembrook and certainly persuade him rather to choose grafton house than any other for his place of retirement  accordingly he went to him when he was just upon his departure they being very intimate friends and the earl rivers pretending he knew nothing of his intended journey told him he came to take his leave of him because he intended to go the next day to grafton house are you engaged replied the earl of pembroke in some horsematch or other to be run there no said he i go only to rest my self of the fatigues of the court if you have so much friendship as to go along with me thither i will think my self obliged to you as long as i live i am a going replied the earl with a melancholy air a great way further off i have some pressing reasons which make me fly that which would prove a great dissatisfaction to me the earl rivers appearing as if he were surprised at his resolution urged the matter so successfully to him that he agreed to go along with him so they went out of london the next day  they needed not have taken so much precaution there being but little probability of the earl of pembrokes meeting with the earl of warwick for each of them had clostred themselves up to lament the death or at least the loss of the countess of devonshire she as i told you before was gone to madam digbys where she was entertained with all imaginable civility it is true under the disguise she had taken she passed there but for a person of an indifferent condition but notwithstanding this her air and deportment gained her much respect from all that beheld her she had assumed the name of jamy the better to conceal her sex and madam digby had two sons and a very handsome niece a woman of a great deal of sense sweet in conversation very serious and something addicted to melancholy her name was leonore and madam digby being resolved to make a match betwixt her and her eldest son who was a short ill favored and illtemperd piece used to keep leonore from all conversation for fear lest leonore in case she should see others more amiable than her son she might take an aversion both to his person and the intended match leonore thus spent the best of her days within the walls of her aunts house when my lady devonshire came thither who in this disguise appeared so graceful as if it had bin natural to her so that leonore from the first moment she saw her was captivated to such a degree that her eyes who were not acquainted with any thing else but the sight of her ugly cousins were now continually employed upon jamy and she being a woman of great vivacity of wit her conversation with jamy was so pleasant as by degrees inspired her with that tenderness she did neither foresee nor was able to overcome  for besides that they were both of the same sex the countess of devonshire had such weighty reasons to have an abhorrence for love that even the most pleasing diversions that had the least relation to that passion could not be acceptable to her she was quite overwhelmed with her misfortunes under the greatest uncertainty how to manage her self for the future exasperated against the earl of warwick irreconcilable to her spouse and the chevalier de hereford very uneasy on account of the suspicions her family might conceive against her and the reports that were likely to be spread abroad upon her account all these were matters of such consequence as to employ all her thoughts which would make her spend some times a whole night in one of the most solitary places of the park belonging to the house the only thing she took some delight in to divert her melancholy was to be instructed in the exercise of arms wherein she improved so well that she would match the best man in shooting and madam digby keeping a fencing master in the house to teach her two sons jamy by his instructions in a little time became as formidable for his arm as for his eyes  leonore was surprised at the progress jamy had made in this sort of exercise and whereas before she was never known to have taken any notice of her cousin when he was at this exercise because he made so miserable a figure now since the arrival of jamy she took so much delight in being there that young digby could not but take some notice of it it is true he did not know unto what to attribute this alteration but after having seriously reflected upon the matter applied the reason thereof to his own advantage flushed with these hopes he desires jamy to compose a song or two in praise of his fair cousin but james excusing himself with some carelessness digby was so vexed thereat that he got jamy by the throat leonore hearing the noise came in to see what was the matter and without hesitating upon the point pulls her cousin by the hair till he was glad to let jamy alone ungrateful woman cried the little cousin did you know the occasion of our quarrel you would be as much vexed at it as i am i desired him to compose me some verses i intended to present you with but he told me with a scornful look he could not make verses at command unless it were for himself leonore casting a scornful look upon her counsin went away without saying one word to the park in that solitary place to bewail her misfortune  certain it is that since the arrival of jamy she had had but little repose at the first beginning she embraced this growing tenderness only as a means to counterpoise her aversion to that monster they had designed her for a husband but it was not long before she was convinced to her cost that love is no less pernicious than hatred she then began to open her eyes and duly reflecting upon her present circumstances found love so dreadful a guest as made her sigh and condole her self without intermission  she was no sooner got to the further end of a thick and dark wood but seating her self near a little brook she ruminated a considerable time upon her present condition at last what do thou mean unfortunate leonore said she to her self is it possible thou should be so far an enemy to thy self as to have a particular regard to a young man so much below thee what is it thou proposest since he cannot be thy husband but why continued she i have riches enough and not ambition there is no place upon earth where i could not live happily with him and no doubt but he will think it the greatest good fortune that could befall him to marry me she framed a thousand other pleasing projects which vanishing as soon as they came and she thus remaining in suspense betwixt hope and fear served only to augment her affliction when she heard on a sudden a noise near her for fear of being over heard by her aunt or young digby she arose immediately and casting her eyes on all sides found it was jamy who was going at a further distance as soon as he saw her  she thought it was out of respect but being no more mistress of her own heart she called and made a sign to him to draw nearer it is but reasonable said she smilingly i should chide you for having refused to oblige my cousin with a few verses intended for me i should have made but a very ill piece of work of it replied he my thoughts are too much taken up to be employed in a thing of this nature say rather added she you are so deeply engaged in a secret passion as not to permit you to think of any other object but what you love he did not return an answer immediately and the impatient leonore continued her discourse your silence said she is easy to be understood oh jamy you are in love i suppose it is with the same person for which you fought a duel in london it is she that has given us the opportunity of seeing you here what a fatality is this jamy having recovered himself told her were you acquainted with the reasons i have of complaining of my misfortunes you would not believe me to be capable of a passion to which i was always a stranger the very name of love is terrible to me how is it possible replied she you should hate to so excessive a degree what you dont know it is certain you have bin in love but are dissatisfied but supposing you have proved unfortunate at one time that ought not to check you for ever i have something of skill in physiognomy and astronomy i foresee every thing will prove successful to you love and you shall be beloved  jamy much surprised at what he heard fair leonore said he i am not capable of following your counsel i must employ all my thoughts upon my present condition which is deplorable and my temper is such that i cannot submit to it i must either die or see my destiny changed i find said she you still resent the ill treatment you received of my cousin but you must excuse him considering he has sufficient reason to be jealous of you of me replied jamy alas for what reason he has observed continued she not without some confusion that i always look at you with pleasure that i cannot forbear to speak in your praise and he perceives perhaps that my thoughts in respect to you even exceed my words  alas jamy and have not you perceived that as well as he i understand a jest answered he you intend to make your self merry at my cost but provided it be the least satisfaction to you i am very willing to take it however dont think my complaisance is unlimited for it is no less true that were it possible to suppose you could stoop so low as to intend to marry me my present condition is such that i should not enjoy the fruits of your goodness how cried leonore with much impatience and would you not marry me would you refuse to marry your fortune i should but ill repay to madam digby the civilities i receive in her house replyd he but you would he at least revenged of her sex said she but that way is not suitable to my present station continued he i am resolved first to resettle my mind before i entertain any thoughts of marriage but i will make you for ever said she i have a great fortune at my command and am willing to share it with you your relations will be very angry at it replied he i will not see the face of any of them returned she we will go and live in the most delight some place of all europe we will set up a kind of a hermitage in some delicious valley where the clearest springs slide gently along among the trees we will have books we will have musical instruments good gardens few domestics and plain but clean and near furniture thus remote from the noise of the world our best days will pass away like a dream all what you tell me is no more than such answered jamy with a smile and i little thought that so amiable a young lady as you had the gift of building castles in the air oh cease cruel man returned she to turn into ridicule a tender passion you ought to embrace with respect you are too sensible of the sentiments and frailties of my tender heart though i have this to say for myself that i have omitted nothing that might conduce to check my passion that all this has served only to increase my sufferings and your idea which is never absent from my mind has always got the upper hand over my most firm and most serious resolutions i am not sensible of what i have done said he whatever it was it was against my will i must tell you once more leonora you and i were not made for one another  this poor young lady quite overwhelmed with grief and shame fell upon the ground without sense or motion which as it caused no less the trouble than pity of jamy he did all he could to bring her to herself again alas said he what unfortunate planet was i born under see love will not cease to persecute me i hoped to have sheltered myself against its force in this solitude and fate will have it so that this charming young lady should have too tender sentiments for me and that i should innocently be accessory to her misfortuues  the water which jamy threw into leonores face being taken out of a very cool spring she soon recovered her senses her eyes which were scarce half open discovered the tenderness and languishment of her heart she had leant her head upon jamys knees they were both very pensive and mutually bemoaning their fate when alarmed by the sound of the huntinghorns and noise of the dogs they saw a stag pursued by the hunters through an opening of the park running directly to them where he was soon after run down by the dogs the hounds belonged to the earl rivers who had a seat not above a few miles from madam digbys but they kept no correspondence together there being a great difference betwixt their ages and way of living  the earl was not a little surprised to see so fair a lady as leonore was in this retired place alone with one of the hand somest and best shaped men in the world and leaning her head upon him leonore got up as fast as she could but the earl rivers who observed every motion of hers followed and accosted her with an air which discovered a certain mixture of fear and confidence i have given you some disturbance madam said he to her and that perhaps at the very nick of time when you were going to take a sleep pray bear me no ill will upon that account for you are revenged already and if i have robbed you of your rest for a few moments i fear i have lost mine for ever leonore knew the earl no more than he did her but judged him to be a person of quality and upon that score would have received his addresses without much reluctance had not jamy got already the sole ascendant over her heart so looking upon him said coldly if you complain no more of me than i do of you my lord you will have no great occasion to repent of our meeting here but not to obstruct your freedom i am going to leave you she made the best of her way toward their house which was not far off but the earl endeavoring to stop her a little an impression made by such a one as you said he to her is not easily to be razed out alas i ought not to have looked at you but now it is too late the venom is taken and your absence will augment its strength leonore scarce minded what he said but went home and the earl fearing lest he should disoblige her in following her any farther came back to his company but in so ill a humor as is scarce to be imagined he went to the place where he left jamy with an tention to ask him who leonore was and to form himself if possibly he could concerning is own condition but he lost his labor for jamy was very uneasy at the sight of him and ho it seemed not very probable that the couness of devonshire should be discovered under such a disguise nevertheless she thought it her safest way not to run the risque of it the earl rivers looking about him on all sides in hopes to see one or other that might tell him what he wanted to know at last espied young digby he made up to him as fast as he could and asked him who the young lady was her name is leonore said he to the earl she is my cousin and will be my wife before we are a month older the earl rivers was so far from looking upon him as a formidable rival that he pitied the poor lady who was to be married to so illfavored a man  so home he went where finding the earl of pembrook in his melancholy posture he blamed him for his not going along with him a hunting and then told him what had happened in relation especially to leonore jamy and digby the earl of pembrook told him he knew the mother of young digby that he lodged there one time when the king was at graftonhouse that her niece might perhaps then not live with her or that they kept her out of his sight prudence requires said the earl rivers to keep her out of the sight of so accomplished a person as you are and after all i saw a young gentleman with her whom i look upon as a dangerous companion and if madam digby intends to keep her nieces heart entire for her son she had better be without such guests perhaps continued the earl of pembrook it was one of her sons i cannot tell that replied the earl but am sure she looked not with an indifferent eye at him her head rested upon his knees and she had not power to turn her eyes any other way but upon him oh what would i not give to know the bottom of this whole intrigue and what good would it do you my lord said the earl of pembrook coldly rather say cried the earl of rivers what good would it not do me is it possible we should talk a whole hour upon this subject and you not perceive all this while how far my interest is concerned in it my lord pembrook thought it not worth his while to return an answer being quite buried in his own melancholy thoughts  the earl rivers lived in hopes that if he could forbear seeing leonore for some few days her idea would wear out by degrees but whenever he went abroad he could not forbear going within sight of her house though he had no opportunity or pretense of going in the earl of pembrook not showing himself so complaisant to the reiterated requests of his friend as to go along with him thither am not i sufficiently plagued with my own passion said he must i be also tormented with yours let me go to london or dont you love at grafton the e could not forbear smiling at my lords abrupt expressions but the idea of leonore had made too deep an impression upon his mind to be able to shake it off at so easy a rate  this fair lady in the mean time most narrowly watched every step jamy had made and as this served only to convince her of his indifferency so it furnished her every day with fresh matter of grief and vexation what a shame is it said she to be in love with a man so inferior in birth to me nay to see my self slighted by him after having declared my passion to him all these dismal reflections enough to humble the most courageous person in the world at last threw her into a most excessive melancholy young digby though very dull of apprehension did not fail to observe it and prompted by his jealousy resolved to make jamy pay for his mistresss ill humor twas upon that account he would seek frequent quarrels with him but wanting courage to encounter him himself he looked out for a good and trusty hand that might dispatch him after having well weighed the matter for some time he pitched upon his fencing master as the most proper person to second his sinister intentions against jamy but he happened to be mistaken in his choice the fencing master was an honest man and one who had as much kindness for jamy as if he had been his son he did indeed pretend to accept of the proposition but it was because it should not be done by another hand and so he discovered the whole plot to jamy alas cried he full of grief what matters it my life is not worthy taking care of though i must confess i should be very sorry to find you my enemy let digby but entrust another with this murder and he shall find i will not oppose him this is the strangest piece of indifferency that ever i heard of replied the fencing master it is impossible for me to see it i beg you therefore by all that is good to think of leaving this house for fear any misfortune should befall you here jamy returned thanks for his kindness and care for him but nevertheless showed so much indisterency in regard to his own person that the fencing master saw himself under a necessity of speaking to leonore about it having observed for some time past that she showed a particular esteem for him and that probably it was upon that account young digby had framed his design against jamys life he gave her a full account of the matter whereat she was alarmed to the highest degree and though she had put the utmost violences upon her self to avoid him and show him all possible marks of indifferency this news was sufficient to engage her to confer with him upon that subject  she chose for this purpose the same wood where she had discovered her passion and addressed her self to him with an air that showed at least as much confusion and grief as in her first discovery  your deportment toward me for some time past said she might easily dispense me from concerning my self for your interest could i dispense with my self but the same fatality that has made me sensible of your deserts will not allow me to be acquainted with the danger you are in without trembling at the very thoughts thereof yes jamy your life is dear to me in spite of all your ingratitude therefore take heed secure your self against the attempts of the pefidious digby this monster thinks it not sufficient to importune me with his nauseous passion but also intends to make you a sacrifice if possible to his jealousy which prompts him to imagine that you have a real passion for me i dont merit that obliging care you take for me fair leonore replied jamy you must consider me as an unfortunate person who is not in a condition to return your obligations and therefore you ought to see me perish without afflicting your self and why to see you perish jamy said she is it impossible for you to embrace the offer i made you fly from this house but permit me to be a sharer in your flight are not your enemies mine also let us therefore retire to some country or other such as you like best i shall be always contented as long as i am with you  jamy seeing himself thus put to it beyond whatever he had been before told her with a deep sigh you dont know me well enough fair leonore to declare your self thus favorably in my behalf said he i am engaged by such strict ties that nothing in the world can break them how then are you married cried she then i have nothing to hope for why would not you let me know the secret you disclose now some time ago perhaps the consideration of the impossibility of attaining to what i desired might have proved a good remedy to accelerate my cure then loading him with a thousand reproaches took from that instant a resolution of procuring her own death a thing not very uncommon among the english however she did not think fit to kill her self with her own hands for fear the cause of so desperate a resolution might be enquired into and discovered to the world but she took a dose of a lingering poison the first effects whereof though they reduced her to a languishing state yet made no considerable diminution in her charms  all this while the countess of devonshire expected with much impatience some alteration in her affairs being weary of living thus in disguise at madam digbys under the name of jamy her nurse gave her from time to time an account of what passed in relation to her self what noise her absence made at london and what pains the earl of devonshire took to find her out for though he did come no more to court he had so vast an acquaintance that he knew every thing that passed and not only this he had sent spies also into all the counties of the kingdom to find her out so that she had all the reason in the world to be upon her guard this reason alone was sufficient to make her continue in a place where leonores love and mr digbys hatred were equally troublesome to her though to speak the truth there was another cause besides this of her present affliction viz the remembrance of the earl of warwick whenever she took a walk in the shady wood she fancied she saw and heard him in his whole shape mien nay even the sound of his voice his engaging air and that grandeur wherein he surpassed all others all these imaginations served only to raise new impressions which were supported and nourished by the solitude of the place she would spend whole days in some of the darkest walks to reproach him with his ingratitude just as if he had bin near enough to hear her a convincing proof to her self that she retained so strong an inclination for him as she was not able to master which served only to add to her torments and to turn her anger at last against her self  the earl riverss condition was no less unfortunate for the obstacles he met with of seeing leonore rendering her more precious in his eyes he was talking day and night of her to the earl of pembroke who instead of giving him the least answer to that point extolled the merits and innocence of the countess of devonshire and as nothing could be more disagreeable to him he did all he could to divert him from that discourse and when his passion would not suffer him any longer to pursue that method he kept a long and profound silence to the no small vexation of the earl of pembroke i should be glad to know said he with some impatience what your design was in bringing me hither did you imagine i came to this place to be your confident in your fantastical intrigues when at the same time you will not give me leave to make my complaints in hopes of meeting with some comfort in my friend truly answered the earl rivers mine is no chimera leonore is no spectre to frighten one and considering every thing i have more reason on my side than you have for my lady devonshire loves no body or if she does it is certain it is the earl of warwick such a rival as he is not so soon to be thrown out of the saddle you lose both your time and your labor and is not this next door to a madness in this manner they used often times to pass away the time together but at last the earl rivers knowing that he should stand in need of the earl of pembrokes assistance began to condole his passion and at the same time forgot not to conjure him to carry him to madam digbys that he might speak to leonore and inform himself concerning jamy whom he looked upon as a dangerous rival  his importunities and complaisance at last engaged the earl of pembroke to conduct him to madam digbys in hopes to meet with an opportunity of entertaining leonore in private the earl rivers desirous to know how matters stood with his mistress before he went thither himself appointed a place at a small distance thence in a wood where to wait for his return at parting he told him am not i a patient lover the repose of my life depends on the success of your conversation if i meet with a repulse i am lost for ever this is a violent passion indeed answered the earl of pembroke considering how little hopes you have why will you talk at that rate said the earl of rivers are not you sufficiently convinced by your own experience that one may love without hopes and may not i flatter my self with more hopes than you in regard to my lady devonshire she treats you with the utmost rigor she is a married lady and you know she prefers the earl of warwick to you he was so far touched to the quick by what he heard his friend say that he had almost taken a resolution of not stirring any further for that time i think said he you make it your sport to seek my destruction what have i done you should revive in my head these melancholy considerations he was running on thus till the earl rivers put a stop to his complaints by entreating him without intermission to go to madam digbys he was no sooner entered the house but found the old lady in the greatest confusion imaginable by reason of the miserable state leonore was reduced to for the poison she had taken answered its operation so effectually that her life was despaired of seeing the whole house in tears he asked madam digby the cause of it she told him she believed her niece would not live two hours longer because she would not take the least thing to forward the cure of her disease and that none of the ablest physicians could guess at the true cause of it  the earl of pembroke touched with compassion for the young lady asked leave to be admitted into her chamber whither being conducted by madam digby he found leonore sitting in an elbow chair with a slight loose nightgown about her only though the weather was not then very warm but she had a fire burning within her which none but jamy could extinguish and therefore would suffer no body to hold up her head but him her eyes were constantly fixed upon him and the want of their usual luster and her pale countenance sufficiently discovered the anguish of her soul i am at the point of death would she cry frequently and will you let me die these being the only words she was heard to say for a good while poor jamy reduced almost to despair to see this young lady in so miserable a condition did nothing but sigh and his sighs being in outward appearance offensive to her she would look at him with some marks of anger and continued saying i am a dying will you let me die the earl finding this young lady under such a deadly languishment and seeming to ask the preservation of her life made her a compliment which was answered by her only by a nod but continued in the same tone will you let me die with so melancholy an air and voice as drew tears from all that beheld her  at last the earl of pembrook casting his eyes upon jamy discerned so great a resemblance betwixt him and the countess of devonshire that it is impossible to describe the confusion it caused in his mind she knew him as soon as he entered the room which as it occasioned no small disturbance in her so the various alterations in her face were undeniable symptoms of her uneasiness and she would not have staid long in the chamber had not leonore who would not be without jamy kept her so being obliged to see herself exposed to the curiosity of the earl of pembrook he told her you are very constant in attending this poor dying lady my lord answered jamy with a low voice for fear of being discovered by the sound thereof i am willing to do her all the petty services i can perhaps added the earl you are one of her relations i have not the honor of being so replied he and what brought you hither continued my lord a young gentleman so well accomplished as you might fix in a more advantageous place for his fortune than to spend his time in the country instead of answering his question jamy told him my lord our patient is disturbed at our discourse so near her  the earl hereupon seated himself in a chair where he might more narrowly observe and take a view of jamy and the more he looked at him the more he discovered of the air and deportment of the countess of devonshire is she then really escaped her husbands fury said he to himself and is it in this place she has sought for shelter under this disguise whilst he was sitting very pensive for some time the countess of devonshire who observed all his motions began to be convinced that if he was not already very certain of it it would not be long before he would discover her disguise never was any poor lady brought to such an extremity not knowing what course to take for her safety however she took the first opportunity of getting out of the room but being as yet unresolved what to do went into the wood there to reflect upon the present necessity she was reduced to of leaving the place o matchless frailty cried she will my hard fortune never cease to persecute me which way i turn myself i meet those that will persecute me some out of an implacable hatred conspire against my life others hurried on by passion i cannot submit to add to my torments let us therefore fly let us retire to some desert or other where i may spend the remnants of my miserable days in quietness she was upon the point of putting in execution her resolution when she was met by the earl of pembroke just as she was going out of the park he having taken particular notice of jamy when he went out of the room and this proving an additional reason to augment his former suspicions sought only an opportunity to follow him leonore soon after perceiving he was gone and asking with much earnestness where he was my lord pretending to be concerned for the sick lady went to look after him and found him coming out of the park leonore wants you said he to jamy but i cannot also be without you i must have one moments conversation with you my lord replied she i want sense to entertain you besides you are sensible in the condition this poor sick lady is in i cannot stay long from her she had scarce said these words but she was a going away as fast as she could all these things serving only to confirm the earl in his former opinion and unwilling to lose so precious an opportunity this made him transgress the rules of decency for he run after jamy and not without some violence stopped him no no said he i shall not suffer you to leave me thus and then taking him by the hand pulled him against his will into the wood  it was here the earl once more looked steadfastly at him for some time and then breaking silence are not you sensible said he i am convinced of what you would make a mystery to me most adoreable countess dont refuse to make me your confident how many tears have i sacrificed to your death i perfectly know you it is impossible such a thing as this should escape my penetration let me stand indebted to you for a secret i am master of already the respect i bear you my lord answered jamy modestly makes me imagine that you have a mind to divert yourself with me rather than that you should really mistake my person but will you give me leave to ask you upon what ground it is you give me the title of a countess oh cruel woman teplyd he do you think it possible i should be mistaken how should that very heart which adores you not know you should the same eyes that have shed so many tears sor you mistake when they see you and is not your cruelty alone sufficient to convince me that you are still the same i cannot tell my lord said jamy with an angry air whom you take me for but i think you had better not detain me when you know leonore wants me whom i take you for madam continued the earl oh i take you for the most cruel person in the universe nobody has admittance to you but the earl of warwick this happy mortal maintains his ground in your heart in spite of all your adorers and you delight in treating me thus cruelly on purpose to oblige him how your eyes sparkle with disdain and anger alas why will you make the most respectful the most tender and most unfortunate of all lovers the object of your hatred  the countess seeing him so sensibly afflicted could not forbear to feel some share in his pain she stood with her arms across and her eyes fixed on the ground immovable not knowing what resolution to take whether to discover or continue to conceal her name the earl who was not insensible of what passed in her heart would willingly at her feet have conjured her to put an entire confidence in him but that he feared to be overseen by somebody or another but he forgot not to represent to her in the most lively expressions that could be invented the signal obligation he should owe her if she would make him a sharer in the secret after various reflections she resolved not to comply with his request and told him she thought it very hard to be thus persecuted by a person she had nothing to do withal and so away she went so overwhelmed with grief that she scarce knew what she did or whither she was going the earl was no less troubled than herself not knowing what he had best to do he followed her at a good distance with his eyes but his respect to her person would not permit him to go after her after a few moments stay his impatience of seeing her again made him hasten out of the wood to leonores chamber but was much surprised not to meet with her there leonore asked very earnestly after jamy i am at the point of death said she i want to talk with him about a matter of the utmost consequence both to me and him search being made after him in every corner at last word was brought that he had been met on horseback riding as fast as he could from the house at this unexpected news leonere and the earl being equally afflicted the first fetched a deep sigh and desired the earl to draw nearer  you will doubtless be surprised my lord said she to him that not having the honor to know you i should choose you rather than any one of my own family the executor of my last will and testament but it being my desire to have it executed accordingly without any regard to young digby or his mother i promise myself from your generosity that you will see jamy put into the quiet possession of what i now bequeath to him which is of my whole estate and every thing i am mistress of in the world i dont question but he will wonder at this action and perhaps i am in the wrong thus to reward his ingratitude but my heart is as full of tenderness toward him as his is full of aversion to me to be short my lord we are not at all times masters of the sentiments of our hearts twas that made me desire the same share in his as he had in mine and notwithstanding the inequality that is betwixt us offered to marry him if he thought fit but his indifferency soon decided the matter against my request it is therefore time to die this is the only satisfaction i can have without him at these words the tears trickld down her cheeks and the earl who was not a little disposed to melancholy bore so considerable a share in her affliction that she soon perceived it and returning hearty thanks told him i should die with some satisfaction could i have seen in jamy something resembling the same sentiments you are pleased to express no body but himself would have denied me so reasonable a satisfaction but were you acquainted with his heart you would be surprised at his cruelty alas madam said the earl to her i know it too well if he has proved the cause of your misfortunes he has no less been the occasion of mine what do you say my lord replied leonore do you take me right i spoke of jamy that young gentleman you saw in this chamber yes leonore answered he i understand you very well and that you may be sensible i did know that the person unto whom you have made your addresses under the name of jamy is a lady whom you might still see here at this moment had it not been for my coming hither twas my fatal presence she could not endure it is that made her fly we shall see her no more however keep my secret as religiously as i will keep yours leonore full of amazement and confusion at what was told her was not able to utter one word she could scarce believe what the earl said though at the same time she wished it might be true for she began to be sensible that the repose of her life depended thereon which made her ask him a thousand questions at last she engaged him by repeated oaths to confirm the truth to her which made her recall to mind several things she had seen jamy do which were much more usual among women than men and which might easily have created a suspicion in her had she not been blinded by passion  after having well weighed the present circumstances of her life death began to appear to her in its most terrible shape she had flattered her self that her generosity to jamy expressed in her last will and testament and the declaration she intended to make him of having taken some poison would produce more tender effects than all her discourses had been able to do and move his heart to love or at least to compassion but this design being rendered abortive by his absence and by what she had heard from the earl she told him after some moments silence the confession i have made to you is so very disagreeable to a woman of my temper that whatever you will hear me say further will be overcome by me without much difficulty i tell you this my lord said she in reference to the condition you now see me in what i have done was the effect of my despair i have poisoned my self the earl stood amazed at the strangeness of the thing is it possible leonore cried he that you had courage enough to make an attempt upon your own life oh it is time to assist you it is time to get proper remedies to save you i should not be against it replied she if it could be done without the knowledge of my friends who else will certainly reproach me with it and my aunt will force me to marry her son twas in some measure the aversion i had to that match which made me fix my love upon jamy the earl perceiving leonore willing enough to live provided her vanity might be thus far satisfied as to keep her design of making her self away by poison from her friends told her he would himself bring her proper antidotes and if his affairs should call him to london the earl rivers was to do it in his stead that he being his intimate friend he could promise in his behalf that he would concern himself in so particular a manner in her welfare that she might without the least fear put an entire confidence in him  he left her with this assurance making all the haste he could to the wood to acquaint his friend with what had happened who in the mean while had passed his time under a thousand inquietudes thinking that his friend had forgot him but it is impossible to express his affliction when he heard the earl of pembroke particularize to him what had passed at madam digbys house in reference to leonore twas not alone the danger he understood she was in that troubled his mind but also the dread of a beautiful rival but when he was told she had taken poison he remained like one that was thunderstruck so soon as he had recovered himself a little he was for taking post immediately for london to provide such remedies as should be judged proper under her present circumstances but the earl of pembroke disliking his resolution if you go to london said he and come back without paying your respect to the king and madam gray they will perhaps take it amiss and if you do it will take you up more time than can be allowed of take my advice stay you at grafton and let me go let me follow my cruel destiny alas was there ever such thing as this i met my lady devonshire by the oddest chance in the world love seemed as if she intended to bestow some of her favors upon me but when i thought i might flatter my self with hopes she proves as cruel to me as ever why then should you make any further attempt said the earl rivers to him reason and despair ought to have bin my physicians replied he but hitherto they have not bin able to compass the cure  they were thus discoursing till they came to the house where whilst the horses were getting ready the earl of pembroke took a little nourishment and the earl rivers took this opportunity of asking him a thousand questions concerning leonore do you think said he she will quit her passion for jamy perhaps since she resolved to poison her self she may also be still inclined to die for him no matters stand with her otherwise now than they did before replied my lord pembroke i have made her sensible of her error death begins to appear frightful to her and you must endeavor to persuade her that the best way to forget jamy is to put you in his place tis true replied the earl that if i could convince her of that point i might flatter my self with some hopes of success but perhaps her opinion and mine are very different alas added he it is time enought to think of means to oblige her my lord let us endeavor first her preservation i conjure you to send me a powerful antidote and pray heavens grant it may prove effectual  they embraced at parting and the e of pembroke was all the while he was upon the road to london ruminating upon what measures he was to take whether to go in search of the countess and to do her all the service that possibly he could or whether he had better not to look after her for fear of incurring her displeasure nay he wished it might be concealed from all the world that she was still alive his first motive had a peculiar relation to the countesss repose fearing lest the earl of devonshire might deal very roughly with her nor was his mind less disturbed with the earl of warwicks passion the condition he had seen that lord reduced to upon the news of the death of the countess of devonshire was a convincing proof to him that he loved her still so he feared that in case he should find her out his passion and constancy might make a favorable impression upon her how difficult it is said he to be always rival to a man who is beloved and deserves to be beloved but if i may hope for a favorable change of my destiny i must find out the countess and persuade her to shelter her self in some agreeable solitude without making any body a partner in the secret but my self and i would not fail to assist her to the utmost in her concealment  all his thoughts were taken up with such like notions for several days however this made him not neglect to send proper medicines to leonore which produced this happy effect that she soon recovered of her distemper this done he employed all his diligence in finding out the countess with all imaginable secrecy and meeting with the larl of warwick was very cautious in mentioning the least thing to him of what had happened at madam digbys and the extreme affliction he observed in the earl at the loss of my lady devonshire was so far from moving him to compassion that he told him she was certainly dead as often as he saw him  purpose to increase the vexation of his rival at last the court becoming insupportable to the earl of warwick he desired leave of the king to retire for some time to sionhill a seat of his about   or   miles from london in the way to windsor seated upon the bank of the river thames the earl of pembrokes return to london whom madam gray esteemed as much as she hated the e of warwick facilitated his request for she looking upon it as a piece of policy to remove her enemy at a further distance soon impetrated the kings leave for his departure wherewith the earl was exceedingly satisfied seeing himself now at full liberty to abandon himself entirely to the highest degree of grief that ever any mortal man was capable of he left his family at london taking along with him only berincour and some few others to attend him thus left to his thoughts he had this sad comfort to condole himself without being overheard and to recall to his mind all the circumstances of an amorous engagement he pursued without the least hopes of success  in this extremity he resolves to go to france intending to stay some time at calais whereof he was governor for though one vauelain a gentleman of gascony in whom he put more than ordinary confidence was his deputy governor there that post was of such vast consequence and so honorable that nothing less than a passion like his for the countess of devonshire could retain a man in england to what a condition am i reduced to said he to berincour i am for leaving the court chelsey and sionhill i am for leaving the kingdom because every thing revives in my heart the remembrance of the countess but my lord replied the gentleman do you imagine that this so dear a remembrance will not follow you where ever you go have you forgot those melancholy days at caerleon there is a vast difference cried he betwixt that time and this i had reason to believe that the countess did not hate me and i knew she was safe in her own family but the case is quite different now she has writ a slighting letter to me and has suffered her self to be carried away by another good god what a contrivance was this for a person of her merits what had i committed against her and why would not she rather bestow this favor upon me than another lover does she think it is possible he should love her more violently than i did and notwithstanding this she thought she could not offer a more pleasing sacrifice to him than to break off with me but added he all these things are now remembered to no purpose since i cannot any ways doubt of her death this cruel husband of hers has sacrificed her to his jealousy and i am too fully revenged all my thoughts of her shall for the future be employed in believing her not so much in the wrong in respect to my self as i did imagine i will think her faithful to regret her loss for all the remainder of my life  the earl would often talk to berincour after this manner and when he did not it was to indulge himself with less interruption in his remembrance of my lady devonshire this being the only thing he thought a fit object of his care for he was grown so regardless of his fortune that every thing that madam gray could do to supplant him was indifferent to him on the other hand the earls of pembroke and rivers had the best opportunity in the world of improving his absence to their advantage had they been in a condition to do it but the first seeing himself more entangled in love than ever thought of nothing else but how to find out my lady devonshire without making the least noise for fear it might otherwise be attended with ill consequences as for the other he dreamed of nothing but leonore the antidote was taken without repugnancy this young lady having changed her mind was not for dying since she knew that jamy was a woman she was ashamed of her frailty and all her thoughts were now taken up in checking a passion which had but too much tormented her you may imagine that the earl rivers neglected nothing to dispose her in his favor and lest his assiduity should afford cause of suspicion to madam digby he insinuated to her with much dexterity that he could not entrust any body but himself with the true method and management of this remedy that therefore he should be obliged to serve its operation every day and that for a considerable time all the family showed abundance of respect and gratitude to him in consideration of the pains he took to preserve leonores life as well as all her acquaintance so that there needed not much trouble for him to get a free access  in the mean time jamys ight made no small noise amongst them one of leonores attendants had over heard several things that were spoken betwixt her and the earl of pembroke and this joined to some other circumstances she had taken notice of made her believe that jamy was no man but came there is disguise she could not conceal her thoughts from some of her friends and these tatling it to others the thing was not only divulged by degrees but also increased by certain additional circumstances the earl of devonshire who had his spies in every place was soon informed of what had happened at madam digbys and the news thereof soon reaching the kings ear tho related under different circumstances he and madam gray asked the earl of pembroke a thousand questions about it which put him to no small confusion fearing lest the countess of devonshire should suspect him of having betrayed her secret yes cried he it is my misfortune she will infallibly impute the discovery of this whole adventure to my indiscretion i say to me who is the most faithful of all her friends and who would rather die than to make her uneasy upon any account whatever notwithstanding all this i am certain she will entertain quite another opinion of me  the marquess of montague who was one of the most honorable and most amiable persons in england had so tender a friendship for the earl of warwick his brother that he never let slip the least opportunity of obliging him he no sooner heard what was rumored abroad concerning the countess of devonshire but to sionhill he went to tell him that it was believed she was still living knowing that he could not put any greater obligation upon him than this coming thither he was told by berincour that the earl would see no body that he was come thither from london to avoid all manner of conversation that in case he should give him admittance before the rest of his friends they would be apt to take exception at it and that therefore he desired him to acquiesce in what he had told him my brother knows me answered the marquess to be the best of his friends and i should have reason to be much dissatisfied if he should use me not as such upon this occasion however tell him that if he will not admit of a visit of the marquesss of montague he may receive me as a messenger who brings him some news concerning the countess of devonshire  at these words berincour went to his masters apartment unto whom he told what he had heard the marquess say touching the countess of devonshire the very name of the countess being alone sufficient to charm the earl he run out straightways to meet his brother and embracing him tenderly conjured him that if he had any news of the countess to let him know it immediately but my dear brother added he dont flatter me let not your desire of allaying my pain engage you to feed me up with false hopes i am not so far assured of what i am to tell you replied the marquess as to engage my word for it but the circumstances are such as make the thing very probable he then gave him a full account of what was said at court in relation to it whereat the earl was extremely satisfied being glad to meet with some matter of consolation tho twere only for a few moments he told the marquess he durst scarce promise to himself so much happiness nevertheless he began to be much better composed in his mind twas this that made him detain the marquess who intended to return immediately to london stay stay here said he to him let us act in concert to deceive me persuade me that the countess is yet alive but alas cried he did ever i really believe her to be dead and was able to outlive her i must own to you brother she has had something of a foresight of what you now confirm to me the marquess neglecting nothing which he judged might strengthen him in this opinion they passed that evening in a very agreeable conversation  the next and several succeeding days the marquess stayed with the earl they spent much of their time in hunting fishing and walking at last the earl desirous to be sometimes alone to ruminate with the more freedom upon the adventure of the countess of devonshire one day as they were walking near the thames side told the marquess dear brother i conjure you to permit me to take a walk without you walk you one way i will choose another and let us meet again at sionhill why my lord said the marquess smiling is my conversation so tiresom that you can no longer bear with it alas cried the earl i am not able to bear my self the marquess heartily compassionating his condition left him alone without saying one word  the earl of warwick then turning into a walk upon the very brink of the river seated himself under a tree where he could not be easily discovered here he was pondring with himself whether he had best go to london in search of the countess or to write to the earl of pembroke to be informed concerning what had happened at madam digbys but he was soon checked in this resolution when he reflected that the earl had kept it as a secret from him i told you before that they had seen one another since his return from graftonhouse when he was so far from mentioning any thing of the matter that on the contrary he assured the earl of warwick that my lady devonshire was actually dead this made him begin to consider the earl of pembroke as a creature of madam gray and knowing that he had been in the country with the earl rivers this ladys brother and his enemy these reflections could not but create in him a jealousy against the earl of pembroke he resolved at last to send berincour to madam digbys to inform himself of all she knew of that affair but feared that if my lady devonshire was really concerned in this adventure this curiosity of his might turn to her disadvantage  whilst he was remaining under this uncertainty he happened to see at some distance upon the river a small boat and in it a single gentleman with a bonnet pulled over his face rowed only by one water man he saw them land near that very place which he had chosen for his retirement he heard the gentleman say to the waterman go to sionhill and enquire whether the earl of warwick will not admit of a visit whether there is no means of delivering a letter to him and which way he takes his walks when he goes abroad dont forget any thing i tell you i will stay for your coming back here  the earl being so near as to understand every word the stranger spoke had the curiosity as soon as the waterman was at some distance from them to know who it was that wanted him so arising from his place i belong said he to the earl of warwick if you think fit to entrust me with a letter for him i will infallibly bring you an answer i know you too well replied the gentleman surprised to meet him in this place to mistake your person i am come here to have your life or to lose mine and then drawing his sword advanced to the earl no quarter no quarter cried he defend your self or i will kill you it is easy to be supposed that my lord warwick who was one of the bravest men upon earth would not have have suffered himself to be thus urged by this unknown person had he not soon known his voice not doubting therefore but that she was the countess and that what the marquess of montague had told him was really true he was overjoyed to see himself assured by the person her self of her life but on the other hand being vexed to the heart to find her so far enraged at him as that no less than his blood would satisfy her he remained immovable like a statue at last he resolved instead of retreating to meet her you desire my life divine countess said he strike the stroke this is perhaps the only minute i have been able to oblige you and so was rushing upon her sword for it was actually she but how soon is a person prepossessed with a most tender esteem disarmed by so entire a submission as this the fair lady was so surprised to be discovered and so uncertain what to do that she was scarce able to hold her sword and had it not been for a tree that supported her she had dropped down upon the ground being seized with a most violent trembling she saw the earl at her feet embracing her knees bathing his hands in his tears and his voice intercepted by a thousand sighs could scarce express the sentiments of his heart rise rise my lord said she i cannot suffer to see you at my feet oh madam replied he either give me leave to die or restore me to your favors it is so long a time returned she you have labored to ferfeit them that i know not by what misfortune it is i should not hate you more than i do have i labored said the earl to remove my self from your heart alas what way must a man take then to come nearer to it have not i served you with the same veneration as they do the gods no no my lord said she you have made all the ill use you could of a letter i sent you by berincour how cried he do you mean those two cruel lines you sent to me during my exilement which alone afflicted me more than all my disgraces together  twas now that they began to unfold their mistake to one another and the attempt of carrying off the countess in the bark whereof she accused the earl of warwick and whereof he justified himself to her satisfaction occasioned no small surprise in them at last she fairly told him she believed the earl of pembroke or else the chevalier de hereford were the persons that did it because they had both made their declarations of love to her the earl now began to be sensible he had been bubbled by the very person whom he thought his most intimate and now recalling to his mind a thousand passages that happened betwixt them all this served to confirm him in his suspicion  but madam said he to the countess of devonshire what is it that could move you to come to kill me what is it i have been guilty of if  to adore you i shall always be so and why will you delay to put in execution a thing that will tend to your satisfaction i will ingenuously confess to you my lord replied the had i been acquainted with your real sentiments i was too much concerned therein to put such a punishment upon you but dont you remember that it was every bodys opinion that it was you that made this attempt and that it was done with my consent how did i know as the case stood whether it was the effect of an excessive passion whereof we are not masters at all times or rather of your malice to ruin my reputation as well in my family as in the world twas this opinion that made me resolve to purchase my justification at the expense of your life i fancied it would prove the truest reparation of my honor when the world should be made sensible what despair had made me do upon that account and i looked upon it as the only means left me to recover my repose well well madam said he dont delay any long i am ready to sacrifice my self with pleasure for your satisfaction you will at least be convinced what i was capable of doing for you that design dropped that very moment you were for supporting it though i applied my self to fencing whilst i was at madam digby s on purpose to make the surer work of it but after all i was very sensible that to put it in execution i should find it a harder task to vanquish my self than you oh madam did you not know your self to be at all times the mistress of my life replied the earl what occasion was there for a sword or other arms to take away my life if you are still of opinion that it may conduce to your glory never spare an unfortunate person whom you have made suffer so much oh my lord replied she there is something that protects you against all my anger at least dont insult for the future over my fraity if i must speak it to my shame i can assure you it will afford you no matter of triumph what is it i have committed added he you should deal so rigorously with me are you afraid i should he apt to flatter my self too much i dont very well know what i fear said she but it seems as if i ought to have a secret mistrust of my self in regard to you  the earl not able to contain himself for joy was going to throw himself at the fair countesss feet when the waterman returning from sionhill gave an account of his success in his errand she bid him go and stay for her coming at some distance thence what will you resolve to do madam said the earl to her can you imagine i should suffer you to expose your self alone to new dangers pray stay for a little time at sionhill we will take care for every thing there i will engage never to see you but at such hours as you shall think fit and no body in the world shall know any thing of your being here alas but i shall know it my lord cried the countess and that is enough for me to refuse it let me undergo what dangers i must i cannot resolve to avoid them by exposing my reputation by such an action how will you be gone then cruel person cried the earl is it resolved then that the desire you have of avoiding me must make you fall into the hands of a terrible husband i must hide my self replied she but there is no occasion for you to be concerned in taking care thereof i will go to my nurse and i will take the first opportunity of going over into france oh madam said the earl you contrive your own ruin you may be satisfied the earl of devonshire is informed of all that passed at madam digby s he knows jamy was sent thither by your nurse all the circumstances that attended this adventure leave no room to doubt but that it was you if you are so nice in this point as not to be satisfied in my stay at sionhill i will go to london and am ready to depart at that very minute you command it  the countess after some further reflections being fully convinced of the danger laid before her eyes by the earl at last gave way to his reasons but would not let him go to london the night being come insensibly upon them besides that they had a great many things to say to one another before they could well break off their conversation  the waterman being sent away the fair countess in her mans apparel went along with the earl toward sionhill this being the first time in all his life he had a full opportunity of discoursing her with some freedom he was so far transported with joy that he would frequently stop her and begin to rehearse the same thing he had but just said before how happy did he think himself what satisfaction did he not feel within his breast he feared not long ago that he was hated he dreaded the death of the countess but now all his inquietudes were dissipated at once he had sight of his countess again and found her not dissatisfied at her not having killed him  the marquess of mountague in the mean while was not a little disturbed at this long stay of his brother and knowing both his despair and the multitude of his enemies feared some ill accident might have befaln him the kings favor had procured him abundance of them but especially the earl of devonshire his family and friends bore him a moral hatred looking upon him as the cause of their misfortunes the chevalier de hereford whose unhappy passion for the countess increased every day considered the earl of warwick as his most cruel enemy and madam grays creatures showed no less animosity against him so that the marquess of mountague no longer able to be at quiet under such a terrible incertitude went out and searched all those solitary places whither the earl used to retire to utter his complaints and sighs making the best of his way he could toward the same walk whither he had seen him go before he left him that day he espied him walking along in company of a gentleman who seeming surprised at the sight of him was going to turn another way till the earl told him fear nothing i will be answerable for my brother and you are i hope satisfied i will take care not to impose upon you then going forward to kneel and embrace him most tenderly i cannot said he but make you a partner in my satisfaction this gentleman is come to bring me some news from the countess of devonshire if you love me keep the secret to your self and when we come to sionhill let it be given out he is come to pay you a visit whereby to amuse and disappoint the inquisitiveness of the family the marquess was overjoyed at the confidence the earl put in him he saluted the gentleman but taking a narrow view of him found him so beautiful handsome and well made that he was struck with admiration the oftener he looked at him the more he was confirmed in his suspicion that it was the countess of devonshire who came to shelter her self at the earls house many other circumstances such as her voice the sweetness of her eyes her modest deportment and in short her graceful air were all such things as he thought could not be centred in any other person but her self  the earl the marquess and the lady supped together or to speak more truly sat down at table for they eat nothing the earl being quite transported with joy and the marquess stricken with admiration and taken up wholly in viewing the countess as for her part though she was well enough pleased with the earls justification and her having found him again she was not without certain reflections which disturbing her mind you might have read her melancholy in her face the earl who narrowly observed her soon guessing in some measure at her thoughts as soon as he had an opportunity of speaking to her alone conjured her to be at ease what is it you fear madam said he my life my fortune and all my interests are at your disposal i will die before i see the least disgrace befall you oh my lord cried she with tears in her eyes the so generous offers you make me cannot satisfy my own nicety can you suppose i can see my self at sion hill disguised in mans habit alone left and abandoned by my family reproached by every body without conceiving an horror against my self dont tell me of my innocence and the satisfaction i ought to take in knowing my self not guilty of the least thing that might make me blush neither am i certain whether i may flatter my self of continuing to be such since i know you and as the saying of caesar in respect to his wife was always in my thoughts so i apply the same to my self being more nice of my reputation than can well be imagined what will become of me thus tossed under these circumstances if i stay here am i not lost for ever if i go from hence i must expose my self to great dangers judge then of my inquietude it is i madam replied the earl that will go from hence i have already considered of the matter and intend to leave my brother here he is a sensible and discreet person i can entirely confide in him whilst i go to london to hear how things go whereof i will give you from time to time an exact account and receive your further commands the countess who approved of his departure could nevertheless not forbear sighing when she understood that he was to be gone the next day she thanked him for his complaisance and told him that nothing but such an accident as this could have engaged her to see him quit his own house but that the tranquillity of her mind in some measure depended thereon  the countess being inclined to go to bed the earl left the room and throwing himself afterward upon a bed with his brother the marquess of montague they spent the remainder of the night in talking of the countess the earl did not now in the least regret all his passed sufferings and though he foresaw many difficulties and obstacles he was likely to meet with in his way every thing appeared pleasing to him if he could but please the countess you make me the confident of your love said the marquess to him and though this ought to make me proof against her charms i have eyes i am not without a heart i desire you my lord not to expose me to the greatest danger you could think of it would be an odd story replied the earl that you who have always had an indifferency for the fair sex should now begin with loving the same person i love no no i know you better than you do your self dont be frightened with nothing but take care to preserve me a treasure that is dearer to me than my own life  the next morning at daybreak the countess got out of bed and received the earl and the marquess in a most magnificent loose nightgown her hairs hanging in buckles upon her shoulders with a red bonnet lined and edged with black velvet on her head the earl was so much delighted to see her in this dress that for a few minutes he was not able to utter one word then kneeling at her feet i am agoing to london madam said he my brother who knows the whole secret is to stay here to keep you company to speak of me sometimes to you and to send me frequent tidings concerning you you put the marquess said she to a needless trouble i desire only some few books and a solitary closet where i may be at liberty to entertain my self with my own thoughts the marquess said nothing because he began already to feel the effects of some sparks of that fire he intended to stifle within his breast but the earl who minded it not desired him to stay behind and then told the countess every thing that must be imagined to proceed from the most lively tender and respectful passion in the world and as it was death to him to leave her so he could not forbear to conjure her to let him stay but one day longer at sionhill were she to have consulted her own heart only his request would scarce have met with a refusal but she being very uneasy at her being there such is my misfortune said she that i must deny my self every thing that may tend to my satisfaction you know my lord this is a maxim i have prescribed to my self long ago perhaps another person would not insist upon every punctilio but such is my hard fate that whatever i do is taken in the wrong sense at these words the tears stood in her eyes which being perceived by the earl furnished him fresh matter of grief alas madam said he must i carry along with me the idea of so melancholy a sight must i see you cry and is it i that is the occasion of it i i say who love you with so much tenderness and respect is it my passion that causes you these sufferings the countess returned no answer but with her eyes lifted up toward heaven remained in a pensive posture at last nodding to the earl go go my lord said she to him fly from me i conjure you to do it but never rob me of your heart he took leave immediately but with no less violence to himself than if he were to have taken a voyage round the world as his unexpected return to court suprizd everybody so the tranquillity that appeared in all his actions was a matter of such a nature as put madam gray and the earl of pembroke upon the rack to know the cause thereof whilst the king was highly satisfied to see his favorite in the same pleasant humor wherein he so much delighted and the earls friends took no small share in this appearance of his satisfaction  in the mean while the earl of devonshire and the chevalier de hereford were come back to london to pursue the intended discovery for having now sufficient reason to believe that the countess was alive they were resolved to find her out at any rate for which reason they spared neither labor nor cost and had their spies in every corner it had been observed that the earl of warwick attended the king every night till his going to bed and then went to sionhill they knew also that the marquess of montague continued here and that the earl had hired a famous italian picture drawer at an excessive rate because he should work for nobody but for him in effect he had sent this painter to sion hill to draw the countesss picture in her disguise since he looked upon it as a singular satisfaction to have her picture in a place where he might look upon it as often as he thought fit but she refused at first to have her picture drawn and it cost them several days before she would be persuaded to consent to it during which time the painter coming frequently to take a view of her suspected her to be a woman but had more wit than to say the least word of it on the contrary he avoided every thing that might render him suspected of having discovered the truth  the marquess of montague faithfully discharged the trust he attended the countess with much assiduity and neglected nothing that might divert her spleen being carefully seconded by the earl himself who came thither every other day and would have come oftener had not some weighty reason kept him back he gave an account to my lady devonshire of every thing he heard and sometimes would add some thing that might frighten and detain her where she was since the earls chief felicity at this time was centred in her being at sion hill as for the marquess of montague he found to his cost that all the resolutions he had taken of continuing indifferent whilst he remained with the countess proved too weak by far to resist the force of her beauty and merits my brother has no real cause of complaint against me said he to himself i suffer without seeking for ease alas what had i done to him to make me his confident what if i never was in love before and must he therefore suppose me to be insensible in regard to what is the most amiable thing in the world he has prepared such torments for me as must prove fatal to my repose whilst he was making these reflections the earl of warwick as he was a going to sion hill espied him sitting at the foot of a rocky hill near the river side seeing him so pensive he could not forbear to enquire the reason thereof i am ready to confess the truth replied the marquess it is because i am in love with my lady devonshire her eyes exert their power no less over me than over you i have hitherto kept a most profound silence though i was a thousand times in a mind to break it i dont tell you this to cause in you the least symptom of pain i am not a rival dangerous enough to you but cannot forgive my self i should make so ill a use of your confidence in me you would have me my lord speak to her only of you and i can say scare any thing but for my self you would have me serve you and i am vexed to the soul i must do you a disservice after having made you this declaration i desire you would let me return to london whither my duty calls me and where i shall commit nothing that may occasion any displeasure in you  the earl looked upon him for some time at last embracing him said ask me for whatever i am master of in the world i will freely give it you but dear brother as to your passion it is not in my power to ease you i am very well satisfied with your resolution of returning to court for i am sensible a small matter more would make me jealous we will go thither together said the marquess and would to god i had never come hither the earl returned no answer for though he loved his brother dearly his tenderness for the countess surpassed all the rest and he could scarce forgive himself to have been so shortsighted as to leave a person of so much merit and endowed with such great qualifications to entertain the countess  they went both together to pay their respects to her and found her very melancholy on account of the insurmountable difficulties she met with every day which hindered her departure and the earl did not neglect any opportunity of representing them more dangerous than they really were and afterward to flatter her with hopes sometimes of the kings protection sometimes of a reconciliation betwixt her and the countess of anglesey her mother nay he told her he would if all failed carry her into france desiring only she would have a little patience so that by these infinuations he insensibly detained her in a place where he had frequently the satisfaction of being with her as to the marquess of montague he told her that he finding himself not in a capacity to do her any service here he would return to london to serve her more effectually there she returned for answer she was sorry for his departure from sionhill that his witty and complaisant conversation had not a little allayed the bitterness of her discontent and that she would not have consented to his going from sionhill but that she hoped her stay there would not be very long he answered all her obliging expressions only with a respectful silence more intelligible to the earl than to her who now judging it too hazardous to leave his brother behind him with the countess they went together to london this being the first time after the coming of the countess thither the earl showed any inclination of going to town  the italian picturedrawer gained by the pressing instances of the marquess of montague had painted for him a copy of my lady devonshires picture after the original he had drawn at sionhill an indifferent satisfaction to a person so much in love as he was but he considered it as the only thing that might be permitted him without being injurious to his brother as for the painter he found the country so dull that he could not resolve to stay there for any long time but soon fell in love with a young woman who was a great artist in enamelling however he took effectual care to conceal every thing that passed at sionhill notwithstanding these precautions the earl of devonshire having got intelligence how matters stood there engaged the young female painter in his interest the prospect she had to make her fortune at once got the better of her passion for the italian painter besides she considered that by discovering the countess of devonshire she should not sacrifice her lover and if the worst came to the worst she did not much fear the consequences she being resolved so soon as she had got the money to go into italy and to settle there twas upon these considerations that she engaged to use all her endeavors to find out the countess and her lover being much more dextrous in his hands than in his head she told him she would not believe he had been so long at sionhill that he had made this story only to serve for a pretense to get abroad from her and to settle his love in another place and finding her lover touched with these reproahes she gave him to understand that she should not cease to be jealous till he had fully justified himself the poor picturedrawer overcome by passion reveals his masters secret the earl of warwick said he has sent me thither to draw the picture of a young lady i know not and whom he is so careful to conceal from my knowledge that she never appears but in mans apparel i have painted her in an african dress i drew her in his presence for he would not stir from us all the while but in spite of all his precautions i have drawn a copy of it for the marquess of montague besides dressed like a woman which i will show you for i must confess she appears more amiable in a womans dress than under her disguise the young woman charmed with the countesss picture conjured the picturedrawer to lend it her because she would take a copy of it in enamelwork and he who knew nothing of her design was willing enough to let her have it and thus the earl of devonshire was let into a mystery which they had taken so much care to conceal from him but whereof he had entertained some time before a shrewd suspicion  it is easy to be imagined he lost not one moment to take effectual measures to snatch his wife out of the earl of warwicks hands being seconded by the chevalier de hereford both as his friend and kinsman and a despised lover they got together all their friends and in spite of all the earl of warwicks grandeur and being the kings favorite resolved to take such a public satisfaction as should appear suitable to the affront put upon them what injurious suspicion did they not entertain against the countesss reputation it is true in all appearance they had sufficient reason for it besides that in the utmost transport of their fury they could have been sorry to find her innocent sion hill is a very fine seat without any manner of defense adapted only to pleasure as having the convenience of beautiful walks good hunting and commodious fishing so that they needed no vast prepartions to carry away the countess especially at a time when she thought her self in absolute security her coming thither being as she thought kept secure they were well informed that her apartment looked into a terraswalk and that they needed only to beat out a few windows to get into it with ease they knew very well that the earl of warwick whose courage might have checked their design was not to be there that night so they got into the garden without the least noise and dividing themselves into several small parties upon a signal given all met about the countesss lodging room so that it was impossible she should escape their hands the business was soon over for they having pitched upon that time of the night when the whole family was asleep they soon got into the room where finding somebody in bed put a handkerchief into her mouth soon put her into a horse litter which being narrowly watched by the earl of devonshire and the chevalier de hereford they rid on by the sides of it attended by their friends conducted it to a country seat of the earls in the road to windsor being no great distance from sionhill no sooner were they come thither and all the doors ordered to be shut carefully than the earl of devonshire who had been very silent all this while began to break out into most dreadful reproaches whilst the poor captive was brought out of the litter but instead of seeing the fair countess come out all in tears enough as was supposed to move all the beholders to compassion they found a young but very ugly ill shaped lad half dead with fear never was a more surprising metamorphosis seen for many ages so they went abroad again to hunt out the poor countess and the earl of devonshire could scarce forbear to show his resentment against him whom he had mistaken for his lady  the thing happened thus which secured the countess for that time berincour whom the earl of warwick had appointed to attend her seeing her much out of humor proposed to her to take the diversion of going in a boat upon the river and himself acting the part of the waterman he being very shy to trust anybody they were insensibly carried down by the stream at a good distance from the house they were soon after surprised by a most violent storm and berincour mistrusting his skill in managing the boat in such  of weather they made the best they could to the next shore night approaching and the tempest continuing they thought it more safe to take up and pass the night in some adjacent fishermens  than to return to sionhill which they did accordingly being regaled by these poor country people with what beds and other conveniences their cottages afforded  in the mean while the steward and the other domestics belongingg to the earl of warwicks family at sion house no sooner heard the noise on the terras but they ran thither and found every thing in great disorder the windows broken the doors beaten to pieces and all the rich movables of the room destroyed and not able to guess at the meaning thereof took horse immediately to notify what had happened to the e of warwick he was then asleep but so soon as he could be spoken with they told him what had passed last night at sion hill alas who is able to express his confusion at this news such was his distraction that he mistook the lad instead of the countess not doubting in the least it was she and without giving himself to ask any further questions sent for the marquess of montague when he saw him he ran and embraced him o dear brother said he let us die let us die i could not keep that treasure wherewith fortune had entrusted me and so related to him the whole matter the marquess no less discomposed than himself was not in a condition to afford him the least consolation so they mutually condold this loss and then resolved to go straitways to sion hill never was a small journey attended with more grievous symptoms of melancholy the earl did nothing but contrive the most violent resolutions that could be thought of against the e of devonshire though to look upon the thing with an unbiased eye twas certain he had the least occasion of complaint but being the kings favorite twas grown into a custom with him to think he could not be in the wrong when they came in sight of sionhill this seemed to revive and add new strength to his fury see here said he the faithless house which could not keep for me what i loved so tenderly i will set it on fire i will not leave one stone upon another and i will proportion my vengeance to my despair the marquess told him he would assist him with the utmost ardour though one would have thought it should have been less terrible to him to see his mistress with her husband than with a rival who adored her and whose merit was so much superior to his  whilst they were thus riding along the bank of the river they saw a boat drawing near the shore they knew immediately the countess and berincour and though they could scarce believe their eyes they leaped with their horses into the water without considering that by the last nights rains the river was much swollen the earls horse soon getting beyond his depth was carried away by the violence of the current which put him in the utmost danger of being drowned twas at this very moment the countess was convinced within herself how much more beloved he was by her than ever she had imagined before she set forth most lamentable cries which the earl had the satisfaction to hear and when soon after she lost sight of him and actually believed him to be lost she dropped down half dead in the boat without the least signs of sense or motion bernicour not being in a condition to assist her because he and the waterman they had taken along with them rowed with all their strength to save the earls life which they did most fortunately for the earl finding his horse to fall him disentangled his feet out of the stirrops and lighting upon a barge lately sunk there he lays hold of the mast which stood above the water till bernicour came to his aid and took him into the boat  my lady devonshire being not as yet come to her self again the earl threw water in her face calling her by her name holding her upright under her arms and giving her all the assistance that possibly he could she was no sooner recovered a little but the first object she cast her eyes upon was the earl whom she believed to be drowned oh my lord said she what a fright have you put me in how glad i am to see you but madam said he what unexpected good fortune brought you hither when i thought you to be fallen into the hands of the earl of devonshire and how did you make your escape the countess appeared much surprised and discomposed at what might have happened in her absence she related to the earl by what accident she had been prevented from coming to sionhill that night so that the earl now remembered it must be his stewards son whom they had carried off in lieu of the countess he being used to sleep constantly in the lower room to take the better care of its precious furniture however the earl and the countess were both convinced that their secret had taken vent that the earl of devonshire was every where in search for her and that she was likely to meet but with a slender entertainment at his hands  memoirs of the earl of warwick part iii the earl of warwick and the countess of devonshire were considering betwixt themselves what an issue was likely to attend so violent a beginning and he having taken a resolution to carry her to his fine seat at chelsea nobody in the world shall know the least thing of it said he to her if you come there replied she there needs no more to make it known no no madam i put the greatest hardships in the world upon my self to secure you against your enemies i am too sensible of the pain the very apprehension of your being seized occasioned in me not to take all possible precautions against such a danger another time which would infallibly cost me my life were you sensible of my sufferings upon that account you would have all the reason in the world to be convinced that there was never a passion so perfect as mine she being a lady of uncommon prudence did not think fit to return a suitable answer on the contrary being vexed he had been an eye witness of her falling into a swoon she imputed the cause thereof before him rather to her surprise than her tenderness for she could have wished heartily to conceal from him her inclinations and how amiable he appeared in her eyes after some further conversation they agreed to separate the earl was set ashore but the countess stayed in the boat to go to chelsea by water which though not the shortest yet was thought the safest way the earl taking his leave of her with as much tenderness as if it had been for all his lifetime went on straight to sionhill where he met with his brother to their mutual satisfaction being glad he had escaped a danger which they expected would have proved fatal to him being wet to the skin he changed his clothes and took a few hours repose  in the mean time the marquess was got into the earls closet there to afford full liberty to his thoughts how hard is my fate said he i am become a rival to a brother who has been always very dear to me i still tremble at the fear i was in of losing him and after all this it is he that proves the cause of all the misfortunes of my life the earl happening to come in and finding him in this melancholy condition told him dont complain alone dear brother i suffer as much as any man can do because i have not resolution enough to resign to you that slender share of advantage i have above you in the fair countess but believe me all my efforts are fruitless oh my lord replied the earl what is it you tell me is it possible you should have so much tenderness for me the very intention of breaking your chains is an unpardonable crime in you in respect to the countess if it is my fate to wear them as well as your self let not my misfortunes interrupt you pleasures i am sensible i shall pay for it with my life but is it not reasonable i should do so since i have been so imprudent as to stay with her imagining i could be proof against falling in love with her i knew unto what a condition you had been reduced and yet was so fool hardy as not to fear the same in my self you have not had sufficient leisure answered the earl to reflect seriously upon the whole matter it seemed to me as if her very first glances did pierce your heart and if i took not immediate notice of it it was because i believed no body could see her without being struck with admiration the marquess told him with a deep sigh he durst not ask whither she was gone because notwithstanding all his resolution to shun her he should certainly endeavor to see her if this is the case said the earl of warwick i will not entrust you with the secret alas brother added he is it possible love should check the career of our entire friendship what prejudice have you conceived against me my lord replied the marquess am i not sufficiently afflicted dont add to my pain so they run with open arms and embracing one another most tenderly let us love let us love cried they let nothing in the world change our mutual tenderness  it was not long before the rumor of the earl of warwick being drowned was spread all over london and the news thereof was as it happens commonly in such like cases related with such circumstances as every one thought most suitable to his opinion the king himself was deceived by so many appearances of truth that madam gray with whom he happened to be at that time had the mortification of seeing him give all the demonstrations that possibly could be of an excessive grief he went instantly to sionhill and understood upon the road what had happened there how the earl of devonshire thinking to find his lady there had beaten down the doors and windows and carried off the stewards son  the earl of warwick in his return to london met the king upon the road who by this giving him such sensible proofs of his affection he received them with all possible acknowledgment though this was not the first time he had known the effects of this monarchs goodness the king having told him a thousand obliging things concerning the trouble he had been in upon his account made him come into his coach and asked him whether it were actually true that the countess of devonshire had sought for refuge at sion hill the earl was put to the greatest nonplus that could be had it been to the king only he was to impart the secret of the countess he would not have hesitated long in the matter especally since the king dred an ingenuous confession but knowing that it would soon come to madam grays ears he was too sensible it could not be put into the hands of a worse person who would improve it to do her mischief upon this consideration he told the king smiling that he begged he would put himself in his place and then tell him whether he would reveal a secret of a lady who had put her whole confidence in him that it was certain the earl of devonshire had been deceived by some false intelligence but that if such a thing should happen that the countess should have so much confidence in him as to come to his house he would rather die upon the spot than discover it the king found it would be in vain to ask any more questions but was not a little dissatisfied that his favorite unto whom he bore so great an affection should refuse to lay open his heart to him  twas an easy matter for the earl of devonshire to make the lad whom he had seized confess that jamy had been at sionhill but was not come home that night and that in all appearance he had changed his quarters his fury being raised to such a pitch as not to be able to contain it within any reasonable bounds he resolved to pick a quarrel with the earl of warwick and accordingly attended by some of his friends went to london where he appeared the next day in the playhouse knowing that the earl of warwick was there before  the noise of what had happened at sionhill being already spead over the town and these two having not been seen together in one place for some time past every one was more intent upon them than the play wherein they soon acted a considerable part for no sooner was the first act over but the earl of devonshire advancing with a fierce countenance toward the earl of warwick struck him with his glove in the face it is easy to guess whether the earl who was as fierce as he was brave resented such an affront he drew his sword as the earl of devonshire had done before and so they made the stage serve them instead of a field of battle till those that were there throwing themselves betwixt them patted them at last in spite of all their endeavors to decide the quarrel upon the spot they went away but with such furious looks as sufficiently showed they were resolved to fulfill their revenge and the time and place of the duel being mutually agreed on they got out of the court for fear the king to prevent the combat should put them under confinement the king actually gave orders to shut up all the gates and to go in search for them in all places where probably they might be found showing himself extremely uneasy on account of this quarrel which was not likely to be ended without a fatal catastrophe madam gray who knew the earl of devonshire to be one of the bravest men in the world and consequently most proper to rid her of an enemy told the king he ought not to prevent their fighting together that according to all outward appearance the earl of warwick was instrumental in concealing the countess a thing not easy to be digested by an husband that on the other hand the earl of warwick having received so signal an affront could not avoid taking safaction for it i understand you madam replied the king with much impatience you are overjoyed to see your own quarrel revenged and provided the earl of warwick have his throat cut you will easily be prevailed upon to make his funeral oration but i who look upon this matter with quite another eye than you do am sensible i must be a loser let the event be what it will if the earl of warwick is killed i shall be inconsolable if the earl of devonshire comes to the worst i lose a man of merit so i am resolved to compose the difference let it cost what it will  in the mean time the two earls had appointed the place of their meeting at barnelms a most delicious walk upon the river thames about six miles from london each brought his second along with him viz the earl of warwick the marquess of montague and the earl of devonshire the chevalier de hereford these two engaged one another not as seconds usually do out of complaisance to their friends but a secret aversion whereof they knew not the cause made them fight most furiously in short they were rivals and so the combat did not end till with the death of the chevalier de hereford and the marquess being dangerously wounded fell for dead upon the ground the earls of warwick and devonshire fought like two lions till the last was run through and killed and the first received a wound in the arm this was the conclusion of this fatal combat  the earl of warwick touched to the heart to see the marquess montague so dangerously wounded and imagining that his passion for the countess and the little hopes he had of being beloved had made him careless of his life began to blame himself for having chosen him his second alas said he it is i that have drawn my brother into a quarrel which i ought to have maintained alone was not i very unfortunate when i left him at sionhill with the countess i knew the force of her charms was irresistible was it not an imprudent action in me to leave him in so dangerous a place i must die continued he if he dies and if he out lives it i ought to resign to him what he loves being more worthy of her than my self all this while he did not neglect to give all possible assistance to the marquess when he found abundance of blood trickle down his arm from a wound he had not perceived by reason of the heat of the combat but finding that there was no long staying for them in this place he got into a boat with his brother upon the thames and so to london where he kept him concealed till he knew how this matter would be relished by the king this done he himself went alone privately to chelsea where he entered his house through a back door of the garden whereof he had the key  having lost abundance of blood he looked out for a place where to take a little rest and making up toward an arbor which was not as yet covered with green because it was early in the spring he espied a woman there and approaching gently found her to be the countess of devonshire the sight of her caused such an emotion in him as is easy to be guessed at for the part he was to act was of such a nature that was to decide of so many things that he did not know how to speak nor how to keep silence at last the same inclination that naturally engages us to follow what we love got the ascendant over all other considerations due to the widow of the earl of devonshire he drew near with a fearful look and at once throwing himself at her feet presented his sword to her if you believe i deserve your anger madam said he punish me this is the same sword which has revenged you upon the earl of devonshire he is no more among the living will you pierce a heart that adores you whilst he was thus addressing himself to the countess she stood amazed not knowing to what all this tended till she understood that the man who was the most dear to her in the world had killed her husband she set forth a most lamentable cry and groaned as if she were giving up the ghost her eyes open and her body without motion and speech as if she had been turned into stone the earl who knew too well the agony of her soul durst not say one word to her but such was the emotion of his spirits as made the blood run afresh from his wound down his arm upon the ground i am a going to die madam said he if you would have it so i will make no complaints against my destiny yes cruel man said she i desire to see the end of your life i owe it as a sacrifice to the memory of the earl of devonshire you are his murderer alas why did you not rather commit this murder upon me i would pardon you my death but it is not in my power to forgive you his every thing obliges me to hate you i must declare an implacable war against you and omit nothing to take revenge of you one stroke more said he to her you need not look out for any other arms but your aversion you see unto what a condition i am reduced i am only afraid my blood will not run fast enough to satisfy your anger pray make use of my sword and dont refuse me this melancholy satisfaction of dying by your hands oh is it in my power barbarous man cried she as if you were ignorant of that fatal ascendent you have got over my heart alas you are only too sensible of it you insult over me in that you dare come to present your self before me and still more when you desire your death at my hands let me lament at my own leisure the excess of my misfortunes this last catastrophe has cast me into an unconceivable despair for i see in your person the enemy of my husband of my children and of my family and nevertheless suffer you in my presence and dont find within my self those motions of that implacable hatred i ought to bear you punish me madam i am at your feet ready to submit to any thing replied the earl with a low and feeble voice and then his strength failing he lay stretched out upon the ground covered all over with blood speechless and in a cold sweat  the surprise this accident caused in the fair countess is scarce to be conceived at that very instant leaving her revenge to the law and the kings disposal and looking upon it as a base action to fight against a vanquished enemy all her care was bent upon his relief berincour who had got notice of his masters arrival and who was in search after him happened to come that way at that very juncture of time and seeing him in company with the countess was going back out of respect she called him to her and showing the earl whose head she held with her hands said come to our assistance we are both a going to die berincour frighted to the heart to see his master in such a condition begged the countess to assist him and then bound up the wound in his arm so dexterously that the blood was stopped immediately he then went to fetch some water which he sprinkled into his face and this with certain cordial drops he gave him immediately brought him to himself out of the swoon that had been occasioned by the loss of blood and spirits and the emotion he felt at the reproaches of the countess of devonshire overjoyed to see her so near him alas madam said he is it you am i worthy of your pity would you have me live or do you reserve me with an intention to make me a more public example of your revenge she answered not a word but cried without intermission the earl of warwick went slowly to the house supported by berincour but the countess remained in the arbor to abandon herself to her grief which being somewhat checked by the earls presence when she now saw herself alone good god what melancholy reflections did not she make upon the odness of her destiny she was mistress of too great a share of sense not to foresee the consequences of so tragical an accident how the blame of the earl of devonshires death was to be laid at her door since at the same time she lay concealed at the earl o warwicks what other interpretation can this admit of said she and who will be able to discern my innocence involved in so many dark ridles she considered herself like a woman banished the world abandoned by her relations and friends where should she seek for refuge now how be able to appear at court how to live a vagabondlife and lie under a suspicion of a love intrigue her grief prevailed so far over spirits that she was ready to drop down dead when berincour coming very seasonably to her relief conjured her to give a visit to his master in his chamber i will never see him more said she all in tears he has robbed me of my reputation he has disturbed the repose of my life i am resolved to leave this place let the event be what it will had it been upon another occasion berincour would have been much surprised at these expressions but knowing what just cause she had to be thus afflicted he did all that lay in his power to give her some consolation at the same time he made such pressing instances to engage her to see the earl to consult about their affairs representing to her that else he would certainly come out to see her that at last she consented to his requrst  madam said the earl to her i am too cautious in every thing relating to you to suffer with patience you should he charged of having too much indulgence for me i would willingly please you it is the only desire and business of my life it is the only happiness i know of but rather than this happiness the greatest of all others to me should fall to my lot at the expense of your honor i should have resolution enough to resign it judge by this whether i make serious reflections upon what course you ought to take upon this occasion nay i dare go farther and advise you to go immediately to throw yourself at the kings feet and demand my head for having fought your husband and killed him contrary to the laws of the land and without his majestys permission but considering that the earl and countess of anglesey may not be so soon reconciled to you and that your husbands executors out of prejudice taken against you may be backwards in supplying you with what is necessary to make your appearance at court i desire you to accept of these jewels which being of a considerable value will enable you to prosecute me to death  are these the arms you put into my hands wherewith to fight you o the most generous enemy that ever was or ever will be cried the countess how would you have me make use of your obligations to persecute you and to declare myself your enemy when you heap favors upon me leave me my lord to my own entire liberty to hate you the road you cut out to come to my heart is too offensive to me i desire nothing of yours because i would not be charged with ingratitude when i must act against you the earl employed all his rhetoric to persuade her but in vain she had a soul too noble to burden herself with such an obligation after having said many things more or rather all what the nature of so odd an adventure would admit of how can i added she ask the king to give me satisfaction proportionable to the evil you have done me when i owe you already such signal obligations and after all though the world is not acquainted with the true reason thereof every body has taken such a prejudice against me already that they will believe the whole to be only a droll no matter for that madam replied the earl it ought to be your care to have nothing to reproach to yourself let time and chance take care for the rest is it possible said she you can imagine i should for the future be your most cruel enemy and is it possible madam said he you should be so i have always preserod such pure and respectful sentiments for you i have had so slender a share in that unfortunate accident which renders you inconsolable i received so gross an affront from the earl of devonshire before i so much as thought of revenge that if you will examine my whole conduct you will agree with me that i deserve only compassion  they continued their discourse for a considerable time till at last the earl saw the countess take her final leave and that with such an affliction on his side that he never felt the like before at any time of their separation berincour attended her to london and the earl went in his barge the same way accompanying the boat wherein his adorable countess was with his eyes as far as he could and would rather have chosen to follow her to the worlds end than to have been king of england  scarce was the duel betwixt the earls of devonshire and warwick over but the dismal news thereof came to the kings ears and the whole court every body run to barnelms some out of friendship others out of curiosity but nothing was to be seen there the dead bodies were removed and the living gone the king was extremely uneasy at this accident not knowing as yet the event or on which side the scale had turned but was sensible it must needs fall very hard upon the earl of warwick and the countess of devonshire for whom he still retained some favorable inclinations notwithstanding his former grudge to see himself so indifferently treated by her  the earl of warwick durst not venture to go to court but writ a letter full of respect and submission to the king begging his protection against the widow and relations of the earl of devonshire he represented that the affront given him at the play house was of such a nature as not to be wiped off but by the death of his rival and that he durst not presume to throw himself at his majestys feet without his permission  his letter met with a favorable reception from the king but nevertheless ordered him to keep himself concealed for some time for fear that if he should immediately appear at his lodgings at court the whole family of the earl of devonshire would unanimously complain of his partiality to see him in the same degree of favor as before  the countess of devonshire upon her arrival in london went to her nurses the only place where she could hope for a kind reception what a strange turn of fortune for the handsomest lady in the kingdom born to so great an estate and related to all the great men of the court what an odd change i say for a lady of her age who had sacrified her inclination to her virtue and who had nothing that was material to reproach her self with it is true her innocence was her only comfort and had she been otherwise her guilt would have much increased her misfortunes she writ letters to all her family she spoke to the earls executors to act with her in concert to prosecute the earl of warwick but these were so far from doing so that they treated her very harshly and told her they would bring an indictment against her and that she had best to look to herself since she would find it one of the hardest pieces of work she had ever met with in all her life a reception so different from what she had promised to herself both surprised and afflicted her to the highest degree she then endeavored a reconciliation with the earl and countess of anglesey and their affection for their daughter was not so far extinguished but that it might have been rekindled again had the good effects thereof not been prevented by those that did her a thousand ill offices with them  all these misfortunes were not able to subdue her courage she had taken a resolution the most difficult of all to demand justice against the earl of warwick and all the obstacles she met in her way was not comparable to that she threw herself at the kings feet in her widows robes and though her eyes were drowned in tears they had not lost their force the king thought her now a thousand times more handsome than when she first made him her conquest and the earl of warwick appeared a thousand times more guilty to him to have known how to get so far the ascendant over so charming a person which had made him kill the earl of devonshire he promised the countess to treat her enemy according to the utmost rigor of the law being very much pleased to have an opportunity of tormenting her in a way she durst not complain of for whatever precaution she took not to betray her sentiments by her looks the young monarch soon discovered her uneasiness thus they revenged themselves upon one another the king by threatening the person beloved by the countess and she in discovering her favorable inclinations for his rival  soon after she found that her name was inserted also in the bill presented against the earl of warwick and that they were for securing her person to call her to account where she had absconded herself during her absence from her family this new disgrace obliged her to have recourse to the kings protection which she did one evening when she knew he had not been very well that day and that notwithstanding this orders had been given by his majesty that she should be admitted into his closer she had a long veil over her face and as she was passing in a chair along a dark gallery a gentleman wrapped up in his cloak stopping the chairmen whither are you going madam said he have you forgot the kings passion and what praises he has bestowed upon you but lately oh cruel woman you intend to make me a sacrifice to this dangerous rival you will rekindle the old flame the countess by these words knowing him to be the earl of warwick alas dont you know said she what a condition i am reduced to would you have me destroyed by my enemies and are not you of the same opinion with me that the king is so deeply enamored with madam gray that he thinks no more of me i cannot rest satisfied upon that point replied the earl i am sensible that the impressions you make are too lively to be soon defaced if the king sees you once more he will certainly fall in love with you i came just now from him and it was he that told me he expected your coming he waits for you with the utmost impatience but madam for gods sake dont go thither secure me against a misfortune i foresee will befall me  you make me afraid of myself my lord said he i dont desire to be beloved by the king speak to him in my behalf and get an order from him for me to be admitted into a nunnery for since i cannot see you without being criminal contrive it so that i may see nobody in the world the earl overjoyed at this extraordinary piece of complaisance of the countess returned her a thousand thanks assuring her he would omit nothing to obtain the order she desired from the king however when he began to intimate to the king the resolution the countess had taken of retiring into a nunnery this prince told him he would never consent to it and that since she had no such thoughts when he saw her last this must be the product of his counsels to her the earl being not a little surprised at the kings answer was now fully convinced that neither time nor all the charms of madam gray had been powerful enough to raze out of the kings mind the impressions made there by the countess of devonshire and that therefore it was high time for him to persuade her to conceal herself  though the earl of warwicks authority was very great at that time in england yet out of a decorum in respect of the death of the earl of devonshire he saw none but his intimate friends the marquess of montague did the same his wounds proving so dangerous that his life was more than once despaired of because the little care he took of it proved a great hinderance to his cure the earl of warwick would fain have been constantly with him but his passion for the countess of devonshire called him to other places where he might do her the most effectual service  this fair widow as soon as she understood the kings refusal to let her go into a nunnery was contriving a place of retirement where she might remain unknown to all the world she stood in need of the earl of warwicks assistance without which she found it would be very difficult for her to compass her designs he caused to be purchased a house privately which made but a slender appearance on the out side but so magnificently adorned within that the palace of psyche built by love itself could not be more pleasant or more agreeable the countess was very willing to accept of this retirement prided the earl of warwick would not come there to see her being persuaded that she could not without guilt continue a strict correspondence with a man who had killed her husband and the earl fearing lest she should be discovered in her lodgings unless she went thither with all possible speed promised to do every thing she desired the earl of warwick sent berincour to attend her at her new house whilst he stayed at london with the marquess of montague he had been in no small danger from his enemies could the king have been prevailed upon to leave him to their mercy but the friendship he bore him put a stop to their designs so that though they without intermission reiterated their instances for the king to leave him to the ordinary course of the law he always found means to put them off by ambiguous answers till they were convinced that all their solicitations were likely to be in vain the countess on the other hand now began to flatter herself that living in this place of retirement without the least noise or luster she would soon be forgot by all the world when the earl of pembroke now deeper in love with her than ever he had been before found out her house and left no stone unturned to get admittance there it is true this was no casie task to be compassed but in england as in most other countries there are few things which may not be purchased by money  the earl found means to engage one of the countesss waiting women into his interest she opened to him a little back gate by which he entered into a most curious flowergarden where her mistress used to walk every night he lay concealed betwixt a hedge of trees when he saw her coming along negligently dressed in mourning and more beautiful than the mother of love her self the sight of her put him into an unspeakable confusion for if he loved her beyond all the world he respected her no less and feared to disoblige her if he accosted her she will doubtless says he be offended at the liberty i take all the imprecations i can make will not clear me from the suspicion she has conceived of my being one of the most intimate friends of madam gray nay perhaps she may fancy i am in love with her but she will scarce think it worth her while to reflect thus far the happy earl of warwick takes up all her thoughts and she little concerns her self about me the countess had already taken several turns in the garden before he durst venture to come out from behind the hedge but at last he did throwing himself immediately at her feet she frightened to the heart run away and the earl thinking she knew him and that what she did was out of an aversion to him resolved to make her sensible of the torments he suffered for her no madam said he keeping her back no i dont come here to deplore at your feet these unconceivable evils you make me suffer i come here to load you with reproaches as being the most cruel of all women living i come i say to complain of that unjust preference you give to the earl of warwick to the man who has killed your husband to him who is the enemy of your family it is him you have chosen your confident your protector and the dearest of your friends whilst i lead a lingering unfortunate life which it is impossile for me to hold without pleasing you and which i intend to sacrifice to you if you dont think it worthy your care there is so little reason in what you say replied the countess moved at his reproaches that a man must be very presumptuous to come to a place where i will be seen by no body to upbraid me with my misfortunes once for all my lord i forbid you to come here any more  the same moment the earl of pembroke espied the earl of warwick what a surprising sight for an amorous and jealous person he did not question but that they had an interview every night in that garden and that there was a very strict correspondence betwixt them as the earl of warwick on the other hand was not a little exasperated at the sight of him in that place  how is it you my lord cried the earl of warwick is it possible your curiosity should lead you so far beyond its bounds as to forget what is owing to a person of that quality and merit as my lady devonshire is and you my lord your self replied the earl fiercely dont you set me a good example have not i as much zeal and respect for her as you have i not an extreme ambition to serve her and in a word have i been accessory to her misfortune all this signifies nothing answered the earl of warwick briskly there is no comparison betwixt your passion and mine but this is not a place fit to dispute this matter in the earl of warwick carrying his arm still in a scarf scarf the earl of pembroke was ready to burst  madness because he had for a considerable me past been very desirous to fight him and whilst they were discoursing together the couness took this opportunity of absenting her self eing vexed to the soul to see her self discovered in her retirement this being her chief consolation at that time to hope to remain concealed from all the world  as for the earl of pembroke he used frequently to commit such errors in his passion as he heartily repented of afterward and so it happened in this case he run away like a madman to madam gray and told her what he had seen in relation to their common enemies she pleased to the heart to have found so fair an opportunity of revenging her self of them without more ado told it to all the world that the countess of devonshire not satisfied to have drawn so many misfortunes upon her family lived near london in a house belonging to the earl of warwick this piece of hers so nearly touched the whole family of this lady that it is not to be expressed how many ill effects it produced to her and the executors of the late earl obtained an act laying a fine of one hundred marks of gold upon the earl of warwick to be paid by him as often as he should go to see her  the earl was little concerned thereat as on the other hand it proved some satisfaction to the countess i shall now said she be freed from the hazard of receiving his visits which must have always been attended with a thousand troublesome consequences a long absence is sometimes requisite to perform a cure but after some further reflections dare i added she flatter my self with the enjoyment of any tranquillity have not i found by experience that ever since that fatal day i first saw the earl it has not been in my power to forget him what attempts have i not carried on against my own heart i cannot upbraid my self with having been too indulgent to him would it please heaven the world was as well convinced of the uprightness of my sentiments as i am being fully resolved to lead a reserved life the kings endeavors to see her proved all in vain she was not for furnishing new matter of discourse upon her own account and therefore rejected all his offers with as much resolution as respect the king laid the fault thereof upon the earl of warwick how far she is prepossessed in his behalf said he speaking of her and how he tries my patience to the utmost to dare to love where i love these reflections began by degrees to make him raze out of his memory the remembrance of the services and the acknowledgments he owed to the earl he forgot it was he who had put the crown on his head or if he remembered it it was to be sorry he owed him such an obligation it is certain that any man less in love or less generous than the earl of warwick would have been very cautious to incur a fine of an hundred marks of gold but he slighted it and if he took any precaution at all when he went to the countess it was only not to expose her to the discourse of others  his impatience of seeing her carrying him above all other considerations he used no other disguise than a cloak so alone he went very late at night her surprise when she saw him come into her room was such that nothing can be compared to it do you consider my lord said she what you do you furnish our common enemies with weapons to fight us and how dearly will you pay for this useless visit you give me provided it is not displeasing to you replied he i ave considered of all the rest madam i dont hink this satisfaction too dearly bought though i ay one hundred marks of gold for every time i have the honor of seeing you and i should never be much concerned about the fine if you would but give me leave to run the hazard of paying it oftener there is but little reason for what you tell me added she but my lord you ought not only to have a regard to your own satisfaction in this business but also to my reputation which ought to be a thousand times dearer to you reflect upon what the world will think of me if you come to visit me i am still the widow of the earl of devonshire oh madam you are still the most cruel woman to me in the world replies the earl my passion my constancy my respect nothing is able to open my way to your heart you always continue to be rigorous to me the countess returned no answer to these reproaches but lifting up her eyes to heaven fetched a deep sigh  he stayed as long as she would give him leave but the visit was soon discovered for they had their spies who observed every body that went in and out at my lady devonshires so the earl being convicted was forced to pay the fine which he did with so noble a freedom as tended more to the confusion of his enemies than caused the least dissatisfaction to him the king could not forbear to speak to him about it is it possible said he you should go about to be your own ruin and that you should not have conduct enough to forbear visiting my lady devonshire did your majesty but know how far my extravagancy exceeds all bounds you would not speak to me thus for sir to confess the truth hitherto i can say i have not seen one minute which might flatter me to be beloved i come to her against her consent i submit to all the harsh rebukes she imposes upon me and to make up the matter they make me pay an hundred marks of gold i can scarce believe you said the king laughing certainly at that rate you are fit for a dark room with nothing but straw in it  the countess understood with the greatest vexation that could be how the earl of warwick had paid the fine and that this last accident was enough to set even those who had entertained a good opinion of her hitherto against her her affliction was so excessive that she cried for many days together the earl who received constant news from her could not be at rest till he gave her another visit in hopes to afford her some consolation but being no more cautious than before he was discovered a second time and was forced once more to pay the same fine the king threatened him with his disgrace unless he could alter his measures and the countess of oxford was so far exasperated against the countess of devonshire that she joined her interest with madam gray and all the rest of her enemies to tear her quite to pieces  this aversion had its rise from a most furious jealousy she had conceived against her because they had always been rivals in point of beauty and the countess of oxford who was infinitely fond of her husband had taken a fancy that he sighed for my lady devonshire perhaps she was not in the wrong of it but if he did his destiny was the same with all the rest of those that loved her notwithstanding all this this lady having conceived a hatred against her took upon her to make a most desperate noise about the earl of warwicks extravagancies he was heartily vexed at it but to no purpose he left off visiting her but this served only to exasperate her the more which made her spread abroad abundance of falous stories which passed for true ones acording to he course of the world it is enough at the darts of a slanderous tongue thrown against a handsome lady are backed by a multide to make them exert their full force espeially if she be under the clouds and her beauy and charms attract more envy than compason  the earl of warwick almost reduced to depair to see so many obstacles in his way contried a certain subterraneous vaulted passage eaching to the countess of devonshires house  this passage were several spacious apartments adapted to the two seasons of the year those for the summer being crusted over with fine marble and other costly stones those for the winter were wainscoted with the finest wood he laid out besides this above  0000 l erling in rich movables such as brass staues gold silver and crystal vessels brocadd beds and such like so that those of his inimate friends whom he admitted to the sight hereof thought they had been brought into an nchanted palace these apartments being fiishd with all possible expedition he writ to the countess the most respectful and the most engaging letter that could be conjuring her to make is the place of her retirement from whence he would open a door into her garden if she would be pleased to give her consent but she hewd so invincible an aversion to it and rejectd his proposition with so much haughtiness that he had but little hopes of seeing her settled here  this put him under an extraordinary perplexity for several days which the marquess of montague who was then with him taking notice of i cannot without some regret said he enquire after your secret because you will perhaps imagine my curiosity to proceed rather from my own than your interest but my lord let your opinion be what it will upon that head i cannot forbear to take my share in your grief and look upon it as if it were my own oh brother you need not fear to be suspected by me cried the earl my affairs are reduced to so lamentable a condition scarce any body will go about to cross me the countess of devonshire forbids me to see her and i know not what to think of so rigorous a sentence the king loves her still how cried he shall the luster of his crown deface the merits of my passion does she know that if i would have consulted my own advantage only i might sit in the same throne whereof i put him in possession so generous an action as this is it not worthy of the highest esteem i can scarce believe said the marquess she should prefer the king to you and would it please heaven her heart were prepossessed by no other but him but my lord  i understand you brother said the earl you love her still but the consideration you have for me makes you not embark upon this fatal ocean you dont know as yet how terrible it will prove to you but dont take my word for it dont check your passion longer upon my account if it is my destiny to meet with rivals you will be instrumental in helping me to vanquish them and if fate will not afford me the satisfaction of being beloved by her make your self to be beloved it will afford me some sort of consolation  the marquess transported with joy at what he told him embraced him most tenderly and how my lord said he do you give your consent for me to serve your divine countess what you just now spoke to me does it proceed from some sudden motion or is it owing to your more serious considerations dont trouble your self replied the earl about the reason that made me say so but make the best of it if you can the marquess of montague did not think fit to push the matter any further for that time and he was so taken up already with the flattering idea of pleasing the countess or at least of endeavoring it or to die at her feet if she would not suffer him to live for her that he could think of nothing else than how to put his design in execution this proved no easy task for she had taken such precautions to avoid the visits of the king and of the earls of warwick and pembroke that her house was as narrowly guarded as a fort notwithstanding all this the marquess got in she was surprised to hear his name and hesitated for a while whether she should give him admittance he being brother to the earl of warwick who had been his second in the late duel but it was not in her power to rob her self of the pleasure of hearing some news or other from him and as she expected he brought her some she had not strength enough to refuse him the marquess accosted her with such symptoms of fear in his face as much surprised her i am come madam said he to justify my conduct perhaps you have been told i knew before hand of their quarrel which occasioned the duel doubtless i should have been acquainted with it had i been in london but happening to go out of town that very day when they quarrelled in the playhouse i came to london again at that very time when my brother had occasion for me he only desired me to meet him at such a place which i did but give you leave to guess what surprise i was in when i saw there the earl of devonshire and the chevalier de hereford this last attacked the first and i need not tell you the rest you being fully informed of it  alas my lord said she dont recall to my mind such dreadful misfortunes however it affords me some consolation to see you take so much pains to justify yourself she fetched a deep sigh and the marquess highly perplexed whether he had best to speak or no threw himself at her feet like one out of his senses never was a surprise comparable to hers for she immediately discovered the secret symptoms of an amorous heart which hitherto had concealed its fire you see here madam said he with a trembling voice a most miserable victim offered to satisfy your anger and if to worship you as we do the sun that gives us light is the way to incur your displeasure i am the most guilty among all your adorers it is the fate of your family cried the countess to disgrace mine what is it i have done to you to cause me so much dissatisfaction rather say madam replied the marquess what crime have i committed to be thus exposed to your indifferency you dont so much as think me worthy your anger oh madam i am a thousand times more unfortunate than i thought myself to be does the earl of warwick know added she of your coming hither yes he knew of it replied the marquess he made his complaints to me and believed questionless by woeful experience that my destiny would be no better than his but madam since decency permits you not to choose him for your spouse the same reason does not hold i think in respect to me i  in a condition to protect you against the violent ddresses of the king and the animosity of your nemies i dare assure you there are certain amilies that will not see themselves tamely opressd and my brother will see my happiness with satisfaction is it possible what you tell me ould be true replied the countess interrupting him if it be so it is time to die good god what is it i hear said the marquess i had flattered myself too much whilst he remained overwhelmed in a deep study the countess full of melancholy thoughts framed a thousand confused projects which all tended toward her leaving england but the king having taken effectual care to stop her passage in all the seaports it was in vain to make an attempt of that nature  the marquess took his leave of my lady devonshire more amorous and more afflicted than any man upon earth for he had flattered himself she would not be averse to change her name for his the grandeur of his family the kings favor the applause of the people but above all his personal merit seemed to plead so far for him as that he needed scarce fear a refusal but though my lady devonshire was yet very young she had such cruel experiences of the inconstancy of humane affairs she had seen so many melancholy days and hours that all her aim now tended to nothing else than how to spend her days in tranquillity by concealing that fatal beauty which no body could look upon with indifferency  the king continued his visits to madam gray with the utmost application and at the same time left no stone unturned to do the earl of warwick all the ill offices he could with  lady devonshire besides that he was no less assiduous to persuade mrs elizabeth lucy that he loved none but her such variety of gallantries as it could not make him really happy so it could not be pleasing to his mistresses madam gray being a lady of the nicest virtue had got an absolute ascendant over the king which she could not have maintained long had she not been one of the most cunning women of her age she began to be weary to see herself put off from time to time in her marriage with the king you know sir said she upon what condition you engaged me to change my solitude for the court i dont think it reasonable that the desire of keeping your promise should engage you into a business of ill consequence but it is also less reasonable i should continue any longer in a place where i may be justly suspected of showing some criminal complaisance you have promised me every thing i ask you for nothing sir except your permission to avoid you consider a little the present state of my affairs cried the king i am scarce settled in the throne and which is still in contest betwixt me and those of lancastor they have still a party who will not fail to make use of the least suspicion of our marriage to create a jealousy in the english nation and you will see the earl of warwick whose power is only too great at the head of them you know the enmity he bears you if therefore you will but afford me a little time i will endeavor to the utmost of my power to give you entire satisfaction your majesty deceives yourself when you talk to me in this manner sir added madam gray i am too well acquainted with this kind of language to be much mistaken in it i am not ignorant sir of your passion for the countess of devonshire i know your sentiments for mrs elizabeth lucy i dont intend to be any longer an obstacle in their way i have a kind of pride within me which tells me a divided heart is not worthy of mine  the king answered to the fair widows reproaches in the style of a passionate lover though at the same time he took no farther care to discharge his promise to her all his thoughts being quite taken up with my lady devonshire he was resolved to see her but knew not how because she had changed her habitation and kept the secret from every body except a very few persons whom she knew to be trusty and silent he was continually tormented with these desires and believing the earl of warwick the only happy person the obligations he owed his rival caused no small vexation in his mind as the earl of pembroke had always had a considerable share in his favor and that he had observed of late much coldness betwixt him and the earl of warwick he pitched upon him for his confident  i never ceased said he to him to love the countess of devonshire her deportment vexes me to the heart my honor seems now to be concerned in it she avoids me she hides her self warwick is the man who has all the preference i would make her love me to revenge myself both of her and him endeavor to find her out and i will make it my business to please her  the earl of pembroke accepted this commission with great satisfaction because he was absolutely at variance with the earl of warwick who had loaded him with bloody reproaches calling him an ungrateful faithless man and pembrook not accustomed to take such language had returned him a suitable answer so that since that time they never saw one another but in the kings presence his passion for the countess was turned into a kind of madness and he felt all the rage of a most direful jealousy and such a despair as is almost inseparable from an unfortunate lover it came into his head to advise the king to send out of the way the earl of warwick he proposed it to his majesty accordingly who highly approving his conceit they had nothing more to do than to find out a fair pretense  i told you before there was an implacable hatred betwixt madam gray and the earl of warwick the earl knew she had sacrificed him to the king and that in some measure she had been the occasion of the disgrace of my lady devonshire and madam gray on the other hand believed it was him who had hitherto dissuaded the king from marrying her so the earl of pembroke judged her a proper subject to enter into their consultation of removing this favorite from the king his age and circumstances requiring he should think of a spouse three parties had been proposed viz margaret princess royal of scotland isabella heiress of castile married afterward to the king of aragon and bomua princess of savoy sister to charloite spouse to lewis xi king of france  the king pretended to pitch upon the last and spoke to the earl of warwick about it no otherwise than if he had really intended the match and the earl who always feared he might marry madam gray took this opportunity to represent to him all the advantages he was likely to reap of this march he told him that margaret of anjou whose courage was as great as her misfortunes was continually soliciting for troops for lewis xi to conduct them into england and endeavor the reestablishment of henry in the throne but that he having once married that kings wifes sister she could not expect any succors there and in short omitted noching he thought requisite to convince the king of the necessity of pursuing that design  the king then told him that this being a negotitation of such consequence he could not cast his eyes upon any body who was likely to acquit himself better of so great a trust than himself and that therefore he wished he would without losing time in the preparing or staying for his equipage go directly to the french court  the marquess of montague stayed for his return from court at his own house dear brother said the earl to him i am going into france upon the kings service and for the countesses tranquillity i hope that such a princess as bonna of savoy will fix him so that we may not see him in love with every handsome woman he meets that madam gray may be removed from court and that at last he may be mindful of what we have done for him i must see my lady devonshire i must give her an account how matters go and receive from her mouth the rules of my future conduct  go go my lord answered the marquess full of grief you will meet with a good reception it is not you she intends to avoid it is the king it is the earl of pembroke it is my lord of oxford and alas it is myself pray heavens it prove so cried the earl but it is only too true that my destiny is the same she listens to her duty before her inclination she has banished me since i fought her husband and you may guess at it by the care she has taken to conceal herself more from me than from you however brother though she hates me i recommend her to you as that which is most dear to me in the world you are of yourself sufficently disposed to serve her so that it is less needful to urge it to you but i shall think my self as much indebted to you as if you did it with reluctance alas my lord replied the marquess how shall i be able to answer your desire you are acquainted with my passion i have chosen you for my only confident and notwithstanding this i check my passion so far as not to be jealous of your good fortune i will then serve her in your name as if it were for myself what can you ask more from the most unfortunate man upon earth he said no more nor did the earl return any answer but taking the first opportunity of getting away unperceived by any went to the countess she had changed both her name and habitation the earl who was informed of every thing took nobody along with him for fear of being discovered and carried with him a billet he had writ before which he delivered to the person that let him in without desiring to be admitted into the house  the countess read the billet with an extreme emotion she was surprised at the earls departure and under a great uncertainty what to resolve upon how was it possible she should let him go into france without seeing him and how was it possible to see him without exposing herself to the hazard of a thousand misfortunes however her inclinations got the better of her prudence and she admitted the earl into her closet is it possible my lord said she you should find me out every where is it not high time you should let me die in tranquillity you know what apprehensions i live under from those who hate me dont reproach me with my passion madam replied the earl i have acted beyond my strength in checking my inclinations to see you but could you be so rigorous as to command me to go out of the kingdom without giving me leave to conjure you to go along with me i will find out a way to get you safely aboard must i leave you at london whilst i am a going to paris and is it in my power to follow you my lord cried the countess under what color can i take such a resolution pray consider my real interest and then tell me whether it is possible for me to do it were the danger you are likely to be exposed to less than it is answered the earl i should perhaps not urge you so far as i do to avoid it but madam take my word for it the kings thoughts are not so much taken up with madam gray nor with mrs elizabeth lucy nor with his intended marriage with the princess of savoy but that he thinks of gaining your heart the difficulty he meets with in the conquest thereof serves only to inflame his desire his glory and pleasure to be short madam he is a king he is amiable handsome and witty what is it i have not to fear nothing at all my lord i assure you said she nothing at all it is true you are not a king but it was your own fault you were not one for the rest you yourself know that the king has not gained the least advantage upon my heart would it please heaven i could treat you with the same indifferency as i do him then come into france added the earl throwing himself at her feet come divine countess hasten to appear in a court where you may expect to meet with a reception suitable to your merits let us remove from this i am very sensible that the king has conceived a secret aversion against me a considerable time ago notwithstanding all his precaution to conceal it from me and if you could once leave england you should soon see me leave it also  my lord said the countess with a melancholy and most serious air your passion touches me too nearly to repay it with indifferency in spite of all the rules of decency which prescribes me to have quite other sentiments for you i am not so far mistress of myself as to follow them if this confession may afford you any consolation taste the full sweets of it but after all this my lord neither wish nor ask for any more i shall avoid you all the days of my life and am convinced that since i cannot see you i shall fly from all the world yes my resolution is fixed we are both unfortunate neither is it possible we should condole our misfortunes together every thing is against us we cannot even have that miserable comfort of intermixing our tears and sighs  who has prescribed you such severe laws replied the amorous earl and what is it that renders me so odious dont flatter me with any particular respect i see the utmost extent of my disgrace for unless you did hate me how could you take such resolutions as you do the countess persisting in the same sentiments dont imagine added she that when i say i will not go along with you into france i dont intend to go thither but i will take my own time to go privately and i must tell you i will do all i can to conceal it from you i dread you more than any other person because i have a high esteem for you the motive is highly obliging but the consequence favors of cruelty replied the earl with something of anger in his countenance and having paused a while well madam since i can expect nothing from you dont refuse my brother he adores you he is a person of merit do him justice make him your husband his happiness will be my comfort and your virtue will sufficiently secure him against the suspicion he might conceive in regard to the king  oh my lord cried my lady devonshire i cannot pardon you this great error in point of nicety no the marquess of montague shall never have my hand no nor the greatest monarch of the universe that fatality which hinders me from joining yours with mine shall not enforce me to accept of your brothers but once more is it possible you should be contented i should become your sister in law alas madam replied the earl kissing her hand against her will i know not what i would have when you take away all hopes from me i lose my reason and fall into such a degree of despair as would move compassion in any other person but you the countess all in tears gave him some tender looks and both their hearts were so far overcome with grief that they could not utter one word for some time it was at last agreed betwixt them she should reassume her disguise the better to conceal herself and suffer herself to be conducted in a mans apparel by the marquess of montague to that beforementioned stupendous subterraneous palace the earl of warwick had built on purpose for her the earl did take his leave but with the utmost grief he saw very well he might flatter himself to be beloved though he purchased this happiness at a very excessive rate  the earl of pembroke could think of no better way to find out the countess of devonshires retirement than to have the earl of warwick dogged where ever he went not questioning but that he would see her before he went into france his faithful and dextrous spies had been so watchful in their employment that about midnight they came to tell him that the earl was gone into one of the most remote corners of the city and that questionless twas thereabouts the countess had fixed her habitation in the mean while the earl of warwick having taken his leave of the king embarked for calais of which place he was governor having before hand given directions to the marquess of montague what was to be done in his absence and he might well rest assured of all his love as long as the interest of the countess was concerned  accordingly the same night he conducted her with two waiting women disguised all three in mens habit to this stupendous vault which for its beauty might challenge a preference to the most magnificent palace the countess was so much surprised thereat that notwithstanding the trouble she was then under she could not forhear to admire the rarities of the marbles and wainscotting though all the precious movables were taken out before there were several closets or retiring places the doors whereof were so artificially contrived that no body but who was very well acquainted with it could open them the marquess showed the secret openings thereof to my lady devonshire and fearing least she should forbid him to come to see her if he continued to entertain her with his passion he chose rather to do so much violence to himself as to speak to her only with his eyes she had too great an esteem for him to show her self insensible to so rare and noble a deportment she defired him to be assured of her esteem and to visit her now and then to comfort her in her misfortunes  at the same time the earl of pembroke persisting in his resolution of giving the king an account of the countess had placed himself in disguise also not far from the before said subterraneous place when he saw the marquess of montague coming along with the countess of devonshire whom he knew notwithstanding the darkness of the night and her disguise having seen her in the same habit at madam digbys but had she appeared in another dress how was it possible for him to mistake her that fatal arrow which pierced his heart when he met her at chelsea with the countess of oxford i say that same arrow remained still in his heart with this difference only that now he felt himself tormented only with the most cruel jealousy that could be that he lived without hopes and that he acted like a man who cared not what he did he run straight to the king and told him where my lady devonshire was lodged and this monarch seeing himself now freed from that respect he preserved for the earl of warwick thought of nothing else than how to surprise an unhappy person destitute of all protection and oppressed by her enemies for this purpose he pitched upon a very dark night and took no body along with him except the earl of pembroke and the chevalier de herbert his brother coming to the entrance of the vault which they found not without much difficulty they soon broke the door the noise thereof put the countess and her two waitingwomen to the utmost consternation and though they were all three shut up in one of these abstruse closets the doors whereof were undiscoverable yet they might easily understand all what was said the countess knowing both the kings and the earl of pembrokes voice having narrowly searched all the corners of the place they concluded she was gone from thence to another why would i delay coming hither cried the king i had certainly met with her here where must i look for her now the earl of pembroke told him he should leave every thing to his care perhaps said he she is gone to try whether she can get beyond sea and when she finds she cannot she will certainly come hither again but replied the king when she finds the doors broken she will not think her self safe here and will come to this place no more all shall be repaired before daybreak continued pembroke your majesty may confide in my care  the king would not go away without making a second search through the whole vault and passing by a looking glass fixed within the marble he writ with his diamond ring the following words had i found her warwick should have seen her no more  and seeing his stay would be useless in that place he went away sorely vexed to see himself thus disappointed in an attempt of this nature the poor countess was under no small disturbance what resolution to take she found the king was gone but heard the earl of pembrokes voice who said to one that was with him so soon as day appears you must fetch some workmen to have the doors mended for my part i will stay here till i have placed all my spies in their proper stations the countess of devonshire seeing that if the marquess of montague should come thither she should be found out by the earls spies or that if he should meet the earl of pembroke there they would come to the utmost extremities took a resolution proceeding partly from despair partly from her natural courage this was to sally forth with her two waitingwomen with swords drawn and pistols in hand to open their way if the earl of pembroke should offer to stop them they no sooner appeared but pembroke and his brother seeing their swords glister and not knowing who they were advanced fiercely against the countess but she being careless of her life threw her self so furiously upon the earl that she put his life in danger she wounded him with her sword and was going to second the blow had she not perceived that he began to retreat without offering to fight any longer in effect he then knew her and his passion triumphing over all his other resolutions he would not fight nor stop her and when the chevalier herbert drew near to revenge his brothers quarrel he held him by the arm thus the fair countess opening her self a passage through her enemies left her subterraneous dwelling place and went to another where she was assured of the fidelity of her friends  twas next to an impossibility the earl of pembroke should be wounded and the thing not be soon known at court the king being informed of all that passed by the chevalier herbert was vexed to the soul to have missed of the place where the countess of devonshire lay concealed and he could not forbear to be dissatisfied with the earl of pembroke and his brother because they did detain him no longer on the other hand madam gray was disturbed by a thousand suspicious thoughts on the kings account which she found very hard to be convinced of though she knew that the young countess had still a considerable place in his heart yet when she considered the earl of pembrokes passion for her this served to check the motion she had conceived of the kings being concerned in this nocturnal adventure there was not a word said at court of the king no more than of the countess of devonshire the whole news run upon a rencounter betwixt some men so that the matter seemed plain enough to every body but to her who notwithstanding all these probable appearances could not get it out of her thoughts but that this adventure concerned chiefly the king and the countess the marquess of montague was in a worse condition than all the rest he came to see his dear countess but found her not what an agony was he in when he saw a long tract of blood some of the movables and the doors broken to pieces he could think no otherwise than that she had been carried away by force he accused all the world with it sometimes the king or pembroke sometimes the countesss enemies his pain was unspeakable till he understood that the earl of pembroke had been wounded after all this piece of news gave occasion to more reflections he that had wounded him must needs be the same person that came thither to persecute the countess and considering that he would be foolhardy enough to venture upon such an attempt were it only in regard of the earl of warwick the more he thought of the matter the more he was confirmed in his opinion that the king was at the head of the party but what means was there to unfold this riddle it being uncertain whether my lady devonshire was at liberty or not  the king needed to have acted with much more circumspection than actually he did in an affair of so peculiar a nature to keep it from the knowledge of madam gray who had many creatures of her own who made their court to her at the expense of king edward she would lose no time to be further satisfied in the matter but taking a chair attended by a few only went to the place where she found the doors broke open and entering with much precipitation found the marquess of montague there still busied in searching every corner of the place they were equally surprised to meet one another here for the aversion that was betwixt madam gray and the earl of warwick having engaged the marquess to adhere to his brothers interest he never came to visit her however the high extraction of jaqueline of lunenburgh her mother and her personal virtues as they challenged respect from every body so the marquess fearing he might disturb her was going to withdraw when she desired him to stay you may easily guess my lord said she there were certain strong motives that brought me hither it is possible you may if you please satisfy me at once in what i desire to know the whole question i have to ask is whether the countess of devonshire has been here yes madam returned the marquess it is most certain that she was here oh cried she i need doubt no more of what i suspected before the king is unfaithful she had scarce spoken these words but happening to cast her eyes upon the lookingglass where the king had written the following line had i found her warwick should have seen her no more she knew the character to be the kings at the same time it fell into her thoughts that the king had written these words only to amuse the curious and to make them believe his design had miscarried which served only to persuade her that the countess was in his power i have seen enough said she to set my heart at rest i came added she to court with much reluctance and i shall leave it without pain my curiosity is satisfied my lord i wish yours were so too having spoken these words she went out of this subterraneous vault leavng the marquess in the greatest confusion of thoughts that could be for there being no room to doubt but that it was the king who had forced open the doors he saw no hopes how the countess could escape his violences so that let him look upon the thing from what side he would he found nothing but what furnished him with sufficient matter of affliction even beyond what can be imagined my lady devonshire was not so little concerned for his satisfaction as to suffer him to remain under these dreadful apprehensions but whom could she trust upon so nice a point and not doubting but that she was betrayed before she dreaded the same fate a second time  as for madam gray she having taken a resolution not to dispute the matter any further with the king but to avoid seeing him ordered her chair to turn straightways toward her seat of graston with a resolution not to come near the court a place she looked upon now as too dangerous for the enjoyment of her repose the king coming to her lodging was surprised to find her to be gone abroad but his surprise was much greater when within a few hours after he was told she was met upon the road making all the haste she could from london his passion for the countess of devonshire at that time was forced to give way to that for the fair widow he sent for the earl rivers her brother you may serve me better upon this occasion than any other person said he to him very obligingly because you being in love your self are best able to judge what inquietudes i labor under on account of the departure of madam gray i know not any reason she  thus to leave me go earl go find her out bring her back and rest assured that if you do me this good office i will give my consent to what i  refused you oh sir cried the earl rivers throwing himself at his feet is it possible your majesty will give me permission to marry my dear leonore i dare scarce flatter my self so far but sir dont lessen the honor i shall have of obeying you by a reward to it i shall think my self happy enough if i can only go immediately continued the king assure her of the entire possession of my heart and that i am extremely sensible of the indifferency she shows for me  the earl rivers transported with joy at the kings promise in favor of his beloved leonore who outlived the poison she had taken mounted on horseback immediately and coming near to a spacious wood he saw in an adjacent valley a good number of horsemen riding so hard that though he followed them at full speed he could not possibly overtake them but coming to madam grays was soon informed twas the king who thought he ought not to entrust any body but himself to persuade his mistress to return and to speak the truth he was endued with all the qualifications requisite to engage a heart his wit was not inferior to his person he never spoke but what was attended with some peculiar graces and being both exceeding fair and sprightly he far surpassed all the rest at court except it were the earl of warwick who had some advantages above him he reproached madam gray but with a thousand tender expressions can you imagine said he to her i will break my word with you after i have made such a step of sending away the earl of warwick under no less pretense than to treat of a marriage betwixt the princess of savoy and me frun the hazard of disobliging king lewis xi who being daily solicited by henry and margaret of anjou to assist them with some troops in order to make war against me will doubtless soon hearken to their proposals after i have given him such an essential cause of complaint as this will prove notwithstanding all this though i foresee the consequences nothing touches me but the satisfaction of seeing you in my possession and at that very jancture i am preparing for that happy day you leave me madam and that without any cause i will not sir replied she justify my conduct either by tears or a deep melancholy your majesty has made me hope for an honor i thought so far above me that i never would give my self leave to desire it looking upon it as a thing impossible but at last when i saw the earl of warwick sent out of the way i began to be more credulous and should perhaps be in the same error still were i not certain that your majesty continues to be in love with the countess of devonshire it is her you would snatch away from the earl of warwick and not me sir whom you intend to place on the throne i judged that upon so weighty an occasion i could do nothing more becoming the respect i owe you and that virtue i always professed than to retreat to my solitude and there to lead if possible an agreeable and easy life without either pleasure or pain  the kings passion acquired new strength by the seeming reluctance of the fair widow she was a lady of a great share of wit gracefulness and conduct she knew the weak side of edward and being resolved to make her lover her spouse she carried the point so far as to make him abjure the countess of devonshire mrs elizabeth lucy and all the rest he ever had any passion for this done he brought her back triumphantly to london and publicly declared his intention of marrying her  whatever had been told to the duchess of york the kings mother upon this head had made but very little impression upon her and this made her look upon it as so odd a piece of news when she first heard it that she was resolved to be satisfied in it from the kings own mouth when the king told her his resolution was fixed and that nothing in the world should alter it the duchess could not forbear bursting out into tears and into sharp expressions as she was a very tender mother she foresaw with grief the ill consequences of so unequal a match and especially in what a heinous manner the king of france would resent the affront put upon his sister in law who was it sir said she who could persuade you to such an action as the earl of warwick is now upon by your order i had a mind to send him out of the way replied the king and unless i did bestow an honorable commission upon him he would always have found some pretense or other to plague me here the duchess lifted up her eyes to heaven like a person afflicted in the most sensible part of her soul  the king was no sooner gone but she sent word to mrs elizabeth lucy to thwart the match with all her power assuring her of her protection this young lady being descended from an illustrious house the king fell in love with her whilst he was as yet earl of march and as nothing could be more dreadful to her than the loss of a prince who was so dear to her she went to the bishop of london to entreat him not to marry edward because he had promised to marry her and the duchess of york having notice thereof declared that her son could not in point of conscience marry madam groy but the king dissatisfied with mrs lucy challenged her to make good her words and she at last either out of respect to the king or because it was really so confessed she had loved that prince without any prospect of being his queen but added she as she was throwing her self at his feet and bathing them with her tears if my passion for your glory sir did check me from wishing for any thing that might sully its luster at this time now you are become so regardless of it your self as to intend to marry madam gray will you not permit me to ask you to be preferred to her i am inferior to her in nothing she is the widow of a private gentleman upon whom her heart had been bestow d before so that your majesty will have it at second hand but as to my own i gave it you without any other consideration than because i loved you you are the only person who has been master of all my tenderness take pity sir of a young woman whom you are going to render the most unfortunate person in the world i request no more of you than not to suffer me to see my rival upon the throne if you will place the princess of savoy there i will submit to my destiny without murmuring  the king heard her without interrupting her and then fetching a deep sigh i am not of an ungrateful temper my dear betty said he i will preserve an esteem for you as long as i live and will give you most solid proofs of it but nothing in the world is able to alter the resolution i have taken of espousing madam gray well let us say no more of it then cried mrs lucy you will never see me again sir i bid you farewell for ever she had no sooner said these words but she went away and retired into a nunnery there to conceal herself under a religious habit just as she was alighting out of her chair she was not a little surprised to see my lord stanley who offered his hand to her he being just then coming back from visiting his sister the countess of devonshire who pursuant to her mother the countess of angleseys command was gone into the same nunnery my lord had no sooner seen mrs lucys livery but he went out to meet her well madam said he are you to be our queen no body in the world deserves it better than yourself oh my lord cried she i am quire inconsolable the king is become ungrateful to me i am resolved to keep myself concealed from the world for the remainder of my life and come here to find a safe retreat  before you enter into the nunnery said he i beg a moment or two to discourse with you so going into a spacious dining room where there was no other company near them the passion i have for you said he has rendered me hitherto the most unfortunate of all men living knowing the kings sentiments for you and yours for him i had nothing else to do but to suffer and say nothing but loved you nevertheless madam pray remember the danger i exposed my self to to preserve your life when one day being a hunting a terrible stag after having made several persons victims of his fury was making directly at you i should scarce have given myself the trouble to save edwards mistress had it not been my own particular concern twas in vain for me to consider you were under strict engagements with him and upon that score to call all my reason to my aid my heart would always let you triumph over it and without your knowledge i have often pleaded in your behalf against myself at this time now the scene is quite altered and that you are resolved to bury yourself in this house only out of spite and chagrin methinks i may make you sensible of the danger into which you are going to precipitate yourself for to live at ones ease in a retirement we ought to have other motives to bring us hither than what proceeds from spleen and anger as soon as these are over you will regret the loss of the world you will be tired you will dislike it and you will grow desperate i dare propose to you a much better convenience let us unite madam our destinies by an undissolvable knot i have a high esteem for you  oh my lord cried she interrupting him durst i flatter myself with such hopes you should have my hand together with my entire inclinations but i believe i had better pass away the remainder of my days in a nunnery than to run the hazard of being slighted to be short my lord gave her all the promises and confirmed them by all the oaths he could think of and mrs lucy resolved rather to take his word than turn nun so she returned to london and was married to my lord stanley against the consent of the earl of anglesey who nevertheless soon after pardoned his son and took them both into his house where mrs lucy by her modest deportment soon blotted out the remembrance of  former frailty for the king  the duchess of york who had flattered herlf hitherto that this young mistress might reve the kings passion for her and that in the ean time the earl of warwick might have an pportunity of obtaining a positive answer from e king of france was highly afflicted to see his project miscarry this made her willingly second the petition of the lord mayor of lonon wherein he attended by a great number of persons of quality humbly represented to the king the inconveniences that were likely to ttend so unequal a match to the great detrimnent of his glory but edward was offended hereat and told them that an amiable and viruous woman ought to be preferred to one of a higher rank however this engaged him to write to the earl of charolois son of the duke of burgundy to desire him to send over into england some of the nearest relations of madam gray in hopes that their appearance might imprint a respect in the english for her person according to her demerits the earl of charolois overjoyed to see his marriage with the princess of savoy come to nothing which hitherto had made him not a little uneasy by reason of the alliance to be contracted betwixt king lewis xi a mortal enemy to the house of burgundy and edward did not fail to send james of luxenburgh earl of s pol and uncle to the fair widow attended by a great number of great lords and a hundred knights most magnificently equipped to assist at the solemnity of the nuptials the fame of their names and the richness and beauty of their equipage served to stop the mouths of all that had exclaimed against the match before so that the king espoused madam gray in public under the joyful acclamations of the people who were much taken with the sumptuous preparations and appearance of the feast contrived so on purpose by the kings orders the earl of st pol being upon his dparture for his own country was presented by the king with a chain valued at three hundred nobles and each of the knights of his company with one of fifty nobles he desired him to assure the earl of charolois of his entire friendship and as a token thereof made him a knight of the garter sending the collar to him by the said earl of s pol and engaging his word to send him some of his best troops  the earl rivers was too sensibly  with the merits and beauty of leonore  to neglect this opportunity of desiring the kings consent to marry her  you have been pleased to flatter me sir said he that your majesty would not oppose my happiness and i hope that after the honor you have done us of placing my sister upon the throne i may without being presumptuous desire  favor at your hands were it for your advantage replied the king i should be overjoyed  but do you consider that by marrying leonore you will neither improve your estate nor  what occasion have i for it sir returned the earl having the honor to be allied to you it seems to me i ought to look for nothing more than how to satisfy my passion and i know no greater satisfaction in the world than to have a wife worthy of being beloved but all this without a good fortune added the king makes us often lead but an indifferent life for how often happens it that love ceases and then you will find an estate much more convenient than love i am too much in love sir said the earl to imane i shall ever repent of having espoused leore on the contrary in having her i believe i ill have every thing and without her i shall not be sensible of any enjoyments yes sir i shall be always rich if she is my wife and always poor if she be not well then said the king pursue the motions of so tender a passion i should be unjust to disturb it at the same time when i sacrifice every thing to my own  the earl rivers transported with joy threw himself at the kings feet returning him hearty thanks in such terms as he thought most proper to make this monarch sensible of his acknowledgement begging of him to obtain also the queens consent which being done by king edwards intercession she told her brother the next day she should be well pleased to see his dear leonore that her only aim was to render him happy and that had he left it to her dsposal she would have taken care to make him so but that after all she would constrain him to nothing the earl told her that if he were master of the universe he should be less pleased with it than in the possession of his mistress and that his fortune could not he ill as long as he shared it with so amiable a person  he now lost no time to go to madam digbys his equipage being very sumptuous according to the rank he bore at court leonore who had heard nothing as yet of the kings marriage with madam gray could not imagine from whence proceeded so great an alteration but her surprise was much greater when he presented to her the jewels and rich apparel sent her by the new queen he gave her an account of the whole affair and told her he was come to conjure her to abandon this melancholy solitude to justify his choice at london  the whole family and even herself at first thought he had been frenzical they could not comprehend immediately so surprising a change of fortune to see a young country gentlewoman born and bred in the country at one stroke of fortune to become sisterinlaw to the king of england and to be transplanted into one of the finest courts of europe however leonore being a young lady of a considerable share of natural wit and sense there needed no great trouble to teach her her lesson she heartily loved the earl rivers and was very sensible of what he had done for her so he conducted her to court where the nuptials were celebrated with no less magnificency than if she had been a princess  whilst these things were transacting at london where the marquess of montague did not appear at any of these public feasts the earl of warwick who had brought the negotiation of the marriage betwixt king edward and bona princess of savoy to a good issue in france had notice sent him several times by his brothers of what passed at court but would give no credit to it for the kings conduct in this affair being so irregular and he having a much better opinion of his understanding he chose rather to call in question the sincerity of his friends who sent him the news than the kings conduct till he was convinced of the truth thereof by the king of frances own mouth this prince being one of the greatest politicians in the world concealed his resentment and coldly told the earl there were certain faults by which those that committed them were more effectually punished than those against whom they were committed had the king your maer added he chosen another princess before my ister in law i should have shown my resentment upon such an account but now the whole questi is concerning a private gentlewoman who ad been his subject who has nothing to give him ut to satisfy his passion i assure you my lord mbassador i am very well satisfied oh sir yd the earl i beg of your majesty not to give e the title of an ambassador i will never erve a king in that station who breaks his word he found that if he should go on he should be apt to discover too far his resentment y he said no more for fear the king who was ne of the most refined princes in the world if e should dive into his real sentiments should mprove it to his own advantage  he was no sooner come out of the audience chamber but the queen sent word she desired to peak with him he found her in company with the princess of savoy both transported with anger tell your master said the queen e shall send us the picture of my sister he is nworthy both of the original and of the copy the princess looking steadfastly upon the ambassador you bear said she a share in the affront ut upon me as well as myself perhaps i should not have put the least confidence in what has been proposed to me had it come from any other but the earl of warwick i should have made due reflection upon the fickle temper of the king of england but my lord twas your name that made me put my confidence in the proposals made to us then remember in what manner they treat us and if you have any power make use of it to revenge our wrong madam replied the earl after this i dare promise you nothing but time will convince you whether i know how to resent an injury done to your highness and myself  his impatience to return to london was too great and the part he had acted in paris too disagreeable to stay there any longer he left that city altogether taken up with the thoughts of what had happened in england to madam gray there being a mutual aversion betwixt them he could not promise himself for the future ary considerable share in the kings favor and the honor he had done him in putting him upon the negotiation of a marriage he intended not to perform seemed so cruel an affront to him that he thought no revenge beyond his resentment he being not as yet acquainted with what had happened to my lady devonshire he hoped to find her in her subtenaneous lodgings and if there was any thing that could allay his dissatisfaction it was the pleasure he proposed to himself of seeing again the only person he loved best in the world as he came nearer to london he understood that the public rejoicings continued that anthony surnamed the bastard had passed the sea so strongly guarded that two privateers who pretended to take him were taken with a great booty and the rest forced to sheer off this being one of the most brave and gallant knights of his age charles earl of charolois highly satisfied with those marks of his friendship edward had transmitted to him by the earl of s pol and judging if of the greatest consequence to enter into a more strict correspondence with this monarch to withdraw him from the league proposed to him by king lewis xi against the duke of burgundy his father charged his natural brother with a commission to sound king edwards inclinations concerning a marriage with margaret of york his sister he could not have entrusted so weighty  affair into better hands for upon his arrival the tournaments and other such like exercises were renewed the lord descalles brotherlaw to the new queen was to engage him a day being appointed for that purpose  the earl of warwick being informed of all this upon the road went not directly to london but took the way to sionhill with so much secrecy that even the marquess of montague knew nothing of it the earl of warwick ordered berincour to get him a black armor and to cause to be painted on his shield an arm extended striking a thunderbolt at a crown with this inscription thus the gods revenge themselves his plume scarf and the trappings of his horse were of a light red to signify his anger and to make the world believe he was still upon the road he had it given out he was fallen ill by the way  he left sionhill attended only by berincour both with the vizors of their helmets down and as they were riding with an easy pace toward london saw a knight cross the road whose armor being very like the earls they had the curiosity of taking particular notice of him and casting their eyes upon his borialer found these words there never did eyes behold so fair a lady this inscription seemed too nearly to reflect upon the countess of devonshires charms for the earl of warwick to let him pass by without opposition knight said he to the unknown whoever you are you give your opinion with too much presumption for the lady you think so handsome and i can assure you i know one that is beyond her it seems to me as if you judged with more rashness than i replied the knight but i am so well satisfied in my assertion that i am sure you will be of the same opinion so soon as you have seen her picture if you can deny it after that look here said he pointing to his sword this shall make you own it to be so thy threats dont frighten me replied the earl with a smile let us see this picture and at the same time prepare for fighting the unknown without returning an answer drew out a long chain of gold on which was fastened a magnificent case richly set with diamonds and in it the picture of the countess of devonshire the earl of warwicks surprise at the sight thereof was beyond what can be imagined he fetched a deep lamentable sigh and for some time remained like a man bereaved of his senses but on a sudden recovering himself no said he i dont dispute the beauty of this lady to be surpassing all others but i will maintain that you are unworthy of so precious a pledge of her friendship having spoken these words he was going to take a lance berincour held in his hand whilst the unknown affronted at these words was preparing to attack him but berincour who observed every thing in cool blood happening to know the case wherein was the countesses picture because he had been employed in having it made did not question but that this knight was the marquess of montague  oh my lord said he to his master keeping the lance back it is my lord your brother look upon him with attention and you will know him as well as i do the earl of warwick finding it was him beckned him with his hand that before they began the combat he would speak to him and why brother said he should we turn our weapons against one another which ought to be employed against our common enemies and so he lifted up his vizor the marquess almost distracted at what had happened threw himself from his horse and the earl alighting likewise went to meet him with open arms and are you here my lord cried the marquess and would not let me know it what have i done to you dont charge me with indifferency replied the earl you know how dearly i love you but understanding that there are to be certain courses and tournaments wherein the queens knights are to make their appearance i had a desire to be there incognito to maintain the beauty of the countess of devonshire surpasses hers in hopes to draw the king into the quarrel to give him a proof of the strength of my arm i thought it not fit to bring you in for a share because i would not interrupt your application to serve the countess the marquess lifting up his eyes to heaven oh my lord said he you know but one part of what occasion of complaint edward has given us  they seated themselves under some trees where seeing themselves at full liberty to entertain one another the marquess related to his brother the carrying away by force of the countess with all the circumstances relating to this unhappy accident you see continued he this black armor it relates to the countess i went with the same design as you do to break a lance with the king and the worthless pembroke if his wounds he received there are cured truly i expected your coming with much impatience in order to act in concert against our common enemies for our mutual satisfaction whilst the marquess was talking the earl had a thousand direful projects in his head which gave him no liberty o speak at last recovering himself he began o call heaven and earth to witness that he would revenge himself in such a manner as never any subject was known to have done before can he be thus ungrateful cried he unto whom he is bebolden for the crown of england i did not only put it upon his head but also have kept it steady there in return whereof he puts two such bloody affronts upon me such as he ought not to have put upon an enemy let us go brother to the tournament if he appears in the list let us join our strength to attack him and provided we die not unrevenged never let us regret our destiny  no my lord said the marquess let us not run the hazard of so much odds against us we may maintain against the queens knights so that she cannot challenge the prize of being the greatest beauty and if the king appears among them we will spare him no more than the rest it is requisite great designs should not be undertaken without long and most serious considerations  the earl being well satisfied with his brothers advice they both mounted on horseback and appeared at the list just as the queen attended by a numerous court was placing herself in a balcony covered with rich tapestry and gold brocaded stuffs whilst the earl of warwick and the marquess of montague casting their eyes upon her found such an emotion within themselves as they were scarce able to keep within due bounds  the earl rivers my lord hastings duke of exeter my lord high chamberlain my lord descalles the queens brother in law john earl of oxford john de moubray duke of norfolk and humphrey duke of buckingham had taken their stations along the barriers expecting the coming of the bastard of burgundy with his young nobility but whilst they stayed for their company the earl of warwick and his brother sent a herald to bid defiance to my lord descalles and the earl rivers offering they were ready to maintain that the queens beauty and all the ladies at court was not comparable to that of the lady they served so disobliging a defiance surprised the herald no less than all the knights i mentioned before and the news thereof being soon brought to the king and queen they blushed for spite saying they must be very impolite persons who would affront so many ladies however the right of freedom being inviolable especially at such like public feasts it was not judged proper to make use of any violent means against these knights besides that there appeared a certain grandeur in all their actions as caused a respect in all those that beheld them the queen ordered the earl rivers to be called brother said shewith a great deal of modesty were i alone concerned in this defiance i would not advise you to espouse so bad a cause but your own wife and so many other fair and charming persons having their share in the challenge you ought to undertake it with resolution and courage as for the conditions i leave them to your own discretion madam said the king interrupting her no body is better able to do it than myself i will espouse the quarrel of that beauty i adore the earl rivers shall be my second no sir cried the queen endeavoring to keep him back i beg of you by all that is good to remain only a spectator and let it fall out as it will i shall be well satisfied with the honor your majesty intended to do me the king had not patience enough to mind what she said but taking his armourentred the list so soon as he appeared the barriers were opened under the sound of trumpets and other warlike instruments which resounded from all parts and the king having not as yet mounted his horse the earl of warwick and the marquess of montague alighted from their horses likewise and drawing nearer knights said the king you come to my court to maintain the beauty of an unknown lady against that of the queen and her ladies it is possible that either out of complaisance or to do the lady justice the point might be granted you if one could see her but who is able to decide it you yourself sir said the earl of warwick casting such oks at him as were more piercing than lightning itself i am apt to believe you have not forgot her and then showed him the countess of devonshires picture the king was so surprised and chad at the sight thereof that he remained doub for some time whether he should continue to defend the queens beauty or join with the knights on the countesses side sometimes he looked upon the picture sometimes upon  two unknown and considering the whole he could not but guess the earl of warwick to have a hand in the game so bold an action as this could not be well attributed to any other person but himself i doubt said he whether the lady whose picture you show would own you for her knights if she know what use you made of it she bears too much respect to the queen and is too polite a person to insult her and all other ladies beauty i have said nothing in her name sir replied the earl fierly but i come to ask whether you will declare against her i should be very unwilling to do so were it upon any other occasion but this said the king but as the case stands i am resolved i will prepare for your defense we will break each of us three lances and he that gets the honor of the combat shall carry off the picture of the vanquished lady this is not sufficient for us sir replied the earl of warwick we must carry off more than one picture to the lady whose knights we are and therefore humbly desire your majesty that all those that appear in arms there at the barriers may enagage against us if they are vanquished they are to give us the pictures of their ladies if we are we will give them that of ours the king beckned them to draw near being unwilling to answer for them before he had spoke to them but they were all ready to accept the offer every one had a picture about him some of their wives some of their mistresses the king was the first who put the queens picture upon a triumphal arch erected in one of the corners of the barrier the earl rivers also set up that of his leonore digby and all the rest produced their pictures in golden cases  the first trial of skill was made betwixt the king and the earl of warwick and betwixt the marquess of montague and the earl rivers under a thousand joyful acclamations of the spectators who were surprised at the goodly mien and the skill those four combatants showed on horseback but it was not long before the scene was altered for in spite of all the kings dexterity the earl of warwick animated with revenge soon got the better of him  the queen and all her ladies could not see this ill success but with the utmost dissatisfaction and had it been in their power to play an ill game they would perhaps not have been spaing in it at this juncture to be short the earl and his brother gained all the honor of the combat but would not take the queens picture which by most was supposed to be done out of respect without considering it might be out of an aversion to her person as for her own part she knew very well the reason of it she had discovered her particular enemy in the person of the kninht with the black armor and the device painted on his shield served her for an interpreter of his actions the king and the earl rivers went out of the list much vexed at their ill success though the rest who engaged with the earl of warwick and the marquess of montague met with no better fortune  they lost every one his picture but the victorious knights would not take all the advantage they might have done they returned to the knights their pictures without so much as opening the cases to look upon them except those belonging to the duke of exeter and the earl of oxford their brothersinlaw whose pictures they carried away in the mean time the bastard of burgundy being advanced to the barriers had been a spectator of the dexterity of the two brave unknown to his great admiration this made him ask permission of the princess of york to maintain her beauty against them but she refused to consent to it finding by what she had seen already that her picture would meet with the same fate as all the rest had done she told him with a great deal of modesty she was not ambitious and desired him to remember that he being her knight was to engage with my lord descalles these few words being received by the burgundian with the utmost respect he broke several lances in honor of the princess and his knights showed their utmost dexterity against the english but nothing was perrmd on either side that could come in competion with the achievements of the earl of warwick  he had taken the first opportunity to get away with his brother with so much diligence that the king had no time to send some body to follow them and the queen was in so ill an humor that under pretense of finding her self not very well she left the company to give vent to her spite and rage it being not long before the king came to see her oh sir said she you need not doubt but that that presumptuous person who engaged with you was the earl of warwick i know him better by his design of affronting me than by his air and device madam replied the king he is disgusted at his late journey into france and it is possible if he had those who would second him he would endeavor to cause me some trouble but henry s party is reduced to so low an ebb that it is almost doubtful now whether there ever were such a thing as the house of lancaster in the world  the earl of warwick and his brother went back to sion hill from whence they first dispatched berincour to old albine to find out and talk with her in private for as she still lived with the countess of anglesey so he hoped by her means to hear some news of the countess of devonshire so soon as he was gone the earl and the marquess opened the two picturecases they had carried off as victors great was their surprise when they found the countess of devonshires picture in that of the earl of oxfords i must needs own to you said the earl showing the picture to the marquess of montague that i did not approve of my sisters jealousy against her husband but now find she was not in the wrong how is it possible my lady devonshire should have so much regard to the earl of oxford as to bestow such a pledge upon him how unfortunate am i answered the marquess of montague i will do her more justice than you questionless the earl of oxford has got this picture without her knowledge in the same manner as i obtained mine which was likely to have occasioned a duel betwixt us oh brother what comfort you give me i must now confess to you that never any thing went more near me than the sight of her picture in your hands i would not be inquisitive for fear of discomposing you by my curiosity but i cannot forbear to tell you i have been very jealous upon that account alas my lord what need you fear replied the marquess with a melancholy air dont you know you are beloved he said no more but remained very pensive do you look upon my present condition said the earl as to be envied by any dont you know what treatment i meet with all my hopes are vanished by my having fought and killed her husband had he killed me i had been much happier than i am now for there is no torment comparable to mine the marquess lifted up his eyes toward heaven as if he would say he had more cause of complaint than he after a few moments silence the earl asked the marquesss advice how he had best to carry on matters at court i advise you said he to him to make your appearance there to remove all manner of suspicion which will enable you the better to take your own measures i shall regulate my conduct replied my lord warwick in a great measure according to what news i shall receive of your dear countess and therefore will stay two days longer at sionhill before i go to london which the marquess approved of  he expected with the utmost impatience the return of berincour when he happened to come back and delivered to him a letter from my lady devonshire he received it with an unexpressible satisfaction and opening it read the following words  i value your esteem at too high a rate to hazard the loss of it by a silence which might make you imagine that the king has carried me away and that i am in his hands you will understand what it was that saved me by the same person who is entrusted to give you an account of my present condition she is to desire you from me not to think of seeing me any more it being absolutely requisite it should be so for my glory and repose   the earl of warwick gave the billet to the marquess to peruse it who told him i must confess to you my lord i was in a most terrible fear since almost nothing less than a miracle could secure the countess from the danger she was in relate to us the particulars continued the marquess addressing himself to berincour my lord said the gentleman i saw albine she made at first a thousand difficulties to speak with any freedom concerning the countess of devonshire but knowing her mercenary temper i  her that i had a very fine ring made for her on purpose in france which i intended to present her with this revived her former confidence could i suppose said she to him you would marry me and that this ring was to be the pledge of your faith i would accept it with pleasure but i am sure you have been so taken up with your masters business that you have thought but little of me and when i see my self thus used i have no more to say to you i promised every thing she would have me to do continued berincour and understood that my lady devonshire was in one of the most abstruse closets in the vault when the king and the earl of pembroke came thither they put her into a most terrible fright whilst they were searching for her till the king being gone and the earl of pembroke staying behind she moved by despair unexpectedly sallied out in her mans habit and with sword and pistol in hand having opened her self a passage went to an old friend of their family there reflecting upon the danger she had so lately escaped she took a resolution of seeing her brother and by his means  endeavor to find a safe refuge in her own family  my lord stanley dearly loved his sister and had been much concerned at her misfortune and if the earl and countess of anglesey should continue in their anger against their daughter they must needs expect to see her exposed to most hazardous accidents my lord stanley knew how to represent this point to them in such tender and pressing terms that at last they agreed to receive and protect her against all her enemies provided she would for the future follow their advice never see the earl of warwick again and retire into a religious house as long as they should think convenient my lord stanley was so desirous to see his sister at rest that he accepted of all the conditions imposed upon her by the countess of anglesey and the countess of devonshire willing to comply with them threw her self at her mothers feet and regained that tenderness which she had lost by her misfortunes she is continued albine in an abbey where i cannot let you see her but i will speak to her to morrow concerning the earl of warwick accordingly she brought me the billet to my lord i just now delivered to you and told me that my lady devonshire conjures you not to take the least step in order to come near her there being nothing in the world more opposite to her intention well then cried the earl interrupting berincour the countess had at last the good fortune to escape the kings and his worthless favorites hands i bebegin to breath a little for i must own to you brother i was very ingenious in tormenting my self a secret jealousy i was not able to master did gnaw my heart and cast me into an abyss of melancholy thoughts my sufferings are beyond yours my lord replied the marquess for i was so dextrous in fancying something so cruel in this adventure as rendered me quite inconsolaable the earl returned no answer to his brother but after a few minutes silence it was agreed betwixt them that they would go to court the next day  the earl of warwick was not a little put to it to conceal his resentment from the king by him he was received with much coldness for the queen vexed to the heart at what had happened at the tournament and not questioning but that these two unknown were the earl of warwick and the marquess of montague had been continually exasperating the king against them  twas done sir said she to him in defyance to you and to expose your choice when they set up the beauty of the countess of devonshire against me the king most tenderly loved the queen and was not well pleased with the earl of warwicks having got so much the better of him at the tournament so that instead of endeavoring a favorable reception to make him forget the affront he had put upon him in preferring isabella woodville to the princess of savoy that the furnished fresh matter of complaint to the earl who now took a resolution to revenge himself by the utter destruction of the same monrach he had placed on the throne the better to encompass this design he entered into a strict friendship with the duke of clarence one of the kings brothers who married one of his daughters who was very young but the richest heiress in england the marriage was consummated at calais whilst the archbishop of york and the marquess of montague did their utmost efforts to strengthen their party in england  the earl of warwick after his return from calais raised a good army directing his march straight to london with a design to depose edward and place henry on the throne again edward was not a little surprised at this unexpected news for though he was one of the bvest princes in the world he was apt to indulge himself too much in the enjoyment of his pleasures trusting to his good fortune which hitherto had made him triumph over all his enemies but now finding the danger at hand he ordered the earl of pembroke to draw together with all possible speed what troops he could and to march against the rebels the earl was very well pleased with this commission for he could not forgive the earl of warwick to have a better share in the countess of devonshires heart than himself he made richard herbert his brother general under him and when the earl of warwick understood he was to fight against them this served only to augment his hatred and emulation a thousand brave actions passed betwixt them recorded in history till at last a battle was fought near bambridge wherein the earl of warwicks forces were upon the point of turning their backs when john clapam an old brave soldier and faithful servant to that family putting himself at the head of  00 or  00 northampton men carrying a white bear being the earls arms in their banners returning to the charge with a loud huzza crying long live warwick put the kings army into such a consternation that they betook themselves to flight the earl of pembroke and his brother unwilling to survive this disgrace fought it out to the last man and were both taken prisoners by the victorious enemy the same misfortune attended the earl rivers the countess rivers who had an infinite deal both of tenderness and and acknowledgment for him could not be at ease all the time of his absence dreading the various chances of war but when she heard he was taken prisoner she was upon the point of running distracted king edward had used his prisoners so rigorously and the execution of henry duke of somerset was as yet in so fresh a remembrance that she did not question but that her husband would be sacrificed to what they call reason of state and to the personal aversion betwixt the queen and the earl she could think of no better expedient to shelter her self against this impending storm than to have recourse to the authority of the countess of devonshire she went to her in the nunnery where she then was alas madam said she to her you see here before you the unfortunate leonore who is come to implore your compassion in behalf of the earl rivers he is in the hands of the earl of warwick and it is feared he will accept of no ransom for his prisoners judge what a condition i am in i conjure you to use your intercession for the preservation of a person who is guilty of no other crime than of having served his king and being the queens brother secure his life against that dreadful stroke that threatens it and in asking you his i ask you my own life madam will not you make use of your interest have you forgot that had it not been for me jamy had been sacrificed to the jealousy of that ill favored digby i am sensible madam replied the countess how much i am indebted to you and embracing her tenderly you need not said she urge such motives of gratitude to engage me to do all that is in my power let us not lose one moment madam for in such like cases every minute is precious she then writ a letter to the earl of warwick the most engaging she ever sent to him and giving it to the countess of rivers advised her not to lose one moment  the countess sent the swiftest courier she could find out but by the highest of misfortune he arrived at that very moment when the earls head was just lopped off my lady devonshires request having the force of an irresistible command with the earl of warwick he run straight to the tent where this illustrious prisoner was kept under a guard you are obliged for every thing my lord to the countess of devonshire said the earl as he was just upon entering the tent she orders me to give you your liberty enjoy the good fortune she has bestowed upon you the earl not appearing and those that heard him speak fearing they had been too hasty in his execution no body durst say one word but they judged by their silence that it was too late he was grieved to the heart this being the only favor the countess of devonshire ever asked him and which was in his power to grant lifting up his eyes toward heaven how unfortunate am i cried he all the unhappy accidents center in me o barbarous laws of an irreconcilable war which makes us forget the very notions of humanity what excess dont you constrain me to commit his heart being full of affliction he writ a letter to the countess of devonshire in his justification in not having been able to obey her commands  in the mean while the countess rivers impatient to see her dear spouse followed the express as fast as she could when she met him upon the road coming back like a man struck dumb with consternation neither had she any great occasion to ask him concerning the fatal catastrophe of her husband a certain heartach with a thousand other melancholy thoughts foretold her what she feared to hear she made such doleful cries and lamentations as would have touched the very rocks that were near her she talked of nothing but of precipitating her self from the top to the bottom and those that attended her had much ado to divert her from that resolution why should you said she hinder me from following him who loved me to so high a degree and whom i loved so dearly he would not live without me and should i be so ungrateful as to live without him and if i would alas is it in my power so to do her attendants took care to carry her to an abbey at no great distance from the place where they then were which she would never leave afterward looking upon this as the most proper place that might afford her the doleful consolation of bewailing what she had so tenderly loved for the remainder of her life  the earl of pembroke and his brother richard herbert both the earl of warwicks prisoners being also condemned by him to lose their heads the earl of pembroke desired to speak with him tis not said he to him to ask you my life i wanted to see you i should be vexed to owe you so great an obligation and thereby to diminish in the least the hatred i bear you but my lord what is it my brother had done has he been the cause of our being rivals his youth his courage his birth every thing intercedes with you in his behalf am not i a victim sufficient to allay your revenge i shall have nothing to reproach to you as you will not have any thing to reproach to me and thus far we shall be even with one another the condition you are reduced to my lord replied the earl of warwick would soon engage me to forget your treacherous dealings with me were my own particular interest concerned only but i cannot pardon you without acting contrary to the laws of this war had i fallen into your hands you would certainly have treated me as i am going now to treat you yes my lord replied the earl of pembroke fiercely i should have taken all possible care to rid my hands of you but pray examine without partiality your case and mine you were always my rival you were always beloved whereas i always met with an ill treatment alas what sufferings have i not undergone upon that account you are the only cause of them whereas you can have no other reason on your side than the eagerness you have of sacrificing an unfortunate person who cherished the same thing that you did but in taking away my life you do me a kindness against your own will it is so long ago since it is become odious to me that i desire nothing else than death and i desire you to order them to dispatch with all speed but the case is quite different with my brother alas what has he committed against you he served his king his benefactor without knowing any thing of our personal quarrel and my sentiments for the countess would not you have fought under the same banners had not you a particular cause of complaint against edward and did not you place him on the same throne from whence you now intend to pull him again my lord said the earl of warwick interrupting him upon this occasion my private animosity has not the least share in what i am going about to do but it is reason of state that forbids me to grant your request i must be forced to leave you for i find it impossible to resist any longer your entreaties so away he went fearing lest compassion should so far prevail upon him as to prevent him from sacrificing to the countess of devonshire a person who endeavored her ruin  thus the brave earl of pembroke and his brother finished their days king edward was more afflicted thereat than at the loss of the battle alas said he my friendship always proves fatal to my faithful subjects who can supply the place these two brave men held in my affection  king edward highly sensible of his late disgrace gathered the scattered remnants of his troops unto which he joined some new levies but notwithstanding this finding himself too weak to cope with his enemy he proposed an accommodation and living in hopes of a good issue little care was taken in his camp to keep the soldiers to their duty the earl advertised thereof took the advantage of a dark night killed all he found in arms and seeing himself soon master of the camp advanced directly to the kings tent and found him fast asleep i give you leave to guess at this monarchs surprise when by the light of the flambeaux he saw the earl of warwick completely armed with his sword drawn who threw open his curtains with a bold countenance and with eyes sparkling with fire and anger the king soon perceiving it was too late to make any resistance you are victorious said he to him with a firm and steady look i am your prisoner but hope my lord you will make no ill use of your good fortune i know what respect i owe you sir replied the earl modestly would to god your majesty had also known what you owed to such a servant as i was earl my misfortunes are too grievous said the king dont upbraid me you have no real cause of complaint against me unless it be on account of my marriage and i think no man in the universe ought to be a better judge of the power of a love passion than your self but to convince you what a good opinion i still have of you i conjure you that if the queen happens to fall into your hands you will treat her according to her rank and virtue sir replied the earl the high station unto which your majesty has exalted her and her sex are such strict engagements to me as she shall never want my respect edward fetched a deep sigh said not a word more and with a profound melancholy in his face followed his conqueror who confined him in the castle of warwick but upon further consideration not thinking him sufficiently secured there he desired the archbishop of york to receive and keep him in the castle of medelan and so he made all the haste he could to london  his whole heart and mind being always with the countess of devonshire and knowing the nunnery she had chosen for her retirement he went thither to ask for her there had been so great a change of affairs since she saw him last that she judged she ought not to refuse him an interview i appear here before you madam said he notwithstanding your orders to the contrary but it was absolutely necessary i should consult you upon the destiny of two great kings as also upon yours and mine you will easily believe madam i was never ambitious of the english crown because when it was in my power to put it upon my own head i gave it to edward but it being now once more at my disposal i could not resist the satisfaction of making an offer of it to you i am come therefore to lay the crown of england at your feet if you will allow me to aid you in ascending the throne and will afford me a place there i shall think my self a thousand times more indebted to you than you can be to me henry is still in the tower edward in the castle of medelan and i am a much closer prisoner than these two princes consider with attention of what i propose to you time is precious you may render me happy without fearing the least opposition  my lord said the countess i need not consider long of the answer i am to give you concerning the offer you make me it is not the luster of a crown that could entice me i never thought you would have been in a condition to give it but to do all the justice i can to your merit my lord i will not enlarge any farther upon that subject for fear of discovering to you the utmost extent of my misfortunes when i am forced by my duty and out of decency to refuse a spouse who would be the only happiness of my life oh madam cried the earl fetching a deep sigh dont sweeten by such obliging expressions the bitterness of your cruel refusal you would find out reasons enough to persuade you to give me your hand were not mine odious to you and so you will rather refuse the kingdom i offer than reign along with me after all this madam i have nothing else to do but to think of dying i will be as forward in courting all opportunities to lose my life as i would have been careful to avoid them had your sentiments proved more favorable to me go on my lord make sure work to overwhelm me with reproaches replied the countess call my words in question doubt since you force me to tell it doubt of the possession of my heart doubt whether i love you beyond any thing living alas answered the earl interrupting her how shall i be convinced of it you have so much goodness as not to dispatch me at once you reserve me for a languishing martyrdom but i am not able to resist long the torments of your refusal i shall certainly pay for them with my life their whole conversation run upon prayers and reproaches assurances of friendship and justifications at last they parted equally overchargd with grief the countess being seized with the most violent inquietude that could be for her dear earl the part he was to act was of such vast consequence as was likely to expose him to so many dangers that the fair lady could not but be greatly alarmed thereat  the earl of warwick now despairing of success in persuading madam devonshire to accept of the crown at his hands and being not inclined to wear it himself except for her sake he directed his journey to london with an intention to have henry out of the tower where he was kept prisoner by edward and to set up this king against the other but was met upon the road by the duke of clarence his soninlaw and the marquess of montague who told him that edward having desired the archbishop of york to let him go sometimes out of the castle to divert himself with hunting and that prelate who foresaw not the design judging he ought not to refuse so small a favor to the king he took the opportunity of making his escape with the assistance of william stanley and thomas borrough his faithful servants  this piece of news changed the whole face of affairs so that instead of going to london they were forced to take another road because edward was got thither before them being received by the great acclamations of the people so they went to lincoln and the king having raised another army engaged the earls forces under the command of sir robert wells near stafford but the earls army was routed and the commander in chief taken prisoner who had his head cut off by the kings orders so sudden and so unexpected a change of fortune would have dismayed any person of a less firm and noble resolution than himself he was sensible there was no staying for him in england his only affliction was to be forced to leave the countess of devonshire behind him being extremely apprehensive of some ill consequences in reference to the love or hatred of king edward  the civil wars having raised so many different parties in the kingdom that the countess saw herself obliged to change sometimes her retirement she found an opportunity of discoursing berincour he told her the disgrace that had befaln the earls army that he was going to calais with the duke and duchess of clarence and that he conjured her to come thither where they needed not fear any thing from their common enemies and that if he could see her there he should enjoy that tranquillity of mind he stood so much in need of to avoid a thousand other mishaps  the countess showed a great deal of regret at the misfortune of her lover and much regard to his tenderness for her person but could not resolve to go beyond sea no mention would be made said she of what i had to fear from edward in england but they would be sure not to forget to report that i was gone to france to see the earl of warwick however i dont intend to outbrave all dangers i will keep myself concealed she writ a consolatory letter to the earl but quite over whelmed with grief was forced to leave berincour and to shut herself up in her closet to afford a free course to her tears for certainly never any lady loved a man so dearly as she did this illustrious earl from the very first minute she saw him and she could not reproach him with one minutes neglect in those days the heroes remained faithful to their mistresses without being happy but in our times things are quite otherwise  the earl of warwick expected with much impatience the return of berincour the countesses letter was so positive that finding no hopes to flatter himself that she would come to calais he found his safety to depend on his dispatch of going thither without her so he eft the coast of england condoling the countess of devonshires condition and sometimes reproaching her want of resolution soon after he came in sight of the harbor of calais where instead of being admitted into the place he had occasion to make trial of those ill chances of fortune which are the ordinary attendants of unfortunate persons he had made one vauclere a gentleman of gascony governor of the place in his absence this man understanding the disgrace of his benefactor was so far from opening the gates to him that he played his cannon upon the ships of the earl of warwick which he had infallibly sunk had they not immediately made off to sea  you may guess at the inquietude and indignation such an action as this raised in the brave warwick but to increase his misfortune the duchess of clarence his daughter frightened at the danger she saw herself exposed to was brought to bed of a son at a time when they wanted even necessaries for his subsistence the earl of warwick seeing them in so deplorable a state thought sit to make his resentment give way to the love he bore to his daughter he sent to vauclere to desire him to permit the new born duke of clarence to be baptized in the town and to send some refreshment for the duchess who was ready to die for want of them vauclere complied with both and the duke and earl seeing there was no hopes of being admitted into that place set sail for diep where they met with a good reception  having spent some time to refresh themselves and the duchess of clarence finding herself strong enough to undertake in company with her father her husband and sister a journey to amboise where king lewis xi then kept his court they met with so favorable a reception from that monarch that they had all the reason in the world to hope for his protection for the king did not in the least doubt but that the earl being sensible of the affront put upon him in the negotiation of the match of the princess of savoy as well as upon that illustrious lady had upon that score revolted from england and the earl soon had intelligence that charles duke of burgundy had been so bold as to threaten king lewis with a bloody war if he supported them but that prince thinking his honor concerned in this quarrel resolved to espouse it publicly  margaret of anjou spouse to that unfortunate king who was kept prisoner by king edward led a melancholy life in france this being the only place from whence she hoped to retain some succors to recover the throne she was not unacquainted with the earl of warwicks design to serve her spouse so that to show her acknowledgement she came in person to visit and return him thanks the duchess of clarence being still much out of order by reason of the fatigues of her late journey the queen would also pay her a visit accompanied by her son this young princes stature was already much beyond his age and his beauty and noble air were infallible signs of his high birth the queen and the duchess of clarence shed abundance of tears so that the remembrance of their misfortunes for a considerable time would not permit them to think or to talk of any thing else but so soon as the queen was a little at leisure and cast her eyes upon ann nevil daughter to the earl of warwick and younger sister to the duchess she stood amazed at her most ravishing beauty and the prince of wales  son felt the effects thereof as soon as he w her and though he was otherwise master of  refined and pleasing wit yet he could do noing at this time but confine himself to a bare dmiration without being able to entertain her  he could have wished to do  the queen joined all her interest with the earl for henry against edward desiring he would make use of all his credit with lewis xi to get some troops from him for notwithstanding she was related to him and had urged him for a long time upon that point he had always found means to evade the matter under some pretense or other but so soon as the earl claimed his share in the obligation the king granted them every thing they desired  the hopes of their speedy return into england at the head of a good army afforded a secret satisfaction as well to the queen as to the earl the better to cement their union they visited one another every day and made private feasts in which the prince of wales made all his application to my lady anne whom he often regaled with flowers and garlands with an air sufficently discovering his fear and confusion and as she received them not without some emotion so they talked but little when they were together but were both uneasy when asunder the prince of wales have flattered himself that my lady anne would go along with the queen his mother who intended to go into england but understanding the earl of warwick did not think it convenient they should leave the french court he was ready to die with grief the first motions of a passion are stronger and more respectful than all the rest he would tremble when he sat down by her and how desirous soever he was to speak to her he durst not venture at it his inquietudes and the continual scruples that afflicted his mind produced such a change in him that he was scarce to be known the queen of england was frightened thereat and the whole court took notice of it  the duchess of clarence frequently keeping her chamber my lady anne was commonly with her so that when the queen came to see and talk with her the prince of wales at last took the boldness to entertain his lady madam said he one day to her notwithstanding my being reduced to a languishing condition i am sprightly enough not to neglect any thing that relates to you i have been very careful to send to madam the duchess of orleans for your case that is to say replied my lady that her lottery is drawn i must own i should be exceeding glad to have a prize because i should look upon it as a good omen to our affairs there are in this lottery so many different prizes said the prince that perhaps that which falls to our lot may not be pleasing to you nay it is true said she with a low voice that if there be any extraordinary jewel to be had madam will endeavor it shall fall to the count of beanjeuts share and have you taken notice continued the prince that she  some particular sentiments for him truly said she one need not be a witch to guess at her sentiments in that regard besides that i hear my father talking so often with my sister upon that point that i dare not challenge the honor of this discovery but signieur added she satisfy my curiosity and let me open the case so fair a hand as yours said he cannot miss of crawing a good prizeticket and so he presented to her a neat case or box on the top whereof was engraven the god of silence guess said my lady anne to him smiling what means this hieroglyphe it means that if we get nothing we ll say nothing for in this world there is nothing like hiding ones own disgrace but i madam cried he should explain it after a quite different manner this god of silence signifies that people who are contented should not divulge nor boast of their good fortune then you will never talk of yours said she no continued he madam i will never speak of it no if i do it shall be to nobody but to you in the mean while my lady opening the box and pulling out a small ticket or billet ah prince cried she with a joyful air i have got something and then read these following words the prince of wales s heart for my lady anne  she was considering of what had happened when the prince laying hold of this opportunity chance has determined my lot madam said he and give me leave to improve this happy juncture to make to you a confession full of respect and sincerity which will perhaps meet with disdain at your hands though at the same time it makes you sensible of the force of your chars and of my passion why signieur should you imagine i should hear you with so much indifferency alas madam i am very willing to do myself justice continued he i am an unfortunate prince without a crown and without a kingdom you deserve one and i am not in a condition to offer it to you but i have a tender and faithful heart that adores you he said no more not daring to look my lady in the face but as she had never seen any thing in her life she thought more amiable than that young prince she told him with much modesty and a graceful air can you imagine signieur i should not remember that you are the son of a great king and that such another revolution as has took you from the throne may place you there again with more luster than ever it is true madam added the prince what you say is not altogether impossible but madam supposing i should always continue unfortunate would you not permit me to adore you my lady blushed and told him with a smile she used not to answer such unnecessary questions  about the same time the queen of france being brought to bed of a dauphin afterward called charles viii the whole court was infinitely rejoiced thereat and the king would needs have the prince of wales to stand godfather  the ceremony was performed with much magnificence and the young prince going to return his thanks to the king for the honor he had done him found him alone in his closet and in an exceeding good humor upon the birth of his son he had the goodness to tell the prince i intend to make you happy who thereupon throwing himself at his feet and embracing his knees sir said he it is in your power to render me happy as long as i live it is neither your treasure i covet nor your troops my ambition reaches much higher what is it you desire then nephew replied the king somewhat surprised at the young princes words sir continued he since your majesty gives me leave to tell it all my desire is centred in my lady anne let her be my spouse let fortune prove never so averse to me otherwise i shall live always contented with her  the king told him he would think of it and upon farther consideration judging it for their common interest to unite the houses of lancaster and warwick and by this means to make the young prince brotherin law to the duke of clarence he proposed the match to the queen of england who approving of it the nuptials were celebrated with much magnificence and to the most sensible joy and satisfaction of the newarried gouple  those of the earls party in england had not eased to labor under hand without intermission he reestablishment of their affairs and though the earls two brothers espoused in outward appearnce the kings cause it was only to be informed he better of all his transactions whilst the king thinking his enemy to be past all recovery thought of nothing but feasting hunting and plays wherein the fair sex had their full share the duke of burgundy his brotherinlaw not so much addicted to gallantry but far surpassing him in point of prudence did not cease to give him notice from time to time that before long he would have work enought to combat a hydra whose heads he would find a hard task to cut off if he gave it time to grow to its full strength but these advices remained unregarded  the earl of warwick was continually solicited to come over into england where as they told him every thing was ready they only wanting his presence he failed not to give an account thereof to the king of france and the queen of england and the troops which king lewis intended as auxiliaries to queen margaret not being as yet ready to embark it was agreed the earl should go into england first to encourage his party by his presence  there was one obstacle in the way viz a strong squadron of ships of the duke of burgundys which were cruizing on the english coast to prevent the transportation of any troops out of france thither the enterprise was hazardous and the earl of warwick had all the reason to dread the falling into the hands of the duke of burgundy his mortal enemy he was sensible of the danger but not so far as to think it sufficient not to venture at it the sole consideration of coming once more near to his countess being sufficient to make him hasten his departure providence seemed to take peculiar care of him at that juncture the fleet of the duke of burgundy being dispersed by a tempest just when the earl was got aboard his ship he arrived safely with all that attended him without any opposition at dartmouth he failed not to give notice of his arrival to all his friends and published a proclamation requiring every man able to bear arms from sixteen to sixty years should come to join him to aid him in the reestablishment of henry who had been unjustly dethroned by the duke of york so that he soon gat himself at the head of an army of sixty thousand men upon this unexpected news edward was awakened out of his lethargy wherein love and pleasure had involved him his courage was such as to be able to undergo a much severer shock of fortune than this he drew together his troops but those being but few in number he thought it most expedient to encamp near the seaside the better to take precaution against all events  this foresight stood him in no small stead for at the solicitation of the marquess of montague in whom he confided and who made but an ill use of his trust upon this occasion being deserted by his little army he was forced to think of saving himself by sea he was then at the castle of lynn and hearing them cry every where long live henry he ordered them to defend the bridge till such time he and the duke of gloucester his brother could get aboard a ship to seek for refuge among their neighbors he steered his course for flanders very ill provided and attended wanting even necessaries for sustenance having carried nothing along with him but his arms wherewith to defend himself or to die like a man of courage what a strange revolution said he to the duke of gloucester we are here swimming upon the sea without money without friends and without knowing where to seek for refuge who would ever put his confidence in fortune all my hopes is in the duke of clarence why sir said the duke of gloucester is my brother so happy as to be reconciled to you has your majesty forgiven him his i reason it is a secret i dare to entrust you with replied the king i have sent back into france one of the duchess of clarences women a person of so much sense and conduct that i have left it to her management to negotiate with her master concerning what i have proposed to him she has made him sensible that nothing can be more derogatory to the grandeur of our house than to be serviceable to that of lancaster that his true interest and that of the earl of warwick are quite opposite and that if he will repent heartily i am ready to pardon him he has actually done so added edward but it is not time yet to declare himself however it is this that flatters my thoughts my soul fluctuating betwixt hopes and fear promises it self a possibility of a happy return i am fully persuaded as well as your majesty said the duke of gloucester we shall still see another favorable revolution which will recover you that throne you have lost  thus these two princes endeavored to afford one another the best comfort they could under their present circumstances  so soon as the marquess of montague was come into his brothers camp they shut themselves up together and every body judged no otherwise than that this was done in order to take the best measures they could to improve and pursue so happy a beginning but they were much out in their guess the two brothers after having embraced one another talked of nothing but the countess of devonshire the earl asked what news he had of her with the utmost impatience and the marquess told him that the king having discovered the place of her retirement went thither and conjured her to let him speak with her and that for fear of exasperating him and dreading some ill usuage if she did not she had at last resolved to see him oh brother what is it you tell me cried the earl he is a prince worthy to be beloved how i dread this conversation i must confess replied the marquess i was as much concerned at it as you are and would have given my life to have been able to interrupt it but the king was no sooner come away but he called and told me i cannot forbear to esteem the countess though she treats me with so much haughtiness and indifferency she has so great a share of virtue that though i lose all hopes of being beloved by her i cannot cease to love this relation said the marquess proved a comfort to me to such a degree as you may imagine i desired the king to banish from his heart a person who returned him nothing but ingratitude and finding he intended to see her again i writ her a letter telling her that if my advice were not suspected by her i thought she would not do amiss to retire at some greater distance from london to avoid further inconveniences she thanked me for my care and immediately after went away with my lord stanley and his lady to nittingham how cried the earl is she so near us go go let us find her out i cannot live without seeing her  had the earl of warwick been less entangled in his passion for the countess of devonshire he had bestowed his time in the pursuit of the king and might in all probability have overtaken him but he sacrificed all his interest to his love he desired his brother to remain in the camp whilst he went to find out the countess being resolved once more to make her an offer of a crown fortune had put into her hands and which was now at his disposal a thousand different thoughts came into his head some tending to flatter his hopes others to drive him to despair sometimes he hoped she would accept of the crown and soon after he feared she would not but to nottingham he went with the utmost speed but was no sooner arrived there when he was told that my lord stanley was gone from thence with all his family toward london being frightened at the approach of the armies and that the countess of devonshire was preparing to retreat to some solitary place where it would be very hard to find her out the earl was once in a mind to follow her but at last considering what danger he was likely to expose himself to if he should be met by some of king edwards parties he thought it best to dispatch berincour to the countess unto whom he writ the following letter  that same heart madam that adores you comes to offer you the crown of england dispose of the heart dispose of the crown make me happy to accept of both   perswade my lady devonshire said the earl that if she refuses my offer with the same obstinacy as she did the last time i saw her i shall in losing all hopes of possessing her become quite careless of my life and only strives to put an end to it by a sudden death berincour overtook the countess at some miles distance from london where she staid for a little time when she faw him she changed color being sensible of all the motions that are commonly felt when one expects some immediate news from what ones loves  my lord is once more victorious said she drawing nearer to the gentleman and you may easily imagine i am more rejoiced thereat than any other person living it is your own fault madam replied berincour if you will not convince him of that truth for hitherto you have given him occasion to doubt of it the countess answered only with a deep figh and taking the letter he presented to her she read it over and over and at last repeated the same things to berincour she had told his master before i have much more tenderness than ambition added she i am sensible of the infinite deserts of the earl of warwick i have reason to believe he loves me i preserve a most sincere acknowledgment for him i am certain also i shall never be happy without either his person or his tenderness but after this frank confession what can he ask more of me is not he the man who fought my husband is it not he that killed him how is it in my power to marry him and if i could give my consent to it i am certain i should forfeit his esteem all what berincour was able to allege to inspire other sentiments into her proving fruitless he saw himself obliged to leave her extremely dissatisfied at this ill success she writ to the earl to thank him for the honor he did her and to tell him how much afflicted she was because her present circumstances would not permit her to accept of his offer so berincour left her under a greater affliction than ever she had been sensible of before in all her life time  the earl of warwick expected with the utmost impatience the return of berincour who when he came brought him such an answer from my lady devonshire as served only to render him more unfortunate he shut himself up in his closet the better to afford a free course to his complaints he cried he called a thousand times for death and then considering within himself how to dispose of one of the best crowns in the world he took a sudden resolution and putting himself at the head of his army that was ready to march cried long live king henry heavens preserve him may his reign prove auspicious the officers and soldiers set up a loud huzzah and so marched forward to london the earl of warwick went immediately to the tower and delivered henry from a long captivity king edward had made him undergo you may guess at the surprise and joy of this unfortunate king and what he said to his deliverer at a time when he little dreamed of the recovery of his liberty and crown the earl received his competitor with a most profound respect and when he assured him of his acknowledgment he begged to consider him as his most humble subject who thought himself too happy in having been instrumental to restore him to the throne and then conducted him in great state to the cathedral  in the mean while the unfortunate queen isabella who had not been able to follow king edward in his flight understanding the news of this strange revolution and of the earl of warwicks approach to london she sought for refuge in the church of westminster against her victorious but mortal enemy where she was delivered of the eldest son she bore to king edward who as he bore his fathers name so he was no loss unfortunate in his reign the earl understanding what a condition she was reduced to sent berincour to her to let her know with his utmost respect that she needed fear nothing in a place where he had some authority but the queen returned no answer but by sobs sighs and tears berincour told the earl the queen was in a most miserable condition and stood in need of every thing he moved with compassion sent him back immediately to offer her a considerable sum of money in a very rich box whatever my right may be to this money said she it is enough it comes from the earl of warwick for me to refuse it the most lamentable state i am reduced to cannot make me be so forgetful as not to remember him to be our most mortal enemy return him his present he is used to be liberal with what is none of his own witness the crown of edward he is going to put upon henrys head madam said berincour may i be so bold as to represent to your majesty that at all  one must not en to ones resentment  accept of my masters present it may perhaps prove a means to reconcile him to your interest no said she i hope for nothing from a revoed subject in the condition the royal family is now reduced to we can hope for no assistance but only from heaven thus this magnanimous princess would not accept of the earls present and remained in westminster church to shelter her self against the violences she dreaded from the house of lancaster so soon as the earl had in the kings name given the necessary orders according to the present exigency of affairs and had dispatched several expresses to lewis the eleventh and queen margaret to inform them of his good success he now began to inform himself exactly concerning what course edward had steered after his departure out of england he was informed that he being pursued in the open sea by eight privateers whom he was not able to engage was in the utmost danger of being taken by them had not a fair wind sprung up and carried him to alemar in the province of holland the signior grutze governor of the place was as good fortune would have it for king edward just then present there who upon the first notice of his arrival went aboard himself offering him every thing that was in his power my condition is deplorable said edward to him but you receive me with so much kindness as will make me almost insensible of my misfortune then turning him to the master of the ship who had brought him over he presented him with his coat lined with martin sables i give you but a slender reward said he but it is all i have left the captain kissing his hand upon his knees i am too well rewarded sir replied he in having the honor of being serviceable to your majesty  king edward being supplied by the said governor with clothes money and other necessaries went to the hague where the duke of burgundy then kept his court that duke seeing him in so miserable a condition did not fail to furnish edward his brother in law and those that came along with him with all manner of neeessaries but as to the succors he desired to enable him to return into england that affair met with some difficulties  the earl of warwick less taken up with the weight of his public affairs than with his passion thought scarce of any thing else but the countess he had been in search for her every where and now despairing to find her alas said he to the marquess of montague because you persist in loving her marry her brother in seeing you happy i shall find some matter of comfort to my self and it will serve me as an undeniable reason to cure me of all the hopes i had conceived of becoming her husband you see her rigor toward me she shuns me i cannot as much as see her she treats me as harshly as your self replied the marquess but with this difference that she loves you but only looks upon mine as an importunate passion they discoursed for some time longer concerning their mutual misfortunes this being the only comfort they had in the countess s absence at last the earl quite oppressed with grief frankly confessed to his brother that he heartily wished to be delivered by death of those most cruel pains that continually tormented him  king henry having constituted the duke of clarence and the earl of warwick governors of the kingdom the last was very vigilant in taking all possible precautions against any sudden surprise but being obliged to march with a good body of troops into the north of england to secure king henrys interest there edward tool this opportunity to land with  000 men without any opposition from those who were entrusted with the defense of the coasts on that side besides which the duke of clarence who under pretense of being highly exasperated against his brother edward had got a great ascendant over king henry and the earl deserted their party and joined his forces with edward  they marched directly to london which city seldom constant to its choice opened its gates without the least resistance in spite of all what henry could do or say to the contrary and he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the victorious enemy this being the fourth time he was taken a prisoner the earl of warwick upon this no less doleful than surprising news drew together what troops he could directing his march toward london in hopes of surprising king edward but this prince no less vigilant upon any occasion of moment than he was careless in matters of no great consequence was already got into the field and marching directly against him the earl animated at the presence of a monarch who had so ill rewarded his services and fearing that the kings party might increase whilst his was likely to diminish did not think fit to expect the french auxiliaries queen margaret was to bring to his assistance you are for fighting said the marquess of montague to him and so am i but this day must decide the fate of our lives if we are worsted let us have this comfort at least to die in the field of battle without carrying away our disgrace and misfortune along with us we will replied the earl bereave our selves of the very means thereof and so alighting from his horse the marquess did the like and they sent their horses without the camp berincour was also dispatched by his master to the countess of devonshire to assure her that if he died in the battle he should not regret so much his life as that he had not been able to merit her heart and her hand  soon after was fought the famous battle of barnet the great actions performed there by edward by the earl and marquess surpassed those of all the rest but at last fortune declared for the king the earls troops at first forced those of edward to give way but these returning to the charge put the earls army to flight ten thousand men were slain in the field of battle the earl of warwick and the marquess of montague did all they could to rally their forces but in vain and king edward being in every place where his presence was necessary animated his troops by his example and words and espying the earl ran toward him with his sword drawn to decide their personal quarrel upon this occasion but whilst they were engaging a whole troop of edwards soldiers fell upon the earl and mortally wounded him the marquess of montague endeavourig to rescue his brother underwent the same fate thus fell these two great men who were always formidable to their enemies the earl of warwick had obtained the surname of the achilles of england being the darling of the people and the terror of his enemies they were universally lamented king edward being the only gainer in this universal loss  scarce was the noise of this victory spread over the kingdom but king henrys party left destitute of all hopes edward had now no more enemies to encounter but queen margaret and the prince of wales lately landed in england with a good body of french and looking upon the victory he had obtained against the earl of warwick as a happy presage of his future success against the queen he engaged them near tewksbury this most courageous princess fighting at the head of her troops like an amazon saw the prince of wales drop dead near her having received many wounds she threw herself upon his body endeavoring to secure him against a vast number of swords directed against his body but in vain her only son was gone which she perceiving fought like a desperate woman who was willing to lose her life upon the spot however she was taken prisoner and the duke of somerset of the royal blood of the house of lancaster along with her the last had his head cut off the next day by king edward thus england stained with the blood of its princes sacrificed its subjects to the fury of an intestine war  the victorious king carried henry and margaret two most deplorable instances of the frailty of humane affairs along with him in his march and near their litters you might see the two bodies of the earl of warwick and his brother the marquess of montague in an open chariot all uncovered edward being willing to expose them to every bodies sight for fear somebody or other should make use of their names to head a new party in this manner he made his entrance in london and he shut up henry in the tower where he a few days after was murdered by the duke of gloucester but queen margaret was ransomed by her father the king of sicily for thirty thousand crowns  the countess of devonshire led so retired a life ever since the last refusal of espousing the earl of warwick and this refusal went so near her heart that she would not be seen even by those of her own family she had bought a little house in one of the most solitary places of london which she took some delight in fitting up she caused all her adventures to be drawn in a closet where the earls picture was drawn in a thousand places she diverted herself with books birds a fine flowergarden and had three women among her attendance who sung and played most charmingly upon several musical instruments this solitude she judged might serve instead of a nunnery for she received no visits and was always employed in sending forth her prayers and vows to heaven to bless the army of the earl of warwick the danger she knew he must after be exposed to would not suffer her to live in tranquillity for sometimes she fancied she saw him in the midst of an army raised in haste who might easily quit his party and go over to king edward and after all supposing no such thing might happen she dreaded the event of a decisive battle or some other fatal accident  her mind was taken up with these reflections when berincour came he told her his master had sent him away that very time when he was preparing to give battle to edward that all the weighty affairs that lay upon his shoulders had not in the least diminished his passion unto which he seemed to postpone every thing else that though her absence had been almost insupportable to him he had continued never the less faithful and that the hero in his person had never got the precedence before the lover  i am sensible of every thing i owe to the earl his idea is always in my mind replied the countess i pray incessantly for his preservation were it even at the expense of my life and his glory whereby he gains an immortal crown sometimes gives me some notions of vanity which is not altogether free from selfinterest but berincour how dearly do i pay for these pleasing minutes for soon after i am overwhelmed with a world of melancholy thoughts which make me dread some ill fate for what i so dearly love a happy indifferency is worthy of the envy of all the world her eyes being filled with tears you see continued she you see me cry and i am not able to stop my tears i am disturbed all night with terrible dreams o good god cried she would it be possible for me to outlive my illustrious friend go return to him make him sensible of my frailties recommend to him from me to be careful of a life whereon depends the preservation of my own let him come back let him come back  but madam  said berincour you give me no promise of your marriage so long as you refuse to unite your destiny with his believe me he will take no care of himself if he dies madam will not you have a great deal to reproach to yourself you confound me continued she but i assure you i am sufficiently unhappy already dont add to my misfortune so berincour saw himself obliged to depart without being able to obtain any thing in favor of his master  the countess as i told you having taken a resolution not to be seen by any body she used to go to church early every morning and that in a chair she was covered with a veil in the earl of warwicks chapel when the earls body and that of the marquess of montague were exposed to public view in st pauls church by king edwards particular command they were covered all over with blood their wounds conspicuous in many parts and death appeared in its natural color in their faces  i will not pretend to represent here the pain the countess devonshire felt at that time she had been beloved both by the earl and by the marquess with so lively constant and respectful a passion that they had never given her the least occasion of complaint against them twas also no less true that she had never seen any man whose deserts could challenge a preference before those of the earl of warwick who was master of a vast share of wit valor and all the other qualifications which made him the most accomplished hero in the universe  till this fatal moment she had had power enough over herself to conceal the infinite tenderness she had for him but now all these passions contained hitherto within the bounds of the empire of reason broke forth with so much impetuosity that with a thousand cries and lamentations she threw herself upon the dead and bloody corpse of her faithful lover here she shed a torrent of tears which was not stopped but with the loss both of her sight and voice her eyes remained fixed without the least motions upon him her delicious red and white complexion changed into a deadly paleness they endeavored to draw her away by force but she squeezing the earls hand close to her bosom fetched a very deep sigh and so expired in the arms of her woman before they were able to remove her from the place or give her any real assistance happy in her misfortunes because her grief would not suffer her to outlive what she loved  the extraction of the countess was such and her beauty so extraordinary and so much celebrated that there were few people in england that did not hear and lament her destiny my lord stanley her brother who loved her tenderly being almost inconsolable desired the king she might be buried in the same tomb with the earl of warwick  king edward consented being unwilling to separate such precious ashes and being highly afflicted at the exit of so wonderful a person whom he had loved with so much tenderness but he having still a great many enemies to contend with he was not altogether so sensible as he would have been at another time of the countess of devonshires death  finis books sold by j

devotion or from open irreligion to hypocrisy hela my pauvre sister saw you but the austerities of versailles and st germains you would no longer be of opinion that the court of england was so inferior to em in splendour and delights i look upon my self no better than a banished man and one grown old in exile from his native country his friends and family it is true my duty obliges me to be here but alas how severe a pleasure is that reckoned with what i can now but barely reflect on even thou my sister art little better than a name to me i left thee so young that it is impossible to have any idea of thee not but nature or impulse or what you please gives me an unaccountable fondness for a person i am wholly a stranger to since my dear you can no longer pretend to be that beautiful little creature of four years old whose image with all her pretty prattle i still retain yes i say thou art now another she thy person and understanding at its growth and i do not question but that they equally deserve our admiration the last i can read in thy inimitable letters therefore wanting the beautiful substance of the other let me at least possess the lovely shadow you have promised me your picture pray do not delay it for that in any desired blessing is a sort of a refusal i leave it to your own choice whether in great or little it is equal to me whether i am obliged to cross or kneller for the knowledge of my sister or any other artist that may perhaps have since outstript them in reputation though when i was so happy to be in england they were deservedly esteemed the best  i find nature to be the same in all countries and that whilst there be women they will have curiosities what is the news of our world to yours would you have me write novels instead of letters i am told in your last that the first thing you do in receiving mine is in considering the quantity from thence to set a price or value upon the whole ah my dear sister truth and kindness are not always the most voluminous we may say the dearest tenderest things in a little room can any thing be more expressive than these words i love all other terms of passion are but derived from thence and yet how little paper do they employ it is not then the friendship in mine that you regard it is the news it affords and in this my dear sister i am afraid you show your self little better than a plain gossip but because i am not well enough acquainted with you to chide it shall be a happiness to me that any way i can make a banished brothers remembrance acceptable to you  but to begin with the court at versailles it has an air of nothing but devotion it is no longer there that gallantry appears barefaced lewis xiv seems to have outlived himself and the gay customs of the former part of his reign that universal spirit of love and pleasure that swayed every heart with absolute power is now no more those noble assemblies are dissolved where love was permitted to show it self without disguise then without wonder two lovers inspired by the same desire might enjoy their mutual pleasures for scandal was lost where all were guilty nor could the wellmannerd persons of either sex make their court more adroitly to their monarch than by sorting themselves to his inclination whence proceeds so dismal a change is it because his age has varied the season be it so but it is not generous to forbid love to others because he has outlived the force of it himself can any thing be more envious were it in his power i believe the whole world should be of one age and taste and not a mortal appear at court under sixty odd then beads and relics might be in season though nothing else is now to be seen there with dull seeminglyreligious faces nor discourses to be heard but of saints days and their vigils hypocrisy has dispossessed love from its lawful and beautiful throne and like most absolute usurping tyranny reigns uneasily and not without pain reduces his subjects to submit to its unbounded power oh were it possible to look into the kings breast to see if his devotion be true and how it comes to pass that he should have remorse for no other sin but that which he is no longer in danger of committing  love which perhaps has been the least criminal of all his actions how is it he still remains unwearied with persecution and power that he knows not how to permit any other monarch in europe to be at ease unless they be in effect his creatures can this be real piety can this be true devotion oh no religion is always equal and consistent in all things and no more indulges sin with than against inclinations his vices then have only shifted the scene tired with love and surfeited with joy he hunts with pleasure the unwearied round of ambition ambition which has this of admirable in it is that still as one hope is defeated it is recruited with another and of all the passions it is the latest cloyed ambition that exorbitant desire which is never sufficiently gratified but still increases with possession and which has so entirely filled the soul of lewis xiv that all his actions are subservient to it hence it is that with such an austere air he assumes devotion as an unquestioned veil to all his tyranny nay it is so severely practiced that a poor young lady if she be but suspected to have a lover has a letter of lachet sent her to withdraw as too libertine an ornament for a holy court  these severities my dear sister pass not without complaint among those persons whom youth and beauty have fitted for other diversions the ladies i believe would not be displeased to see a younger prince upon the throne who has three sons all disposed to gay and softer inclinations so that we may justly say the whole nation groans under lewiss tyranny and that if he oppresses the men with taxes persecution and war he no less constrains the women by devotion i was sitting at my ease behind a fountain in the garden at versailles the other evening when two court ladies came to repose themselves near me i was hid from em by a myrtle hedge thus they discoursed ah ma belle comtess cries one of em of what value is youth and beauty in such a court as this we either are not admired or they must not discover it to us that we are will not old age or ill faces serve well enough to follow the old insensible monarch to marli or madam maintenon to st cyr thank god i do not want devotion but i would not altogether forget i am young and surely born to taste other joys than what arise from cant and prayer nay they teach our very husbands to believe that the delights of marriage should have something severe in em and that excess in all things but religion is to be condemned but their opinions i could easier forgive than those severities that forbid to us the innocent pleasure of admiration which let a woman be never so honest she cannot miss without inquietudes oh the satisfaction of seeing ones self admired by a crowd of adorers all eager to oblige watching every glance catching at every turn of my eyes or graceful nod pressing to do me service praising as i pass my face my shape my manner this air all languishing the next moment more gay all pleasing let me tell you it is insufferable tyranny inverting the order of nature a tax upon our youth and beauty so exorbitant that age and ugliness is of as great an use and value and we might have as well been born old as live young to so little purpose as we do  i may venture my dear sister to affirm that in this ladys i send you the general opinion and present state of the feminine court see then if it can possibly afford those sort of adventures which you so passionately beg to hear i suppose it is otherwise with you the sun seems to rise on the successes of that court as it is declining or setting here all things appear to us like faded glories we droop we languish as persons without hope we fear all accidents since none of late have happened to our advantage my dear sister adieu and believe i passionately love and embrace you once more adieu  letter ii to the same from the same being an account of the salacious amors of madam montespan one of the french kings mistresses with lords gentlemen players etc i imagine my dear sister that you who are so full of curiosity cannot but have read some of the many memoirs that have been translated and printed in english concerning madam de montespan a former and beautiful mistress of lewis xiv you must therein have found how he took her from her husband the late marquis de montespan who retired extremely dissatisfied from court at the prerogative his royal master usurped of taking from husbands their wives whenever they appeared charming to him madam de fontange succeeded her in the kings favor for alas what love is there that remains always the same what ardours are there which time does not abate what enjoyment that long deserves to be called such what transports that do not fade even before the beauty that inspires em  madam montespan who had never any great passion for the person of the king saw his change with less concern than any other would have done and endeavored to comfort her self for his loss in the arms of a thousand others in short she has made her self so great a slave to sensual love enriching worthless people to her own ruin that we see her at this day the most despised from the most admired of her age and whereas another in losing the kings affections for the honor of those children she has had by him would have endeavored to retrieve her reputation and improved the great estate the kings lavish love had bestowed upon her she has run counter to all discretion and very often seen her self without a jewel the smallest piece of plate or perhaps one pistole undone between cards and lovers she has scarce left her self a bare subsistence and had not the king wisely foreseen the prodigality of her temper and settled eighteen thousand crowns a year to be paid her weekly i dare affirm that long ere this she had not had wherewith to eat but nothing made her so despicable as her calling that ugly fellow but excellent comedian labrunne from the stage to her service and bed where as gentleman of the horse he ruled both his lady and family for some years till being detected as a traitor the king sent him to languish out the remainder of his life at pignerol madam montespan who had none of those romantic weaknesses called constancy soon found wherewith to comfort her for the comedians absence for many fellows more worthless if possible soon succeeded to her favor in their turns among whom the same folly pursuing her to her old age she received one who had it is true been handsome in the eye of the whole town but so long since that every body had forgot it but himself he still retained the name and was vulgarly called handsome du prez tho he would admit of no other title but monsieur le comte du prez count of the sacred roman empire and in spite of what the heralds could do he gave the roman eagles and bore em upon his equipage etc they at first laughed at and afterward slighted him as a madman and so left him to his imaginary grandeur his economy as to his affairs can have no better a parallel than his courage for if one was little the other was less and he was no better than a beggar when he applied himself in his address to madam montespan her lord had bin dead about six months when she married this imaginary count and i have heard several fay that she wanted but this last act of indiscretion or rather height of folly to crown or close her foregoing life and to make her descend to the grave as she had lived the most deservedly despised and scorned of any woman living  from so old so fantastical and so ill yet wellpaird a couple what could be expected but a new scene of follies they were the theme for laughter of the whole kingdom and would have still better diverted had they not bin so far despised as to be neglected and many of their follies safe from being repeated as too worthless for conversation this ridiculous garb extravagant equipage and great expense with his parade through paris in diamond buttons and other fantastical calls to the multitude were the common theme amongst the vulgar for people of condition had left to speak of em yet thus safely might he have flourished if he had not joined ingratitude to the rest of his moral virtues and ill used that lady from whence he drew his support she had called to her family a granddaughter of hers named madam briancon a lady full of youth and fire with more beauty than discretion she was parted from her husband for her criminal conduct or at least the appearance of it madam montespan received her with open arms and as she is passionately fond of new favorites of what sex soever nothing was well done but what madam briancon ordered the old amorous count of the sacred empire was soon cloyed with his brides antiquated charms nay if you will believe scandal she was no new thing to him having several years before when du prez was in his beauty received him to her arms but however it were he could not every day see so much youth and agreeableness as madam briancon was mistress of without offering her his heart there is certainly a lex talionis a law of retaliation in this world as well as the next and madam montespan who was her self consummate in ingratitude and scarce ever bestowed a favor upon the deserving now tasted the return from her own grandchild and husband madam briancon accepted his odious love because it came well accompanied with money and presents of whatever he could give her of her grandmothers that was most valuable and so often were they in their amors that the old lady quickly complained of being defrauded that she had indeed bought a husband but another had the greatest and best property in him her tongue had ever bin too shrill and bitter not to be a nuisance to all that heard it and if upon her friends her intimates and servants where she had no occasion she used loudly to exert her  of scurrilous railing what think you became of her where she was so nearly concerned she tore she roared and dry and old as she was she squeezed out briny baleful tears which like drops from yewtrees would have scalded the most verdant grass but this little availed her the counts vanity was gratified by her violent passions and madam briancon too charming and too kind must not be forsaken for her grandmother the fool thought himself young again tho it was but an old beldame that contended for him and grew nauseously fond of his mistress and intollerably slighting of his wife the good jealous marchioness no longer able to endure the daily insults of her younger charms dismissed madam briancon with a million of reproaches the consequence of which was that the sacred count took a house for her and furnishing of it with what was most precious from the marchioness he was ten times more there than at home nay so far he carried his ingratitude that he threatened his lady with the loss of her life unless she would consent to give him all that was in her power turned off her people put new ones about her who were only spies and tormenters to her and refused to bring her what was necessary even to eating and drinking that no longer able to endure his tyranny she left her house and fled for safety to her sons the duke de main from whence she complained to the parliament of paris which takes cognizance of such affairs and whilst the process was depending far beyond her hopes or deserts it was discovered that the roman count was some time before his nuptials with madam montespan married to a woman who had been imposed upon him by a pleasant cheat for a fortune the trial before the council of state was very diverting and his letters produced to his first wife whilst he yet believed her a great lady wherein he styled her countess of the sacred empire with the depositions of the priest whom he first asked to marry em where he gave him an account of the good fortune that was happning to him tho indeed she was not handsome but the more like a woman of quality the case was clearly demonstrated the marchioness was relieved from her ungrateful husband and he adjudgd to his first wife whom he had barbarously used and left to starve and sentenced as the law requires to undergo the punishment due to him who shall remarry during the life of his wife but madam briancon by her charms procured him the protection of the envoy of savoy who received him into his house and shortly two of the first dukes and peers of the realm who had bailed him when he stood committed upon the marchionesses first complaint got him the royal pardon not out of kindness or esteem for him he was not worth it but hatred to madam montespan who when formerly in power had made those two mighty men her enemies therefore let none think to confer injuries unforgotten or unrevenged since there are none how despicable soever but in the turn of a life may have opportunity to return the mischief  thus my dear sister i have in short given you the detail of madam montespans adventure while yet du prezs first marriage was undiscovered he carried it with the utmost insolence against the marchioness and in all companies ridiculed her and her old fond amors to all the height imaginable wrote or procured to be wrote numbers of the most scandalous verses or ballads that ever your grubstreet afforded and these he dispersed with his own hand to all comers and in all public places though all condemned her  her ill life and marriage yet none took part with him unless it were some whose contempt of her surmounted their contempt of him  madam briancon flourishes with the addresses of the envoy at whose house she is seen too often not but her beauty has attracted another lover and her kind nature received him into the number of the happy and surely he deserves the good fortune of a virginheart and one who shall sigh for him alone it is the young count of c new returned from travel and who to all his other accomplishments has this not inconsiderable one of near fourscore thousand crowns annual rent  will not this long letter and of adventures too oblige my dear sister certainly to conclude that she may command all things within the power of her passionately tender and most affectionate brother and servant  letter iii being a secret history of the intrigues amors etc of the frince of hesse in england and spain it is very true madam your ladyships memory is most exact but i think you lay too great a stress upon accident for i can term it no other and you must certainly be mistaken in giving foreknowledge to an old poor woman in a dirty chimneycorner because she happened to tell the prince of hesse darmstadt that once in two years he should narrowly escape death if he did escape it having a near relation to colonel nugent who was gentleman of the horse to his highness i often had the honor of conversing with the prince and am glad it is in my power to oblige you with some memoirs of the life of that brave man he was second son to the younger house of hesse called darmstadt to distinguish it from hessecassel the elder his name was george and according to the custom of the younger princes of germany he was made a soldier of fortune he had distinguished himself in several campaigns and particularly in the irish war where king william gave him a regiment and favored our hero with his esteem after his return to germany the king of the romans caressed and bestowed on him the honor of his friendship the queen of spain was then contracted and wedded by proxy to charles of spain she was near related to our prince and when the king of the romans sent him to her fathers court to have the honor of attending her to her husband at that time the prince of hesse was very handsome and though afterward at the age of two and thirty years when we saw him in england he appeared to us like a man of forty weatherbeaten and fatigued yet was he well made of a good mien and height his eyes black and unusually sweet the goodness of his temper was visible in his countenance he had a large soul generous to profuseness believed well of all he conversed with and would be but with pain undeceived when he found that they answered not the opinion he had of em the queens interest procured him the viceroyship of catalonia and he held his court at barcelona with extreme splendour when the kings death and the turn of affairs called him to court cardinal fortocarero did all that a cunning politician could to draw him into the french interest but with a faith unshaken to the house of austria he rather chose to resign his government and return to germany  on his highnesss arrival in spain with the new queen he found at court the princess dowager of  she was a young widow extremely charming and as sensible of the pains of love as of giving them she could not see the graceful person of the prince which visibly confessed the hero and observe the good qualities of his mind by conversation without some secret wishes that she might not be indifferent to him nor could the prince behold so uncommon a beauty without ardent desires that she could look on him with a favorable eye there was such a sympathy betwixt the sweet tempers of the queen and this princess that on the death of the king she retired to toledo with her majesty the prince as firm as his desires were and as much as he asked the love of the princess made love give way to business and ambition went to his government without informing the princess with his passion fearing the declaration would oblige a longer attendance than his affairs or the service of the king would permit and on the death of charles the second he was forced to repair to madrid in order to quit a command he could not preserve without a breach of that honor which he always professed but before he left spain he went to take his leave of the queen with this satisfaction that he should there see the charming object of his desires and though he could hope little from the short time of his stay yet the pleasure of seeing her would not permit him to think of the pain it might cost him he has often told me in confidence that the most glorious evening of his life was that when he went to take his leave of the princess at toledo where the cardinal had ordered the queen to retire after the usual compliments he told her majesty the business of his audience was to receive her commands for germany the princess waited his return from the queen and gave occasion for a passion as agreeable as tormenting but before he retired she desired his company to her closet for she had some business with him which ought to be private he gave her his hand to conduct her and found her in an unusual trembling and disorder when she was seated and had paused some moments with an enchanting blush which covered her beauteous face with vermillion she cast her languishing and sparkling eyes upon him and thus sweetly inquired my lord have not women of such high quality as mine do you think some prerogative above other women or else what does title signify but alas we have the same weaknesses with the rest of our sex are sensible of the same passions can hate as cruelly and love as violently but with this difference that we are seldom beloved at least the first time we are sure to be made victims to our quality and the civil laws of spain oblige widows of my rank to retire to a monastery what hope is there then for me what expectation should the god of love or the bright queen his mother touch my heart with that passion as to those charming softnesses they so well know how to inspire and yet it is too true that i understand but too well the laws of tenderness i am in pain i almost love but know not how to assure my self of being beloved that alone restrains me from going into those heights which love requires from us  ladies of your beauteous form answered the prince without the advantage of great titles are sure to have all the returns that so great a blessing as being beloved by you can really deserve but how said the princess if i should cast mine on a heart already engaged must i either make a traitor or be unhappy my self i may boldly say returned the prince that before your highness all beauties are forgotten nay the very memory is defaced of all preceding tendernesses and if we have not been insensible before it is only to show the mighty difference betwixt those languors another can inspire and those passions your highness  i am then understood by you my lord replied the princess hastily this moment retire from me or i shall sink with confusion but go no farther than madrid take care not to leave our kingdom till i have determined what to do with you  whether his highness obeyed i durst not so nicely enquire but i think from that time he became faithless to the duke d albuquerques daughter he showed me the princesses picture done upon vellum which he always carried about him without either case or frame in his pocketbook her hair was flaxen her eyes black and full of the natural sweetness usual to that color he had it besides in great hung up in his closet and when the prince would indulge himself it was in writing letters to her of a prodigious length i cannot say fine for they seemed to want it there were attempts of passion in them but nothing answerable to those of the princess which made me conclude hers truly the effect of love his only of gratitude in the freedom i had with his highness i found means unknown to him to copy four of her letters which i send you that you may judge how nature would act in ladies did not custom restrain them but i dare not assure you that they do not suffer extremely in the translation in their originals they have much more softness and yet more force and fire yet such as i have made them i present to you  the princess of  letters to the prince of hesse darmstadt letter i expressing her uneasiness at the news of his resolution of leaving spain and desires before he goes to hear from him the queen and court wait for my presence but love ever uppermost in my soft soul will be hearkened to though affairs of the greatest moment were forced to be at a stand and wait till you are dispatched i hear you are preparing to leave spain had your soul loved with that ardout it ought this separation had not been love ingenious to its own satisfaction would have prevented its own misfortunes had it been my province i could have found out a thousand ways to have prevented this evil you stupid as you are fear to advance one step but by rule know you not that after my confessing love i had no more to do the rest was yours what courage is this when you only dare to wish and are afraid of acting what a soul is that who declines his fortune when with swelling sails and prosperous gales it is more than offered him do you imagine that every day will present you a heart like mine  go by this coldness you are unworthy of what i would have done for you did i not bid you boldly ask  what should not that have taught you what explanation had that but my self no rest no sleep should have been yours till at my feet you had thanked me as you ought for a favor so inestimable how am i thus by a soft resentment betrayed to make reproaches foreign to the manners and character of a woman of honor yet surely if ever they are to be passed over it is in favor of a lover beloved come to me to morrow but write to me to night and write your true thoughts mine are notwithstanding this petty anger all yours adieu  you beg me to think of you some times i every night see you in my dreams judge then whether it is in my power not to think of you   letter ii desiring to hear from him whoever would have told me that i could have felt in favor of any person living what i feel for you i should have answered twas impossible write to me by this courier but write as i do to you sincerely without art or without design but of pleasing and if any part of that dangerous poison has touched your heart with which mine is filled if you can in the least feel any stings of that tenderness with which mine abounds i shall quickly show that fortune had not forgot you when she made me yours   letter iii your letter was my bedfellow last night i laid it upon my breast where my heart beat it a thousand welcomes tell me what almighty power is there in liking how can it be in nature that i have insensibly passed the addresses of all the great men of my own country yet am wounded by a stranger without your ever designing it not one advance on your side to excuse that in me which you may cruelly call levity whilst i feel and know it is fate it is irresistible it is what i cannot conquer and must indulge beware of sacrificing me to your happy mistress i will not name her least you should find a pleasure in it and i would ingross all yours you deny to return my letters and plead discretion twould have been a better argument if you had said you loved and could not restore em how pleased should i be if i thought you true when you write me that you behold my rival with much more indifferency since i have honored you with my concern but i forget you are eternally engaged and i do ill to thrust rudely between two hearts where love seems to intend an union nay perhaps i am impertinent in writing tedious letters to a man in business whose soul is filled with something less soft than love or if filled it is for another and not for me do not enquire too nicely what a woman of honor can mean by owning a passion for a man engaged i dare not yet consult my own heart upon the point all i know is that my virtue is what it ought to be i love without other design but of making you in love with me that effected fate must rule our destiny and be answerable for the event  i will not be so rigid as to impose answering my letters by every courier your leisure and softer moments be for me take my example i write unartfully without method or perhaps coherence my thoughts naturally as they arise in my mind fall from my pen not polished by art nor bettered by study if in love any study be of use therefore make not a judgment of my understanding from the disguise my passion has put it in or if you must judge judge truly that it is thus unfeignedly they love who thus unartfully do write  could i be sure that it were agreeable to you i would repeat a thousand times over that you are more then dear more than precious to me the paper does not blush though i do but that you see not nor that inborn modesty so hard to be dispensed with which were you even here before me would make me a ve woman and deny all i have this way said to you nay the night i last saw you in my closet when i and my passion both strove to rid our selves of it when i was upon the point of losing you for ever without a sally on my side to favor your presumption and dying at that loss yet could i make nothing of it though by the kind encouragement of my eyes you ventured at what you guessed a pleasing kiss with pleasure i could have clasped you to my bosom by a dear embrace to have imprinted our cruel parting in your memory yet left i you almost where i found you though i once had resolved before you went to tell you insinuately and indirectly but so as any man not stupid might have known that twas you alone could make all my happiness   letter iv i have so lately seen you and my thoughts are so filled with that dear image that i cannot forbear telling you though at this distance that fancy has brought you near nay so very near as to my bosom there this morning i dreamed you were and the imagination was so strong that starting out of my sleep i left my dream imperfect my senses had their concern been less had not so soon roused themselves to find whether the object were a real or imaginary happiness and i perhaps had longer seen you nay i more than saw you forgive the pleasure i take in writing freely and let me instruct you in the laws of love which say there can be no indecency in virtuous love it is generosity it is kindness and unless you love not me i cannot offend be my letters the test of your passion if they are acceptable i must be so nor think i should dislike you for your inconstancy to another i have already told you you can only offend by indifferency should i not cherish that inconstancy should i not be proud of the exchange i am and of your kindness which i hope real because i deserve it should be so you seem to doubt of the continuance of mine and think it burns too fierce to last it would indeed be the greatest happiness for me for sure a hopeless distant passion is of all things the most miserable state my whole endeavors strove reason pride modesty in short all the powers of haughty womankind inflamed to the height with an opinion of her own worth not to have let you seen when here the disorder you had made but in vain i would too have forbid my self the ease of complaining upon paper but the rack was too exquisite selflove carried it above all other considerations and i pushed my fortune in hopes of succeeding how then do you think i should now do less when i have the pleasing prospect of a mutual passion do not believe me weary of the pursuit at least till i arrive at that charming intelligence of heart which leaves us nothing farther to desire than indeed they say we may be suspected to decline because human nature is in it self restless and loves alteration but being yet at a vast distance from the cause alarm not your self in fear of the effects especially where there is not the least symptoms of such a change therefore if you can love me boldly love me without fears of my inconstancy or any dispondency of your own merit talk no more at that displeasing distance let me not find you think your self undeserving of the worthiest heart for that seems a secret upbraiding of my choice if you must fear fear only that fortune may for a long time delay our mutual pleasure of seeing each other if ever i am so happy i will infuse into your soul so vast a profusion of tenderness that your self shall own could be only inspired by me then you will say your whole life has passed insipidly without the greatest most transporting and most valuable gift of nature and no where to be found but in hearts mutually loving and knowing how to be beloved yet  granting a mighty difference in the understanding of the persons the more sensible the love doubtless it is the most capable of those delights whose description is too big for words and which only the lovers fancy can do justice to   i am sorry i can give you no more particulars of this amor for i durst not press the prince to declare whether he were married or only promised i believe the former however he did not long enjoy her beauty but returning to germany was sent to treat upon secrets of state with the king of england whose death succeeding soon after broke for some time the prince of hesses measures so he retired to greenwich to pass over incognito the grief he really took for his loss twas there that i first had the honor of his acquaintance my ill health obliging me to take the air in hopes of my recovery i had not then ever seen his highness nor in some years my cousin nugent the viceroys of catalonia have it in their power to create whom they please noble the prince had had the goodness to make him a count during his residence in spain i met em both in the park and did not fail to congratulate and welcome my cousin into england i asked him who that foreigner was that i saw with him not imagining it to be the prince because they had not one attendant and nugent wore his hat and treated him but as his equal he invited me to their little lodging at greenwich which indeed was very small nor had they any more than one servant that waited without a livery i speak most of the modern languages and the prince did me the honor to be pleased with my conversation nay so far as to discover himself to me and i persuaded him back to court to apply himself to the ministers who probably would pursue the method the king had before his death resolved upon for the next campaign the queen graciously received him and in consultation with count wratislaw the emperors envoy it was resolved according to king williams intentions that the prince of hesse should be sent to portugal to endeavor to draw that king from his neutrality into the alliance before things could be fixed for his departure the prince met with several interruptions traversed by the pensioners of france for there are but few negotiations secret in the court of england the delays were so uneasy that it put him upon a superstitious piece of weakness and which indeed was his blind side of hearing what astrologers and fortune tellers would tell him nugent had procured him several among which one ignorant dirty creature in white friars a month before his departure told him that he should not go till the next month that he should receive his dispatch the sixteenth depart the seventeenth but if he could stay till the eighteenth his voyage would have success but withal said he should never come to england again i must believe that nugent had a hand in her intelligence for according to what she said the prince received his orders on the sixteenth and went the seventeenth the joy and eagerness he had to have surmounted all those difficulties that had retarded his voyage got the better of his superstition and would not let him wait for the eighteenth which he afterward repented when he failed of what he had proposed for the king of portugal gave him his congee without harkening to any of his proposals or the reasons he offered to draw him into the alliance the prince refused the presents that the king sent after him on board his ship and departed with all the chagrin of a disappointed courtier whose own interest as surely it was his to serve spain was equally defeated he joined the squadron where the duke of ormond was they resolved upon a descent at barcelona the prince depending upon his intelligence with the citizens and the great love the people had for him since his being viceroy in catalonia but their designs were discovered and for that time disappointed they afterward fell in at vigo with all that success which it will be superfluous to repeat to you here he found means to receive new proofs of the princesss kindness with a passionate letter too long for me to copy full of smiling hopes that fortune would shortly unite their persons as it had done their hearts  he returned to england with the duke of ormond and was very well received at court notwithstanding the disappointments he had met with and the mortification he had not long after of seeing one of the queens servants succeed in what he had failed the king of portugal was drawn into the alliance and the princes hopes were still fairer than before he still maintained his intelligence with the catalonians and the court believed so well of it as to resolve to send a fleet and army to attend him under the command of the earl of peterborough  notwithstanding the princes glorious affair with the princess of  he found it not amiss at his leisure hours to unbend himself with the fair english ladies his soul was passionate his temper amorous and sweet he pretended not to be one of those heros of romance that can subsist upon the bare imagination of an absent mistress and who think it a crime deserving death should they bestow the least glance upon another the princes person and good will was at the service of any fair lady he lived in splendour lavished away his money for his generous temper like marshall turenne considered not the value of it this gave him choice enough among the ladies that were to be purchased with whom he amused himself though his inclinations were all devoted to my lord ws lady but want of leisure and believing her already engaged hindered his application though he made his court regularly to her as indeed all the foreigners do her living so long in the court of france and being daughter to a king has given her conversation that easy turn and freedom as makes it very entertaining to all that love the honor of conversing with her  you must have heard of his known amor with a reputed daughter of the duke of monmouth a lady who has had the honor of pleasing the first and then the greatest elector of the empire he had also an intrigue with the miss of a gentleman of your acquaintance who is since dead the prince had been lost for two or three nights an affair of consequence happning i was upon the necessary hunt to impart it to him and was directed to a little blind lodging in soho where i was told his highness was incognito with phts mistress the woman of the house happned to be of my acquaintance and whilst the prince was rising entertained me below in her parlour with the good fortune and honor she received by his consummating his nuptials at her worthless house i asked her how his quality came to be discovered she conjured me to secresy and told me her hoyness had her self trusted her with it and that she was sure it must be so for she as well as the prince wore the order of the golden fleece about her neck and had promised she should attend her hoyness into germany in quality of first lady of her bedchamber be her lady malborough that she was a vast fortune and one of the coheiresses of the late earl of gainsborough i laughed heartily at the womans relation of the quality of her hoyness and told her as a friend that i doubted she woud not get much honor by keeping such a hoyness in her house that to my knowledge she was no other than a poor pawnbrokers daughter up two pair of stairs in stanhopestreet till pht debauched or at least took her for she had been amongst richs players before since when her mother was removed into leicesterfields and kept a house of fair reception for who pleased to lodge there my good acquaintance who was really an honest woman flew out into extreme bitterness against me how not a princess impossible she came home last night from sitting for her picture dressed like a shepherdess and her fine diamond necklace broke as she was running up stairs and she cried out every diamond was worth above an hundred pound oh it is an inestimable necklace the prince had plundered it from vigo i bid her take care of what she said against the princes honor in that particular twas enough how innocent soever to bring him before the council who sat upon the examination of what was plundered that i was sure he had a soul too great to be guilty of any such thing she still urged the necklace and as matter of fact produced one of the diamonds that had bin found that morning as they cleaned the house i presently saw how it was for indeed she had borrowed it with a crook scrip hat and other shepherds accoutrements from the playhouse this undeceived my friend and made her confess that before she thought her hoyness very wild and very vain and now she found her very bragging that i told her was as natural to her as lying for when pht had her first she past at their lodging for sr guilford medcalfss daughter deceased lord mayor of york and a fortune of twenty thousand pounds that twas usual for her to entertain one man with the account of how many others had caressed her and if by chance she happned into the acquaintance of any woman civiler than her self she would asperse them to her fellows for having debauched and put her to bed to this lord and that duke and of mixing brandy in her wine and intoxicating her so that she did not know what she did oh she will drink like a fish answered the good landlady she had several strong rich waters for her mornings draught has slept her self sober three times in a day in my house and her excuse is that her hoyness is going into a cold country and must use her self to it or else she shall be laughed at where all perpetually drink and never are disordered with it here the prince came to us and i found him a little out of countenance at my seeing him there we went away together i gave him the character of his mistress he confessed he was tired of her vanity and folly and which was worse began to fear some disorder in his health but i fancy it no ill scene to see my friend dismissing her hoyness from her lodging and reproaching her for the scandal she had brought upon her house i have dwelt too long upon these fooleries and yet i took em but as an introduction to a greater what the fortunetelling woman in whitefriars had told the prince of his mistress carrying on the affair he was then going about confirmed him in the opinion that they had a supernatural knowledge though she had failed in that particular of his coming to england again somebody that he was repeating it too told him that there was one mrs mason in whitechappel that was a perfect witch he presently asked em if they had ever seen her they said no nor did not intend it for though the silly vulgar reputed her a witch they did not believe god had given that power to any the prince persuaded two of em to go incognito with him and at least hear what she could say they yielded to oblige him and in a hackney coach to harrowalley away they go the prince was a man that seldom made an appearance as to dress and that day was as plain as possible they came to the blind alley on that side that goes into goodmansfields where they left the coach and walked into the alley till they came to a little alehouse where upon a board it was written that mrs mason the fortune tellers lived there up two pair of stairs they were carried into a dirty dining room enjoining themselves silence least they should be overheard and their own words repeated to em as prophesy after half an hours waiting they were shown into a closet where mrs mason sat to attend em twas so small the prince reposed himself upon a dirty pair of stairs that went up thence into a garret her manner is to ask no questions but taking the persons two hands together looks carefully in em and then falls to telling as fast as she can the past the present and the future this i am sure off she could have no intelligence of who the prince was nor his design for themselves knew it not but just as they went about it after she had dispatched the ladies the prince took the chair and sat before the witch when she had looked into his hands she told him she did not know what to say to him he asked her why she answered because he should be something greater than ever she had seen they laughed at her mistake she proceeded to tell him there was a certain great and very fair lady that would make his fortune if he lived but two years longer and that he should be easy for the rest of his days die old and in his bed but that an eminent danger threatened him either by fire or water in two years the malevolence of his evil destiny would be past that he had already escaped several hazards one with a sword in his thigh another with a shot in his head and once drowning etc the prince in returning from the witch was very melancholy and told the ladies that it was true he had actually received two such wounds pulled back his perriwig and showed where the musketball went into his head and worked out at his neck they laughed at the prediction yet one of em was so far inclined to believe that she resolved to try her again and taking a friend with her that never had heard of mrs mason they changed clothes with their chamber maids and went to her she applied her self to the servants of the mistresses and told em fortunes accordingly and to the lady who had been there before whom she did not know again quite contrary to what she had said when she was there with the prince which inevitably shows us that she has no other inspiration but a random guess which sometimes hits but a thousand times oftener misses unless it were that heaven who takes more than a common care of heros put into this ignorant womans mouth words proper for the subject and by superstition fitting him to believe gave him warning to be wary how for two years he continued to expose himself but love and glory calling him he hearknd not to any presages of his evil destiny though almost a miracle was shown for i reckon it a remote one that mrs mason should happen upon the right places where he was wounded nay though he believed all that she said as he has often assured me and that his blood was adust and melancholy with that belief yet negligent of the warning he had received in hopes of being for ever happy in the arms of his beauteous queen he rushed through clouds of fire and smoke at the siege of barcelona to the fatal assault where he was laid dead by the shot of a thousand muskets and all his hopes of ambition and love buried in that glorious ruin yet shall his memory survive amongst the mourning catalonians who unfeignedly lamented his death it was indeed a blow to charles the third of austria he lost a man of considerable interest in that part of spain and one whom the dowagers favor rendered considerable at court for however all things were managed by the french faction there were several of the grandees continued faithful to the house of austria by the wise management of that charming queen it is only permitted us to guess at the princesss sorrow or rather despair at the death of her hero she who so diligently had loved and caused to be brought to plymouth a little before his departure a present to the value of forty thousand pound in money plate and jewels for his use without doubt she is inconsolable i am sorry for your sake that i have no means of being informed of what so great a queen said and acted at the loss of her lover possibly one day i may oblige you with some particulars if prince henry of hesse darmstadt prince georges brother who went to barcelona with him ever return to england we may hence comfort our selves at our misfortunes when little miseries befall us to think the great and glorious are no more exempt than the meanest mortal human vicissitudes are as natural as to breath and seldom does happiness settle in a point but varying as the compass with only snatches and sudden gusts visits her greatest favorites but by moments whilst miseries slow and solemn take state and where they once appear will not be dispossessed with ease this prince was by nature perfectly great and good he should have wore a crown for an example of generosity and virtue to reigning kings there wanted but six weeks when he was killed of the prediction of two years being elapsed i can dwell no longer on this mournful subject but beg leave to assure you however abruptly i may end that i am most devoutly  madam your most obedient and most humble servant i forgot to tell you mrs mason is very rich but as she had her rise in that dirty alehouse she foresees by her art that the spirit of divination will depart from her when ever she forsakes it so that the inspiration lies in the place etc    letter iv being an account of an amor of a young widow of the town and two gallants mr c of d and mr s j i have no entertainment for you dear sir james that can quit the trouble of reading my letters were they properly my own therefore i seek supply from a richer fountain rather than leave you undiverted the fair little widow that could charm you in her cypress a dress ominous to a lover less daring has showed us that she was to be taken though not by your battery for yours was not the murdering cannon that nowadays does all the execution vows and oaths going for little the powerfullst god is glittering gold which our friend mr cvery well understands and therefore applied himself that way to our widow and by whispering false hopes to the governor got possession of the town as i understand the story he had given in to her proposals money to carry on her lawsuit but whether her charms did not answer his expectations or that he be of sir charles sidleys opinion in his bellamira that it is no sin to cousin them that cousin the world he did not fail to baulk the ladys expectations and heroically to stand the brunt of an amorous dun the letters happening by a secret way to fall into my hands i have transcribed em for you to read in your limetreewalk when you are barren of a better entertainment i can assure you that they are matter of fact and literally true  her first letter to mr c to desire the loan of some money on the promise of which he had been happy in your arms i forgot all my misfortunes and the business of our acquaintance but am awaked by approaching ruin from that pleasing dream my lawyer is such an infidel that nothing but miracles can convince him and money is such to me at this time in short i lose the term without it and have no prospect but starving out the rest of my life after the writ is ready all but sealing yet he will not suffer it to be done till his bill be discharged think if i am worth that generosity and spare me the confusion of speaking which it is much easier for me to want than do if i pass wednesday morning the whole term is lost to me and i may then be counted amongst those things that were and are no more   mr c loved his money too well to admit of either compassion for the fair or justice to his own promise he thought fit to leave this letter unanswered but over a glass of wine when the linen was taken away after dinner at mr s js house he did not fail to divert him with the adventure showed him the letter and ingeniously prided himself in deceiving her mr s j asked him if he would not take it ill if he endeavored to succeed him in the ladys favor mr c gave him liberty of conscience to say and write what he thought fit by this means the widow became acquainted with her misfortune and how cruelly mr c had exposed her and her letter she thereupon thought fit to send him this second epistle with an intent to have made him ashamed of his telling her secret  her second letter to the same to thank him for a bill of two hundred pounds but sent by another you have found the handsomest way in the world to oblige me for however you disguised the hand the directions that came to me this morning by the penypost with a bankbill of two hundred guineas must come from you for i had asked nor obliged no body else or re mr s j was not so gallant if you did not oblige me your self i desire you will ask him if he did but why should i be so vain to think of a person that had not received the least civility from me no it must be you and i am all on fire to thank you in the best manner it has i hope saved my cause i am sure paid my lawyers and may give me four hundred pound a year judge then of the obligation i have to you if ever i live to recover my estate you shall certainly be paid in kind for that is the least i can do to my benefactor in the mean time send me word when we shall meet at mrs ts it is a long while methinks since sunday night i shall now see you with double pleasure that is to say with gratitude as well as love   his letter to the fair widow assuring her he sent her no bill nor ever was so expensive in his pleasures had not my hopes of being my own ambassador rather than this paper made me defer it from hour to hour i had ere now madam congratulated with you upon the unusual goodness of the world and at the same time approved my self not so vain as to accept of praises not at all my due i am by nature a sceptick and doubtful of all things past and to come and therefore should have been as uncertain in this as all other things but naming the sum i quickly found it cannot be i who have not the tenth part of that to spare nor would the indies supply me if the mite i offer to every inclination were of such a piece of paper how extraordinary a thing is it to receive unknown obligations in this world therefore sure it cannot be but the magnificent will follow the present and some rich sultan banker has declared you his favorite and espoused you his sultana and methinks i see you already triumphant in the midst of your slaves where the most unworthy is even my envy so far does love exceed all else in dignity as well as power that whilst the greatest monarchs most favorite slaves look vile to every impartial eye the chains of love add honor to all that wear em therefore i make it my petition and it is all my ambition to bear a link or two of your chains amongst the many for though there may be more deserving there can be none more faithful   her third letter a banter upon mr c for his exposing her necessities this is prodigious modesty in you to deny all pretense to an obligation which i am convinced if not immediately yet collaterally proceeds from you nor let me forget to congratulate that unbounded inclination of yours to which i owe such substantial joys as are beyond the power of fate to recall and which you all sceptick as you are cannot so far overact your part as to doubt of what you have felt is past nay the present things are beyond dispute for when with extreme gratitude and honor you had to your friends condold the incapacity of that little indies of yours which had been so profusely lavisht to every inclination that scarce the tenth part remained to oblige a fond young believing undone woman who had thrown her self upon your generosity trusting to your promises and offers the rumor caught from your kind aloud complaining voice run from one to another where you had taken care to spread it till at length it rested in the breast of an old magnifico whose heart is large as his possessions though his years exceeding both he first appeared to me in the shape of a bankbill and as you guessed quickly after in his own you may imagine prepossessed as my heart was with your faithful image which was the most welcome though from him i received the obligation yet to you i owe it since had you not though your self unable to relieve with small seven thousand pound a year complained to others of my wants i still had been a silent sufferer how worthily can i think you my noble benefactor how enough to the world shall i proclaim your generosity and honor how reward so magnificent a bounty what vandike shall i employ to tell with his admirable pencil succeeding ages how generous you how grateful i let me high on a throne be drawn with all that glittering wealth about me you have so well described whilst you raised equal to me in vanity in pride and pleasures free from the least link of that chain you speak of shall employ all my thoughts with eyes languishing and hands pointing to that shining store about us shall seem to say all this i owe to you for had you not in kind compassion told my secret i had not thus been blessed fame honor discretion secrecy and a thousand other ridiculous virtues shall disappear before us luxurious love shall tell all our hours to us whilst in pleasure our five senses shall be improved to fifty thus may you ever flourish thus ever live and your years prove immortal as your merits   thus my dear baronet have i endeavored to divert you with two letters that are i am sure in their kinds originals i will leave you to make what reflections you please upon the wit and sincerity of either the last admits of no dispute in me when it pretends to the title of sir  your most faithful and most humble servant  letter v from a lady to a lady being an account of her own adventures and loss of her lovers yes my dear my evervalud friend you shall here know all that my poor tortured soul has suffered in these long cruel three years separation have i one spark of joy remaining in my soul your letter brought it forth and though dead to hope and lost to happiness or even wish of happiness i find still a pleasure in being esteemed by you oh clorinda in other loves there is no constancy even friendship to me is but insipid fit only to amuse a soul unfeeling a more exalted heat had our sex been different i fear my dear by this we had forgot to love or perhaps have learnt to hate though that is a passion so foreign to my mind that as yet i am ignorant of what it means my soul rebounds not at an injury engrossed by softer passions it has no room to entertain so rough a guest  you ask me the meaning of that melancholy strain that runs through all my letters and conjure me to explain my self with friendship you well remember me that when we parted i was envied by most and by all thought happy it is true i had not suffered shipwreck then but since oh what have i not endured will you have patience to hear a three years anguish it is all dark a melancholy gloom my gayer genius is fled and lost in its shades i am the reverse of what i was no more the pleasure of the world the delight of conversation no more beloved yet still loving is there a misery beyond this is there a rack in nature i have not felt may i not well complain but to give you in particular my misfortunes you left me in the possession of a heart worthy mine but the world and interest divided us an eminent lawsuit ruined my lovers fortune in which part of mine was involved and left him no hopes of repairing it but by a wife more rich than i could be the coming term was to take him in execution for a sum too mighty for him to struggle with this was kept a secret from me for fear of my disquiets at length finding him excessive melancholy and dejected beyond what i could ever have suspected from his fortitude of soul he told me his misfortunes that he was undone but his own sorrows were inconsiderable to him in comparison of mine he was indeed by promise by vows and inclination my husband but should i call him to the performance we both were lost and must expect to languish out the rest of his life in prison oppressed with misery and wants that such a lady had been offered him for a wife considerable in her fortune and so destitute of charms that it could not give me the least suspicion that inconstancy had any part in what was his only refuge the last plak that could preserve him from shipwreck i took time to weigh and examine the truth of what he said but was soon convinced of his ill circumstances and could not suffer my heart to hesitate a moment on what it should do to save him the thoughts were death to me that for my sake he should live poor contemned and wretched i concluded that though like other men he might prove ungrateful twas a more tolerable evil than having him through my means unfortunate let all who have not generous souls as i suppose they will condemn me for what they may call weakness but sure clorinda does better know how to value so unpresidented a sacrifice i gave up all my happiness to his interest and by permission saw him three weeks after married indeed misfortunes in prospect are only guessed at they are not to be described till felt though i had prepared my self for all that could be expected of sufferings yet when once i began to feel the real load i sunk under em since he was safe and happy no matter what became of me neither honor nor policy would permit his visits for his engagements with me had been no secret his lady would soon have heard of em and consequently have had her own and his pleasure poisoned that way besides i was resolved to put an end to a flame that could not now burn with innocence i gave my self up to the diversions of the world visits cards plays all that ought to divert the mind  my love was to suffer a violent death since it would not resign to a natural but in vain it withstood the essorts of reason diversions duty it mocked all my endeavors and augmenting by resistance threw me into a violent illness out of which i did not but after much danger recover the pain was at my heart which the physicians had no cure for then it was my clorinda that with the rest of the world you heard the report of my death and truly i was so near it that it was the work of ten months before i could stand alone or under my own hand give you to know i was not yet so happy as to be nothing they removed me into the country to try their last experiment the change of air by the time of my return back to london almost two years had passed since that fatal marriage my heart still engaged still tortured by a love which i could not persuade my self to be criminal because i once had a right and title to his love though when i considered my self had released all pretenses i doubly blamed my heart for persevering but love is a power too mighty for us to control i saw my murderer and my old wounds bleed afresh at the fatal sight he complained of his own want of happiness and secretly pleased my heart by finding if his grief were less his satisfaction was not more how insignificant a relief is this how is it that a power so mighty as love can be served and find its account in trifles he complained that marriage had not answered his end for though it saved him from impending ruin in his lawsuit and discharged his execution yet many other of his debts being unpaid gave him much uneasiness that his lady like a right widow had secured the greatest part of her fortune to her own use their humors were extremely different and he had little hopes of prevailing on hers because he wanted the first principles that should give his their agrecable motion she loved flattery as most ladies do and he was not master of it he had almost said of kindness too in short he was too dangerous for my conversation his eyes had still the same beauty his words their usual softness and i think a certain melancholy air heightened all his charms should i dwell on every circumstance the conversation must tire you in a word i tore my self from these enchantments and forbid my heart such criminal delights yet my torment pursued me wheresoever i fled i had once more recourse to the country and went by recommendation to board in bristol at a gentlemans house who with his family were all strangers to me a chronick distemper which my melancholy had contracted could only expect its cure from change of air the family i was received into consisted of an old wellnaturd gentleman governed by his spleenetick wife who had as much cunning as nature alone could give her and had her education been good her wit might have been more considerable they had formerly merchandizd but being pretty easy in the world had lately left off a brother of hers lived in the family who had been bred up with them in their way he appeared to me as a person well made and handsome but perfectly unfashiond having had no conversation but business who declined womens company and rarely ever spoke among the men he seldom  at home and i believe i was near seven months in the house with him before we had any conversation though you know me easy of access and pleased with company my business was to sck diversion which my ill health had made perfectly necessary to me an ugly unmarried maid of thirty a sister of theirs brought up the rear of this goodly family and here in reading and conversing with some of the town who visited mrs woudbe which you must know is my landladys name i passed a considerable time the poison still at my heart daily wasting by a consuming hopeless fire what would i not have done for my cure how was i alone of all human kind plagnd with a never dying passion i had read indeed that inconstancy was counted the greatest weakness of the weakest sex but here i imagined it would have been meritorious for there can be no appeal from marriage that certainly ought to destroy all precedent inclinations and they must be unpardonable who preserve theirs after it  at length another brother the squire of mrs woudbes family came upon a visit to bristol he dressed at the ladies had seen some of the world was half bred as to gallantry and about that pitch in understanding but good natured and a very honest gentleman what his brother wanted in tongue he supplied and twas not his fault if conversation languishd his kind endeavors would relieve it though sometimes at the expense of his reputation as to wit for it is very hard for great talkers always to escape impertinence mr peregrine worthy was his name he quickly told me that his heart had been mortgaged above these two years to a young lady passionately fond of him but he was one whom her father would not permit her to marry because his estate did not answer the fortune he could give her he was not so young as his brother by six years nor so well shaped but much more polished and it came into my head by a malicious diversion to make him in love with me notwithstanding his engagement it seemed erable that any other woman should be qui possessor of the heart she loved whilst i was so unhappy to be deprived of what i had adored the general ill opinion i had of all mens constancy made me conclude i should have no great trouble in conquering peregrines i looked not at the consequence nor had debated with my self what to do with that toy his heart or that lumber his person were they once made an offering to me what i wanted was present amusement for as poisons are said to expel poisons i would with all my heart have loved any thing to put out of my mind the phantom that haunted me but this was not the diamond that was to cut mine for though we entered into a commerce of gallantry and after his departure writ letters as mutually tender as if we had been really touched i suppose we both remained unwounded by each other all i know of my side is that my former passion found not the least abatement and therefore it is easy to conclude a new one did not succeed at length young worthy fell so ill that his life was for some time in danger mrs woudbe had business called her to london after she was gone i debated with my self whether i should be so illnatured to let a brother of the family where i was die and never give him a visit i knew he did not love company and least of all ladies but my good manners and good nature overruling i resolved to do my duty though it should prove unacceptable i came to his bedside and had a much civiller reception than i expected the height of his distemper as i then supposed had mastered his native roughness i found him in a violent fever and having too lately had an expensive experience of what physicians could do i was able to advise him in many things proper for the recovery of his health had mrs woudbe been there i should not have attempted it for she has that quality peculiar to her self to believe none besides her self knowing in any thing and that she is ignorant of nothing mrs abigal the surly her sister of thirty dull and heavy in make as well as understanding was his chief nurse i had compassion for him in the ill hands he was in and therefore failed not to be often with him which he seemed to receive very civilly his fever abated but his temper being melancholy the distemper had so seized his spirits that i found it must be a powerful diversion of the mind that could be able to throw it thence but whence it should proceed i could not guess to a man wholly free from vice or passions i found his understanding very good what he did speak proper and well imagined and i doubted not but he would show us he had wit enough could he once dispense with custom and modesty that had hitherto kept him silent we read to him books of wit and gallantry i found he had a true taste of things and could commend in the right place thus a sort of satisfaction succeeded compassion and i felt my self better pleased in his company than i imagined i could have been we grew acquainted his conversation became free and genteel we chanced to talk of love he protested he never knew what the least spark of it meant and my judgment was he never would not considering that nature makes nothing in vain however a defect of constitution might happen i talked of the language of the eyes he innocently protested he knew not what i meant by that neither could he imagine nay was more and more confounded when i told him lovers eyes could talk he assured me he never minded the difference of glances he thought all eyes had the same looks though not the same color this was wonderful i thought from one who had himself the finest i ever saw and a very bad encouragement for me if i had had the least design upon his heart though in jest as before with his brother he liked my company or my library or both so well that after he was up and dressed he never was from us i suited him with the gay part of reading being properest to remove his melancholy we chanced one day to light upon browns translation of fontenels and aristaenetuss letters he seemed mightily pleased with em there was one from a lady who permits a lover all but the last favor and gives him leave to touch her breast to kiss her eyes her mouth and squeeze her with her stays off he could not imagine what pleasure could be taken in that not long after we were returning with mistress abigal late from a visit out of town where we had been merrily entertained and had all three contrary to custom drank enough to elevate us bacchus is counted a friend to love after putting me into the coach young worthy staid not for compliments with mrs abigal but threw himself with a gaiety wholly new to him on the seat by me twas dark and though the surly maid was our opposite in the humor we were all in it passed for raillery he pretended to make the ladys experiment of squeezing since he found i had only a morningwastcoat on thence he attempted to kiss my cheek then my lips and if i am not mistaken could no longer wonder where the pleasure was of that after we came home we continued the frolic sitting upon mrs abigals bed he sighed after every kiss no ill omen of a heart touched with pleasure i may truly protest to you that for nine successive years that i had been tormented with an unintermitting passion this was the only moment that i first found it suspended i confess i was then lost to any thoughts but the present there his eyes first gave and knew the distinction of looks he could no longer boast of ignorance they had a softness wholly new so full of sparkling fire so tender nay so passionate that i catched the distemper into mine and looked on his with an uncommon pleasure you may perhaps too nicely blame me for giving into those delights but i was suddenly betrayed by one from whom i never expected any danger and therefore could not arm my self against it i was also charmed with thinking my self the first that gave him wishes that gave him desire and joy that heart that formerly insensible heart seemed no longer so to me i was pleased to encourage a pleasure that destroyed my former pain and i found young worthy had in an hour done more toward my cure than all my own whole two years endeavor mrs abigal thought our conversation something too tender the wine working out in ill nature with her as in kindness with us she was impertinent enough to have offended us had she been worth it after this when he found me alone he would sometimes pretend to the pleasure of a kiss but never declared himself so that i believed my self mistaken when i reckoned upon my conquest he took occasion to be always with me we read we walked we eat together but still not a word of love he became unimaginably improved like cymon for iphigenia in the fable he dressed he discoursed he no longer avoided the ladies company all the world wondered at the change he became genteel as any body and appeared with as good an air i told you at first that he was perfectly wellshapd to me they attributed these improvements calling him my scholar my pain was inverted from london to the country i would have given all the world to hear his mouth confirm what his eyes so often told me what laws what manners what customs have our sex how must we be tantalizd how tortured why was it not permitted to search his heart why not to ask him if yet he knew whether there was a deity called love our perpetual opportunities our long converse might have well excused it but modesty overruled even curiosity and vanity i was forced to suffer in uncertainty and silence thus a whole year run on since that moment he first began to make an impression upon my heart at length amidst the pleasing liberty of unnumberd kisses he brought out with doubting modesty that transporting word i love you i could have swore that till that minute i never knew what joy what pleasure was i could not stay for reflection i could not speak i more than spoke i hugged him in an extatick manner more charming more intelligible than a thousand words you have known my dear clorinda the force of love wonder not then that thus in me he exerted his tyrannick sway or think the person i have described because lower than my self in rank unworthy of my heart his was by inclination noble and dryden who so well knew the passions tells us love either finds equality or makes it like death he knows no difference in degrees but plains and levels all after that he would perhaps have no longer scrupled to speak his passion but our opportunities of being alone were few what was now no secret to me was long since by his actions suspected by the family mrs woudbe and mrs abigal were our perpetual companions nay we had an additional spy a friend of mrs woudbes that was received there upon some misfortunes of her husband this was a damsel that pretended to airs and charms would ogle my lover and whether by their desires or her own inclinations attempted to have made a diversion of his kindness she offered at so many advances that my jealous eyes called em unpardonable however her charms were no way dangerous and i believe i need have given my self no pain that way this creature won upon my easy nature by her assiduities and she used often to rally at mrs woudbes fears for her brother thus were we interrupted in the full course of our amor and twas impossible to speak without being overheard one or both of the sisters were perpetually upon the hearken it was not so when any other company was with me for i had a ridiculous pretender or two out of the town which had not my heart been engaged might perhaps have served me to laugh at but i was ever uneasy as well as worthy out of each others company and though we could only steal a glance or sometimes the touch of the hand fancy improved our pleasures and made them greater than any other satisfaction out of our selves my first fires were in their full force the object only changed by an invisible transmutation i loved to the height of all my former disorder but it was with a more pleasing pain a secret satisfaction in having made a conquest over that hitherto inexorable virgin heart  i conceive their fears were least young worthy should marry me i was a widow with an encumbered jointure and his affairs required a wife with a fortune in ready money however our intelligence had proceeded no farther than the word love and it seems to me that he had not formed no more than my self any designs toward the possession of what he loved  mrs woudbe and mrs marwoud the name of the other lady were invited to an entertaniment in the town that was like to hold till late mrs abigal was diverted another way so that i was left alone the old husband being abroad upon his occasions young worthy ignorant of their designs for they kept it from us was likewise from home the weather was hot i undrest my self to a loose nightgown and marseilles petticoat and laid me down after dinner upon the bed to sleep young worthy returned by instinct or the whispers of his good genius as he calls it and hearing all were gone out came as usual to my chamber i cast my eyes to the door as it opened and saw him with so elevated a joy that scarce gave him time to shut it after him for running to me as i lay he threw himself upon my mouth and eyes and so transportedly kissed me that i could no longer doubt but his modesty was giving place to his desires when hearing some body come up the stairs which answered exactly to my chamber i broke from his arms and opening the door was ready to swoon at the sight of mrs woudbe returned weary ill or pretendedly so she would have gone in but i shut it after me and directed her into the dining room she asked me who i had with me i told her in utmost confusion a gentleman she said why dont you then madam go to him so i must answered i and returning shut the door after me but the key was left on the outside young worthy saw my disorder and the guilty air which yet i could not recover i told him though we were never so innocent all appearances were against us my undress the dishabilie of the bed the door shut upon us and my refusal to let her enter so that happen what would for his sake i was resolved his sister should not see him who most diligently kept centry in the dining room to watch who should come out i ran the hazard and scandal of being suspected with any other rather than being confirmed with him she goes down to the servants to enquire who was with me they tell her none but her brother who was come in two moments before her she returned again to her post in the dining room having not so far lost her respect to attempt my chamber door though as i told you the key was on the outside i i was at my wits end for invention and would have him get out of my dressingroomwindow upon the leads that answered to a window in another part of the house and which by chance was then open from whence he might descend the back stairs and possibly get off unseen he objected some men that were working in the next neighbors yard i told him in a case like that something must be hazarded and therefore removing with expedition the glass and toylet that was spread upon a table under that window he shot in a moment from one to the other and good fortune favoring him got down the stairs and through the house without any of their people seeing him this was a lucky conveyance successful legerdemain and i recovering my fright could not chose but laugh at the sick lady upon duty she stirred not from her post i wonder how her patience could hold from interrupting us till after three hours i calling for candles she asked the servant who brought em who was with me and she answering no body you must imagine what she could think she had set one centry at the street door which how they escaped seeing worthy go out i cannot imagine her self had been upon the watch above i had told her there was a gentleman in the chamber with me one maid says it is her brother and soon after another tells her there was no body there my apparent confusion and dishabily all these were what confounded even her cunning i believe till that minute she suspected not that her brother had discovered to me his love but the appearances were now strong and she imagined us to be really criminal why should i of a sudden be so undrest why shut up alone with her brother where she was refused entrance why so confused these were indeed circumstantial evidences but what could i have said had she entered and found us as at first it would have certainly condemned us and getting him off so was all that was left for us to do as making the best of a bad market twas at worst a moot point whether he was with me or no politic mrs woudbe said nothing to her brother or me but kept close as well as abigal to their watch we had not time to speak together for above a week after one night he put a paper into my hand which i have transcribed because your curiosity may be obliged by reading a first loveletter without art or ornament the effects only of what that passion could dictate for it seemed to me twas to get the better of his modesty that could not had we had opportunity so freely permit him to explain himself  the first letter expressing the desire of a young lover under constraint tell me my dear inspiring mistress how shall i express the tender passion of my love instruct your willing scholar and give directions by what means i may obtain an uncontrolled access to your dear person without the apprehension of disspiriting fear the geniuss that haunt your chamber prevent the pleasure of your private conversation and puts me into insupportable pain to suppress the appearance of the glowing flames of love raging in my breast  if you would preserve my life you must suddenly find out some way how uninterrupted i may freely taste the sweets of love it is not in the power of humane nature unprovd to conceive the inestimable pleasures of powerful love a pleasure so great and so transporting that it is inexpressible my thoughts too eagerly press upon one another and strive which shall tell you first how much i love to describe your bright charms is too great an attempt for my weak genius i dare only say i feel the effect in extacy and rapture i doubt not but your goodness will excuse and pardon all defects of nature especially when you have my heart a sacrifice for all  oh inconstancy but why that thought what need have i to fear have not i received marks of special favor but it is a woman yet the best of all her sex all truth and goodness ay but humane nature in all things loves change the highest tides produce the lowest ebbs remember fair one who taught me first to love who brought me into this labyrinth will you now desert me will you now leave me to be lost inevitably tell me truly or if i am lost tell me not at all i am past recovery it is not in the power of time the coolest thoughts of reason nothing less than death can unfix my love grounded upon so firm an esteem rivetted immovable within my heart i faint  give me life let me live and live to love you   to tell you the pleasure this letter gave me would too much confirm you in the opinion of my weakness the next day being sunday mrs marwoud went with me to church as i was kneeling i could not forbear taking out the paper to read it i thought her at her devotions and never minded her squint over my shoulders whence she gained the first part of the letter which confirmed her opinion from the sight of the character whence it came my lover for a night or two after staid in my chamber later by half an hour than the rest the door was open and we could not speak so low but we were overheard those precious moments those delightful embraces those piercing kisses never to be recalled all was at the mercy of mrs woudbe who by harkening gave her self a confirmation to her fears and the second night met him at his own chamber door as he came from me with millions of reproaches i knew nothing of what was past till the next night he put this second letter into my hand  the second letter excusing himself from being any more alone it is impossible to express the concern with which i write to you upon this unpleasant subject we were overheard if not seen last night by my married sister she received me at the head of the stairs shut my chamber door and began to open  i was not so much surprised as i thought i should have bin upon such an occasion she said she could not believe what she had been told had not her own ears convinced her as to the truth of it she recounted to me many particular passages especially that when you in so much confusion thrust her out of the room when you had only a nightgown on and i in the chamber with you  i answered that she had given her self a great deal of trouble to little purpose i did not suppose but she would a truer opinion of both that indeed i liked to be with you because you were improving and delightful company but no further and that a ealous listner hearing imperfectly some words and not others turned all to the subject they were apprehensive of or suspected if the talk was never so remote nothing more uncertain when the sound of words cannot be distinguished i urged my own innocence so we parted and appeased her pretty well upon the promise never to be alone with you again since it gave her so much uneasiness lest you should be ignorant of what has past i thought it proper this way to acquaint you with it that you might not judge untruly of my neglect the hazard is at present too great for me to break my promise therefore if you have and i cannot think otherwise a real value for me you will not desire it believe me i shall ever have a sincere love and esteem for you who are the same or more to me than ever tell me your thoughts in a letter and suddenly for i am impatient till i hear from you   pride and indignation seized me at the reading of this in a style so different from the former what his dependence upon his sister in point of interest was i could not tell but i thought be it never so great he made too large a sacrifice to it and such as love could never forgive him that i was discovered and my honor wrongfully suspected was not half my concern though that must needs sensibly affect a soul haughty like mine and who would rather meet death than shame i gave him my answer next morning wherein i complained of the weakness of that love which could not stand one assault the rest you may conclude by his reply  the third leter in vindication of his doubted love what have i wrote that you interpret so much to my disadvantage i am surprised at your answer you take my meaning quite contrary to my intentions dont believe i can renounce and forsake you in whom i have first my chiefest happiness i cannot express the tenderness of my affection for you believe me you shall never find the fervency of my love turned into coolness or my sincerity into flattery nor my soul guilty of any ingratitude if you have any love for me dont perplex you self for that gives me great uneasiness nor imagin i can have one unkind thought for you i love you most dearly well indeed time will produce it and convince you of the truth of all i say when opporunity permits me to show how much how unalterably i am yours   i should not have given you these letters at ength but only to beg your judgment of my lovers sincerity he was some time before this about departing from us upon his own business with stupid mrs abigal for his housekeeper i conceive mrs woudbe was of use to him she governing her husband in point of stock or partnership that made him so cautious of disobliging her she closeted him the next day employing three hours in railing at me with the most prodigious absurd abuses that envy or malice or the devil himself could invent who does not know the power of an ill tongue upon weak minds he ought to have considered it that interest and revenge dictated to them and have with fortitude and justice withstood any impression they would have made upon him i believe indeed he was proof to a great part of it till industriously mrs marwoud owing me a good turn for preventing her a conquest she had a desire to told him i was a lady only seeking my diversions and in whom vanity so much prevailed as to expose his letter to her and then repeated part of what she had cunningly read over my shoulder he persisted in his denial that he had never writ to me any but when next we met i found his eyes declined me and no longer animated by those bewitching softning glances that sweetened all the cruelties of fortune and which love of me first taught i pursued em but they were lost to me i found time to ask the cause of the change he answered i had exposed his letter twas what he could not account to himself for and therefore must begin to practice a difficult care upon his heart since i did but laugh at him i had not leisure to answer but upon paper endeavored to convince him how the matter happened this gave me more pain than i can express if they could succeed in such common arts of making a misunderstanding between us twas in vain for me to expect the prospect of any happiness i suffered more real anguish by his false displeasure than i can describe my letter wrought so far upon him that at the next meeting i found the kindling fire returning to his eyes and when upon the first opportunity he caught me in his arms to kiss me i felt the same ease the same release from pain as a writch took from the rack or from that more exquisite torture the rack of nature the ease a woman feels released from motherpains he said he had in vain strove for his cure the more he strove the harder it was to conquer but my clorinda i found how dear i was like to pay for that letter which had so transported me oh why must the extremity of pleasure produce the extremity of pain i found his mind daily shaken even from its foundation he never would believe but that i had exposed his letter and all that could be said was that he endeavored to forgive it me but twas a weakness he did not think i could have been guilty of and if on the side of love i lost no ground with him i suffered much and wrongfully in his esteem besides the pain i had been in taught him the power he had over me and which upon all occasions he too much exerted perplexing me as he pleased taking delight in the alternate pains and pleasure that  could raise in me and which i cannot forgive him for this was all done by snatches for since the first discovery i never had so much as one quarter of an hours time to talk the matter over with him thus stands the present state of our amor he is gone to his own house distant from ours these three long tedious days and nights i have lived and lived without one sight of him tell me sincerely my clorinda thou infallible judge of hearts what do thou believe of his could i but find my self in earnest slighted pride and disdain in my haughty soul must cure me for though i so long against my will persisted constant to my first engagements it was because our separation was the work of cruel fortune in which unkindness had not any part twill be vain to expect my cure from reason for that points to mutual love as the greatest good i am not my clorinda born to happiness when young betrayed and married where i could never affect you know the next how my first dear inclinations were crossed see if i have any better hopes of this fortune cruelly is against me i cannot hope not to be happy oh restore me then by your wise counsels to that blessed state of indifferency extinguish in me if it be possible these eternal sparks of love or teach me to transfer it to a brighter a more worthy object improve this humane to a love divine let me there only fix my eternal hopes of unfading joys of pleasures unknowing a decay where without reproach it will be meritorious to excel in fondness there only where excess of passion gives without remorse excess of pleasure free from those allays attending transitory joys oh aid me here to fix my hopes my happiness without end and without change as i am yours  letter vii a renunciation of chemistry it is to me since my late reflections and self discourses a plain illusion of some evil spirit that any body of sense believes in chemistry nor can i otherwise imagine how your scrub should be yet venerable i am heartily glad i am cured of all those hopes and prefer jealousy of my mistress to the torment of a philosophic doubt and think that a less fantastic affliction than this how can you let scrub still mislead you how can the devil delude in his own shape if i come to town time enough and may be admitted of your politic council we will contrive a part in a play for roxana were she drawn affecting and unfit for those very airs she would be thought in reallity to have it would methinks be miraculously surprising to turn all her natural faults to stupid deformities and make the awkard woman a skilful actress i long to see dr garths nine days wonder of that date i think you say was the edition you tell me you long to see what i have done when you do you will find it like all other strong desires end in disappointment for there is neither love gallantry or poetry in it but what to me surpasses at present the charms of em all downright religion which all you wits laugh at but indeed laugh at for want of reflection for if you would allow it your consideration you would all be votaries it has so much of your only good pleasure i assure you i am going to my prayers which profusion of delight is embittered only by the thought that you and all my friends will not share in it  letter viii a letter of friendship the first visit i should have made in town had been to you but that i have some vexations to remove before i can be at rest and liberty besides mrs ps now my greatest terror has prevented my venturing to you be pleased to send me a billet wherein i may know i am in your favor and that you will assist me with your usual seasonable and habile friendship on this occasion and you will extremely oblige  madam your most obedient servant r stle  letter ix consisting of various heads dear madam yours of saturday night i just now received and am obliged to you for your condolance of my lost mistress but you make up the misfortune on the account of your recovery tho you tell me my other is also vanished it is very generous of the princess to forgive me so far as to send me her service as much roxana as she is on the stage she is statira elsewhere i would methinks write panegyric on so great an heroine as a woman that can forgive an injury an injury done to her beauty be pleased madam to preserve yours with your health and stay as long as you can before you are immortal which your genius has ensurd you i heartily pray for you and have while i invoke your happiness a reason for devotion out of which you cannot rally me i am  madam your most obedient and most humble servant r stle i shall be relieved here i think to morrow and be commanded to greenwich    letter x a congratulation on the increase of the ladys riches it is an hour i would say an age since my last to you and i find that joy has something in it as troublesome as grief can bring your accession of wealth you will be apt to think the occasion of my repeated impertinence it is methinks an injury to me that you are so rich since your fortune may lessen the sincerity of my professing an admiration for you but madam a truth in the search of nature could be found only by your industry who are your self the best pattern of what she can do all i can say to you is may you ever live in the till now imagined riches of chemistry and adorned with all the panegyric of poetry if any thing in the latter can add to the author of so excellent pieces as your own nothing but the news in yours could inspire me to so much calmness of mind as to be able to tell you i am  madam your most obedient humble servant r stle  letter xi an answer to a lady that had desired to make him a visit in the country fate would have exerted its utmost severity had it loaded me with your unkindness after a misfortune which nothing but that can equal i mean the death of an uncle who was to me instead of a father i have been with him during part of his illness and staid to see him interred which was the occasion of my having but just now found your letter in which i can never sufficiently admire the generosity of your temper who though you had seemingly a real cause to be angry could yet bestow new favors when the balance was already so much on your side i could with transport accept the offer you make were it not for some relations we have with us and some other reasons i could tell you which make it at present not so convenient but will i hope shortly be otherwise though my absence prevented me from hearing of you it should not however have made me thus forgetful of writing had my thoughts not been disturbed with so sad an object as rendered them unfit for love and you who producing only the most pleasing ideas should halcyonlike
