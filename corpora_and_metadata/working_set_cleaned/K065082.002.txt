deplorable reigns of valerian and gallienus the empire was oppressed and almost destroyed by the soldiers the tyrants and the barbarians it was saved by a series of great princes who derived their obscure origin from the martial provinces of illyricum within a period of about thirty years claudius aurelian probus diocletian and his colleagues triumphed over the foreign and domestic enemies of the state reestablished with the military discipline the strength of the frontiers and deserved the glorious title of restorers of the roman world  the removal of an effeminate tyrant made way for a succession of heroes the indignation of the people imputed all their calamities to gallienus aureolus invades italy is defeated and besieged at milan and the far greater part were indeed the consequence of his dissolute manners and careless administration he was even destitute of a sense of honor which so frequently supplies the absence of public virtue and as long as he was permitted to enjoy the possession of italy a victory of the barbarians the loss of a province or the rebellion of a general seldom disturbed the tranquil course of his pleasures at length a considerable army stationed on the upper danube a d     invested with the imperial purple their leader aureolus who disdaining a confined and barren reign over the mountains of rhaetia passed the alps occupied milan threatened rome and challenged gallienus to dispute in the field the sovereignty of italy the emperor provoked by the insult and alarmed by the instant danger suddenly exerted that latent vigor which sometimes broke through the indolence of his temper forcing himself from the luxury of the palace he appeared in arms at the head of his legions and advanced beyond the po to encounter his competitor the corrupted name of pontirolo pons aureoli thirteen miles from bergamo and thirtytwo from milan see cluver italia antiq tom i p     near this place in the year   0  the obstinate battle of cassano was fought between the french and austrians the excellent relation of the chevalier de folard who was present gives a very distinct idea of the ground see polybe de folard tom iii p          still preserves the memory of a bridge over the adda which during the action must have proved an object of the utmost importance to both armies the rhaetian usurper after receiving a total defeat and a dangerous wound retired into milan the siege of that great city was immediately formed the walls were battered with every engine in use among the ancients and aureolus doubtful of his internal strength and hopeless of foreign succors already anticipated the fatal consequences of unsuccessful rebellion  his last resource was an attempt to seduce the loyalty of the besiegers he scattered libels through their camp inviting the troops to desert an unworthy master who sacrificed the public happiness to his luxury and the lives of his most valuable subjects to the slightest suspicions the arts of aureolus diffused fears and discontent among the principal officers of his rival a conspiracy was formed by heraclianus the praetorian prefect by marcian a general of rank and reputation and by cecrops who commanded a numerous body of dalmatian guards the death of gallienus was resolved and notwithstanding their desire of first terminating the siege of milan the extreme danger which accompanied every moments delay obliged them to hasten the execution of their daring purpose at a late hour of the night but while the emperor still protracted the pleasures of the table an alarm was suddenly given that aureolus at the head of all his forces had made a desperate sally from the town gallienus who was never deficient in personal bravery started from his silken couch and without allowing himself time either to put on his armor or to assemble his guards he mounted on horseback and rode full speed toward the supposed place of the attack encompassed by his declared or concealed enemies he soon amidst the nocturnal tumult received a mortal dart from an uncertain hand before he expired a patriotic a d     march  0 death of gallienus sentiment rising in the mind of gallienus induced him to name a deserving successor and it was his last request that the imperial ornaments should be delivered to claudius who then commanded a detached army in the neighborhood of pavia the report at least was diligently propagated and the order cheerfully obeyed by the conspirators who had already agreed to place claudius on the throne on the first news of the emperors death the troops expressed some suspicion and resentment till the one was removed and the other assuaged by a donative of twenty pieces of gold to each soldier they then ratified the election and acknowledged the merit of their new sovereign on the death of gallienus see trebellius pollio in hist august p     zosimus l i p    zonaras l xii p     eutrop ix    aurelius victor in epitom victor in caesar i have compared and blended them all but have chiefly followed aurelius victor who seems to have had the best memoirs   the obscurity which covered the origin of character and elevation of the emperor claudius claudius though it was afterward embellished by some flattering fictions some supposed him oddly enough to be a bastard of the younger gordian others took advantage of the province of dardania to deduce his origin from dardanus and the ancient kings of troy  sufficiently betrays the meanness of his birth we can only discover that he was a native of one of the provinces bordering on the danube that his youth was spent in arms and that his modest valor attracted the favor and confidence of decius the senate and people already considered him as an excellent officer equal to the most important trusts and censured the inattention of valerian who suffered him to remain in the subordinate station of a tribune but it was not long before that emperor distinguished the merit of claudius by declaring him general and chief of the illyrian frontier with the command of all the troops in thrace maesia dacia pannonia and dalmatia the appointments of the prefect of egypt the establishment of the proconsul of africa and the sure prospect of the consulship by his victories over the goths he deserved from the senate the honor of a statue and excited the jealous apprehensions of gallienus it was impossible that a soldier could esteem so dissolute a sovereign nor is it easy to conceal a just contempt some unguarded expressions which dropped from claudius were officiously transmitted to the royal ear the emperors answer to an officer of confidence describes in very lively colors his own character and that of the times there is not any thing capable of giving me more serious concern than the intelligence contained in your last dispatch notoria a periodical and official dispatch which the emperors received from the frumentarii or agents dispersed through the provinces of these we may speak hereafter  that some malicious suggestions have indisposed toward us the mind of our friend and parent claudius as you regard your allegiance use every means to appease his resentment but conduct your negotiation with secrecy let it not reach the knowledge of the dacian troops they are already provoked and it might inflame their fury i myself have sent him some presents be it your care that he accept them with pleasure above all let him not suspect that i am made acquainted with his imprudence the fear of my anger might urge him to desperate counsels hist august p  0  gallienus describes the plate vestments etc like a man who loved and understood those splendid trifles  the presents which accompanied this humble epistle in which the monarch solicited a reconciliation with his discontented subject consisted of a considerable sum of money a splendid wardrobe and a valuable service of silver and gold plate by such arts gallienus softened the indignation and dispelled the fears of his illyrian general and during the remainder of that reign the formidable sword of claudius was always drawn in the cause of a master whom he despised at last indeed he received from the conspirators the bloody purple of gallienus but he had been absent from their camp and counsels and however he might applaud the deed we may heartily presume that he was innocent of the knowledge of it julian orat i p   affirms that claudius acquired the empire in a just and even holy manner but we may distrust the partiality of a kinsman  when claudius ascended the throne he was about fiftyfour years of age  the siege of milan was still continued and aureolus soon discovered that the success of his artifices had only raised up a more determined death of aureolus adversary he attempted to negociate with claudius a treaty of alliance and partition tell him replied the intrepid emperor that such proposals should have been made to gallienus he perhaps might have listened to them with patience and accepted a colleague as despicable as himself hist august p  0  there are some trifling differences concerning the circumstances of the last defeat and death of aureolus  this stern refusal and a last unsuccessful effort obliged aureolus to yield the city and himself to the discretion of the conqueror the judgment of the army pronounced him worthy of death and claudius after a feeble resistance consented to the execution of the sentence nor was the zeal of the senate less ardent in the cause of their new sovereign they ratified perhaps with a sincere transport of zeal the election of claudius and as his predecessor had shown himself the personal enemy of their order they exercised under the name of justice a severe revenge against his friends and family the senate was permitted to discharge the ungrateful office of punishment and the emperor reserved for himself the pleasure and merit of obtaining by his intercession a general act of indemnity aurelius victor in gallien the people loudly prayed for the damnation of gallienus the senate decreed that his relations and servants should be thrown down headlong from the gemonian stairs an obnoxious officer of the revenue had his eyes torn out whilst under examination   such ostentatious clemency discovers less of the real character of claudius than a trifling circumstance in which he seems to have consulted only clemency and justice of claudius the dictates of his heart the frequent rebellions of the provinces had involved almost every person in the guilt of treason almost every estate in the case of confiscation and gallienus often displayed his liberality by distributing among his officers the property of his subjects on the accession of claudius an old woman threw herself at his feet and complained that a general of the late emperor had obtained an arbitrary grant of her patrimony this general was claudius himself who had not entirely escaped the contagion of the times the emperor blushed at the reproach but deserved the confidence which she had reposed in his equity the confession of his fault was accompanied with immediate and ample restitution zonaras l xii p       in the arduous task which claudius had undertaken he undertakes the reformation of the army of restoring the empire to its ancient splendor it was first necessary to revive among his troops a sense of order and obedience with the authority of a veteran commander he represented to them that the relaxation of discipline had introduced a long train of disorders the effects of which were at length experienced by the soldiers themselves that a people ruined by oppression and indolent from despair could no longer supply a numerous army with the means of luxury or even of subsistence that the danger of each individual had increased with the despotism of the military order since princes who tremble on the throne will guard their safety by the instant sacrifice of every obnoxious subject the emperor expatiated on the mischiefs of a lawless caprice which the soldiers could only gratify at the expense of their own blood as their seditious elections had so frequently been followed by civil wars which consumed the flower of the legions either in the field of battle or in the cruel abuse of victory he painted in the most lively colors the exhausted state of the treasury the desolation of the provinces the disgrace of the roman name and the insolent triumph of rapacious barbarians it was against those barbarians he declared that he intended to point the first effort of their arms tetricus might reign for a while over the west and even zenobia might preserve the dominion of the east zonaras on this occasion mentions posthumus but the registers of the senate hist august p  0  prove that tetricus was already emperor of the western provinces  these usurpers were his personal adversaries nor could he think of indulging any private resentment till he had saved an empire whose impending ruin would unless it was timely prevented crush both the army and the people  the various nations of germany and sarmatia who fought under the gothic standard had already a d     the goths invade the empire collected an armament more formidable than any which had yet issued from the euxine on the banks of the niester one of the great rivers that discharge themselves into that sea they constructed a fleet of two thousand or even of six thousand vessels the augustan history mentions the smaller zonaras the larger number the lively fancy of montesquieu induced him to prefer the latter  numbers which however incredible they may seem would have been insufficient to transport their pretended army of three hundred and twenty thousand barbarians whatever might be the real strength of the goths the vigor and success of the expedition were not adequate to the greatness of the preparations in their passage through the bosphorus the unskilful pilots were overpowered by the violence of the current and while the multitude of their ships were crowded in a narrow channel many were dashed against each other or against the shore the barbarians made several descents on the coasts both of europe and asia but the open country was already plundered and they were repulsed with shame and loss from the fortified cities which they assaulted a spirit of discouragement and division arose in the fleet and some of their chiefs sailed away toward the islands of crete and cyprus but the main body pursuing a more steady course anchored at length near the foot of mount athos and assaulted the city of thessalonica the wealthy capital of all the macedonian provinces their attacks in which they displayed a fierce but artless bravery were soon interrupted by the rapid approach of claudius hastening to a scene of action that deserved the presence of a warlike prince at the head of the remaining powers of the empire impatient for battle the goths immediately broke up their camp relinquished the siege of thessalonica left their navy at the foot of mount athos traversed the hills of macedonia and pressed forwards to engage the last defense of italy  we still possess an original letter addressed by claudius to the senate and people on this memorable distress and firmness of claudius occasion conscript fathers says the emperor know that three hundred and twenty thousand goths have invaded the roman territory if i vanquish them your gratitude will reward my services should i fall remember that i am the successor of gallienus the whole republic is fatigued and exhausted we shall fight after valerian after ingenuus regillianus lollianus posthumus celsus and a thousand others whom a just contempt for gallienus provoked into rebellion we are in want of darts of spears and of shields the strength of the empire gaul and spain are usurped by tetricus and we blush to acknowledge that the archers of the east serve under the banners of zenobia whatever we shall perform will be sufficiently great trebell pollio in hist august p  0   the melancholy firmness of this epistle announces a hero careless of his fate conscious of his danger but still deriving a wellgrounded hope from the resources of his own mind  the event surpassed his own expectations and those of the world by the most signal victories his victory over the goths he delivered the empire from this host of barbarians and was distinguished by posterity under the glorious appellation of the gothic claudius the imperfect historians of an irregular war hist august in claud aurelian et prob zosimus l i p        zonaras l xii p     aurel victor in epitom victor junior in caesar eutrop ix    eusebius in chron do not enable us to describe the order and circumstances of his exploits but if we could be indulged in the allusion we might distribute into three acts this memorable tragedy i the decisive battle was fought near naissus a city of dardania the legions at first gave way oppressed by numbers and dismayed by misfortunes their ruin was inevitable had not the abilities of their emperor prepared a seasonable relief a large detachment rising out of the secret and difficult passes of the mountains which by his order they had occupied suddenly assailed the rear of the victorious goths the favorable instant was improved by the activity of claudius he revived the courage of his troops restored their ranks and pressed the barbarians on every side fifty thousand men are reported to have been slain in the battle of naissus several large bodies of barbarians covering their retreat with a moveable fortification of wagons retired or rather escaped from the field of slaughter ii we may presume that some insurmountable difficulty the fatigue perhaps or the disobedience of the conquerors prevented claudius from completing in one day the destruction of the goths the war was diffused over the provinces of maesia thrace and macedonia and its operations drawn out into a variety of marches surprises and tumultuary engagements as well by sea as by land when the romans suffered any loss it was commonly occasioned by their own cowardice or rashness but the superior talents of the emperor his perfect knowledge of the country and his judicious choice of measures as well as officers assured on most occasions the success of his arms the immense booty the fruit of so many victories consisted for the greater part of cattle and slaves a select body of the gothic youth was received among the imperial troops the remainder was sold into servitude and so considerable was the number of female captives that every soldier obtained to his share two or three women a circumstance from which we may conclude that the invaders entertained some designs of settlement as well as of plunder since even in a naval expedition they were accompanied by their families iii the loss of their fleet which was either taken or sunk had intercepted the retreat of the goths a vast circle of roman posts distributed with skill supported with firmness and gradually closing toward a common center forced the barbarians into the most inaccessible parts of mount haemus where they found a safe refuge but a very scanty subsistence during the course of a rigorous winter in which they were besieged by the emperors troops famine and pestilence desertion and the sword continually diminished the imprisoned multitude on the return of spring nothing appeared in a d   0 arms except a hardy and desperate band the remnant of that mighty host which had embarked at the mouth of the niester  the pestilence which swept away such numbers of the barbarians at length proved fatal to march death of the emperor who recommends aurelian for his successor their conqueror after a short but glorious reign of two years claudius expired at sirmium amidst the tears and acclamations of his subjects in his last illness he convened the principal officers of the state and army and in their presence recommended aurelian one of his generals as the most deserving of the throne and the best qualified to execute the great design which he himself had been permitted only to undertake the virtues of claudius his valor affability according to zonaras l xii p     claudius before his death invested him with the purple but this singular fact is rather contradicted than confirmed by other writers  justice and temperance his love of fame and of his country place him in that short list of emperors who added luster to the roman purple those virtues however were celebrated with peculiar zeal and complacency by the courtly writers of the age of constantine who was the great grandson of crispus the elder brother of claudius the voice of flattery was soon taught to repeat that the gods who so hastily had snatched claudius from the earth rewarded his merit and piety by the perpetual establishment of the empire in his family see the life of claudius by pollio and the orations of mamertinus eumenius and julian see likewise the caesars of julian p     in julian it was not adulation but superstition and vanity   notwithstanding these oracles the greatness of the flavian family a name which it had pleased them to assume was deferred above twenty the attempt and fall of quintilius years and the elevation of claudius occasioned the immediate ruin of his brother quintilius who possessed not sufficient moderation or courage to descend into the private station to which the patriotism of the late emperor had condemned him without delay or reflection he assumed the purple at aquileia where he commanded a considerable force and though his reign lasted only seventeen days he had time to obtain the sanction of the senate and to experience a mutiny of the troops as soon as he was informed that the great army of the danube had invested the wellknown valor of aurelian with imperial power he sunk under the fame and merit of his rival and ordering his veins to be opened prudently april withdrew himself from the unequal contest zosimus l i p    pollio hist august p  0  allows him virtues and says that like pertinax he was killed by the licentious soldiers according to dexippus he died of a disease   the general design of this work will not permit us minutely to relate the actions of every origin and services of aurelian emperor after he ascended the throne much less to deduce the various fortunes of his private life we shall only observe that the father of aurelian was a peasant of the territory of sirmium who occupied a small farm the property of aurelius a rich senator his warlike son inlisted in the troops as a common soldier successively rose to the rank of a centurion a tribune the prefect of a legion the inspector of the camp the general or as it was then called the duke of a frontier and at length during the gothic war exercised the important office of commander in chief of the cavalry in every station he distinguished himself by matchless valor theoclius as quoted in the augustan history p     affirms that in one day he killed with his own hand fortyeight sarmatians and in several subsequent engagements nine hundred and fifty this heroic valor was admired by the soldiers and celebrated in their rude songs the burden of which was mill mill mill occidit  rigid discipline and successful conduct he was invested with the consulship by the emperor valerian who styles him in the pompous language of that age the deliverer of illyricum the restorer of gaul and the rival of the scipios at the recommendation of valerian a senator of the highest rank and merit ulpius crinitus whose blood was derived from the same source as that of trajan adopted the pannonian peasant gave him his daughter in marriage and relieved with his ample fortune the honorable poverty which aurelian had preserved inviolate acholius ap hist august p     describes the ceremony of the adoption as it was performed at byzantium in the presence of the emperor and his great officers   the reign of aurelian lasted only four years aurelians successful reign and about nine months but every instant of that short period was filled by some memorable achievement he put an end to the gothic war chastised the germans who invaded italy recovered gaul spain and britain out of the hands of tetricus and destroyed the proud monarchy which zenobia had erected in the east on the ruins of the afflicted empire  it was the rigid attention of aurelian even to the minutest articles of discipline which bestowed his severe discipline such uninterrupted success on his arms his military regulations are contained in a very concise epistle to one of his inferior officers who is commanded to enforce them as he wishes to become a tribune or as he is desirous to live gaming drinking and the arts of divination were severely prohibited aurelian expected that his soldiers should be modest frugal and laborious that their armor should be constantly kept bright their weapons sharp their clothing and horses ready for immediate service that they should live in their quarters with chastity and sobriety without damaging the corn fields without stealing even a sheep a fowl or a bunch of grapes without exacting from their landlords either salt or oil or wood the public allowance continues the emperor is sufficient for their support their wealth should be collected from the spoil of the enemy not from the tears of the provincials hist august p     this laconic epistle is truly the work of a soldier it abounds with military phrases and words some of which cannot be understood without difficulty ferramenta samiata is well explained by salmasius the former of the words means all weapons of offense and is contrasted with arma defensive armor the latter signifies keen and well sharpened  a single instance will serve to display the rigor and even cruelty of aurelian one of the soldiers had seduced the wife of his host the guilty wretch was fastened to two trees forcibly drawn toward each other and his limbs were torn asunder by their sudden separation a few such examples impressed a salutary consternation the punishments of aurelian were terrible but he had seldom occasion to punish more than once the same offense his own conduct gave a sanction to his laws and the seditious legions dreaded a chief who had learned to obey and who was worthy to command  the death of claudius had revived the fainting spirit of the goths the troops which guarded the passes of mount haemus and the he concludes a treaty with the goths banks of the danube had been drawn away by the apprehension of a civil war and it seems probable that the remaining body of the gothic and vandalic tribes embraced the favorable opportunity abandoned their settlements of the ukraine traversed the rivers and swelled with new multitudes the destroying host of their countrymen their united numbers were at length encountered by aurelian and the bloody and doubtful conflict ended only with the approach of night zosim l i p     exhausted by so many calamities which they had mutually endured and inflicted during a twenty years war the goths and the romans consented to a lasting and beneficial treaty it was earnestly solicited by the barbarians and cheerfully ratified by the legions to whose suffrage the prudence of aurelian referred the decision of that important question the gothic nation engaged to supply the armies of rome with a body of two thousand auxiliaries consisting entirely of cavalry and stipulated in return an undisturbed retreat with a regular market as far as the danube provided by the emperors care but at their own expense the treaty was observed with such religious fidelity that when a party of five hundred men straggled from the camp in quest of pluner the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the guilty leader should be apprehended and shot to death with darts as a victim devoted to the sanctity of their engagements it is however not unlikely that the precaution of aurelian who had exacted as hostages the sons and daughters of the gothic chiefs contributed something to this pacific temper the youths he trained in the exercise of arms and near his own person to the damsels he gave a liberal and roman education and by bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers gradually introduced between the two nations the closest and most endearing connexions dexippus ap excerpta legate p    relates the whole transaction under the name of vandals aurelian married one of the gothic ladies to his general bonosus who was able to drink with the goths and discover their secrets hist august p       but the most important condition of peace was and resigns to them the province of dacia understood rather than expressed in the treaty aurelian withdrew the roman forces from dacia and tacitly relinquished that great province to the goths and vandals hist august p     eutrop ix    sextus rufus c   lactantius de mortibus persecutorum c    his manly judgment convinced him of the solid advantages and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace of thus contracting the frontiers of the monarchy the dacian subjects removed from those distant possessions which they were unable to cultivate or defend added strength and populousness to the southern side of the danube a fertile territory which the repetition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert was yielded to their industry and a new province of dacia still preserved the memory of trajans conquests the old country of that name detained however a considerable number of its inhabitants who dreaded exile more than a gothic master the walachians still preserve many traces of the latin language and have boasted in every age of their roman descent they are surrounded by but not mixed with the barbarians see a memoir of m danville on ancient dacia in the academy of inscriptions tom xxx  these degenerate romans continued to serve the empire whose allegiance they had renounced by introducing among their conquerors the first notions of agriculture the useful arts and the conveniences of civilized life an intercourse of commerce and language was gradually established between the opposite banks of the danube and after dacia became an independent state it often proved the firmest barrier of the empire against the invasions of the savages of the north a sense of interest attached these more settled barbarians to the alliance of rome and a permanent interest very frequently ripens into sincere and useful friendship this various colony which filled the ancient province and was insensibly blended into one great people still acknowledged the superior renown and authority of the gothic tribe and claimed the fancied honor of a scandinavian origin at the same time the lucky though accidental resemblance of the name of gaeta infused among the credulous goths a vain persuation that in a remote age their own ancestors already seated in the dacian provinces had received the instructions of zamolxis and checked the victorious arms of sesostis and darius see the first chapter of jornandes the vandals however c    maintained a short independence between the rivers marisia and crissia maros and keres which fell into the teiss   while the vigorous and moderate conduct of the alemannie war aurelian restored the illyrian frontier the nation of the alemanni dexippus p       zosimus l   p    vopiscus in aurelian in hist august however these historians differ in names alemanni juthungi and marcomanni it is evident that they mean the same people and the same war but it requires some care to conciliate and explain them violated the conditions of peace which either gallienus had purchased or claudius had imposed and inflamed by their impatient youth suddenly flew to arms forty thousand horse appeared in the field cantoclarus with his usual accuracy chooses to translate three hundred thousand his version is equally repugnant to sense and to grammar  and the numbers of the infantry doubled those of the cavalry we may remark as an instance of bad taste that dexippus applies to the light infantry of the alemanni the technical terms proper only to the grecian phalanx  the first objects of their avarice were a few cities of the rhaetian frontier but their hopes soon rising with success the rapid march of the alemanni traced a line of devastation from the danube to the po in dexippus we at present read rhodanus m de valois very judiciously alters the word to eridanus   the emperor was almost at the same time a d   0 september informed of the irruption and of the retreat of the barbarians collecting an active body of troops he marched with silence and celerity along the skirts of the hercynian forest and the alemanni laden with the spoils of italy arrived at the danube without suspecting that on the opposite bank and in an advantageous post a roman army lay concealed and prepared to intercept their return aurelian indulged the fatal security of the barbarians and permitted about half their forces to pass the river without disturbance and without precaution their situation and astonishment gave him an easy victory his skilful conduct improved the advantage disposing the legions in a semicircular form he advanced the two horns of the crescent across the danube and wheeling them on a sudden toward the center enclosed the rear of the german host the dismayed barbarians on whatsoever side they cast their eyes beheld with despair a wasted country a deep and rapid stream a victorious and implacable enemy  reduced to this distressed condition the alemanni no longer disdained to sue for peace aurelian received their ambassadors at the head of his camp and with every circumstance of a map of the parts of europe and asia adjacentto constantinople martial pomp that could display the greatness and discipline of rome the legions stood to their arms in wellordered ranks and awful silence the principal commanders distinguished by the ensigns of their rank appeared on horseback on either side of the imperial throne behind the throne the consecrated images of the emperor and his predecessors the emperor claudius was certainly of the number but we are ignorant how far this mark of respect was extended if to caesar and augustus it must have produced a very awful spectacle a long line of the masters of the world  the golden eagles and the various titles of the legions engraved in letters of gold were exalted in the air on lofty pikes covered with silver when aurelian assumed his seat his manly grace and majestic figure vopiscus in hist august p   0 taught the barbarians to revere the person as well as the purple of their conqueror the ambassadors fell prostrate on the ground in silence they were commanded to rise and permitted to speak by the assistance of interpreters they extenuated their perfidy magnified their exploits expatiated on the vicissitudes of fortune and the advantages of peace and with an illtimed confidence demanded a large subsidy as the price of the alliance which they offered to the romans the answer of the emperor was stern and imperious he treated their offer with contempt and their demand with indignation reproached the barbarians that they were as ignorant of the arts of war as of the laws of peace and finally dismissed them with the choice only of submitting to his unconditioned mercy or awaiting the utmost severity of his resentment dexippus gives them a subtle and prolix oration worthy of a grecian sophist  aurelian had resigned a distant province to the goths but it was dangerous to trust or to pardon these perfidious barbarians whose formidable power kept italy itself in perpetual alarms  immediately after this conference it should the alemanni invade italy seem that some unexpected emergency required the emperors presence in pannonia he devolved on his lieutenants the care of finishing the destruction of the alemanni either by the sword or by the surer operation of famine but an active despair has often triumphed over the indolent assurance of success the barbarians finding it impossible to traverse the danube and the roman camp broke through the posts in their rear which were more feebly or less carefully guarded and with incredible diligence but by a different road returned toward the mountains of italy hist august p      aurelian who considered the war as totally extinguished received the mortifying intelligence of the escape of the allemanni and of the ravage which they already committed in the territory of milan the legions were commanded to follow with as much expedition as those heavy bodies were capable of exerting the rapid flight of an enemy whose infantry and cavalry moved with almost equal swiftness a few days afterward the emperor himself marched to the relief of italy at the head of a chosen body of auxiliaries among whom were the hostages and cavalry of the vandals and of all the praetorian guards who had served in the wars on the danube dexippus p      as the light troops of the alemanni had spread and are at last vanquished by aurelian themselves from the alps to the apennine the incessant vigilance of aurelian and his officers was exercised in the discovery the attack and the pursuit of the numerous detachments notwithstanding this desultory war three considerable battles are mentioned in which the principal force of both armies was obstinately engaged victor junior in aurelian  the success was various in the first fought near placentia the romans received so severe a blow that according to the expression of a writer extremely partial to aurelian the immediate dissolution of the empire was apprehended vopiscus in hist august p      the crafty barbarians who had lined the woods suddenly attacked the legions in the dusk of the evening and it is most probable after the fatigue and disorder of a long march the fury of their charge was irresistible but at length after a dreadful slaughter the patient firmness of the emperor rallied his troops and restored in some degree the honor of his arms the second battle was fought near fano in umbria on the spot which five hundred years before had been fatal to the brother of hannibal the little river or rather torrent of metaurus near fano has been immortalized by finding such an historian as livy and such a poet as horace  thus far the successful germans had advanced along the aemilian and flaminian way with a design of sacking the defenseless mistress of the world but aurelian who watchful for the safety of rome still hung on their rear found in this place the decisive moment of giving them a total and irretrievable defeat it is recorded by an inscription found at pezaro see gruter cclxxvi    the flying remnant of their host was exterminated in a third and last battle near pavia and italy was delivered from the inroads of the alemanni  fear has been the original parent of superstition superstitious ceremonies and every new calamity urges trembling mortals to deprecate the wrath of their invisible enemies though the best hope of the republic was in the valor and conduct of aurelian yet such was the public consternation when the barbarians were hourly expected at the gates of rome that by a decree of the senate the sibylline books were consulted even the emperor himself from a motive either of religion or of policy recommended this salutary measure chided the tardiness of the senate one should imagine he said that you were assembled in a christian church not in the temple of all the gods  and offered to supply whatever expense whatever animals whatever captives of any nation the gods should require notwithstanding this liberal offer it does not appear that any human victims expiated with their blood the sins of the roman people the sibylline books enjoined ceremonies of a more harmless nature processions of priests a d     january    in white robes attended by a chorus of youths and virgins lustrations of the city and adjacent country and sacrifices whose powerful influence disabled the barbarians from passing the mystic ground on which they had been celebrated however puerile in themselves these superstitious arts were subservient to the success of the war and if in the decisive battle of fano the alemanni fancied they saw an army of specter combating on the side of aurelian he received a real and effectual aid from this imaginary reinforcement vopiscus in hist august p         gives a long account of these ceremonies from the registers of the senate   but whatever confidence might be placed in fortifications of rome ideal ramparts the experience of the past and the dread of the future induced the romans to construct fortifications of a grosser and more substantial kind the seven hills of rome had been surrounded by the successors of romulus with an ancient wall of more than thirteen miles plin hist nature iii   to confirm our idea we may observe that for a long time mount caelius was a grove of oaks and mount viminal was overrun with osiers that in the fourth century the aventine was a vacant and solitary eetirement that till the time of augustus the esquiline was an unwholesome buryingground and that the numerous inequalities remarked by the ancients in the quirinal sufficiently prove that it was not covered with buildings of the seven hills the capitoline and palatine only with the adjacent valleys were the primitive habitation of the roman people but this subject would require a dissertation  the vast enclosure may seem disproportioned to the strength and numbers of the infant state but it was necessary to secure an ample extent of pasture and arable land against the frequent and sudden incursions of the tribes of latium the perpetual enemies of the republic with the progress of roman greatness the city and its inhabitants gradually increased filled up the vacant space pierced through the useless walls covered the field of mars and on every side followed the public highways in long and beautiful suburbs exspatiantia tecta multas addidere urbes is the expression of pliny  the extent of the new walls erected by aurelian and finished in the reign of probus was magnified by popular estimation to near fifty hist august p     both lipsius and isaac vossius have eagerly embraced this measure  but is reduced by accurate measurement to about twentyone miles see nardini roma antica l i c    it was a great but melancholy labor since the defense of

of jealous husbands whose revenge would have appeared more justifiable had they spared the innocence of his son after the murder of so many valiant princes it is somewhat remarkable that a female for

marius and tetricus on the throne and to reign with a manly vigor under the name of those dependent emperors money of copper of silver and of gold was coined in her name she assumed the titles of

she was of a dark complexion for in speaking of a lady these trifles become important her teeth were of a pearly whiteness and her large black eyes sparkled with uncommon fire tempered by the most attractive sweetness her voice was strong and harmonious her manly understanding was strengthened and adorned by study she was not ignorant of the latin tongue but possessed in equal perfection the greek the syriac and the egyptian languages she had drawn up for her own use an epitome of oriental history and familiarly compared the beauties of homer and plato under the tuition of the sublime longinus  this accomplished woman gave her hand to her valor odenathus who from a private station raised himself to the dominion of the east she soon became the friend and companion of a hero in the intervals of war odenathus passionately delighted in the exercise of hunting he pursued with ardour the wild beasts of the desert lions panthers and bears and the ardour of zenobia in that dangerous amusement was not inferior to his own she had inured her constitution to fatigue disdained the use of a covered carriage generally appeared on horseback in a military habit and sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of the troops the success of odenathus was in a great measure ascribed to her incomparable prudence and fortitude their splendid victories over the great king whom they twice pursued as far as the gates of ctesiphon laid the foundations of their united fame and power the armies which they commanded and the provinces which they had saved acknowledged not any

complete steel the moorish and illyrian horse of aurelian were unable to sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists they fled in real or affected disorder engaged the palmyrenians in a laborious pursuit harassed them by a desultory combat and at length discomfited this impenetrable but unwieldy body of cavalry the light infantry in the mean time when they had exhausted their quivers

honorable rank of a colony it was during that peaceful period if we may judge from a few remaining inscriptions that the wealthy palmyrenians constructed those temples palaces and porticos of grecian architecture whose ruins scattered over an extent of several miles have deserved the curiosity of our travelers the elevation of odenathus and zenobia appeared to reflect new splendor on their country

provinces that had renounced their allegiance since the captivity of valerian  when the syrian queen was brought into the presence of aurelian he sternly asked her how behavior of zenobia she had presumed to rise in arms against the emperors of rome the answer of zenobia was a prudent mixture of respect and firmness because i disdained to consider as roman emperors an aureolus or a gallienus you alone i acknowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign pollio in hist p      but as female fortitude is commonly artificial so it is seldom steady or consistent the courage of zenobia deserted her in the hour of trial she trembled at the angry clamours of the soldiers who called aloud for her immediate execution forgot the generous despair of cleopatra which she had proposed as her model and ignominiously purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her friends it was to their counsels which governed the weakness of her sex that she imputed the guilt of her obstinate resistance it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the cruel aurelian the fame of longinus who was included among the numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear will survive that of the queen

governor and garrison which he had left among them and again erected the standard of revolt without a moments deliberation he once more turned his face toward syria antioch was alarmed by his rapid approach and the helpless city of palmyra felt the irresistible weight of his resentment we have a letter of aurelian himself in which he acknowledges hist august p      that old men women children and peasants had been involved in that dreadful execution which should have been confined to armed rebellion and although his principal concern seems directed to the reestablishment of a temple of the sun he discovers some pity for the remnant of the palmyrenians to whom he grants the permission of rebuilding and inhabiting their city but it is easier to destroy than to restore the seat of commerce

a dangerous though obscure rebel who during the revolt of palmyra had arisen on the banks of the nile firmus the friend and ally as he proudly styled himself of odenathus and zenobia was no more than a wealthy merchant of egypt in the course of his trade to india he had formed very intimate connexions with the saracens and the blemmyes whose situation on either coast of the red sea gave them an easy introduction into the upper egypt the egyptians he inflamed with the hope of freedom and at the head of their furious multitude broke into the city of alexandria where he assumed the imperial purple coined money published edicts and raised an army which as he vainly boasted he was capable of maintaining from the sole profits of his paper trade such troops were a feeble defense against the approach of aurelian and it seems almost unnecessary to relate that firmus was routed taken tortured and put to death aurelian might now congratulate the senate the people and himself that in little more than three years he had restored universal peace and order to the roman world see vopiscus in hist august p   0     as an instance of luxury it is observed that he had glass windows he was

procession unfeigned joy wonder and gratitude swelled the acclamations of the multitude but the satisfaction of the senate was clouded by the appearance of tetricus nor could they suppress a rising murmur that the haughty emperor should thus expose to public ignominy the person of a roman and a magistrate the expression of calphurnius eclog i  0 nullos ducet captiva triumphos as applied to rome contains a very manifest allusion and censure   but however in the treatment of his unfortunate rivals aurelian might indulge his pride his treatment of tetricus and zenobia he behaved toward them with a generous clemency which was seldom exercised by the ancient conquerors princes who without success had defended their throne or freedom were frequently strangled in prison as soon as the triumphal pomp ascended the capitol these usurpers whom their defeat had convicted of the crime of treason were permitted to spend their lives in affluence and honorable repose the emperor presented

mischievous arts and pernicious connivance the luxuriant growth of a feeble and oppressive government were eradicated throughout the roman world vopiscus in hist august p      but if we attentively reflect how much swifter is the progress of corruption than its cure and if we remember that the years abandoned to public disorders exceeded the months allotted to the martial reign of aurelian we must confess that a few short intervals of peace were insufficient for the arduous work of reformation even his attempt to restore the integrity of the coin was opposed by a formidable insurrection the emperors vexation breaks out in one of his private letters surely says he the gods have decreed that my life should be a perpetual warfare a sedition within the walls has just now given birth to a very serious civil war the workmen of the mint at the instigation of felicissimus a slave to whom i had entrusted an employment in the finances have risen in rebellion they are at length suppressed but seven thousand of my soldiers have been slain in the contest of those troops whose ordinary station is in dacia and the camps along the danube hist august p     aurelian calls those soldiers hiberi riparienses castriani and dacisci  other writers who confirm the same fact add likewise that it happened soon after aurelians triumph that the decisive engagement was fought on the caelian hill that the workmen of the mint had adulterated the coin and that the emperor restored the public credit by delivering out good money in exchange for the bad which the people was commanded to bring into the treasury zosimus l i p    eutropius ix    aurel victor   we might content ourselves with relating this observations upon it extraordinary transaction but we cannot dissemble how much in its present form it appears to us inconsistent and incredible the debasement of the coin is indeed well suited to the administration of gallienus nor is it unlikely that the instruments of the corruption might dread the inflexible justice of aurelian but the guilt as well as the profit must have been confined to a few nor is it easy to conceive by what arts they could arm a people whom they had injured against a monarch whom they had betrayed we might naturally expect that such miscreants should have shared the public detestation with the informers and the other ministers of oppression and that the reformation of the coin should have been an action equally popular with the destruction of those obsolete accounts which by the emperors orders were burnt in the forum of trajan hist august p     aurel victor  in an age when the principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood the most desirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious means but a temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely excite and support a serious civil war the repetition of intolerable taxes imposed either on the land or on the necessaries of life may at last provoke those who will not or who cannot relinquish their country but the case is far otherwise in every operation which by whatsoever expedients restores the just value of money the transient evil is soon obliterated by the permanent benefit the loss is divided among multitudes and if a few wealthy individuals experience a sensible diminution of treasure with their riches they at the same time lose the degree of weight and importance which they derived from the possession of them however aurelian might choose to disguise the real cause of the insurrection his reformation of the coin could only furnish a faint pretense to a party already powerful and discontented rome though deprived of freedom was distracted by faction the people toward whom the emperor himself a plebeian always expressed a peculiar fondness lived in perpetual dissension with the senate the equestrian order and the praetorian guards it already raged before aurelians return from egypt see vopiscus who quotes an original letter

not easily to the impressions of sympathy and he could sustain without emotion the sight of tortures and death trained from his earliest youth in the exercise of arms he set too small a value on the life of a citizen chastised by military execution the slightest offenses and transferred the stern discipline of the camp into the civil administration of the laws his love of justice often became a blind and furious passion and whenever he deemed his own or the public safety endangered he disregarded the rules of evidence and the proportion of punishments the unprovoked rebellion with which the romans rewarded his services exasperated his haughty spirit the noblest families of the capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this dark conspiracy a hasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody prosecution and it proved fatal to one of the nephews of the emperor the executioners if we may use the expression of a contemporary poet were fatigued the prisons were crowded and the unhappy senate lamented the death or absence of its most illustrious members nulla catenati feralis pompa senatus carnificum lassabit opus nec carcere pleno infelix raros numerabt curia patres calphurn eclog

judgment shall declare worthy of the imperial purple none of those whose guilt or misfortune have contributed to our loss shall ever reign over us vopiscus in hist august p     aurelius victor mentions a formal deputation from the troops to the senate  the roman senators heard without surprise that another emperor had been assassinated in his camp they secretly rejoiced in the fall of aurelian but the modest and dutiful address of the legions when it was communicated in full assembly by the consul diffused the most pleasing astonishment such honors as fear and perhaps esteem could extort they liberally poured forth on the memory of their deceased sovereign such acknowledgments as gratitude could inspire they returned to the faithful armies of the republic who entertained so just a sense of the legal authority of the senate in the choice of an emperor yet notwithstanding this flattering appeal the most prudent of the assembly declined exposing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an armed multitude the strength of the legions was indeed a pledge of their sincerity since those who may command are seldom reduced to the necessity of dissembling but could it naturally be expected that a hasty repentance would correct the inveterate habits of fourscore years should the soldiers relapse into their accustomed seditions their insolence might disgrace the majesty of the senate and prove fatal to the object of its choice motives like these dictated a decree by which the election of a new emperor was referred to the suffrage of the military order  the contention that ensued is one of the best attested but most improbable events in the history of mankind vopiscus our principal authority wrote at rome sixteen years only after the death of aurelian

the obstinate modesty of either party was resolved to receive a master from the hands of the other eight months insensibly elapsed an amazing period of tranquil anarchy during which the roman world remained without a sovereign without an usurper and without a sedition the generals and magistrates appointed by aurelian continued to execute their ordinary functions and it is observed that a proconsul of asia was the only considerable person removed from his office in the whole course of the interregnum  an event somewhat similar but much less authentic is supposed to have happened after the death of romulus who in his life and character bore some affinity with aurelian the throne was vacant during twelve months till the election of a sabine philosopher and the public peace was guarded in the same manner by the union of the several orders of the state but in the time of numa and romulus the arms of the people were controlled by the authority of the patricians and the balance

that could banish from an interregnum the prospect of obedience and harmony an immense and tumultuous capital a wide extent of empire the servile equality of despotism an army of four hundred thousand mercenaries and the experience of frequent revolutions yet notwithstanding all these temptations the discipline and memory of aurelian still restrained the seditious temper of the troops as well as the fatal ambition of their leaders the flower of the legions maintained their stations on the banks of the bosphorus and the imperial standard awed the less powerful camps of rome and of the provinces a generous though transient enthusiasm seemed to animate the military order and we may hope that a few real patriots cultivated the returning friendship of the army and the senate as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to its ancient beauty and vigor  on the twentyfifth of september near eight months after the murder of aurelian the consul a d     sept    convoked an assembly of the senate and reported the consul assembles the senate the doubtful and dangerous situation of the empire he slightly insinuated that the precarious loyalty of the soldiers depended on the chance of every hour and of every accident but he represented with the most convincing eloquence the various dangers that might attend any farther delay in the choice of an emperor intelligence he said was already received that the germans had passed the rhine and occupied some of the strongest and most opulent cities of gaul the ambition of the persian king kept the east in perpetual alarms

that humble title resigned it to the most ancient of the senators  required his opinion on the important subject of a proper candidate for the vacant throne  if we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness we shall esteem the birth of tacitus character of tacitus more truly noble than that of kings he claimed his descent from the philosophic historian whose writings will instruct the last generations of mankind the only objection to this genealogy is that the historian was named cornelius the emperor claudius but under the lower empire surnames were extremely various and uncertain  the senator tacitus was then seventyfive years of age zonaras l xii p     the alexandrian chronicle by an obvious mistake transfers that age to aurelian  the long period of his innocent life was adorned with wealth and honors he had twice been invested with the consular dignity in the year     he was ordinary consul but he must have been suffectus many years before and most probably under valerian  and enjoyed with elegance and sobriety his ample patrimony of between two and three millions sterling bis millies octingenties vopiscus in hist august p     this sum according to the old standard was equivalent to eight hundred and forty thousand roman pounds of silver each of the value of three pounds sterling but in the age of tacitus the coin had lost much of its weight and purity  the experience of so many princes whom he had esteemed or endured from the vain follies of elagabalus to the useful rigor of aurelian taught him to form a just estimate of the duties the dangers and the temptations of their sublime station from the assiduous study of his immortal ancestor he derived the knowledge of the roman constitution and of human nature after his accession he gave orders that ten copies of the historian should be annually transcribed and placed in the public libraries the roman libraries have long since perished and the most valuable part of tacitus was

eloquent confusion that the greatest of the roman princes numa trajan hadrian and the antonines had ascended the throne in a very advanced season of life that the mind not the body a sovereign not a soldier was the object of their choice and that they expected from him no more than to guide by his wisdom the valor of the legions these pressing though tumultuary instances were seconded by a more regular oration of metius falconius the next on the consular bench to tacitus himself he reminded the assembly of the evils which rome had endured from the vices of headstrong and capricious youths congratulated them on the election of a virtuous and experienced senator and with a manly though perhaps a selfish freedom exhorted tacitus to remember the reasons of his elevation and to seek a

under augustus and at length repealed by justinian see casaubon ad locum vopisci  he studied to heal the wounds which imperial pride civil discord and military violence had inflicted on the constitution and to restore at least the image of the ancient republic as it had been preserved by the policy of augustus and the virtues of trajan and the antonines it may not be useless to recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the senate appeared to have regained by the election of tacitus see the lives of tacitus florianus and probus in the augustan history we may be well assured that whatever the soldier gave the senator had already given    to invest one of their body under the title of emperor with the general command of the armies and the government of the frontier provinces   to determine the list or as it was then styled the college of consuls they were twelve in number who in successive pairs each during the space of two months filled the year and represented the dignity of that ancient office the authority of the senate in the nomination of the consuls was exercised with such independent freedom that no regard was paid to an irregular request of the emperor in favor of his brother florianus the senate exclaimed tacitus with the honest transport of a patriot understand the character of a prince whom they have chosen   to appoint the proconsuls and presidents of the provinces and to confer on all the magistrates their civil jurisdiction   to receive appeals through the intermediate office of the prefect of the city from all the tribunals of the empire   to give force and validity by their decrees to such as they should approve of the emperors edicts   to these several branches of authority we may add some inspection over the

expectations were however soon disappointed nor indeed was it possible that the armies and the provinces should long obey the luxurious and unwarlike nobles of rome on the slightest touch the unsupported fabric of their pride and power fell to the ground the expiring senate displayed a sudden luster blazed for a moment and was extinguished for ever  all that had yet passed at rome was no more than a theatrical representation unless it was ratified a d     tacitus is acknowledged by the army by the more substantial power of the legions leaving the senators to enjoy their dream of freedom and ambition tacitus proceeded to the thracian camp and was there by the praetorian prefect presented to the assembled troops as the prince whom they themselves had demanded and whom the senate had bestowed as soon as the prefect was silent the emperor addressed himself to the soldiers with eloquence and propriety he gratified their avarice by a liberal distribution of treasure under the names of pay and donative he engaged their esteem by a spirited declaration that although his age might disable him from the performance of military exploits his counsels should never be unworthy of a roman general the successor of the brave aurelian hist august p       whilst the deceased emperor was making preparations for a second expedition into the east the alani invade asia and are repulsed by tacitus he had negociated with the alani a scythian people who pitched their tents in the neighborhood of the lake moeotis those barbarians allured by presents and subsidies had promised to invade persia with a numerous body of light cavalry they were faithful to their engagements but when they arrived on the roman frontier aurelian was already dead the design of the persian war was at least suspended and the generals who during their interregnum exercised a doubtful authority were unprepared either to receive or to oppose them provoked by such treatment which they considered as trifling and perfidious the alani had recourse to their own valor for their payment and revenge and as they moved with the usual swiftness of tartars they had soon spread themselves over the provinces of pontus cappadocia cilicia and galatia the legions who from the opposite shores of the bosphorus could almost distinguish the flames of the cities and villages impatiently urged their general to lead them against the invaders the conduct of tacitus was suitable to his age and station he convinced the barbarians of the faith as well as of the power of the empire great numbers of the alani appeased by the punctual discharge of the engagements which aurelian had contracted with them relinquished their booty and captives and quietly retreated to their own deserts beyond the phasis against the remainder who refused peace the roman emperor waged in person a successful war seconded by an army of brave and experienced veterans in a few weeks he delivered the provinces of asia from the

were of short death of the emperor tacitus duration transported in the depth of winter from the soft retirement of campania to the foot of mount caucasus he sunk under the unaccustomed hardships of a military life the fatigues of the body were aggravated by the cares of the mind for a while the angry and selfish passions of the soldiers had been suspended by the enthusiasm of public virtue they soon broke out with redoubled violence and raged in the camp and even in the tent of the aged emperor his mild and amiable character served only to inspire contempt and he was incessantly tormented with factions which he could not assuage and by demands which it was impossible to satisfy whatever flattering expectations he had conceived of reconciling the public disorders tacitus soon was convinced that the licentiousness of the army disdained the feeble restraint of laws and his last hour was hastened by anguish and disappointment it may be doubtful whether the soldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent prince eutropius and aurelius victor only say that he died victor junior adds that it was of a fever zosimus and zonaras affirm that he was killed by the soldiers vopiscus mentions both accounts and seems to hesitate yet surely these jarring opinions are easily reconciled  it is certain that their insolence was the cause of his death he expired at tyana in cappadocia after a reign of only six months and a d     april    about twenty days according to the two victors he reigned exactly two hundred days   the eyes of tacitus were scarcely closed before usurpation and death of his brother florianus his brother florianus showed himself unworthy to reign by the hasty usurpation of the purple without expecting the approbation of the senate the reverence for the roman constitution which yet influenced the camp and the provinces was sufficiently strong to dispose them to censure but not to provoke them to oppose the precipitate ambition of florianus the discontent would have evaporated in idle murmurs had not the general of the east the heroic probus boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate the contest however was still unequal nor could the most able leader at the head of the effeminate troops of egypt and syria encounter with any hopes of victory the legions of europe whose irresistible strength appeared to support the brother of tacitus but the fortune and activity of probus triumphed over every obstacle the hardy veterans of his rival accustomed to cold climates sickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of cilicia where the summer proved remarkably unwholesome their numbers were diminished by frequent desertion the passes of the mountains were feebly defended tarsus opened its gates and the soldiers of florianus when they had permitted him to enjoy the imperial title about three months delivered the empire from civil war by the easy sacrifice of july a prince whom they despised hist august p     zosimus l i p

confusion   the perpetual revolutions of the throne had so their family subsists in obscurity perfectly erased every notion of hereditary right that the family of an unfortunate emperor was incapable of exciting the jealousy of his successors the children of tacitus and florianus were permitted to descend into a private station and to mingle with the general mass of the people their poverty indeed became an additional safeguard to their innocence when tacitus was elected by the senate he resigned his ample patrimony to the public service hist august p      an act of generosity specious in appearance but which evidently disclosed his intention of transmitting the empire to his descendants the only consolation of their fallen state was the remembrance of transient greatness and a distant hope the child of a flattering prophecy that at the end of a thousand years a monarch of the race of tacitus should arise the protector of the senate the restorer of rome and the conqueror of the whole earth he was to send judges to the parthians persians and sarmatians a president to taprobana and a proconsul to the roman island supposed by casaubon and salmasius to mean britain such a history as mine says vopiscus with proper modesty will not subsist a thousand years to expose or justify the prediction   the peasants of illyricum who had already character and elevation of the emperor probus given claudius and aurelian to the sinking empire had an equal right to glory in the elevation of probus for the private life of probus see vopiscus in hist august p         above twenty years before the emperor valerian with his usual penetration had discovered the rising merit of the young soldier on whom he conferred the rank of tribune long before the age prescribed by the military regulations the tribune soon justified his choice by a victory over a great body of sarmatians in which he saved the life of a near relation of valerian and deserved to receive from the emperors hand the collars bracelets spears and banners the mural and the civic crown and all the honorable rewards reserved by ancient rome for successful valor the third and afterward the tenth legion were entrusted to the command of probus who in every step of his promotion showed himself superior to the station which he filled africa and pontus the rhine the danube the euphrates and the nile by turns afforded him the most splendid occasions of displaying his personal prowess and his conduct in war aurelian was indebted to him for the conquest of egypt and still more indebted for the honest courage with which he often checked the cruelty of his master tacitus who desired by the abilities of his generals to supply his own deficiency of military talents named him commander in chief of all the eastern provinces with five times the usual salary the promise of the consulship and the hope of a triumph when probus ascended the imperial throne he was about fortyfour years of age according to the alexandrian chronicle he was fifty at the time of his death  in the full possession of his fame of the love of the army and of a mature vigor of mind and body  his acknowledged merit and the success of his respectful conduct toward the senate his arms against florianus left him without an enemy or a competitor yet if we may credit his own professions very far from being desirous of the empire he had accepted it with the most sincere reluctance but it is no longer in my power says probus in a private letter to lay down a title so full of envy and of danger i must continue to personate the character which the soldiers have imposed upon me the letter was addressed to the praetorian prefect whom on condition of his good behavior he promised to continue in his great office see hist august p      his dutiful address to the senate displayed the sentiments or at least the language of a roman patriot when you elected one of your order conscript fathers to succeed the emperor aurelian you acted in a manner suitable to your justice and wisdom for you are the legal sovereigns of the world and the power which you derive from your ancestors will descend to your posterity happy would it have been if florianus instead of usurping the purple of his brother like a private inheritance had expected what your majesty might determine either in his favor or in that of any other person the prudent soldiers have punished his rashness to me they have offered the title of augustus but i submit to your clemency my pretensions and my merits vopiscus in hist august p     the date of the letter is assuredly faulty instead of non februar we may read non august  when this respectful epistle was read by the consul a d     august   the senators were unable to disguise their satisfaction that probus should condescend thus humbly to solicit a scepter which he already possessed they celebrated with the warmest gratitude his virtues his exploits and above all his moderation a decree immediately passed without a dissenting voice to ratify the election of the eastern armies and to confer on their chief all the several branches of the imperial dignity the names of caesar and augustus the title of father of his country the right of making in the same day three motions in the senate hist august p     it is odd that the senate should treat probus less favorably than marcus antoninus that prince had received even before the death of pius jus quintae relationis see capitolin in hist august p     the office of pontifex maximus the tribunitian power and the proconsular command a mode of investiture which though it seemed to multiply the authority of the emperor expressed the constitution of the ancient republic the reign of probus corresponded with this fair beginning the senate was permitted to direct the civil administration of the empire their faithful general asserted the honor of the roman arms and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric trophies the fruits of his numerous victories see the dutiful letter of probus to the senate after his german victories hist august p      yet whilst he gratified their vanity he must secretly have despised their indolence and weakness though it was every moment in their power to repeal the disgraceful edict of gallienus the proud successors of the scipios patiently acquiesced in their exclusion from all military employments they soon experienced that those who refuse the sword must renounce the scepter  the strength of aurelian had crushed on every side the enemies of rome after his death they victories of probus over the barbarians seemed to revive with an increase of fury and of numbers they were again vanquished by the active vigor of probus who in a short reign of about six years the date and duration of the reign of probus are very correctly ascertained by cardinal noris in his learned work de epochis syromacedonum p      0  a passage of eusebius connects the second year of probus with the aeras of several of the syrian cities  equalled the fame of ancient heroes and restored peace and order to every province of the roman world the dangerous frontier of rhaetia he so firmly secured that he left it without the suspicion of an enemy he broke the wandering power of the sarmatian tribes and by the terror of his arms compelled those barbarians to relinquish their spoil the gothic nation courted the alliance of so warlike an emperor vopiscus in hist august p      he attacked the isaurians in their mountains besieged and took several of their strongest castles zosimus l i p        tells a very long and trifling story of lycius the isaurian robber  and flattered himself that he had for ever suppressed a domestic foe whose independence so deeply wounded the majesty of the empire the troubles excited by the usurper firmus in the upper egypt had never been perfectly appeased and the cities of ptolemais and coptos fortified by the alliance of the blemmyes still maintained an obscure rebellion the chastisement of those cities and of their auxiliaries the savages of the south is said to have alarmed the court of persia zosim l i p    vopiscus in hist august p       0 but it seems incredible that the defeat of the savages of aethiopia could affect the persian monarch  and the great king sued in vain for the friendship of probus most of the exploits which distinguished his reign were achieved by the personal valor and conduct of the emperor insomuch that the writer of his life expresses some amazement how in so short a time a single man could be present in so many distant wars the remaining actions he entrusted to the care of his lieutenants the judicious choice of whom forms no inconsiderable part of his glory carus diocletian maximian constantius galerius asclepiodatus annibalianus and a crowd of other chiefs who afterward ascended or supported the throne were trained to arms in the severe school of aurelian and probus besides these wellknown chiefs several others are named by vopiscus hist august p     whose actions have not reached our knowledge   but the most important service which probus a d     rendered to the republic was the deliverance of he delivers gaul from the invasion of the germans gaul and the recovery of seventy flourishing cities oppressed by the barbarians of germany who since the death of aurelian had ravaged that great province with impunity see the caesars of julian and hist august p       0      among the various multitude of those fierce invaders we may distinguish with some degree of clearness three great armies or rather nations successively vanquished by the valor of probus he drove back the francs into their morasses a descriptive circumstance from whence we may infer that the confederacy known by the manly appellation of free already occupied the flat maritime country intersected and almost overflown by the stagnating waters of the rhine and that several tribes of the frisians and batavians had acceded to their alliance he vanquished the burgundians a considerable people of the vandalic race they had wandered in quest of booty from the banks of the oder to those of the seine they esteemed themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase by the restitution of all their booty the permission of an undisturbed retreat they attempted to elude that article of the treaty their punishment was immediate and terrible zosimus l i p    hist august p   0 but the latter suppose the punishment inflicted with the consent of their kings if so it was partial like the offense  but of all the invaders of gaul the most formidable were the lygians a distant people who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers of poland and silesia see cluver germania antiqua l iii ptolemy places in their country the city of calisia probably calish in silesia  in the lygian nation the arii held the first rank by their numbers and fierceness the arii it is

for the combat the darkest hour of the night their host advances covered as it were with a funereal shade feralis umbra is the expression of tacitus it is surely a very bold one  nor do they often find an enemy capable of sustaining so strange and infernal an aspect of all our senses the eyes are the first vanquished in battle tacit germ c     yet the arms and discipline of the romans easily discomfited these horrid phantoms the lygii were defeated in a general engagement and semno the most renowned of their chiefs fell alive into the hands of probus that prudent emperor unwilling to reduce a brave people to despair granted them an honorable capitulation and permitted them to return in safety to their native country but the losses which they suffered in the march the battle and the retreat broke the power of the nation nor is the lygian name ever repeated in the history either of germany or of the empire the deliverance of gaul is reported to have cost the lives of four hundred thousand of the invaders a work of labor to the romans and of expense to the emperor who gave a piece of gold for the head of every barbarian vopiscus in hist august p      but as the fame of warriors is built on the destruction of human kind we may naturally suspect that the sanguinary account was multiplied by the avarice of the soldiers and accepted without any very severe examination by the liberal vanity of probus  since the expedition of maximin the roman and carries his arms into germany generals had confined their ambition to a defensive war against the nations of germany who perpetually pressed on the frontiers of the empire the more daring probus pursued his gallic victories passed the rhine and displayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the elbe and the neckar he was fully convinced that nothing could reconcile the minds of the barbarians to peace unless they experienced in their own country the calamities of war germany exhausted by the ill success of the last emigration was astonished by his presence nine of the most considerable princes repaired to his camp and fell prostrate at his feet such a treaty was humbly received by the germans as it pleased the conqueror to dictate he exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which they had carried away from the provinces and obliged their own magistrates to punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to detain any part of the spoil a considerable tribute of corn cattle and horses the only wealth of barbarians was reserved for the use of the garrisons which probus established on the limits of their territory he even entertained some thoughts of compelling the germans to relinquish the exercise of arms and to trust their differences to the justice their safety to the power of rome to accomplish these salutary ends the constant residence of an imperial governor supported by a numerous army was indispensably requisite probus therefore judged it more expedient to defer the execution of so great a design which was indeed rather of specious than solid utility hist august p         vopiscus quotes a letter from the emperor to the senate in which he mentions his design of reducing germany into a province  had germany been reduced into the state of a province the romans with immense labor and expense would have acquired only a more extensive boundary to defend against the fiercer and more active barbarians of scythia  instead of reducing the warlike natives of he builds a wall from the rhine to the danube germany to the condition of subjects probus contented himself with the humble expedient of raising a bulwark against their inroads the country which now forms the circle of swabia had been left desert in the age of augustus by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants strabo l vii according to velleius paterculus ii  0  maroboduus led his marcomanni into bohemia cluverius german antiq iii   proves that it was from swabia  the fertility of the

of tithes the majesty of the empire these settlers from the payment of tithes were denominated decumates tacif germania c     to protect these new subjects a line of frontier garrisons was gradually extended from the rhine to the danube about the reign of hadrian when that mode of defense began to be practiced these garrisons were connected and covered by a strong intrenchment of trees and palisades in the place of so rude a bulwark the emperor probus constructed a stonewall of a considerable height and strengthened it by towers at convenient distances from the neighborhood of newstadt and ratisbon on the danube it stretched across hills valleys rivers and morasses as far as wimpfen on the necker and at length terminated on the banks of the rhine after a winding course of near two hundred miles see notes de labbe de la bleterie a la germany de tacit p     his account of the wall is chiefly borrowed as he says himself from the alsatia illustrata of schoepflin  this important barrier uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of europe seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the barbarians and particularly the alemanni could penetrate with the greatest facility into the heart of the empire but the experience of the world from china to britain has exposed the vain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of country see recherches sur les chinois et les egyptiens tom ii p      0  the anonymous author is well acquainted with the globe in general and with germany in particular with regard to the latter he quotes a work of m hanselman but he seems to confound the wall of probus designed against the alemanni with the fortification of the mattiaci constructed in the neighborhood of francfort against the catti  an active enemy who can select and vary his points of attack must in the end discover some feeble spot or some unguarded moment the strength as well as the attention of the defenders is divided and such are the blind effects of terror on the firmest troops that a line broken in a single place is almost instantly deserted the fate of the wall which probus erected may confirm the general observation within a few years after his death it was overthrown by the alemanni its scattered ruins universally ascribed to the power of the demon now serve only to excite the wonder of the swabian peasant  among the useful conditions of peace imposed introduction and settlement of the barbarians by probus on the vanquished nations of germany was the obligation of supplying the roman army with sixteen thousand recruits the bravest and most robust of their youth the emperor dispersed them through all the provinces and distributed this dangerous reinforcement in small bands of fifty or sixty each among the national troops judiciously observing that the aid which the republic derived from the barbarians should be felt but not seen he distributed about fifty or sixty barbarians to a numerus as it was then called a corpse with whose established number we are not exactly acquainted  their aid was now become necessary the feeble elegance of italy and the internal provinces could no longer support the weight of arms the hardy frontier of the rhine and danube still produced minds and bodies equal to the labors of the camp but a perpetual series of wars had gradually diminished their numbers the infrequency of marriage and the ruin of agriculture affected the principles of population and not only destroyed the strength of the present but intercepted the hope of future generations the wisdom of probus embraced a great and beneficial plan of replenishing the exhausted frontiers by new colonies of captive or fugitive barbarians on whom he bestowed lands cattle instruments of husbandry and every encouragement that might engage them to educate a race of soldiers for the service of the republic into britain and most probably into cambridgeshire camdens britannia introduction p     but he speaks from a very doubtful conjecture  he transported a considerable body of vandals the impossibility of an escape reconciled them to their situation and in the subsequent troubles of that island they approved

the end they were surely destroyed by the power of a warlike emperor the successful rashness of a party of franks was attended however with such memorable consequences that it ought not to be passed unnoticed they had been established by probus on the seacoast of pontus with a view of strengthening the frontier against the inroads of the alani a fleet stationed in one of the harbors of the euxine fell into the hands of the franks and they resolved through unknown seas to explore their way from the mouth of the phasis to that of the rhine they easily escaped through the bosphorus and the

compensated by a life of pleasure and idleness but if the duties of the soldier are incessantly aggravated by the labors of the peasant he will at last sink under the intolerable burden or shake it off with indignation the imprudence of probus is said to have inflamed the discontent of his troops more attentive to the interests of mankind than to those of the army he expressed the vain hope that by the establishment of universal peace he should soon abolish the necessity of a standing and mercenary force vopiscus in hist august p     he lavishes on this idle hope a large stock of very foolish eloquence  the unguarded expression proved fatal to him in one of the hottest days of summer as he severely urged the unwholesome labor of draining the marshes of sirmium the soldiers impatient of fatigue on a sudden threw down their tools grasped their arms and broke out into a furious mutiny the emperor conscious of his danger took refuge in a lofty tower constructed for the purpose of surveying the progress of the work turris ferrata it seems to have been a moveable tower and cased with iron  the tower was instantly forced and a thousand swords were plunged at once into the bosom of the unfortunate probus a d     august the rage of the troops subsided as soon as it had been gratified they then lamented their fatal rashness forgot the severity of the emperor whom they had massacred and hastened to perpetuate by an honorable monument the memory of his virtues and victories probus et vere probus situs est victor omnium gentium barbararum victor etiam tyrannorum   when the legions had indulged their grief election and character of carus and repentance for the death of probus their unanimous consent declared carus his praetorian prefect the most deserving of the imperial throne every circumstance that relates to this prince appears of a mixed and doubtful nature he gloried in the title of roman citizen and affected to compare the purity of his blood with the foreign and even barbarous origin of the preceding emperors yet the most inquisitive of his contemporaries very far from admitting his claim have variously deduced his own birth or that of his parents from illyricum from gaul or from africa yet all this may be conciliated he was born at narbonne in illyricum confounded by eutropius with the more famous city of that name in gaul his father might be an african and his mother a noble roman carus himself was educated in the capital see scaliger animadversion ad eusebius chron p      though a soldier he had received a learned education though a senator he was invested with the first dignity of the army and in an age when the civil and military professions began to be irrecoverably separated from each other they were united in the person of carus notwithstanding the severe justice which he exercised against the assassins of probus to whose favor and esteem he was highly indebted he could not escape the suspicion of being accessory to a deed from whence he derived the principal advantage he enjoyed at least before his elevation an acknowledged character of virtue and abilities probus had requested of the senate an equestrian statue and a marble palace at the public expense as a just recompense of the singular merit of carus vopiscus in hist august p      but his austere temper insensibly degenerated into moroseness and cruelty and the imperfect writers of his life almost hesitate whether they shall not rank him in the number of roman tyrants vopiscus in hist august p         julian excludes the emperor carus and both his sons from the banquet of the caesars  when carus assumed the purple he was about sixty years of age and his two sons carinus and numerian had already attained the season of manhood john malela tom i p

epistle that he had ascended the vacant throne hist august p     carus congratulated the senate that one of their own order was made emperor  a behavior so very opposite to that of his amiable

persian war before his departure for this distant expedition carus conferred on his two sons carinus and numerian the title of caesar and investing the former with almost an equal share of the

bacon and a few hard pease composed his supper a coarse woollen garment of purple was the only circumstance that announced his dignity the conference was conducted with the same disregard of courtly elegance carus taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his baldness assured the ambassadors that unless their master acknowledged the superiority of rome he would speedily render persia as naked of trees as his own head was destitute of hair synesius tells this story of carinus and it is much more natural to understand it of carus than as petavius and tillemont choose to do of probus  notwithstanding some traces of art and preparation we may discover in this scene the manners of carus and the severe simplicity which the martial princes who succeeded gallienus had already restored in the roman camps the ministers of the great king trembled and retired  the threats of carus were not without effect he ravaged mesopotamia cut in pieces whatever his victories and extraordinary

has so long been an object of dispute among the learned but to explain and justify my opinion would require a dissertation  but the reign of carus was destined to expose the vanity of predictions they were scarcely uttered before a d     dec    they were contradicted by his death an event attended with such ambiguous circumstances that it may be related in a letter from his own secretary to the prefect of the city carus says he our dearest emperor was confined by sickness to his bed when a furious tempest arose in the camp the darkness which overspread the sky was so thick that we could no longer distinguish each other and the incessant flashes of lightning took from us the knowledge of all that passed in the general confusion immediately after the most violent clap of thunder we heard a sudden cry that the emperor was dead and it soon appeared that his chamberlains in a rage of grief had set fire to the royal pavillion a circumstance which gave rise to the report that carus was killed by lightning but as far as we have been able to investigate the truth his death was the natural effect of his disorder hist august p   0 yet eutropius festus rufus the two victors jerome sidonius apollinaris syncellus and zonaras all ascribe the death of carus to lightning   the vacancy of the throne was not productive of any disturbance the ambition of the aspiring he is succeeded by his two sons carinus and numerian generals was checked by their mutual fears and young numerian with his absent brother carinus were unanimously acknowledged as roman emperors the public expected that the successor of carus would pursue his fathers footsteps and without allowing the persians to recover from their consternation would advance sword in hand to the palaces of susa and ecbatana see nemesian cynegeticon v    etc  but the legions however strong in numbers and discipline were dismayed by the most abject superstition notwithstanding all the arts that were practiced to disguise the manner of the late emperors death it was found impossible to remove the opinion of the multitude and the power of opinion is irresistible places or persons struck with lightning were considered by the ancients with pious horror as singularly devoted to the wrath of heaven see festus and his commentators on the word scribonianum places struck with lightning were surrounded with a wall things were buried with mysterious ceremony  an oracle was remembered which marked the river tigris as the fatal boundary of the roman arms the troops terrified with the fate of carus and with their own danger called aloud on young numerian to obey the will of the gods and to lead them away from this inauspicious scene of war the feeble emperor was unable to subdue their obstinate prejudice and the persians wondered at the unexpected retreat of a victorious enemy vopiscus in hist august p   0 aurelius victor seems to believe the prediction and to approve the retreat   the intelligence of the mysterious fate of the a d     vices of carinus late emperor was soon carried from the frontiers of persia to rome and the senate as well as the provinces congratulated the accession of the sons of carus these fortunate youths were strangers however to that conscious superiority either of birth or of merit which can alone render the possession of a throne easy and as it were natural born and educated in a private station the election of their father raised them at once to the rank of princes and his death which happened about sixteen months afterward left them the unexpected legacy of a vast empire to sustain with temper this rapid elevation an uncommon share of virtue and prudence was requisite and carinus the elder of the brothers was more than commonly deficient in those qualities in the gallic war he discovered some degree of personal courage nemesian cynegeticon v    he was a contemporary but a poet  but from the moment of his arrival at rome he abandoned himself to the luxury of the capital and to the abuse of his fortune he was soft yet cruel devoted to pleasure but destitute of taste and though exquisitely susceptible of vanity indifferent to the public esteem in the course of a few months he successively married and divorced nine wives most of whom he left pregnant and notwithstanding this legal inconstancy found time to indulge such a variety of irregular appetites as brought dishonor on himself and on the noblest houses of rome he beheld with inveterate hatred all those who might remember his former obscurity or censure his present conduct he banished or put to death the friends and counselors whom his father had placed about him to guide his inexperienced youth and he persecuted with the meanest revenge his schoolfellows and companions who had not sufficiently respected the latent majesty of the emperor with the senators carinus affected a lofty and regal demeanor frequently declaring that he designed to distribute their estates among the populace of rome from the dregs of that populace he selected his favorites and even his ministers the palace and even the imperial table was filled with singers dancers prostitutes and all the various retinue of vice and folly one of his doorkeepers cancellarius this word so humble in its original has by a singular fortune rose into the title of the first great office of state in the monarchies of europe see casaubon and salmasius ad hist august p     he entrusted with the government of the city in the room of the praetorian prefect whom he put to death carinus substituted one of the ministers of his looser pleasures another who possessed the same or even a more infamous title to favor was invested with the consulship a confidential secretary who had acquired uncommon skill in the art of forgery delivered the indolent emperor with his own consent from the irksome duty of signing his name  when the emperor carus undertook the persian war he was induced by motives of affection as well as policy to secure the fortunes of his family by leaving in the hands of his eldest son the armies and provinces of the west the intelligence which he soon received of the conduct of carinus filled him with shame and regret nor had he concealed his resolution of satisfying the republic by a severe act of justice and of adopting in the place of an unworthy son the brave and virtuous constantius who at that time was governor of dalmatia but the elevation of constantius was for a while deferred and as soon as the fathers death had released carinus from the control of fear or decency he displayed to the romans the extravagancies of elagabalus aggravated by the cruelty of domitian vopiscus in hist august p         eutropius ix    victor junior the reign of diocletian indeed was so long and prosperous that it must have been very unfavourable to the reputation of carinus   the only merit of the administration of carinus that history could record or poetry celebrate he celebrates the roman games was the uncommon splendor with which in his own and his brothers name he exhibited the roman games of the theater the circus and the amphitheatre more than twenty years afterward when the courtiers of diocletian represented to their frugal sovereign the fame and popularity of his munificent predecessor he acknowledged that the reign of carinus had indeed been a reign of pleasure vopiscus in hist august p     he calls him carus but the sense is sufficiently obvious and the words were often confounded  but this vain prodigality which the prudence of diocletian might justly despise was enjoyed with surprise and transport by the roman people the oldest of the citizens recollecting the spectacles of former days the triumphal pomp of probus or aurelian and the secular games of the emperor philip acknowledged that they were all surpassed by the superior magnificence of carinus see calphurnius eclog vii    we may observe that the spectacles of probus were still recent and that the poet is seconded by the historian   the spectacles of carinus may therefore be spectacles of rome best illustrated by the observation of some particulars which history has condescended to relate concerning those of his predecessors if we confine ourselves solely to the hunting of wild beasts however we may censure the vanity of the design or the cruelty of the execution we are obliged to confess that neither before nor since the time of the romans so much art and expense have ever been lavished for the amusement of the people the philosopher montaigne essais l iii   gives a very just and lively view of roman magnificence in these spectacles  by the order of probus a great quantity of large trees torn up by the roots were transplanted into the midst of the circus the spacious and shady forest was immediately filled with a thousand ostriches a thousand stags a thousand fallow deer and a thousand wild boars and all this variety of game was abandoned to the riotous impetuosity of the multitude the tragedy of the succeeding day consisted in the massacre of an hundred lions an equal number of lionesses two hundred leopards and three hundred bears vopiscus in hist august p   0  the collection prepared by the younger gordian for his triumph and which his successor exhibited in the secular games was less remarkable by the number than by the singularity of the animals twenty zebras displayed their elegant forms and variegated beauty to the eyes of the roman people they are called onagri but the number is too inconsiderable for mere wildasses cuper de elephantis exercitat ii   has proved from oppian dion and an anonymous greek that zebras had been seen at rome they were brought from some island of the ocean perhaps madagascar  ten elks and as many camelopards the loftiest and most harmless creatures that wander over the plains of sarmatia and aethiopia were contrasted with thirty african hyaenas and ten indian tigers the most implacable savages of the torrid zone the unoffending strength with which nature has endowed the greater quadrupeds was admired in the rhinoceros the hippopotamus of the nile carinus gave an hippopotamus see calphurn eclog vii    in the latter spectacles i do not recollect any crocodiles of which augustus once exhibited thirtysix  dion cassius l lv p      and a majestic troop of thirtytwo elephants capitolin in hist august p         we are not acquainted with the animals whom he calls archeleontes some read argoleontes others agrioleontes both corrections are very nugatory  while the populace gazed with stupid wonder on the splendid show the naturalist might indeed observe the figure and properties of so many different species transported from every part of the ancient world into the amphitheatre of rome but this accidental benefit which science might derive from folly is surely insufficient to justify such a wanton abuse of the public riches there occurs however a single instance in the first punic war in which the senate wisely connected this amusement of the multitude with the interest of the state a considerable number of elephants taken in the defeat of the carthaginian army were driven through the circus by a few slaves armed only with blunt javelins plin hist nature viii   from the annals of piso  the useful spectacle served to impress the roman soldier with a just contempt for those unwieldy animals and he no longer dreaded to encounter them in the ranks of war  the hunting or exhibition of wild beasts was the amphitheatre conducted with a magnificence suitable to a people who styled themselves the masters of the world nor was the edifice appropriated to that entertainment less expressive of roman greatness posterity admires and will long admire the awful remains of the amphitheatre of titus which so well deserved the epithet of colossal see maffei verona illustrata p iv l i c    it was a building of an elliptic figure five hundred and sixtyfour feet in length and four hundred and sixtyseven in breadth founded on fourscore arches and rising with four successive orders of architecture to the height of one hundred and forty feet maffei l ii c   the height was very much exaggerated by the ancients it reached almost to the heavens according to calphurnius eclog vii    and surpassed the ken of human sight according to ammianus marcellinus xvi  0 yet how trifling to the great pyramid of egypt which rises  00 feet perpendicular  the outside of the edifice was encrusted with marble and decorated with statues the slopes of the vast concave which formed

different copies of victor we read   000 or   000 spectators but maffei l ii c    finds room on the open sents for no more than   000 the remainder were contained in the upper covered galleries

each person whether of the senatorial the equestrian or the plebeian order arrived at his destined place without trouble or confusion see maffei l ii c       he treats the very difficult subject with all possible clearness and like an architect as well as an antiquarian  nothing was omitted which in any respect could be subservient to the convenience and pleasure of the spectators they were protected from the sun and rain by an ample canopy occasionally drawn over their heads the air was continually refreshed by the playing of fountains and profusely impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics in the center of the edifice the arena or stage was strewed with the finest sand and successively assumed the most different forms at one moment it seemed to rise out of the earth like the garden of the hesperides and was afterward broken into the rocks and caverns of thrace the subterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhaustible supply of water and what had just before appeared a level plain might be suddenly converted into a wide lake covered with armed vessels and replenished with the monsters of the deep calphurn eclog vii       these lines are curious and the whole eclogue has been of infinite use to maffei calphurnius as well as martial see his first book was a poet but when they described the amphitheatre they both wrote from their own senses and to those of the romans  in the decoration of these scenes the roman emperors displayed their wealth and liberality and we read on various occasions that the whole furniture of the amphitheatre consisted either of silver or of gold or of amber consult plin hist nature xxxiii    xxxvii     the poet who describes the games of carinus in the character of a shepherd attracted to the capital by the fame of their magnificence affirms that the nets designed as a defense against the wild beasts were of gold wire that the porticoes were gilded and that the belt or circle which divided the several ranks of spectators from each other was studded with a precious mosaic of beautiful stones balteus en gemmis en in lita porticus auro certatim radiant etc calphurn vii   in the midst of this glittering pageantry the a d     sept    emperor carinus secure of his fortune enjoyed the acclamations of the people the flattery of his courtiers and the songs of the poets who for want of a more essential merit were reduced to celebrate the divine graces of his person et martis vultus et apollinis esse putavi says calphurnius but john malela who had perhaps seen pictures of carinus describes him as thick short and white tom i p  0

after return of numerian with the army from persia their fathers death the arrangements which their new situation required were probably deferred till the return of the younger brother to rome where a triumph was decreed to the young emperors for the glorious success of the persian war nemesianus in the cynegeticons seems to anticipate in his fancy that auspicious day  it is uncertain whether they intended to divide between them the administration or the provinces of the empire but it is very unlikely that their union would have proved of any long duration the jealousy of power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters in the most corrupt of times carinus was unworthy to live numerian deserved to reign in a happier period his affable manners and gentle virtues secured him as soon as they became known the regard and affections of the public he possessed the elegant accomplishments of a poet and orator which dignify as well as adorn the humblest and the most exalted station his eloquence however it was applauded by the senate was formed not so much on the model of cicero as on that of the modern declaimers but in an age very far from being destitute of poetical merit he contended for the prize with the most celebrated of his contemporaries and still remained the friend of his rivals a circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart or the superiority of his genius he won all the crowns from nemesianus with whom he vied in didactic poetry the senate eracted a statue to the son of carus with a very ambiguous inscription to the most powerful of orators see vopiscus in hist august p      but the talents of numerian were rather of the contemplative than of the active kind when his fathers elevation reluctantly forced him from the shade of retirement neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him for the command of armies his constitution was destroyed by the hardships of the persian war and he had contracted from the heat of the climate a more natural cause at least than that assigned by vopiscus hist august p     incessantly weeping for his fathers death  such a weakness in his eyes as obliged him in the course of a long retreat to confine himself to the solitude and darkness of a tent or litter the administration of all affairs civil as well as military was devolved on arrius aper the praetorian prefect who to the power of his important office added the honor of being fatherinlaw to numerian the imperial pavilion was strictly guarded by his most trusty adherents and during many days aper delivered to the army the supposed mandates of their invisible sovereign in the persian war aper was suspected of a design to betray carus hist august p   0   it was not till eight months after the death of death of numerian carus that

european side of the propontis we are obliged to the alexandrian chronicle p     for the knowledge of the time and place where diocletian was elected emperor  but a report soon circulated through the camp at first in secret whispers and at length in loud clamours of the emperors death and of the presumption of his ambitious minister who still exercised the sovereign power in the name of a prince who was no more the impatience of the soldiers could not long support a state of suspense with rude curiosity they broke into the imperial tent and discovered only the corpse of numerian hist august p     eutrop ix    hieronym in chron according to these judicious writers the death of numerian was discovered by the stench of his dead body could no aromatics be found in the imperial household  the gradual decline of his health might have induced them to believe that his death was natural but the concealment was interpreted as an evidence of guilt and the measures which aper had taken to secure his election became the immediate occasion of his ruin yet even in the transport of their rage and grief the troops observed a regular proceeding which proves how firmly discipline had been reestablished by the martial successors of gallienus a general assembly of the army was appointed to be held at chalcedon whither aper was transported in chains as a prisoner and a criminal a vacant tribunal was erected in the midst of the camp and the generals and tribunes formed a great military council they soon announced to the multitude that their a d     sept    choice had fallen on diocletian commander of the domestics or bodyguards as the person the election of the emperor diocletian most capable of revenging and succeeding their beloved emperor the future fortunes of the candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the present hour conscious that the station which he had filled exposed him to some suspicions diocletian ascended the tribunal and raising his eyes toward the sun made a solemn profession of his own innocence in the presence of that allseeing deity aurel victor eutropius ix  0 hieronym in chron  then assuming the tone of a sovereign and a judge he commanded that aper should be brought in chains to the foot of the tribunal this man said he is the murderer of numerian and without giving him time to enter on a dangerous justification drew his sword and buried it in the breast of the unfortunate prefect a charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without contradiction and the legions with repeated acclamations acknowledged the justice and authority of the emperor diocletian vopiscus in hist august p     the reason why diocletian killed aper a wild boar was founded on a prophecy and a pun as foolish as they are well known   before we enter upon the memorable reign of defeat and death of carinus that prince it will be proper to punish and dismiss the unworthy brother of numerian carinus possessed arms and treasures sufficient to support his legal title to the empire but his personal vices overbalanced every advantage of birth and situation the most faithful servants of the father despised the incapacity and dreaded the cruel arrogance of the son the hearts of the people were engaged in favor of his rival and even the senate was inclined to prefer an usurper to a tyrant the arts of diocletian inflamed the general discontent and the winter was employed in secret intrigues and open preparations for a civil war in the spring the forces of the east and of the west encountered a d     may each other in the

violence had frequently superseded the ideal prerogatives of nobility but a distinct line of separation was a d     hitherto preserved between the free and the servile part of mankind the parents of

of the little treatise de mortibus persecutorum accuses diocletian of timidity in two places c     in chap   he says of him erat in omni tumultu meticulosus et animi disjectus  it would not be easy to persuade us of the cowardice of a soldier of fortune who acquired and preserved the esteem of the legions as well as the favor of so many warlike princes yet even calumny is sagacious enough to discover and to attack the most vulnerable part the valor of diocletian was never found inadequate to his duty or to the occasion but he appears not to have possessed the daring and generous spirit of a hero who courts danger and fame disdains artifice and boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals his abilities were useful rather than splendid a vigorous mind improved by the experience and study of mankind dexterity and application in business a judicious mixture of liberality and economy of mildness and rigor profound dissimulation under the disguise of military frankness steadiness to pursue his ends flexibility to vary his means and above all the great art of submitting his own passions as well as those of others to the interest of his ambition and of coloring his ambition with the most specious pretenses of justice and public utility like augustus diocletian may be considered as the founder of a new empire like the adopted son of caesar he was distinguished as a statesman rather than as a warrior nor did either of those princes employ force whenever their purpose could be effected by policy  the victory of diocletian was remarkable for his clemency and victory its singular mildness a people accustomed to applaud the clemency of the conqueror if the usual punishments of death exile and confiscation were inflicted with any degree of temper and equity beheld with the most pleasing astonishment a civil war the flames of which were extinguished in the field of battle diocletian received into his confidence aristobulus the principal minister of the house of carus respected the lives the fortunes and the dignity of his adversaries and even continued in their respective stations the greater number of the servants of carinus in this encomium aurelius victor seems to convey a just though indirect censure of the cruelty of constantius it appears from the fasti that aristobulus remained prefect of the city and that he ended with diocletian the consulship which he had commenced with carinus  it is not improbable that motives of prudence might assist the humanity of the artful dalmatian of these servants many had purchased his favor by secret treachery in others he esteemed their grateful fidelity to an unfortunate master the discerning judgment of aurelian of probus and of carus had filled the several departments of the state and army with officers of approved merit whose removal would have injured the public service without promoting the interest of the successor such a conduct however displayed to the roman world the fairest prospect of the new reign and the emperor affected to confirm this favorable prepossession by declaring that among all the virtues of his predecessors he was the most ambitious of imitating the humane philosophy of

de tillemont histoire des empereurs tom iv p  00   0  who has weighed the several reasons and difficulties with his scrupulous accuracy  but the motives of his conduct as well as the object of his choice were of a very different nature from those of his admired predecessor by investing a luxurious youth with the honors of the purple marcus had discharged a debt of private gratitude at the expense indeed of the happiness of the state by associating a friend and a fellowsoldier to the labors of government diocletian in a time of public danger provided for the defense both of the east and of the west maximian was born a peasant and like aurelian in the territory of sirmium ignorant of letters in an oration delivered before him panegyr vet ii   mamertinus expresses a doubt whether his hero in imitating the conduct of hannibal and scipio had ever heard of their names from thence we may fairly infer that maximian was more desirous of being considered as a soldier than as a man of letters and it is in this manner that we can often translate the language of flattery into that of truth  careless of laws the rusticity of his appearance and manners still betrayed in the most elevated fortune the meanness of his extraction war was the only art which he professed in a long course of service he had distinguished himself on every frontier of the empire and though his military talents were formed to obey rather than to command though perhaps he never attained the skill of a consummate general he was capable by his valor constancy and experience of executing the most arduous undertakings nor were the vices of maximian less useful to his benefactor insensible to pity and fearless of consequences he was the ready instrument of every act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at once suggest and disclaim as soon as a bloody sacrifice had been offered to prudence or to revenge diocletian by his seasonable intercession saved the remaining few whom he had never designed to punish gently censured the severity of his stern colleague and enjoyed the comparison of a golden and an iron age which was universally applied to their opposite maxims of government notwithstanding the difference of their characters the two emperors maintained on the throne that friendship which they had contracted in a private station the haughty turbulent spirit of maximian so fatal afterward to himself and to the public peace was accustomed to respect the genius of diocletian and confessed the ascendant of reason over brutal violence lactantius de m p c   aurelius victor as among the panegyrics we find orations pronounced in praise of maximian and others which flatter his adversaries at his expense we derive some knowledge from the contrast  from a motive either of pride or superstition the two emperors assumed the titles the one of jovius the other of herculius whilst the motion of the world such was the language of their venal orators was maintained by the allseeing wisdom of jupiter the invincible arm of hercules purged the earth from monsters and tyrants see the second and third panegyrics particularly iii    0    but it would be tedious to copy the diffuse and affected expressions of their false eloquence with regard to the titles consult aurel victor lactantius de m p c    spanheim de usu numisinatum etc dissertat xii     but even the omnipotence of jovius and herculius association of two caesars was insufficient to sustain the weight of the public administration the prudence of diocletian discovered that the empire assailed galerius and constantius on every side by the barbarians required on every side the presence of a great army and of a d     march   an emperor with this view he resolved once more to divide his unwieldy power and with the inferior title of caesars to confer on two generals of approved merit an equal share of the sovereign authority aurelius victor victor in epitome eutrop ix    lactant de m p c   hieronym in chron  galerius surnamed armentarius from his original profession of a herdsman and constantius who from his pale complexion had acquired the denomination of chlorus it is only among the modern greeks that tillemont can discover his appellation of chlorus any remarkable degree of paleness seems inconsistent with the rubor mentioned in panegyric v     were the two persons invested with the second honors of the imperial purple in describing the country extraction and manners of herculius we have already delineated those of galerius who was often and not improperly styled the younger maximian though in many instances both of virtue and ability he appears to have possessed a manifest superiority over the elder the birth of constantius was less obscure than that of his colleagues eutropius his father was one of the most considerable nobles of dardania and his mother was the niece of the emperor claudius julian the grandson of constantius boasts that his family was derived from the warlike maesians misopogon p     the dardanians dwelt on the edge of maesia  although the youth of constantius had been spent in arms he was endowed with a mild and amiable disposition and the popular voice had long since acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at last attained to strengthen the bonds of political by those of domestic union each of the emperors assumed the character of a father to one of the caesars diocletian to galerius and maximian to constantius and each obliging them to repudiate their former wives bestowed his daughter in marriage on his adopted son galerius married valeria the daughter of diocletian if we speak with strictness theodora the wife of constantius was daughter only to the wife of maximian spanheim dissertat xi    these four princes distributed among themselves the wide extent of the roman empire the defense of departments and harmony of the four princes gaul spain this division agrees with that of the four praefectures yet there is some reason to doubt whether spain was not a province of maximian see tillemont tom iv p      and britain was entrusted to constantius galerius was stationed on the banks of the danube as the safeguard of the illyrian provinces italy and africa were considered as the department of maximian and for his peculiar portion diocletian reserved thrace egypt and the rich countries of asia every one was sovereign within his own jurisdiction but their united authority extended over the whole monarchy and each of them was prepared to assist his colleagues with his counsels or presence the caesars in their exalted rank revered the majesty of the emperors and the three younger princes invariably acknowledged by their gratitude and obedience the common parent of their fortunes the suspicious jealousy of power found not any place among them and the singular happiness of their union has been compared to a chorus of music whose harmony was regulated and maintained by the skilful hand of the first artist julian in caesarib p     spanheims notes to the french translation p       this important measure was not carried into series of events execution till about six years after the association of maximian and that interval of time had not been destitute of memorable incidents but we have preferred for the sake of perspicuity first to describe the more perfect form of diocletians government and afterward to relate the actions of his reign following rather the natural order of the events than the dates of a very doubtful chronology  the first exploit of maximian though it is mentioned in a few words by our imperfect writers a d     state of the peasants of gaul deserves from its singularity to be recorded in a history of human manners he suppressed the peasants of gaul who under the appellation of bagaudae the general name of bagaudae in the signification of rebels continued till the fifth century in gaul some critics derive it from a celtic word bagad a tumultuous assembly scaliger ad eusebius du cange glossar  had risen in a general insurrection very similar to those which in the fourteenth century successively afflicted both france and england chronique de froissart vol i c     ii        the naivete of his story is lost in our best modern writers  it should seem that very many of those institutions referred by an easy solution to the feudal system are derived from the celtic barbarians when caesar subdued the gauls that great nation was already divided into three orders of men the clergy the nobility and the common people the first governed by superstition the second by arms but the third and last was not of any weight or account in their public councils it was very natural for the plebeians oppressed by debt or apprehensive of injuries to implore the protection of some powerful chief who acquired over their persons and property the same absolute rights as among the greeks and romans a master exercised over his slaves caesar de bell gallic vi    orgetorix the helvetian could arm for his defense a body of ten thousand slaves  the greatest part of the nation was gradually reduced into a state of servitude compelled to perpetual labor on the estates of the gallic nobles and confined to the soil either by the real weight of fetters or by the no less cruel and forcible restraints of the laws during the long series of troubles which agitated gaul from the reign of gallienus to that of diocletian the condition of these servile peasants was peculiarly miserable and they experienced at once the complicated tyranny of their masters of the barbarians of the soldiers and of the officers of the revenue their oppression and misery are acknowledged by eumenius panegyr vi   gallias efferatus injuriis   their patience was at last provoked into despair their rebellion on every side they rose in multitudes armed with rustic weapons and with irresistible fury the ploughman became a foot soldier the shepherd mounted on horseback the deserted villages and open towns were abandoned to the flames and the ravages of the peasants equalled those of the fiercest barbarians panegyr vet ii   aurelius victor  they asserted the natural rights of men but they asserted those rights with the most savage cruelty the gallic nobles justly dreading their revenge either took refuge in the fortified cities or fled from the wild seen of anarchy the peasants reigned without control and two of their most daring leaders had the folly and rashness to assume the imperial ornaments aelianus and amandus we have medals coined by them goltzius in these r a p          their power soon expired at the approach of the legions the strength of union and discipline obtained an easy victory over a licentious and divided multitude levibus proeliis domuit eutrop ix  0  a severe retaliation was inflicted and chastisement on the peasants who were found in arms the affrighted remnant returned to their respective habitations and their unsuccessful effort for freedom served only to confirm their slavery so strong and uniform is the current of popular passions that we might almost venture from very scanty materials to relate the particulars of this war but we are not disposed to believe that the principal leaders aelianus and amandus were christians the fact rests indeed on very slight authority a life of st babolinus which is probably of the seventh century see duchesne scriptores rer francicar tom i p      or to insinuate that the rebellion as it happened in the time of luther was occasioned by the abuse of those benevolent principles of christianity which inculcate the natural freedom of mankind  maximian had no sooner recovered gaul from a d     the hands of the peasants than he lost britain by revolt of carausius in britain the usurpation of carausius ever since the rash but successful enterprise of the franks under the reign of probus their daring countrymen had constructed squadrons of light brigantines in which they incessantly ravaged the provinces adjacent to the ocean aurelius victor calls them germans eutropius ix    gives them the name of saxons but eutropius lived in the ensuing century and seems to use the language of his own times  to repel their desultory incursions it was found necessary to create a naval power and the judicious measure was prosecuted with prudence and vigor gessoriacum or boulogne in the straights of the british channel was chosen by the emperor for the station of the roman fleet and the command of it was entrusted to carausius a menapian of the meanest origin the three expressions of eutropius aurelius victor and eumenius vilissime natus bataviae alumnus and menapiae civis give us a very doubtful account of the birth of carausius dr stukely however hist of carausius p    chooses to make him a native of st davids and a prince of the blood royal of britain the former idea he had found in richard of cirencester p     but who had long signalized his skill as a pilot and his valor as a soldier the integrity of the new admiral corresponded not with his abilities when the german pirates sailed from their own harbors he connived at their passage but he diligently intercepted their return and appropriated to his own use an ample share of the spoil which they had acquired the wealth of carausius was on this occasion very justly considered as an evidence of his guilt and maximian had already given orders for his death but the crafty menapian foresaw and prevented the severity of the emperor by his liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which he commanded and secured the barbarians in his interest from the port of boulogne he sailed over to britain persuaded the legion and the auxiliaries which guarded that island to embrace his party and boldly assuming with the imperial purple the title of augustus defied the justice and the arms of his injured sovereign panegyr v    britain at this time was secure and slightly guarded   when britain was thus dismembered from the importance of britain empire its importance was sensibly felt and its loss sincerely lamented the romans celebrated and perhaps magnified the extent of that noble island provided on every side with convenient harbors the temperature of the climate and the fertility of the soil alike adapted for the production of corn or of vines the valuable minerals with which it abounded its rich pastures covered with innumerable flocks and its woods free from wild beasts or venomous serpents above all they regretted the large amount of the revenue of britain whilst they confessed that such a province well deserved to become the seat of an independent monarchy panegyr vet v    vii   the orator eumenius wished to exalt the glory of the hero constantius with the importance of the conquest notwithstanding our laudable partiality for our native country it is difficult to conceive that in the beginning of the fourth century england deserved all these commendations a century and half before it hardly paid its own establishment see appian in proaem  during the space of seven years it was possessed power of carausius by carausius and fortune continued propitious to a rebellion supported with courage and ability the british emperor defended the frontiers of his dominions against the caledonians of the north invited from the continent a great number of skilful artists and displayed on a variety of coins that are still extant his taste and opulence born on the confines of the franks he courted the friendship of that formidable people by the flattering imitation of their dress and manners the bravest of their youth he enlisted among his land or sea forces and in return for their useful alliance he communicated to the barbarians the dangerous knowledge of military and naval arts carausius still preserved the possession of boulogne and the adjacent country his fleets rode triumphant in the channel commanded the mouths of the seine and of the rhine ravaged the coasts of the ocean and diffused beyond the columns of hercules the terror of his name under his command britain destined in a future age to obtain the empire of the sea already assumed its natural and respectable station of a maritime power as a great number of medals of carausius are still preserved he is become a very favorite object of antiquarian curiosity and every circumstance of his life and actions has been investigated with sagacious accuracy dr stukely in particular has devoted a large volume to the british emperor i have used his materials and rejected most of his fanciful conjectures   by seizing the fleet of boulogne carausius had deprived his master of the means of pursuit a d     acknowledged by the other emperors and revenge and when after a vast expense of time and labor a new armament was launched into the water when mamertinus pronounced his first panegyric the naval preparations of maximian were completed and the orator presaged an assured victory his silence in the second panegyric might alone inform us that the expedition had not succeeded  the imperial troops unaccustomed to that element were easily baffled and defeated by the veteran sailors of the usurper this disappointed effort was soon productive of a treaty of peace diocletian and his colleague who justly dreaded the enterprising spirit of carausius resigned to him the sovereignty of britain and reluctantly admitted their perfidious servant to a participation of the imperial honors aurelius victor eutropius and the medals pax auggg inform us of this temporary reconciliation though i will not presume as dr stukely has done medallic history of carausius p    etc to insert the identical articles of the treaty  but the adoption of the two caesars restored new vigor to the roman arms and while the rhine was guarded by the presence of maximian his brave associate constantius assumed the conduct of the british war his first enterprise was against the important place of boulogne a stupendous mole raised across the entrance of the harbor intercepted all hopes of relief the town surrendered after an obstinate a d     defense and a considerable part of the naval strength of carausius fell into the hands of the besiegers during the three years which constantius employed in preparing a fleet adequate to the conquest of britain he secured the coast of gaul invaded the country of the franks and deprived the usurper of the assistance of those powerful allies  before the preparations were finished constantius a d     received the intelligence of the tyrants his death death and it was considered as a sure presage of the approaching victory the servants of carausius imitated the example of treason which he had given he was murdered by his first minister alectus and the assassin succeeded to his power and to his danger but he possessed not equal abilities either to exercise the one or to repel the other he beheld with anxious terror the opposite shores of the continent already filled with arms with troops and with vessels for constantius had very prudently divided his forces that he might likewise divide the attention and resistance of the enemy the attack was at length made by the principal squadron a d     which under the command of the prefect recovery of britain by constantius asclepiodatus an officer of distinguished merit had been assembled in the mouth of the seine so imperfect in those times was the art of navigation that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the romans who ventured to set sail with a sidewind and on a stormy day the weather proved favorable to their enterprise under the cover of a thick fog they escaped the fleet of alectus which had been stationed off the isle of wight to receive them landed in safety on some part of the western coast and convinced the britons that a superiority of naval strength will not always protect their country from a foreign invasion asclepiodatus had no sooner disembarked the imperial troops than he set fire to his ships and as the expedition proved fortunate his heroic conduct was universally admired the usurper had posted himself near london to expect the formidable attack of constantius who commanded in person the fleet of boulogne but the descent of a new enemy required his immediate presence in the west he performed this long march in so precipitate a manner that he encountered the whole force of the prefect with a small body of harassed and disheartened troops the engagement was soon terminated by the total defeat and death of allectus a single battle as it has often happened decided the fate of this great island and when constantius landed on the shores of kent he found them covered with obedient subjects their acclamations were loud and unanimous and the virtues of the conqueror may induce us to believe that they sincerely rejoiced in a revolution which after a separation of ten years restored britain to the body of the roman empire with regard to the recovery of britain we obtain a few hints from aurelius victor and eutropius   britain had none but domestic enemies to defense of the frontiers dread and as long as the governors preserved their fidelity and the troops their discipline the incursions of the naked savages of scotland or ireland could never materially affect the safety of the province the peace of the continent and the defense of the principal rivers which bounded the empire were objects of far greater difficulty and importance the policy of diocletian which inspired the councils of his associates provided for the public tranquillity by encouraging a spirit of dissension among the barbarians and by strengthening the fortifications of the roman limit in the east he fixed fortifications a line of camps of egypt to the persian dominions and for every camp he instituted an adequate number of stationary troops commanded by their respective officers and supplied with every kind of arms from the new arsenals which he had formed at antioch emesa and damascus john malela in chron antiochen tom i p  0   0   nor was the precaution of the emperor less watchful against the wellknown valor of the barbarians of europe from the mouth of the rhine to that of the danube the ancient camps towns and citadels were diligently reestablished and in the most exposed places new ones were skilfully constructed the strictest vigilance was introduced among the garrisons of the frontier and every expedient was practiced that could render the long chain of fortifications firm and impenetrable zosim l i p   that partial historian seems to celebrate the vigilance of diocletian with a design of exposing the negligence of constantine we may however listen to an orator nam quid ego alarm et cohortium castra percenseam toto rheni et istri et euphratis limite restituta panegyr vet iv     a barrier so respectable was seldom violated and the barbarians often turned against each other their disappointed rage the goths the vandals the gepidae dissentions of the barbarians the burgundians the alemanni wasted each others strength by destructive hostilities and whosoever vanquished they vanquished the enemies of rome the subjects of diocletian enjoyed the bloody spectacle and congratulated each other that the mischiefs of civil war were now experienced only by the barbarians ruunt omnes in sanguinem suum populi quibus non contigit esse romany obstinataeque feritatis poenas nunc sponte persolvunt panegyr vet iii    mamertinus illustrates the fact by the example of almost all the nations of the world   notwithstanding the policy of diocletian it was impossible to maintain an equal and undisturbed conduct of the emperors tranquillity during a reign of twenty years and along a frontier of many hundred miles sometimes the barbarians suspended their domestic animosities and the relaxed vigilance of the garrisons sometimes gave a passage to their strength or dexterity whenever the provinces were invaded diocletian conducted himself with that calm dignity which he always affected or possessed reserved his presence for such occasions as were worthy of his interposition never exposed his person or reputation to any unnecessary danger ensured his success by every means that prudence could suggest and displayed with ostentation the consequences of his victory in wars of a more difficult nature and more doubtful event he employed the rough valor of maximian and that faithful soldier was content to ascribe his own victories to the wise counsels and auspicious influence of his benefactor but after the adoption of the two caesars the emperors themselves retiring to a valor of the caesars less laborious scene of action devolved on their adopted sons the defense of the danube and of the rhine the vigilant galerius was never reduced to the necessity of vanquishing an army of barbarians on the roman territory he complained though not with the strictest truth jam fluxisse annos quindecim in quibus in illyrico ad ripam danubii relegatus cum gentibus barbaris luctaret lactant de m p c     the brave and active constantius delivered gaul from a very furious inroad of the alemanni and his victories of langres and vindonissa appear to have been actions of considerable danger and merit as he traversed the open country with a feeble guard he was encompassed on a sudden by the superior multitude of the enemy he retreated with difficulty toward langres but in the general consternation the citizens refused to open their gates and the wounded prince was drawn up the wall by the means of a rope but on the news of his distress the roman troops hastened from all sides to his relief and before the evening he had satisfied his honor and revenge by the slaughter of six thousand alemanni in the greek text of eusebius we read six thousand a number which i have preferred to the sixty thousand of jerome orosius eutropius and his greek translator paeanius  from the monuments of those times the obscure traces of several other victories over the barbarians of sarmatia and germany might possibly be collected but the tedious search would not be rewarded either with amusement or with instruction  the conduct which the emperor probus had treatment of the barbarians adopted in the disposal of the vanquished was imitated by diocletian and his associates the captive barbarians exchanging death for slavery were distributed among the provincials and assigned to those districts in gaul the territories of amiens beauvais cambray treves langres and troyes are particularly specified panegyr vet vii     which had been depopulated by the calamities of war they were usefully employed as shepherds and husbandmen but were denied the exercise of arms except when it was found expedient to enrol them in the military service nor did the emperors refuse the property of lands with a less servile tenure to such of the barbarians as solicited the protection of rome they granted a settlement to several colonies of the carpi the bastarnae and the sarmatians and by a dangerous indulgence permitted them in some measure to retain their national manners and independence there was a settlement of the sarmatians in the neighborhood of treves which seems to have been deserted by those lazy barbarians ausonius speaks of them in his moselle unde iter ingrediens nemorosa per avia solum et nulla humani spectans vestigia cultus  arvaque sauromatum nuper metata colonis there was a town of the carpi in the lower maesia    among the provincials it was a subject of flattering exultation that the barbarian so lately an object of terror now cultivated their lands drove their cattle to the neighboring fair and contributed by his labor to the public plenty they congratulated their masters on the powerful accession of subjects and soldiers but they forgot to observe that multitudes of secret enemies insolent from favor or desperate from oppression were introduced into the heart of the empire see the rhetorical exultation of eumenius panegyr vii     while the caesars exercised their valor on the wars of africa and egypt banks of the rhine and danube the presence of the emperors was required on the southern confines of the roman world from the nile to mount atlas africa was in arms a confederacy of five moorish nations issued from their deserts to invade the peaceful provinces scaliger animadvers ad eusebius p     decides in

the upper egypt scarcely any circumstances have been preserved of the exploits of maximian in the western parts of africa but it appears by the event that the progress of his arms was rapid and decisive that he vanquished the fiercest barbarians of mauritania and that he removed them from the mountains whose inaccessible strength had inspired their inhabitants with a lawless confidence and habituated them to a life of rapine and violence tu ferocissimos mauritaniae populos inaccessis montium jugis et naturali munitione fidentes expugnasti recipisti transtulisti panegyr vet vi    a d     diocletian on his side opened the campaign in conduct of diocletian in egypt egypt by the siege of alexandria cut off the aqueducts which conveyed the waters of the nile into every quarter of that immense city see the description of alexandria in hirtius de bell alexandrin c    and rendering his camp impregnable to the sallies of the besieged multitude he pushed his reiterated attacks with caution and vigor after a siege of eight months alexandria wasted by the sword and by fire implored the clemency of the conqueror but it experienced the full extent of his severity many thousands of the citizens perished in a promiscuous slaughter and there were few obnoxious persons in egypt who escaped a sentence either of death or at least of exile eutrop ix    orosius vii    john malela in chron antioch p  0    0 yet eumenius assures us that egypt was pacified by the clemency of diocletian  the fate of eusiris and of coptos was still more melancholy than that of alexandria those proud cities the former distinguished by its antiquity the latter enriched by the passage of the indian trade were utterly destroyed by the arms and by the severe order of diooletian eusebius in chron places their destruction several years sooner and at a time when egypt itself was in a state of rebellion against the romans  the character of the egyptian nation insensible to kindness but extremely susceptible of fear could alone justify this excessive rigor the seditions of alexandria had often affected the tranquillity and subsistence of rome itself since the usurpation of firmus the province of upper egypt incessantly relapsing into rebellion had embraced the alliance of the savages of aechiopia the number of the blemmyes scattered between the island of meroe and the red sea was very

more serious wars their vexatious inroads might again harass the repose of the province with a view of opposing to the blemmyes a suitable adversary diocletian persuaded the nobatae or people of nubia to remove from their ancient habitations in the deserts of lybia and resigned to them an extensive but unprofitable territory above syene and the cataracts of the nile with the stipulation that they should ever respect and guard the frontier of the empire the treaty long subsisted and till the establishment of christianity introduced stricter notions of religious worship it was annually ratified by a solemn sacrifice in the isle of elephantine in which the romans as well as the barbarians adored the same visible or invisible powers of the universe see procopius de bell persic l i c      at the same time that diocletian chastised the past crimes of the egyptians he provided for their future safety and happiness by many wise regulations which were confirmed and enforced under the succeeding reigns he fixed the public allowance of corn for the people of alexandria at two millions of medimni about four hundred thousand quarters chron paschal p     procop hist arcan c     one very remarkable edict which he published instead of being condemned as the effect of jealous tyranny deserves to be applauded as an act of prudence and humanity he caused a diligent inquiry to be made

the opulence of the egyptians should inspire them with confidence to rebel against the empire john antioch in excerp valesian p     suidas in diocletian  but if diocletian had been convinced of the reality of that valuable art far from extinguishing the memory he would have converted the operation of it to the benefit of the public revenue it is much more likely that his good sense discovered to him the folly of such magnificent pretensions and that he was desirous of preserving the reason and fortunes of his subjects from the mischievous novelty and progress of that art pursuit it may be remarked that these ancient books so liberally ascribed to pythagoras to solomon or to hermes were the pious frauds of more recent adepts the greeks were inattentive either to the use or to the abuse of chemistry in that immense register where pliny has deposited the discoveries the arts and the errors of mankind there is not the least mention of the transmutation of metals and the persecution of diocletian is the first authentic event in the history of alchymy the conquest of egypt by the arabs diffused that vain science over the globe congenial to the avarice of the human heart it was studied in china as in europe with equal eagerness and with equal success the darkness of the middle ages ensured a favorable reception to every tale of wonder and the revival of learning gave new vigor to hope and suggested more specious arts of deception philosophy with the aid of experience has at length banished the study of alchymy and the present age however desirous of riches is content to seek them by the humbler means of commerce and industry see a short history and confutation of alchymy in the works of that philosophical compiler la mothe le vayer tom i p          the reduction of egypt was immediately followed the persian war by the persian war it was reserved for the reign of diocletian to vanquish that powerful nation and to extort a confession from the successors of artaxerxes of the superior majesty of the roman empire  we have observed under the reign of valerian that armenia was subdued by the perfidy and the tiridates the armenian arms of the persians and that after the assassination of chosroes his son tiridates the infant heir of the monarchy was saved by the fidelity of his friends and educated under the protection of the emperors tiridates derived from his exile such advantages as he could never have obtained on the throne of armenia the early knowledge of adversity of mankind and of the roman discipline he signalized his youth by deeds of valor and displayed a matchless dexterity as well as strength in every martial exercise and even in the less honorable contests of the olympian games see the education and strength of tiridates in the armenian history of moses of chorene l ii c    he could seize two wild bulls by the horns and break them off with his hands  those qualities were more nobly exerted in the defense of his benefactor licinius if we give credit to the younger victor who supposes that in the year     licinius was only sixty years of age he could scarcely be the same person as the patron of tiridates but we know from much better authority eusebius hist ecclesiast l x c   that licinius was at that time in the last period of old age sixteen years before he is represented with gray hairs and as the contemporary of galerius see lactant c    licinius was probably born about the year   0  that officer in the sedition a d     which occasioned the death of probus was exposed to the most imminent danger and the enraged soldiers were forcing their way into his tent when they were checked by the single arm of the armenian prince the gratitude of tiridates contributed soon afterward to his restoration i icinius was in every station the friend and companion of galerius and the merit of galerius long before he was raised to the dignity of caesar had been known and esteemed by diocletian in the third year of that emperors reign tiridates was invested with the kingdom of armenia the justice of the measure was not less evident than its expediency it was time to rescue from the usurpation of the persian monarch an important territory which since the reign of nero had been always granted under the protection of the empire to a younger branch of the house of arsaces see the sixtysecond and sixtythird books of dion cassius   when tiridates appeared on the frontiers of armenia he was received with an unfeigned transport of joy and loyalty during twentysix a d     years the country had experienced the real and his restoration to the throne of armenia imaginary hardships of a foreign yoke the persian monarchs adorned their new conquest with magnificent buildings but those monuments had been erected at the expense of the people and were abhorred as badges of slavery the apprehension of a revolt had inspired the most rigorous precautions oppression had been state of the country aggravated by insult and the consciousness of the public hatred had been productive of every measure that could render it still more implacable we have already remarked the intolerant spirit of the magian

obstacle and the persian garrisons retreated before its fury the nobles of armenia flew to the standard of tiridates all alleging their past merit offering their future service and soliciting from the new king those honors and rewards from which they had been excluded with disdain under the foreign government the armenian nobility was numerous and powerful moses mentions many families which were distinguished under the reign of valarsaces l ii   and which still subsisted in his own time about the middle of the fifth century see the preface of his editors  the command of the army was bestowed

the opulence of the natives and by their love of peace above all the other nations of the earth  which at that time extended as far as the neighborhood of sogdiana vouti the first emperor of the seventh dynasty who then reigned in china had political transactions with fergana a province of sogdiana and is said to have received a roman embassy histoire des huns tom i p    in those ages the chinese kept a garrison at kashgar and one of their generals about the time of trajan marched as far as the caspian sea with regard to the intercourse between china and the western countries a curious

implored the protection of sapor the emperor of china claimed the fugitive and alleged the rights of sovereignty the persian monarch pleaded the laws of hospitality and with some difficulty avoided a war by the promise that he would banish mamgo to the uttermost parts of the west a punishment as he described it not less dreadful than death itself armenia was chosen for the place of exile and a large district was assigned to the scythian horde on which they might feed their flocks and herds and remove their encampment from one place to another according to the different seasons of the year they were employed to repel the invasion of tiridates but their leader after weighing the obligations and injuries which he had received from the persian monarch resolved to abandon his party the armenian prince who was well acquainted with the merit as well as power of mamgo treated him with distinguished respect and by admitting him into his confidence acquired a brave and faithful servant who contributed very effectually to his restoration see hist armen l ii c      for a while fortune appeared to favor the the persians recover armenia enterprising valor of tiridates he not only expelled the enemies of his family and country from the whole extent of armenia but in the prosecution of his revenge he carried his arms or at least his incursions into the heart of assyria the historian who has preserved the name of tiridates from oblivion celebrates with a degree of national enthusiasm his personal prowess and in the true spirit of eastern romance describes the giants and the elephants that fell beneath his invincible arm it is from other information that we discover the distracted state of the persian monarchy to which the king of armenia was indebted for some part of his advantages the throne was disputed by the ambition of contending brothers and hormuz after exerting without success the strength of his own party had recourse to the dangerous assistance of the barbarians who inhabited the banks of the caspian sea ipsos persas ipsumque regem ascitis saccis et russis et gellis petit frater ormies panegyric vet iii   the saccae were a nation of wandering scythians who encamped toward the sources of the oxus and the jaxartes the gelli were the inhabitants of ghilan along the caspian sea and who so long under the name of dilemites infested the persian monarchy see dherbelot bibliotheque orientale  the civil war was however soon terminated either by a victory or by a reconciliation and narses who was universally acknowledged as king of persia directed his whole force against the foreign enemy the contest then became too unequal nor was the valor of the hero able to withstand the power of the monarch tiridates a second time expelled from the throne of armenia once more took refuge in the court of the emperors narses soon reestablished his authority over the revolted province and loudly complaining of the protection afforded by the romans to rebels and fugitives aspired to the conquest of the east moses of chorene takes no notice of this second revolution which i have been obliged to collect from a passage of ammianus marcellinus l xxiii   lactantius speaks of the ambition of narses concitatus domesticis exemplis avi sui saporis ad occupandum orientem magnis copiis inhiabat de mort persecut c     neither prudence nor honor could permit the war between the persians and the romans emperors to forsake the cause of the armenian king and it was resolved to exert the force of the empire in the persian war diocletian with a d     the calm dignity which he constantly assumed fixed his own station in the city of antioch from whence he prepared and directed the military operations we may readily believe that lactantius ascribes to cowardice the conduct of diocletian julian in his oration says that he remained with all the forces of the empire a very hyperbolical expression  the conduct of the legions was entrusted to the intrepid valor of galerius who for that important purpose was removed from the banks of the danube to those of the euphrates the armies soon encountered each other in the defeat of galerius plains of mesopotamia and two battles were fought with various and doubtful success but the third engagement was of a more decisive nature and the roman army received a total overthrow which is attributed to the rashness of galerius who with an inconsiderable body of troops attacked the innumerable host of the persians our five abbreviators eutropius festus the two victors and orosius all relate the last and great battle but orosius is the only one who speaks of the two former  but the consideration of the country that was the scene of action may suggest another reason for his defeat the same ground on which galerius was vanquished had been rendered memorable by the death of crassus and the slaughter of ten legions it was a plain of more than sixty miles which extended from the hills of carrhae to the euphrates a smooth and barren surface of sandy desert without a hillock without a tree and without a spring of fresh water the nature of the country is finely described by plutarch in the life of crassus and by xenophon in the first book of the anabasis  the steady infantry of the romans fainting with heat and thirst could neither hope for victory if they preserved their ranks nor break their ranks without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger in this situation they were gradually encompassed by the superior numbers harassed by the rapid evolutions and destroyed by the arrows of the barbarian cavalry the king of armenia had signalized his valor in the battle and acquired personal glory by the public misfortune he was pursued as far as the euphrates his horse was wounded and it appeared impossible for him to escape the victorious enemy in this extremity tiridates embraced the only refuge which he saw before him he dismounted and plunged into the stream his armor was heavy the river very deep and at those parts at least half a mile in breadth see fosters dissertation in the second volume of the translation of the anabasis by spelman which i will venture to recommend as one of the best versions extant  yet such was his strength and dexterity that he reached in safety the opposite bank hist armen l ii c    i have transferred this exploit of tiridates from an imaginary defeat to the real one of galerius  with regard to the roman general we are ignorant of the circumstances of his escape but when he returned to antioch diocletian received him not with the tenderness his reception by diocletian of a friend and colleague but with the indignation of an offended sovereign the haughtiest of men clothed in his purple but humbled by the sense of his fault and misfortune was obliged to follow the emperors chariot above a mile on foot and to exhibit before the whole court the spectacle of his disgrace ammian marcellin l xiv the mile in the hands of eutropius ix    of festus c    and of orosius vii    easily increased to several miles   as soon as diocletian had indulged his private second campaign of galerius resentment and asserted the majesty of supreme power he yielded to the submissive entreaties of the caesar and permitted him to retrieve his own a d     honor as well as that of the roman arms in the room of the unwarlike troops of asia which had most probably served in the first expedition a second army was drawn from the veterans and new levies of the illyrian frontier and a considerable body of gothic auxiliaries were taken into the imperial pay aurelius victor jornandes de rebus geticis c     at the head of a chosen army of twentyfive thousand men galerius again passed the euphrates but instead of exposing his legions in the open plains of mesopotamia he advanced through the mountains of armenia where he found the inhabitants devoted to his cause and the country as favorable to the operations of infantry as it was inconvenient for the motions of cavalry aurelius victor says per armeniam in hosts contendit que ferme sola seu facilior vincendi via est he followed the conduct of trajan and the idea of julius caesar  adversity had confirmed the roman discipline while the barbarians his victory elated by success were become so negligent and remiss that in the moment when they least expected it they were surprised by the active conduct of galerius who attended only by two horsemen had with his own eyes secretly examined the state and position of their camp a surprise especially in the nightime was for the most part fatal to a persian army their horses were tied and generally shackled to prevent their running away and if an alarm happened a persian had his housing to fix his horse to bridle and his corslet to put on before he could mount xenophons anabasis l iii for that reason the persian cavalry encamped sixty stadia from the enemy  on this occasion the impetuous attack of galerius spread disorder and dismay over the camp of the barbarians a slight resistance was followed by a dreadful carnage and in the general confusion the wounded monarch for narses commanded his armies in person fled toward the deserts of media his sumptuous tents and those of his satraps afforded an immense booty to the conqueror and an incident is mentioned which proves the rustic but martia ignorance of the legions in the elegant superfluities of life a bag of shining leather filled with pearls fell into the hands of a private soldier he carefully preserved the bag but he threw away its contents judging that whatever was of no use could not possibly be of any value the story is told by ammianus l xxii instead of saccum some read scutum  the principal loss of narses was and behavior to his royal captives of a much more affecting nature several of his wives his sisters and children who had attended the army were made captives in the defeat but though the character of galerius had in general very little affinity with that of alexander he imitated after his victory the amiable behavior of the macedonian toward the family of darius the wives and children of narses were protected from violence and rapine conveyed to a place of safety and treated with every mark of respect and tenderness that was due from a generous enemy to their age their sex and their royal dignity the persians confessed the roman superiority in morals as well as in arms eutrop ix    but this respect and gratitude of enemies is very seldom to be found in their own accounts   while the east anxiously expected the decision of this great contest the emperor diocletian negotiation for peace having assembled in syria a strong army of observation displayed from a distance the resources of the roman power and reserved himself for any future emergency of the war on the intelligence of the victory he condescended to advance toward the frontier with a view of moderating by his presence and counsels the pride of galerius the interview of the roman princes at nisibis was accompanied with every expression of respect on one side and of esteem on the other it was in that city that they soon afterward gave audience to the ambassador of the great king the account of the negotiation is taken from the fragments of peter the patrician in the excerpta legationum published in the byzantine collection peter lived under justinian but it is very evident by the nature of his materials that they are drawn from the most authentic and respectable writers  the power or at least the spirit of narses had been broken by his last defeat and he considered an immediate peace as the only means that could stop the progress of the roman arms he dispatched apharban a servant who possessed his favor and confidence with a commission to negociate a treaty or rather to receive whatever conditions the conqueror should impose apharban opened the conference by expressing speech of the persian ambassador his masters gratitude for the generous treatment of his family and by soliciting the liberty of those illustrious captives he celebrated the valor of galerius without degrading the reputation of narses and thought it no dishonor to confess the superiority of the victorious caesar over a monarch who had surpassed in glory all the princes of his race notwithstanding the justice of the persian cause he was empowered to submit the present differences to the decision of the emperors themselves convinced as he was that in the midst of prosperity they would not be unmindful of the vicissitudes of fortune apharban concluded his discourse in the style of eastern allegory by observing that the roman and persian monarchies were the two eyes of the world which would remain imperfect and mutilated if either of them should be put out  it well becomes the persians replied galerius answer of galerius with a transport of fury which seemed to convulse his whole frame it well becomes the persians to expatiate on the vicissitudes of fortune and calmly to read us lectures on the virtues of moderation let them remember their own moderation toward the unhappy valerian they vanquished him by fraud they treated him with indignity they detained him till the last moment of his life in shameful captivity and after his death they exposed his body to perpetual ignominy softening however his tone galerius insinuated to the ambassador that it had never been the practice of the romans to trample on a prostrate enemy and that on this occasion they should consult their own dignity rather than the persian merit he dismissed apharban with a hope that narses would soon be informed on what conditions he might obtain from the clemency of the emperors a lasting peace and the restoration of his wives and children in this conference we may discover the fierce passions of galerius as well as his deference to the superior wisdom and authority of diocletian the ambition of the former grasped at the conquest of the east and had proposed to reduce persia into the state of a province the prudence of the latter who adhered moderation of diocletian to the moderate policy of augustus and the antonines embraced the favorable opportunity of terminating a successful war by an honorable and advantageous peace adeo victor says aurelius ut ni valerius cujus nutu omnia gerebantur abnuisset romani fasces in provinciam novam ferrentur verum pars terrarum tamen nobis utilior quaesita   in pursuance of their promise the emperors soon afterward appointed sicorius probus one conclusion of their secretaries to acquaint the persian court with their final resolution as the minister of peace he was received with every mark of politeness and friendship but under the pretense of allowing him the necessary repose after so long a journey the audience of probus was deferred from day to day and he attended the slow motions of the king till at length he was admitted to his presence near the river asprudus in media the secret motive of narses in this delay had been to collect such a military force as might enable him though sincerely desirous of peace to negociate with the greater weight and dignity three persons only assisted at this important conference the minister apharban the prefect of the guards and an officer who had commanded on the armenian frontier he had been governor of sumium pet patricius in excerpt legate p  0 this province seems to be mentioned by moses of chorene geograph p   0 and lay to the east of mount ararat  the first condition proposed by the ambassador is not at present of a very intelligible nature that the city of nisibis might be established for the place of mutual exchange or as we should formerly have termed it for the staple of trade between the two empires there is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the roman princes to improve their revenue by some restraints upon commerce but as nisibis was situated within their own dominions and as they were masters both of the imports and exports it should seem that such restraints were the objects of an internal law rather than of a foreign treaty to render them more effectual some stipulations were probably required on the side of the king of persia which appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his dignity that narses could not be persuaded to subscribe them as this was the only article to which he refused his consent it was no longer insisted on and the emperors either suffered the trade to flow in its natural channels or contented themselves with such restrictions as it depended on their own authority to establish  as soon as this difficulty was removed a solemn peace was concluded and ratified between and articles of the treaty the two nations the conditions of a treaty so glorious to the empire and so necessary to persia may deserve a more peculiar attention as the history of rome presents very few transactions of a similar nature most of her wars having either been terminated by absolute conquest or waged against barbarians ignorant of the use of letters i the aboras or as it is called by xenophon the aboras fixed as the limits between the empires the araxes was fixed as the boundary between the two monarchies by an error of the geographer ptolemy the position of singara is removed from the aboras to the tigris which may have produced the mistake of peter in assigning the latter river for the boundary instead of the former the line of the roman frontier traversed but never followed the course of the tigris  that river which rose near the tigris was increased a few miles below nisibis by the little stream of the mygdonius passed under the walls of singara and fell into the euphrates at circesium a frontier town which by the care of diocletian was very strongly fortified procopius de edificiis l ii c    mesopotamia the object of so many wars was ceded to the empire and the persians by this treaty renounced all pretensions to that great province ii they relinquished cession of five provinces beyond the tigris to the romans five provinces beyond the tigris three of the provinces zabdicene arzanene and carduene are allowed on all sides but instead of the other two peter in excerpt leg p  0 inserts rehimene and sophene i have preferred ammianus l xxv   because it might be proved that sophene was never in the hands of the persians either before the reign of diocletian or after that of jovian for want of correct maps like those of m danville almost all the moderns with tillemont and valesius at their head have imagined that it was in respect to persia and not to rome that the five provinces were situate beyond the tigris  their situation formed a very useful barrier and their natural strength was soon improved by art and military skill four of these to the north of the river were districts of obscure fame and inconsiderable extent intiline zabdicene arzanene and moxoene but on the east of the tigris the empire acquired the large and mountainous territory of carduene the ancient seat of the carduchians who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in the heart of the despotic monarchies of asia the ten thousand greeks traversed their country after a painful march or rather engagement of seven days and it is confessed by their leader in his incomparable relation of the retreat that they suffered more from the arrows of the carduchians than from the power of the great king xenophons anabasis l iv their bows were three cubits in length their arrows two they rolled down stones that were each a wagon load the greeks found a great many villages in that rude country  their posterity the curds with very little alteration either of name or manners acknowledged the nominal sovereignty of the turkish sultan iii it armenia is almost needless to observe that tiridates the faithful ally of rome was restored to the throne of his fathers and that the rights of the imperial supremacy were fully asserted and secured the limits of armenia were extended as far as the fortress of sintha in media and this increase of dominion was not so much an act of liberality as of justice of the provinces already mentioned beyond the tigris the four first had been dismembered by the parthians from the crown of armenia according to eutropius vi   as the text is represented by the best mss the city of tigranocerta was in arzanene the names and situation of the other three may be faintly traced  and when the romans acquired the possession of them they stipulated at the expense of the usurpers an ample compensation which invested their ally with the extensive and fertile country of atropatene its principal city in the same situation perhaps as the modern tauris was frequently honored with the residence of tiridates and as it sometimes bore the name of ecbatana he imitated in the buildings and fortifications the splendid capital of the medes compare herodotus l i c    with moses choronens hist armen l ii c    and the map of armenia given by his editors  iv the country of iberia was iberia barren its inhabitants rude and savage but they were accustomed to the use of arms and they separated from the empire barbarians much fiercer and more formidable than themselves the narrow defiles of mount caucasus were in their hands and it was in their choice either to admit or to exclude the wandering tribes of sarmatia whenever a rapacious spirit urged them to penetrate into the richer climates of the south hiberi locorum potentes caspia via sarmatam in armenios raptim effundunt tacit annal vi    see strabon geograph l xi p      the nomination of the kings of iberia which was resigned by the persian monarch to the emperors contributed to the strength and security of the roman power in asia peter patricius in excerpt leg p  0 is the only writer who mentions the iberian article of the treaty  the east enjoyed a profound tranquillity during forty years and the treaty between the rival monarchies was strictly observed till the death of tiridates when a new generation animated with different views and different passions succeeded to the government of the world and the grandson of narses undertook a long and memorable war against the princes of the house of constantine  the arduous work of rescuing the distressed triumph of diocletian and maximian empire from tyrants and barbarians had now been completely achieved by a succession of illyrian peasants as soon as diocletian entered into the a d  0  nov  0 twentieth year of his reign he celebrated that memorable era as well as the success of his arms by the pomp of a roman triumph eusebius in chron pagi ad annum till the discovery of the treatise de mortibus persecutorum it was not certain that the triumph and the vincenalia were celebrated at the same time  maximian the equal partner of his power was his only companion in the glory of that day the two caesars had fought and conquered but the merit of their exploits was ascribed according to the rigor of ancient maxims to the auspicious influence of their fathers and emperors at the time of the vincenalia galerius seems to have kept his station on the danube see lactant de m p c     the triumph of diocletian and maximian was less magnificent perhaps than those of aurelian and probus but it was dignified by several circumstances of superior fame and good fortune africa and britain the rhine the danube and the nile furnished their respective trophies but the most distinguished ornament was of a more singular nature a persian victory followed by an important conquest the representations of rivers mountains and provinces were carried before the imperial car the images of the captive wives the sisters and the children of the great king afforded a new and grateful spectacle to the vanity of the people eutropius ix    mentions them as a part of the triumph as the persons had been restored to narses nothing more than their images could be exhibited  in the eyes of posterity this triumph is remarkable by a distinction of a less honorable kind it was the last that rome ever beheld soon after this period the emperors ceased to vanquish and rome ceased to be the capital of the empire  the spot on which rome was founded long absence of the emperors from rome had been consecrated by ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles the presence of some god or the memory of some hero seemed to animate every part of the city and the empire of the world had been promised to the capitol livy gives us a speech of camillus on that subject v        full of eloquence and sensibility in opposition to a design of removing the seat of government from rome to the neighboring city of veii  the native romans felt and confessed the power of this agreeable illusion it was derived from their ancestors had grown up with their earliest habits of life and was protected in some measure by the opinion of political utility the form and the seat of government were intimately blended together nor was it esteemed possible to transport the one without destroying the other julius caesar was reproached with the intention of removing the empire to ilium or alexandria see sueton in caesar c    according to the ingenious conjecture of le fevre and dacier the third ode of the third book of horace was intended to divert augustus from the execution of a similar design  but the sovereignty of the capital was gradually annihilated in the extent of conquest the provinces rose to the same level and the vanquished nations acquired the name and privileges without imbibing the partial affections of romans during a long period however the remains of the ancient constitution and the influence of custom preserved the dignity of rome the emperors though perhaps of african or illyrian extraction respected their adopted country as the seat of their power and the center of their extensive dominions the emergencies of war very frequently required their presence on the frontiers but diocletian and maximian were the first roman princes who fixed in time of peace their ordinary residence in the provinces and their conduct however it might be suggested by private motives was justified by very specious considerations of policy the court of the emperor of the west was for their residence at milan the most part established at milan whose situation at the foot of the alps appeared far more convenient than that of rome for the important purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of germany milan soon assumed the splendor of an imperial city the houses are described as numerous and well built the manners of the people as polished and liberal a circus a theater a mint a palace baths which bore the name of their founder maximian porticoes adorned with statues and a double circumference of walls contributed to the beauty of the new capital nor did it seem oppressed even by the proximity of rome see aurelius victor who likewise mentions the buildings erected by maximian at carthage probably during the moorish war we shall insert some verses of ausonius de clar urb v et mediolani mira omnia copia rerum innumerae cultaeque domus facunda virorum ingenia et mores laeti tum duplice muro amplificata loci species populique voluptas circus et inclusi moles cuneata theatri templa palatinaeque arces opulensque moneta

premit vicinia romae   to rival the majesty of rome was the ambition likewise of diocletian who employed his leisure and nicomedia and the wealth of the east in the embellishment of nicomedia a city placed on the verge of europe and asia almost at an equal distance between the danube and the euphrates by the taste of the monarch and at the expense of the people nicomedia acquired in the space of a few years a degree of magnificence which might appear to have required the labor of ages and became inferior only to rome alexandria and antioch in extent or populousness lactant de m p c    libanius orat viii p  0   the life of diocletian and maximian was a life of action and a considerable portion of it was spent in camps or in their long and frequent marches but whenever the public business allowed them any relaxation they seem to have retired with pleasure to their favorite residences of nicomedia and milan till diocletian in the twentieth year of his reign celebrated his roman triumph it is extremely doubtful whether he ever visited the ancient capital of the empire even on that memorable occasion his stay did not exceed two months disgusted with the licentious familiarity of the people he quitted rome with precipitation thirteen days before it was expected that he should have appeared in the senate invested with the ensigns of the consular dignity lactant de m p c    on a similar occasion ammianus mentions the dicacitas plebis as not very agreeable to an imperial ear see l xvi c  0   the dislike expressed by diocletian toward debasement of rome and of the senate rome and roman freedom was not the effect of momentary caprice but the result of the most artful policy that crafty prince had framed a new system of imperial government which was afterward completed by the family of constantine and as the image of the old constitution was religiously preserved in the senate he resolved to deprive that order of its small remains of power and consideration we may recollect about eight years before the elevation of diocletian the transient greatness and the ambitious hopes of the roman senate as long as that enthusiasm prevailed many of the nobles imprudently displayed their zeal in the cause of freedom and after the successors of probus had withdrawn their countenance from the republican party the senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment as the sovereign of italy maximian was entrusted with the care of extinguishing this troublesome rather than dangerous spirit and the task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper the most illustrious members of the senate whom diocletian always affected to esteem were involved by his colleague in the accusation of imaginary plots and the possession of an elegant villa or a well cultivated estate was interpreted as a convincing evidence of guilt lactantius accuses maximian of destroying fictis criminationibus lumina senatus de m p c   aurelius victor speaks very doubtfully of the faith of diocletian toward his friends  the camp of the praetorians which had so long oppressed began to protect the majesty of rome and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline of their power they were naturally disposed to unite their strength with the authority of the senate by the prudent measures of diocletian the numbers of the praetorians were insensibly reduced their privileges abolished truncatae vires urbis imminuto praetoriarum cohortium atque in armis vulgi numero aurelius victor lactantius attributes to galerius the prosecution of the same plan c     and their place supplied by two new bodies of guards jovians and herculians faithful legions of illyricum who under the new titles of jovians and herculians were appointed to perform the service of the imperial guards they were old corpse stationed in illyricum and according to the ancient establishment they each consisted of six thousand men they had acquired much reputation by the use of the plumbatae or darts loaded with lead each soldier carried five of these which he darted from a considerable distance with great strength and dexterity see vegetius i     but the most fatal though secret wound which the senate received from the hands of diocletian and maximian was inflicted by the inevitable operation of their absence as long as the emperors resided at rome that assembly might be oppressed but it could scarcely be neglected the successors of augustus exercised the power of dictating whatever laws their wisdom or caprice might suggest but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate the model of ancient freedom was preserved in its deliberations and decrees and wise princes who respected the prejudices of the roman people were in some measure obliged to assume the language and behavior suitable to the general and first magistrate of the republic in the armies and in the provinces they displayed the dignity of monarchs and when they fixed their residence at a distance from the capital they for ever laid aside the dissimulation which augustus had recommended to his successors in the exercise of the legislative as well as the executive power the sovereign advised with his ministers instead of consulting the great council of the nation the name of the senate was mentioned with honor till the last period of the empire the vanity of its members was still flattered with honorary distinctions see the theodosian code l vi tit ii with godefroys commentary  but the assembly which had so long been the source and so long the instrument of power was respectfully suffered to sink into oblivion the senate of rome losing all connection with the imperial court and the actual constitution was left a venerable but useless monument of antiquity on the capitoline hill  when the roman princes had lost sight of the senate and of their ancient capital they easily civil magistracies laid aside forgot the origin and nature of their legal power the civil offices of consul of proconsul of censor and of tribune by the union of which it had been formed betrayed to the people its republican extraction those modest titles were laid aside see the   th dissertation in spanheims excellent work de usu numismatum from medals inscriptions and historians he examines every title separately and traces it from augustus to the moment of its disappearing  and if they still distinguished their high station by the appellation of emperor or imperator that word was understood in a new and more dignified sense and no longer denoted the general of the roman armies but the sovereign of the roman world the name of emperor which was at first of a military nature imperial dignity and titles was associated with another of a more servile kind the epithet of dominus or lord in its primitive signification was expressive not of the authority of a prince over his subjects or of a commander over his soldiers but of the despotic power of a master over his domestic slaves pliny in panegyr c      etc speaks of dominus with execration as synonymous to tyrant and opposite to prince and the same pliny regularly gives that title in the tenth book of the epistles to his friend rather than master the virtuous trajan this strange contradiction puzzles the commentators who think and the translators who can write  viewing it in that odious light it had been rejected with abhorrence by the first caesars their resistance insensibly became more feeble and the name less odious till at length the style of our lord and emperor was not only bestowed by flattery but was regularly admitted into the laws and public monuments such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and satisfy the most excessive vanity and if the successors of diocletian still declined the title of king it seems to have been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their delicacy wherever the latin tongue was in use and it was the language of government throughout the empire the imperial title as it was peculiar to themselves conveyed a more respectable idea than the name of king which they must have shared with an hundred barbarian chieftains or which at the best they could derive only from romulus or from tarquin but the sentiments of the east were very different from those of the west from the earliest period of history the sovereigns of asia had been celebrated in the greek language by the title of basileus or king and since it was considered as the first distinction among men it was soon employed by the servile provincials of the east in their humble addresses to the roman throne synesius de regno edit petav p    i am indebted for this quotation to the abbe de la bleterie  even the attributes or at least the titles of the divinity were usurped by diocletian and maximian who transmitted them to a succession of christian emperors see vendale de consecratione p     etc it was customary for the emperors to mention in the preamble of laws their numen sacred majesty divine oracles etc according to tillemont gregory of nazianzen complains most bitterly of the profanation especially when it was practiced by an arian emperor  such extravagant compliments however soon lose their impiety by losing their meaning and when the ear is once accustomed to the sound they are heard with indifference as vague though excessive prosessions of respect  from the time of augustus to that of diocletian diocletian assumes the diadem and introduces the persian ceremonial the roman princes conversing in a familiar manner among their fellowcitizens were saluted only with the same respect that was usually paid to senators and magistrates their principal distinction was the imperial or military robe of purple whilst the senatorial garment was marked by a broad and the equestrian by a narrow band or stripe of the same honorable color the pride or rather the policy of diocletian engaged that artful prince to introduce the stately magnificence of the court of persia see spanheim de usu numismat dissertat xii  he ventured to assume the diadem an ornament detested by the romans as the odious ensign of royalty and the use of which had been considered as the most desperate act of the madness of caligula it was no more than a broad white fillet set with pearls which encircled the emperors head the sumptuous robes of diocletian and his successors were of silk and gold and it is remarked with indignation that even their shoes were studded with the most precious gems the access to their sacred person was every day rendered more difficult by the institution of new forms and ceremonies the avenues of the palace were strictly guarded by the various schools as they began to be called of domestic officers the interior apartments were entrusted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs the increase of whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symptom of the progress of despotism when a subject was at length admitted to the imperial presence he was obliged whatever might be his rank to fall prostrate on the ground and to adore according to the eastern fashion the divinity of his lord and master aurelius victor eutropius ix    it appears by the panegyrists that the romans were soon reconciled to the name and ceremony of adoration  diocletian was a man of sense who in the course of private as well as public life had formed a just estimate both of himself and of mankind nor is it easy to conceive that in substituting the manners of persia to those of rome he was seriously actuated by so mean a principle as that of vanity he flattered himself that an ostentation of splendor and luxury would subdue the imagination of the multitude that the monarch would be less exposed to the rude license of the people and the soldiers as his person was secluded from the public view and that habits of submission would insensibly be productive of sentiments of veneration like the modesty affected by augustus the state maintained by diocletian was a theatrical representation but it must be confessed that of the two comedies the former was of a much more liberal and manly character than the latter it was the aim of the one to disguise and the object of the other to display the unbounded power which the emperors possessed over the roman world  ostentation was the first principle of the new new form of administration two augusti and two caesars system instituted by diocletian the second was division he divided the empire the provinces and every branch of the civil as well as military administration he multiplied the wheels of the machine of government and rendered its operations less rapid but more secure whatever advantages and whatever defects might attend these innovations they must be ascribed in a very great degree to the first inventor but as the new frame of policy was gradually improved and completed by succeeding princes it will be more satisfactory to delay the consideration of it till the season of its full maturity and perfection the innovations introduced by diocletian are chiefly deduced  st from some very strong passages in lactantius and  dly from the new and various offices which in the theodosian code appear already established in the beginning of the reign of constantine  reserving therefore for the reign of constantine a more exact picture of the new empire we shall content ourselves with describing the principal and decisive outline as it was traced by the hand of diocletian he had associated three colleagues in the exercise of the supreme power and as he was convinced that the abilities of a single man were inadequate to the public defense he considered the joint administration of four princes not as a temporary expedient but as a fundamental law of the constitution it was his intention that the two elder princes should be distinguished by the use of the diadem and the title of augusti that as affection or esteem might direct their choice they should regularly call to their assistance two subordinate colleagues and that the caesars rising in their turn to the first rank should supply an uninterrupted succession of emperors the empire was divided into four parts the east and italy were the most honorable the danube and the rhine the most laborious stations the former claimed the presence of the augusti the latter were entrusted to the administration of the caesars the strength of the legions was in the hands of the four partners of sovereignty and the despair of successively vanquishing four formidable rivals might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general in their civil government the emperors were supposed to exercise the undivided power of the monarch and their edicts inscribed with their joint names were received in all the provinces as promulgated by their mutual councils and authority notwithstanding these precautions the political union of the roman world was gradually dissolved and a principle of division was introduced which in the course of a few years occasioned the perpetual separation of the eastern and western empires  the system of diocletian was accompanied increase of taxes with another very material disadvantage which cannot even at present be totally overlooked a more expensive establishment and consequently an increase of taxes and the oppression of the people instead of a modest family of slaves and freedmen such as had contented the simple greatness of augustus and trajan three or four magnificent courts were established in the various parts of the empire and as many roman kings contended with each other and with the persian monarch for the vain superiority of pomp and luxury the number of ministers of magistrates of officers and of servants who filled the different departments of the state was multiplied beyond the example of former times and if we may borrow the warm expression of a contemporary when the proportion of those who received exceeded the proportion of those who contributed the provinces were oppressed by the weight of tributes lactant de m p c    from this period to the extinction of the empire it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted series of clamours and complaints according to his religion and situation each writer chooses either diocletian or constantine or valens or theodosius for the object of his invectives but they unanimously agree in representing the burden of the public impositions and particularly the land tax and capitation as the intolerable and increasing grievance of their own times from such a concurrence an impartial historian who is obliged to extract truth from satire as well as from panegyric will be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they accuse and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices than to the uniform system of their administration the emperor diocletian was indeed the author of that system but during his reign the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty and discretion and he deserves the reproach of establishing pernicious precedents rather than of exercising actual oppression indicta lex nova quae sane illorum temporum modestia tolerabilis in perniciem processit aurel victor who has treated the character of diocletian with good sense though in bad latin  it may be added that his revenues were managed with prudent economy and that after all the current expenses were discharged there still remained in the imperial treasury an ample provision either for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the state  it was in the twentyfirst year of his reign that diocletian executed his memorable resolution of abdication of diocletian and maximian abdicating the empire an action more naturally to have been expected from the elder or the younger antoninus than from a prince who had never practiced the lessons of philosophy either in the attainment or in the use of supreme power diocletian acquired the glory of giving to the world the first example of a resignation solus omnium post conditum romanum imperium qui extanto fastigio sponte ad privatae vitae statum civilitatemque remearet eutrop ix     which has not been very frequently imitated by succeeding monarchs the parallel of charles the fifth resemblance to charles the fifth however will naturally offer itself to our mind not only since the eloquence of a modern historian has rendered that name so familiar to an english reader but from the very striking resemblance between the characters of the two emperors whose political abilities were superior to their military genius and whose specious virtues were much less the effect of nature than of art the abdication of charles appears to have been hastened by the vicissitude of fortune and the disappointment of his favorite schemes urged him to relinquish a power which he found inadequate to his ambition but the reign of diocletian had flowed with a tide of uninterrupted success nor was it till after he had vanquished all his enemies and accomplished all his designs that he seems to have entertained any serious thoughts of resigning the empire neither charles nor diocletian were arrived at a very advanced period of life since the one was only fiftyfive and the other was no more than fiftynine years of age but the active life of those princes their wars and journies the cares of royalty and their application to business had already impaired their constitution and brought on the infirmities of a premature old age the particulars of the journey and illness are taken from lactantius c    who may sometimes be admitted as an evidence of public facts though very seldom of private anecdotes   notwithstanding the severity of a very cold and rainy winter diocletian left italy soon after a d  0  long illness of diocletian the ceremony of his triumph and began his progress toward the east round the circuit of the illyrian provinces from the inclemency of the weather and the fatigue of the journey he soon contracted a slow illness and though he made easy marches and was generally carried in a close litter his disorder before he arrived at nicomedia about the end of the summer was become very serious and alarming during the whole winter he was confined to his palace his danger inspired a general and unaffected concern but the people could only judge of the various alterations of his health from the joy or consternation which they discovered in the countenances and behavior of his attendants the rumor of his death was for some time universally believed and it was supposed to be concealed with a view to prevent the troubles that might have happened during the absence of the caesar galerius at length however on the first of march diocletian once more appeared in public but so pale and emaciated that he could scarcely have been recognized by those to whom his person was the most familiar it was time to put an end to the painful struggle which he had his prudence sustained during more than a year between the care of his health and that of his dignity the former required indulgence and relaxation the latter compelled him to direct from the bed of sickness the administration of a great empire he resolved to pass the remainder of his days in honorable repose to place his glory beyond the reach of fortune and to relinquish the theater of the world to his younger and more active associates aurelius victor ascribes the abdication which had been so variously accounted for to two causes  st diocletians contempt of ambition and  dly his apprehension of impending troubles one of the panegyrists vi   mentions the age and infirmities of diocletian as a very natural reason for his retirement   the ceremony of his abdication was performed in a spacious plain about three miles from nicomedia the emperor ascended a lofty throne and in a speech full of reason and dignity declared his intention both to the people and to the soldiers who were assembled on this extraordinary occasion as soon as he had divested a d  0  may   himself of the purple he withdrew from the gazing multitude and traversing the city in a covered chariot proceeded without delay to the favorite retirement which he had chosen in his native country of dalmatia on the same compliance of maximian day which was the first of may the difficulties as well as mistakes attending the dates both of the year and of the day of diocletians abdication are perfectly cleared up by tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p     note    and by pagi ad annum  maximian as it had been previously concerted made his resignation of the imperial dignity at milan even in the splendor of the roman triumph diocletian had meditated his design of abdicating the government as he wished to secure the obedience of maximian he exacted from him either a general assurance that he would submit his actions to the authority of his benefactor or a particular promise that he would descend from the throne whenever he should receive the advice and the example this engagement though it was confirmed by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the capitoline jupiter see panegyr veter vi   the oration was pronounced after maximian had reassumed the purple  would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce temper of maximian whose passion was the love of power and who neither desired present tranquillity nor future reputation but he yielded however reluctantly to the ascendant which his wiser colleague had acquired over him and retired immediately after his abdication to a villa in lucania where it was almost impossible that such an impatient spirit could find any lasting tranquillity  diocletian who from a servile origin had retirement of diocletian at salona raised himself to the throne passed the nine last years of his life in a private condition reason had dictated and content seems to have accompanied his retreat in which he enjoyed for a long time the respect of those princes to whom he had resigned the possession of the world eumenius pays him a very fine compliment at enim divinum illum virum qui primus imperium et participavit et posuit consilii et facti sui non poenitet nec amisisse se putat quod sponte transcripsit felix beatusque vere quem vestra tantorum principum colunt obsequia privatum panegyr vet vii     it is seldom that minds long exercised in business have formed any habits of conversing with themselves and in the loss of power they principally regret the want of occupation the amusements of letters and of devotion which afford so many resources in solitude were incapable of fixing the attention of diocletian but he had preserved or at least he soon recovered a taste for the most innocent as well as natural pleasures and his leisure hours were sufficiently employed in building planting and gardening his answer to maximian is deservedly celebrated he was solicited by that restless old man to reassume his philosophy the reins of government and the imperial purple he rejected the temptation with a smile of pity calmly observing that if he could show maximian the cabbages which he had planted with his own hands at salona he should no longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the pursuit of power we are obliged to the younger victor for this celebrated bon mot eutropius mentions the thing in a more general manner  in his conversations with his friends he frequently acknowledged that of all arts the most difficult was the art of reigning and he expressed himself on that favorite topic with a degree of warmth which could be the result only of experience how often was he accustomed to say is it the interest of four or five ministers to combine together to deceive their sovereign secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity the truth is concealed from his knowledge he can see only with their eyes he hears nothing but their misrepresentations he confers the most important offices upon vice and weakness and disgraces the most virtuous and deserving among his subjects by such infamous arts added diocletian the best and wisest princes are sold to the venal corruption of their courtiers hist august p         vopiscus had learned this conversation from his father  a just estimate of greatness and the assurance of immortal fame improve our relish for the pleasures of retirement but the roman emperor had filled too important a character in the world to enjoy without alloy the comforts and security of a private condition it was impossible that he could remain ignorant of the troubles which afflicted the empire after his abdication it was impossible that he could be indifferent to their consequences fear sorrow and discontent sometimes pursued him into the solitude of salona his tenderness or at least his pride was deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter and the last moments of diocletian were embittered by some affronts which licinius and constantine might have spared the father of so many emperors and the first author of their own fortune a report though of a very and death a d     doubtful nature has reached our times that he prudently withdrew himself from their power by a voluntary death the younger victor slightly mentions the report but as diocletian had disobliged a powerful and successful party his memory has been loaded with every crime and misfortune it has been affirmed that he died raving mad that he was condemned as a criminal by the roman senate etc   before we dismiss the consideration of the life description of salona and the adjacent country and character of diocletian we may for a moment direct our view to the place of his retirement salona a principal city of his native province of dalmatia was near two hundred roman miles according to the measurement of the public highways from aquileia and the confines of italy and about two hundred and seventy from sirmium the usual residence of the emperors whenever they visited the illyrian frontier see the itiner p         edit wessel  a miserable village still preserves the name of salona but so late as the sixteenth century the remains of a theater and a confused prospect of broken arches and marble columns continued to attest its ancient splendor the abate fortis in his viaggio in dalmazia p    printed at venice in the year      in two small volumes in quarto quotes a ms account of the antiquities of salona composed by giambattista giustiniani about the middle of the xvith century  about six or seven miles from the city diocletian constructed a magnificent palace and we may infer from the greatness of the work how long he had meditated his design of abdicating the empire the choice of a spot which united all that could contribute either to health or to luxury did not require the partiality of a native the soil was dry and fertile the air is pure and wholesome and though extremely hot during the summer months this country seldom feels those sultry and noxious winds to which the coasts of istria and some parts of italy are exposed the views from the palace are no less beautiful than the soil and climate were inviting toward the west lies the fertile shore that stretches along the hadriatic in which a number of small islands are scattered in such a manner as to give this part of the sea the appearance of a great lake on the north side lies the bay which led to the ancient city of salona and the country beyond it appearing in sight forms a proper contrast to that more extensive prospect of water which the hadriatic presents both to the south and to the east toward the north the view is terminated by high and irregular mountains situated at a proper distance and in many places covered with villages woods and vineyards adams antiquities of diocletians palace at spalatro p   we may add a circumstance or two from the abate fortis the little stream of the hyader mentioned by lucan produces most exquisite trout which a sagacious writer perhaps a monk supposes to have been one of the principal reasons that determined diocletian in the choice of his retirement fortis p    the same author p    observes that a taste for agriculture is reviving at spalatro and that an experimental farm has lately been established near the city by a society of gentlemen   though constantine from a very obvious prejudice affects to mention the palace of diocletian with contempt constantin orat ad coetum sanct c    in this sermon the emperor or the bishop who composed it for him affects to relate the miserable end of all the persecutors of the church  yet one of their successors of diocletians palace who could only see it in a neglected and mutilated state celebrates its magnificence in terms of the highest admiration constantin porphyr de statu imper p     it covered an extent of ground consisting of between nine and ten english acres the form was quadrangular flanked with sixteen towers two of the sides were near six hundred and the other two near seven hundred feet in length the whole was constructed of a beautiful freestone extracted from the neighboring quarries of trau or tragutium and very little inferior to marble itself four streets intersecting each other at right angles divided the several parts of this great edifice and the approach to the principal apartment was from a very stately entrance which is still denominated the golden gate the approach was terminated by a peristylium of granite columns on one side of which we discover the square temple of aesculapius on the other the octagon temple of jupiter the latter of those deities diocletian revered as the patron of his fortunes the former as the protector of his health by comparing the present remains with the precepts of vitruvius the several parts of the building the baths bedchamber the atrium the basilica and the cyzicene corinthian and egyptian halls have been described with some degree of precision or at least of probability their forms were various their proportions just but they were all attended with two imperfections very repugnant to our modern notions of taste and convenience these stately rooms had neither windows nor chimnies they were lighted from the top for the building seems to have consisted of no more than one story and they received their heat by the help of pipes that were conveyed along the walls the range of principal apartments was protected toward the southwest by a portico of five hundred and seventeen feet long which must have formed a very noble and delightful walk when the beauties of painting and sculpture were added to those of the prospect  had this magnificent edifice remained in a solitary country it would have been exposed to the ravages of time but

messieurs adam and clerisseau attended by two draughtsmen visited spalatro in the month of july      the magnificent work which their journey produced was published in london seven years afterward  but there is room to suspect that the elegance of his designs and engraving has somewhat flattered the objects which it was their purpose to represent we decline of the arts are informed by a more recent and very judicious traveller that the awful ruins of spalatro are not less expressive of the decline of the arts than of the greatness of the roman empire in the time of diocletian i shall quote the words of the abate fortis ebastevolmente nota agli amatori dellarchitettura e dellantichita lopera del signor adams che a donato molto a que superbi vestigi collabituale eleganza del suo

architecture we must naturally believe that painting and sculpture had experienced a still more sensible decay the practice of architecture is directed by a few general and even mechanical rules but sculpture and above all painting propose to themselves the imitation not only of the forms of nature but of the characters and passions of the human soul in those sublime arts the dexterity of the hand is of little avail unless it is animated by fancy and guided by the most correct taste and observation  it is almost unnecessary to remark that the of letters civil distractions of the empire the license of the soldiers the inroads of the barbarians and the progress of despotism had proved very unfavourable to genius and even to learning the succession of illyrian princes restored the empire without restoring the sciences their military education was not calculated to inspire them with the love of letters and even the mind of diocletian however active and capacious in business was totally uninformed by study or speculation the professions of law and physic are of such common use and certain profit that they will always secure a sufficient number of practitioners endowed with a reasonable degree of abilities and knowledge but it does not appear that the students in those two faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who have flourished within that period the voice of poetry was silent history was reduced to dry and confused abridgments alike destitute of amusement and instruction a languid and affected eloquence was still retained in the pay and service of the emperors who encouraged not any arts except those which contributed to the gratification of their pride or the defense of their power the orator eumenius was secretary to the emperors maximian and constantius and professor of rhetoric in the college of autun his salary was six hundred thousand sesterces which according to the lowest computation of that age must have exceeded three thousand pounds a year he generously requested the permission of employing it in rebuilding the college see his oration de restaurandis scholis which though not exempt from vanity may atone for his panegyrics   the declining age of learning and of mankind is marked however by the rise and rapid progress the new platonists of the new platonists the school of alexandria silenced those of athens and the ancient sects enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fashionable teachers who recommended their system by the novelty of their method and the austerity of their manners several of these masters ammonius plotinus amelius and porphyry porphyry died about the time of diocletians abdication the life of his master plotinus which he composed will give us the most complete idea of the genius of the sect and the manners of its professors this very curious piece is inserted in fabricius bibliotheca graeca tom iv p        were men of profound thought and intense application but by mistaking the true object of philosophy their labors contributed much less to improve than to corrupt the human understanding the knowledge that is suited to our situation and powers the whole compass of moral natural and mathematical science was neglected by the new platonists whilst they exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes of metaphysics attempted to explore the secrets of the invisible world and studied to reconcile aristotle with plato on subjects of which both these philosophers were as ignorant as the rest of mankind consuming their reason in these deep but unsubstantial meditations their minds were exposed to illusions of fancy they flattered themselves that they possessed the secret of disengaging the soul from its corporeal prison claimed a familiar intercourse with demons and spirits and by a very singular revolution converted the study of philosophy into that of magic the ancient sages had derided the popular superstition after disguising its extravagance by the thin pretense of allegory the disciples of plotinus and porphyry became its most zealous defenders as they agreed with the christians in a few mysterious points of faith they attacked the remainder of their theological system with all the fury of civil war the new platonists would scarcely deserve a place in the history of science but in that of the church the mention of them will very frequently occur  chap xiv troubles after the abdication of diocletian  death of constantius  elevation of constantine and maxentius  six emperors at the same time  death of maximian and galerius  victories of constantine over maxentius and licinius  reunion of the empire under the authority of constantine the balance of power established by diocletian subsisted no longer than while it was sustained by the firm and dexterous hand of period of civil wars and confusion the founder it required such a fortunate mixture of different tempers and abilities as could scarcely be found or even expected a second time a d  0       two emperors without jealousy two caesars without ambition and the same general interest invariably pursued by four independent princes the abdication of diocletian and maximian was succeeded by eighteen years of discord and confusion the empire was afflicted by five civil wars and the remainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as a suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs who viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred strove to increase their respective forces at the expense of their subjects  as soon as diocletian and maximian had resigned the purple their station according to the character and situation of constantius rules of the new constitution was filled by the two caesars constantius and galerius who immediately assumed the title of augustus m de montesquieu considerations sur la grandeur et la decadence des romans c    supposes on the authority of orosius and eusebius that on this occasion the empire for the first time was really divided into two parts it is difficult however to discover in what respect the plan of galerius differed from that of diocletian  the honors of seniority and precedence were allowed to the former of those princes and he continued under a new appellation to administer his ancient department of gaul spain and britain the government of those ample provinces was sufficient to exercise his talents and to satisfy his ambition clemency temperance and moderation distinguished the amiable character of constantius and his fortunate subjects had frequently occasion to compare the virtues of their sovereign with the passions of maximian and even with the arts of diocletian hic non modo amabilis sed etiam venerabilis gallis suit praecipue quod diocletiani suspectam prudentiam et maximiani sanguinariam violentiam imperio ejus evaserant eutrop breviar x    instead of imitating their eastern pride and magnificence constantius preserved the modesty of a roman prince he declared with unaffected sincerity that his most valued treasure was in the hearts of his people and that whenever the dignity of the throne or the danger of the state required any extraordinary supply he could depend with confidence on their gratitude and liberality divitiis provincialium mel provinciarum ac privatorum studens fisci commoda non admodum affectans ducensque melius publicas opes a privatis haberi quam intra unum claustrum reservari id ibid he carried this maxim so far that whenever he gave an entertainment he was obliged to borrow a service of plate  the provincials of gaul spain and britain sensible of his worth and of their own happiness reflected with anxiety on the declining health of the emperor constantius and the tender age of his numerous family the issue of his second marriage with the daughter of maximian  the stern temper of galerius was cast in a very different mould and while he commanded of galerius the esteem of his subjects he seldom condescended to solicit their affections his fame in arms and above all the success of the persian war had elated his haughty mind which was naturally impatient of a superior or even of an equal if it were possible to rely on the partial testimony of an injudicious writer we might ascribe the abdication of diocletian to the menaces of galerius and relate the particulars of a private conversation between the two princes in which the former discovered as much pusillanimity as the latter displayed ingratitude and arrogance lactantius de mort persecutor c    were the particulars of this conference more consistent with truth and decency we might still ask how they came to the knowledge of an obscure rhetorician but there are many historians who put us in mind of the admirable saying of the great conde to cardinal de retz ces coquins nous font parler et agir comme ils auroient fait euxmemes a notre place  but these obscure anecdotes are sufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and conduct of diocletian whatever might otherwise have been his intentions if he had apprehended any danger from the violence of galerius his good sense would have instructed him to prevent the ignominious contest and as he had held the scepter with glory he would have resigned it without disgrace  after the elevation of constantius and galerius the two caesars severus and maximin to the rank of augusti two new caesars were required to supply their place and to complete the system of the imperial government diocletian was sincerely desirous of withdrawing himself from the world he considered galerius who had married his daughter as the firmest support of his family and of the empire and he consented without reluctance that his successor should assume the merit as well as the envy of the important nomination it was fixed without consulting the interest or inclination of the princes of the west each of them had a son who was arrived at the age of manhood and who might have been deemed the most natural candidates for the vacant honor but the impotent resentment of maximian was no longer to be dreaded and the moderate constantius though he might despise the dangers was humanely apprehensive of the calamities of civil war the two persons whom galerius promoted to the rank of caesar were much better suited to serve the views of his ambition and their principal recommendation seems to have consisted in the want of merit or personal consequence the first of these was daza or as he was afterward called maximin whose mother was the sister of galerius the unexperienced youth still betrayed by his manners and language his rustic education when to his own astonishment as well as that of the world he was invested by diocletian with the purple exalted to the dignity of caesar and entrusted with the sovereign command of egypt and syria sublatus nuper a pecoribus et silvis says lactantius de m p c    statim scutarius continuo protector mox tribunus postridie caesar accepit orientem aurelius victor is too liberal in giving him the whole portion of diocletian  at the same time severus a faithful servant addicted to pleasure but not incapable of business was sent to milan to receive from the reluctant hands of maximian the caesarean ornaments and the possession of italy and africa his diligence and fidelity are acknowledged even by lactantius de m p c     according to the forms of the constitution severus acknowledged the supremacy of the western emperor but he was absolutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor galerius who reserving to himself the intermediate countries from the confines of italy to those of syria firmly established his power over threefourths of the monarchy in the full confidence that the approaching death of constantius would leave him sole master of the roman world we are assured that he had arranged in his mind a long succession of future princes and that he meditated his own retreat from public life after he should have accomplished a glorious reign of about twenty years these schemes however rest only on the very doubtful authority of lactantius de m p c  0   but within less than eighteen months two unexpected revolutions overturned the ambitious schemes of galerius the hopes of uniting the ambition of galerius disappointed by two revolutions western provinces to his empire were disappointed by the elevation of constantine whilst italy and africa were lost by the successful revolt of maxentius  i the fame of constantine has rendered posterity birth education and escape of constantine a d     attentive to the most minute circumstances of his life and actions the place of his birth as well as the condition of his mother helena have been the subject not only of literary but of national disputes notwithstanding the recent tradition which assigns for her father a british king we are obliged to confess that helena was the daughter of an innkeeper this tradition unknown to the contemporaries of constantine was invented in the darkness of monasteries was embellished by jeffrey of monmouth and the writers of the xiith century has been defended by our antiquarians of the last age and is seriously related in the ponderous history of england compiled by mr carte vol i p     he transports however the kingdom of coil the imaginary father of helena from essex to the wall of antoninus  but at the same time we may defend the legality of her marriage against those who have represented her as the concubine of constantius eutropius x   expresses in a few words the real truth and the occasion of the error ex obscuriori matrimonio ejus filius zosimus l ii p    eagerly seized the most unfavourable report and is followed by orosius vii    whose authority is oddly enough overlooked by the indefatigable but partial tillemont by insisting on the divorce of helena diocletian acknowledged her marriage  the great constantine was most probably born at naissus in dacia there are three opinions with regard to the place of constantines birth   our english antiquarians were used to dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyrist britannias illic oriendo nobiles fecisti but this celebrated passage may be referred with as much propriety to the accession as to the nativity of constantine   some of the modern greeks have ascribed the honor of his birth to drepanum a town on the gulf of nicomedia cellarius tom ii p     which constantine dignified with the name of helenopolis and justinian adorned with many splendid buildings procop de aedificiis v   it is indeed probable enough that helenas father kept an inn at drepanum and that constantius might lodge there when he returned from a persian embassy in the reign of aurelian but in the wandering life of a soldier the place of his marriage and the places where his children are born have very little connection with each other   the claim of naissus is supported by the anonymous writer published at the end of ammianus p   0 and who in general copied very good materials and it is confirmed by julius firmicius de astrologia l i c   who flourished under the reign of constantine himself some objections have been raised against the integrity of the text and the application of the passage of firmicius but the former is established by the best mss and the latter is very ably defended by lipsius de magnitudine romana l iv c    et supplement  and it is not surprising that in a family and province distinguished only by the profession of arms the youth should discover very little inclination to improve his mind by the acquisition of knowledge literis minus instructus anonym ad ammian p   0  he was about eighteen years a d     of age when his father was promoted to the rank of caesar but that fortunate event was attended with his mothers divorce and the splendor of an imperial alliance reduced the son of helena to a state of disgrace and humiliation instead of following constantius in the west he remained in the service of diocletian signalized his valor in the wars of egypt and persia and gradually rose to the honorable station of a tribune of the first order the figure of constantius was tall and majestic he was dexterous in all his exercises intrepid in war affable in peace in his whole conduct the active spirit of youth was tempered by habitual prudence and while his mind was engrossed by ambition he appeared cold and insensible to the allurements of pleasure the favor of the people and soldiers who had named him as a worthy candidate for the rank of caesar served only to exasperate the jealousy of galerius and though prudence might restrain him from exercising any open violence an absolute monarch is seldom at a loss how to execute a sure and secret revenge galerius or perhaps his own courage exposed him to single combat with a sarmatian anonym p   0 and with a monstrous lion see praxagoras apud phocium p    praxagoras an athenian philosopher had written a life of constantine in two books which are now lost he was a contemporary  every hour increased the danger of constantine and the anxiety of his father who by repeated letters expressed the warmest desire of embracing his son for some time the policy of galerius supplied him with delays and excuses but it was impossible long to refuse so natural a request of his associate without maintaining his refusal by arms the permission of the journey was reluctantly granted and whatever precautions the emperor might have taken to intercept a return the consequences of which he with so much reason apprehended they were effectually disappointed by the incredible diligence of constantine zosimus l ii p       lactantius de m p c    the former tells a very foolish story that constantine caused all the posthorses which he had used to be hamstrung such a bloody execution without preventing a pursuit would have scattered suspicions and might have stopped his journey  leaving the palace of nicomedia in the night he traveled post through bithynia thrace dacia pannonia italy and gaul and amidst the joyful acclamations of the people reached the port of boulogne in the very moment when his father was preparing to embark for britain anonym p   0 panegyr veter vii   but zosimus l ii p    eusebius de vit constant l i c    and lactantius de m p c    suppose with less accuracy that he found his father on his deathbed   the british expedition and an easy victory death of constantius and elevation of constantine a d  0  july    over the barbarians of caledonia were the last exploits of the reign of constantius he ended his life in the imperial palace of york fifteen months after he had received the title of augustus and almost fourteen years and a half after he had been promoted to the rank of caesar his death was immediately succeeded by the elevation of constantine the ideas of inheritance and succession are so very familiar that the generality of mankind consider them as founded not only in reason but in nature itself our imagination readily transfers the same principles from private property to public dominion and whenever a virtuous father leaves behind him a son whose merit seems to justify the esteem or even the hopes of the people the joint influence of prejudice and of affection operates with irresistible weight the flower of the western armies had followed constantius into britain and the national troops were reinforced by a numerous body of alemanni who obeyed the orders of crocus one of their hereditary chieftains cunctis qui aderant annitentibus sed praecipue croco alii eroco alamannorum rege auxilii gratia constantium comitato imperium capit victor junior c    this is perhaps the first instance of a barbarian king who assisted the roman arms with an independent body of his own subjects the practice grew familiar and at last became fatal  the opinion of their own importance and the assurance that britain gaul and spain would acquiesce in their nomination were diligently inculcated to the legions by the adherents of constantine the soldiers were asked whether they could hesitate a moment between the honor of placing at their head the worthy son of their beloved emperor and the ignominy of tamely expecting the arrival of some obscure stranger on whom it might please the sovereign of asia to bestow the armies and provinces of the west it was insinuated to them that gratitude and liberality held a distinguished place among the virtues of constantine nor did that artful prince show himself to the troops till they were prepared to salute him with the names of augustus and emperor the throne was the object of his desires and had he been less actuated by ambition it was his only means of safety he was well acquainted with the character and sentiments of galerius and sufficiently apprized that if he wished to live he must determine to reign the decent and even obstinate resistance which he chose to affect his panegyrist eumenius vii   ventures to affirm in the presence of constantine that he put spurs to his horse and tried but in vain to escape from the hands of his soldiers  was contrived to justify his usurpation nor did he yield to the acclamations of the army till he had provided the proper materials for a letter which he immediately dispatched to the emperor of the east constantine informed him of the melancholy event of his fathers death modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession and respectfully lamented that the affectionate violence of his troops had not permitted him to solicit the imperial purple in the regular and constitutional manner the first emotions of galerius were those of surprise disappointment and rage and as he could seldom restrain his passions he loudly threatened that he would commit to the flames both the letter and the messenger but his resentment insensibly he is acknowledged by galerius who gives him only the title of caesar and that of augustus to severus subsided and when he recollected the doubtful chance of war when he had weighed the character and strength of his adversary he consented to embrace the honorable accommodation which the prudence of constantine had left open to him without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the british army galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the sovereign of the provinces beyond the alps but he gave him only the title of caesar and the fourth rank among the roman princes whilst he conferred the vacant place of augustus on his favorite severus the apparent harmony of the empire was still preserved and constantine who already possessed the substance expected without impatience an opportunity of obtaining the honors of supreme power lactantius de m p c    eumenius vii   gives a rhetorical turn to the whole transaction   the children of constantius by his second marriage were six in number three of either sex the brothers and sisters of constantine and whose imperial descent might have solicited a preference over the meaner extraction of the son of helena but constantine was in the thirtysecond year of his age in the full vigor both of mind and body at the time when the eldest of his brothers could not possibly be more than thirteen years old his claim of superior merit had been allowed and ratified by the dying emperor the choice of constantine by his dying father which is warranted by reason and insinuated by eumenius seems to be confirmed by the most unexceptionable authority the concurring evidence of lactantius de m p c    and of libanius oration i of eusebius in vit constantin l i c       and of julian oration i  in his last moments constantius bequeathed to his eldest son the care of the safety as well as greatness of the family conjuring him to assume both the authority and the sentiments of a father with regard to the children of theodora their liberal education advantageous marriages the secure dignity of their lives and the first honors of the state with which they were invested attest the fraternal affection of constantine and as those princes possessed a mild and grateful disposition they submitted without reluctance to the superiority of his genius and fortune of the three sisters of constantine constantia married the emperor licinius anastasia the caesar bassianus and eutropia the consul nepotianus the three brothers were dalmatius julius constantius and annibalianus of whom we shall have occasion to speak hereafter   ii the ambitious spirit of galerius was discontent of the romans at the apprehension of taxes scarcely reconciled to the disappointment of his views upon the gallic provinces before the unexpected loss of italy wounded his pride as well as power in a still more sensible part the long absence of the emperors had filled rome with discontent and indignation and the people gradually discovered that the preference given to nicomedia and milan was not to be ascribed to the particular inclination of diocletian but to the permanent form of government which he had instituted it was in vain that a few months after his abdication his successors dedicated under his name those magnificent baths whose ruins still supply the ground as well as the materials for so many churches and convents see gruter inscrip p     the six princes are all mentioned diocletian and maximian as the senior augusti and fathers of the emperors they jointly dedicate for the use of their own romans this magnificent edifice the architects have delineated the ruins of these thermae and the antiquarians particularly donatus and nardini have ascertained the ground which they covered one of the great rooms is now the carthusian church and even one of the porters lodges is sufficient to form another church which belongs to the feuillans  the tranquillity of those elegant recesses of ease and luxury was disturbed by the impatient murmurs of the romans and a report was insensibly circulated that the sums expended in erecting those buildings would soon be required at their hands about that time the avarice of galerius or perhaps the exigencies of the state had induced him to make a very strict and rigorous inquisition into the property of his subjects for the purpose of a general taxation both on their lands and on their persons a very minute survey appears to have been taken of their real estates and wherever there was the slightest suspicion of concealment torture was very freely employed to obtain a sincere declaration of their personal wealth see lactantius de m p c        the privileges which had exalted italy above the rank of the provinces were no longer regarded and the officers of the revenue already began to number the roman people and to settle the proportion of the new taxes even when the spirit of freedom had been utterly extinguished the tamest subjects have sometimes ventured to resist an unprecedented invasion of their property but on this occasion the injury was aggravated by the insult and the sense of private interest was quickened by that of national honor the conquest of macedonia as we have already observed had delivered the roman people from the weight of personal taxes though they had experienced every form of despotism they had now enjoyed that exemption near five hundred years nor could they patiently brook the insolence of an illyrian peasant who from his distant residence in asia presumed to number rome among the tributary cities of his empire the rising fury of the people was encouraged by the authority or at least the connivance of the senate and the feeble remains of the praetorian guards who had reason to apprehend their own dissolution embraced so honorable a pretense and declared their readiness to draw their swords in the service of their oppressed country it was the wish and it soon became the hope of every citizen that after expelling from italy their foreign tyrants they should elect a prince who by the place of his residence and by his maxims of government might once more deserve the title of roman emperor the name as well as the situation of maxentius determined in his favor the popular enthusiasm  maxentius was the son of the emperor maximian maxentius declared emperor at rome a d  0    th oct and he had married the daughter of galerius his birth and alliance seemed to offer him the fairest promise of succeeding to the empire but his vices and incapacity procured him the same exclusion from the dignity of caesar which constantine had deserved by a dangerous superiority of merit the policy of galerius preferred such associates as would never disgrace the choice nor dispute the commands of their benefactor an obscure stranger was therefore raised to the throne of italy and the son of the late emperor of the west was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a villa a few miles distant from the capital the gloomy passions of his soul shame vexation and rage were inflamed by envy on the news of constantines success but the hopes of maxentius revived with the public discontent and he was easily persuaded to unite his personal injury and pretensions with the cause of the roman people two praetorian tribunes and a commissary of provisions undertook the management of the conspiracy and as every order of men was actuated by the same spirit the immediate event was neither doubtful nor difficult the prefect of the city and a few magistrates who maintained their fidelity to severus were massacred by the guards and maxentius invested with the imperial ornaments was acknowledged by the applauding senate and people as the protector of the roman freedom and dignity it is uncertain whether maximian was previously acquainted with the conspiracy but as soon as the standard of rebellion was erected at rome the old emperor broke from the retirement maximian reassumes the purple where the authority of diocletian had condemned him to pass a life of melancholy solitude and concealed his returning ambition under the disguise of paternal tenderness at the request of his son and of the senate he condescended to reassume the purple his ancient dignity his experience and his fame in arms added strength as well as reputation to the party of maxentius the vith panegyric represents the conduct of maximian in the most favorable light and the ambiguous expression of aurelius victor retractante diu may signify either that he contrived or that he opposed the conspiracy see zosimus l ii p    and lactantius de m p c      according to the advice or rather the orders of his colleague the emperor severus immediately hastened to rome in the full confidence defeat and death of severus that by his unexpected celerity he should easily suppress the tumult of an unwarlike populace commanded by a licentious youth but he found on his arrival the gates of the city shut against him the walls filled with men and arms an experienced general at the head of the rebels and his own troops without spirit or affection a large body of moors deserted to the enemy allured by the promise of a large donative and if it be true that they had been levied by maximian in his african war preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial ties of allegiance anulinus the praetorian prefect declared himself in favor of maxentius and drew after him the most considerable part of the troops accustomed to obey his commands rome according to the expression of an orator recalled her armies and the unfortunate severus destitute of force and of counsel retired or rather fled with precipitation to ravenna here he might for some time have been safe the fortifications of ravenna were able to resist the attempts and the morasses that surrounded the town were sufficient to prevent the approach of the italian army the sea which severus commanded with a powerful fleet secured him an inexhaustible supply of provisions and gave a free entrance to the legions which on the return of spring would advance to his assistance from illyricum and the east maximian who conducted the siege in person was soon convinced that he might waste his time and his army in the fruitless enterprise and that he had nothing to hope either from force or famine with an art more suitable to the character of diocletian than to his own he directed his attack not so much against the walls of ravenna as against the mind of severus the treachery which he had experienced disposed that unhappy prince to distrust the most sincere of his friends and adherents the emissaries of maximian easily persuaded his credulity that a conspiracy was formed to betray the town and prevailed upon his fears not to expose himself to the discretion of an irritated conqueror but to accept the faith of an honorable capitulation he was at first received with humanity and treated with respect maximian conducted the captive emperor to rome and gave him the most solemn assurances that he had secured his life by the resignation of the purple but severus could obtain only an easy death and an imperial funeral when the sentence was a d  0  february signed to him the manner of executing it was left to his own choice he preferred the favorite mode of the ancients that of opening his veins and as soon as he expired his body was carried to the sepulcher which had been constructed for the family of gallienus the circumstances of this war and the death of severus are very doubtfully and variously told in our ancient fragments see tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv part i p     i have endeavored to extract from them a consistent and probable narration   though the characters of constantine and maxentius had very little affinity with each other their situation and interest were the same and maximian gives his daughter fausta and the title of augustus to constantine a d  0  march    prudence seemed to require that they should unite their forces against the common enemy notwithstanding the superiority of his age and dignity the indefatigable maximian passed the alps and courting a personal interview with the sovereign of gaul carried with him his daughter fausta as the pledge of the new alliance the marriage was celebrated at arles with every circumstance of magnificence and the ancient colleague of diocletian who again asserted his claim to the western empire conferred on his soninlaw and ally the title of augustus by consenting to receive that honor from maximian constantine seemed to embrace the cause of rome and of the senate but his professions were ambiguous and his assistance slow and ineffectual he considered with attention the approaching contest between the masters of italy and the emperor of the east and was prepared to consult his own safety or ambition in the event of the war the vith panegyric was pronounced to celebrate the elevation of constantine but the prudent orator avoids the mention either of galerius or of maxentius he introduces only one slight allusion to the actual troubles and to the majesty of rome   the importance of the occasion called for the galerius invades italy presence and abilities of galerius at the head of a powerful army collected from illyricum and the east he entered italy resolved to revenge the death of severus and to chastise the rebellious romans or as he expressed his intentions in the furious language of a barbarian to extirpate the senate and to destroy the people by the sword but the skill of maximian had concerted a prudent system of defense the invader found every place hostile fortified and inaccessible and though he forced his way as far as narni within sixty miles of rome his dominion in italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp sensible of the increasing difficulties of his enterprise the haughty galerius made the first advances toward a reconciliation and dispatched two of his most considerable officers to tempt the roman princes by the offer of a conference and the declaration of his paternal regard for maxentius who might obtain much more from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful chance of war with regard to this negotiation see the fragments of an anonymous historian published by valesius at the end of his edition of ammianus marcellinus p     these fragments have furnished us with several curious and as it should seem authentic anecdotes  the offers of galerius were rejected with firmness his perfidious friendship refused with contempt and it was not long before he discovered that unless he provided for his safety by a timely retreat he had some reason to apprehend the fate of severus the wealth which the romans defended against his rapacious tyranny they freely contributed for his destruction the name of maximian the popular arts of his son the secret distribution of large sums and the promise of still more liberal rewards checked the ardour and corrupted the fidelity of the illyrian legions and when galerius at length gave the signal of the retreat it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on his veterans not to desert a banner which had so often conducted them to victory and honor a contemporary writer assigns two other causes for the failure of the expedition but they are both of such a nature that a cautious historian will scarcely venture to adopt them we are told that galerius who had formed a very imperfect notion of the greatness of rome by the cities of the east with which he was acquainted found his forces inadequate to the siege of that immense capital but the extent of a city serves only to render it more accessible to the enemy rome had long since been accustomed to submit on the approach of a conqueror nor could the temporary enthusiasm of the people have long contended against the discipline and valor of the legions we are likewise informed that the legions themselves were struck with horror and remorse and that those pious sons of the republic refused to violate the sanctity of their venerable parent lactantius de m p c    the former of these reasons is probably taken from virgils shepherd illam ego huic nostrae similem meliboee putavi etc lactantius delights in these poetical allusions  but when we recollect with how much ease in the more ancient civil wars the zeal of party and the habits of military obedience had converted the native citizens of rome into her most implacable enemies we shall be inclined to distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and barbarians who had never beheld italy till they entered it in a hostile manner had they not been restrained by motives of a more interested nature they would probably have answered galerius in the words of caesars veterans if our general wishes to lead us to the banks of the tyber we are prepared to trace out his camp whatsoever walls he has determined to level with the ground our hands are ready to work the engines nor shall we hesitate should the name of the devoted city be rome itself these are indeed the expressions of a poet but of a poet who has been distinguished and even censured for his strict adherence to the truth of history castra super tusci si ponere tybridis undas jubeas hesperios audax veniam metator in agros tu quoscunque voses in planum effundere muros his aries actus disperget saxa lacertis illa licet penitus tolli quam jusseris urbem roma sit lucan pharsal i         the legions of galerius exhibit a very melancholy his retreat proof of their disposition by the ravages which they committed in their retreat they murdered they ravished they plundered they drove away the flocks and herds of the italians they burnt the villages through which they passed and they endeavored to destroy the country which it had not been in their power to subdue during the whole march maxentius hung on their rear but he very prudently declined a general engagement with those brave and desperate veterans his father had undertaken a second journey into gaul with the hope of persuading constantine who had assembled an army on the frontier to join the pursuit and to complete the victory but the actions of constantine were guided by reason and not by resentment he persisted in the wise resolution of maintaining a balance of power in the divided empire and he no longer hated galerius when that aspiring prince had ceased to be an object of terror lactantius de m p c    zosim l ii p    the latter insinuates that constantine in his interview with maximian had promised to declare war against galerius   the mind of galerius was the most susceptible elevation of licinius to the rank of augustus of the sterner passions but it was not however incapable of a sincere and lasting friendship licinius whose manners as well as character were a d  0  nov    not unlike his own seems to have engaged both his affection and esteem their intimacy had commenced in the happier period perhaps of their youth and obscurity it had been cemented by the freedom and dangers of a military life they had advanced almost by equal steps through the successive honors of the service and as soon as galerius was invested with the imperial dignity he seems to have conceived the design of raising his companion to the same rank with himself during the short period of his prosperity he considered the rank of caesar as unworthy of the age and merit of licinius and rather chose to reserve for him the place of constantius and the empire of the west while the emperor was employed in the italian war he entrusted his friend with the defense of the danube and immediately after his return from that unfortunate expedition he invested licinius with the vacant purple of severus resigning to his immediate command the provinces of illyricum m de tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv part i p     has proved that licinius without passing through the intermediate rank of caesar was declared augustus the   th of november a d  0  after the return of galerius from italy  the and of maximin news of his promotion was no sooner carried into the east than maximin who governed or rather oppressed the countries of egypt and syria betrayed his envy and discontent disdained the inferior name of caesar and notwithstanding the prayers as well as arguments of galerius exacted almost by violence the equal title of augustus lactantius de m p c    when galerius declared licicinius augustus with himself he tried to satisfy his younger associates by inventing for constantine and maximin not maxentius see baluze p    the new title of sons of the augusti but when maximin acquainted him that he had been saluted augustus by the army galerius was obliged to acknowledge him as well as constantine as equal associates in the imperial dignity  for the first and indeed for the last time the roman world was administered by six emperors in the west constantine and maxentius affected six emperors a d  0  to reverence their father maximian in the east licinius and maximin honored with more real consideration their benefactor galerius the opposition of interest and the memory of a recent war divided the empire into two great hostile powers but their mutual fears produced an apparent tranquillity and even a feigned reconciliation till the death of the elder princes of maximian and more particularly of galerius gave a new direction to the views and passions of their surviving associates  when maximian had reluctantly abdicated the misfortunes of maximian empire the venal orators of the times applauded his philosophic moderation when his ambition excited or at least encouraged a civil war they returned thanks to his generous patriotism and gently censured that love of ease and retirement which had withdrawn him from the public service see panegyr vet vi   audi doloris nostri liberam vocem etc the whole passage is imagined with artful flattery and expressed with an easy flow of eloquence  but it was impossible that minds like those of maximian and his son could long possess in harmony an undivided power maxentius considered himself as the legal sovereign of italy elected by the roman senate and people nor would he endure the control of his father who arrogantly declared that by his name and abilities the rash youth had been established on the throne the cause was solemnly pleaded before the praetorian guards and those troops who dreaded the severity of the old emperor espoused the party of maxentius lactantius de m p c    zosim l ii p    a report was spread that maxentius was the son of some obscure syrian and had been substituted by the wife of maximian as her own child see aurelius victor anonym valesian and panegyr vet ix      the life and freedom of maximian were however respected and he retired from italy into illyricum affecting to lament his past conduct and secretly contriving new mischiefs but galerius who was well acquainted with his character soon obliged him to leave his dominions and the last refuge of the disappointed maximian was the court of his soninlaw constantine ab urbe pulsum ab italia fugatum ab illyrico repudiatum tuis provinciis tuis copiis tuo palatio recepisti eumen in panegyr vet vii     he was received with respect by that artful prince and with the appearance of filial tenderness by the empress fausta that he might remove every suspicion he resigned the imperial purple a second time lactantius de m p c    yet after the resignation of the purple constantine still continued to maximian the pomp and honors of the imperial dignity and on all public occasions gave the right hand place to his fatherinlaw panegyr vet vii     professing himself at length convinced of the vanity of greatness and ambition had he persevered in this resolution he might have ended his life with less dignity indeed than in his first retirement yet however with comfort and reputation but the near prospect of a throne brought back to his remembrance the state from whence he was fallen and he resolved by a desperate effort either to reign or to perish an incursion of the franks had summoned constantine with a part of his army to the banks of the rhine the remainder of the troops were stationed in the southern provinces of gaul which lay exposed to the enterprises of the italian emperor and a considerable treasure was deposited in the city of arles maximian either craftily invented or hastily credited a vain report of the death of constantine without hesitation he ascended the throne seized the treasure and scattering it with his accustomed profusion among the soldiers endeavored to awake in their minds the memory of his ancient dignity and exploits before he could establish his authority or finish the negotiation which he appears to have entered into with his son maxentius the celerity of constantine defeated all his hopes on the first news of his perfidy and ingratitude that prince returned by rapid marches from the rhine to the saone embarked on the last mentioned river at chalons and at lions trusting himself to the rapidity of the rhone arrived at the gates of arles with a military force which it was impossible for maximian to resist and which scarcely permitted him to take refuge in the neighboring city of marseilles the narrow neck of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified against the besiegers whilst the sea was open either for the escape of maximian or for the succors of maxentius if the latter should choose to disguise his invasion of gaul under the honorable pretense of defending a distressed or as he might allege an injured father apprehensive of the fatal consequences of delay constantine gave orders for an immediate assault but the scalingladders were found too short for the height of the walls and marseilles might have sustained as long a siege as it formerly did against the arms of caesar if the garrison conscious either of their fault or of their danger had not purchased their pardon by delivering up the city and the person of maximian a secret but irrevocable sentence of death was pronounced against his death a d   0 february the usurper he obtained only the same favor which he had indulged to severus and it was published to the world that oppressed by the remorse of his repeated crimes he strangled himself with his own hands after he had lost the assistance and disdained the moderate counsels of diocletian the second period of his active life was a series of public calamities and personal mortifications which were terminated in about three years by an ignominious death he deserved his fate but we should find more reason to applaud the humanity of constantine if he had spared an old man the benefactor of his father and the father of his wife during the whole of this melancholy transaction it appears that fausta sacrificed the sentiments of nature to her conjugal duties zosim l ii p    eumenius in panegyr vet vii        the latter of these has undoubtedly represented the whole affair in the most favorable light for his sovereign yet even from this partial narrative we may conclude that the repeated clemency of constantine and the reiterated treasons of maximian as they are described by lactantius de m p c     0 and copied by the moderns are destitute of any historical foundation   the last years of galerius were less shameful death of galerius a d     may and unfortunate and though he had filled with more glory the subordinate station of caesar than the superior rank of augustus he preserved till the moment of his death the first place among the princes of the roman world he survived his retreat from italy about four years and wisely relinquishing his views of universal empire he devoted the remainder of his life to the enjoyment of pleasure and to the execution of some works of public utility among which we may distinguish the discharging into the danube the superfluous waters of the lake pelso and the cutting down the immense forests that encompassed it an operation worthy of a monarch since it gave an extensive country to the agriculture of his pannonian subjects aurelius victor c  0 but that lake was situated on the upper pannonia near the borders of noricum and the province of valeria a name which the wife of galerius gave to the drained country undoubtedly lay between the drove and the danube sextus rufus c   i should therefore suspect that victor has confounded the lake pelso with the volocean marches or as they are now called the lake sabaton it is placed in the heart of valeria and its present extent is not less than    hungarian miles about  0 english in length and two in breadth see severini pannonia l i c    his death was occasioned by a very painful and lingering disorder his body swelled by an intemperate course of life to an unwieldy corpulence was covered with ulcers and devoured by innumerable swarms of those insects who have given their name to a most loathsome disease lactantius de m p c    and eusebius l viii c    describe the symptoms and progress of his disorder with singular accuracy and apparent pleasure  but as galerius had offended a very zealous and powerful party among his subjects his sufferings instead of exciting their compassion have been celebrated as the visible effects of divine justice if any like the late dr jortin remarks on ecclesiastical history vol ii p  0       still delight in recording the wonderful deaths of the persecutors i would recommend to their perusal an admirable passage of grotius hist l vii p     concerning the last illness of philip ii of spain  he had no sooner expired in his palace of nicomedia than the two emperors who were indebted for their purple to his favor began to collect his dominion shared between maximin and licinius their forces with the intention either of disputing or of dividing the dominions which he had left without a master they were persuaded however to desist from the former design and to agree in the latter the provinces of asia fell to the share of maximin and those of europe augmented the portion of licinius the hellespont and the thracian bosphorus formed their mutual boundary and the banks of those narrow seas which flowed in the midst of the roman world were covered with soldiers with arms and with fortifications the deaths of maximian and of galerius reduced the number of emperors to four the sense of their true interest soon connected licinius and constantine a secret alliance was concluded between maximin and maxentius and their unhappy subjects expected with terror the bloody consequences of their inevitable dissensions which were no longer restrained by the fear or the respect which they had entertained for galerius see eusebius l ix    0 lactantius de m p c    zosimus is less exact and evidently confounds maximian with maximin   among so many crimes and misfortunes occasioned administration of constantine in gaul a d  0       by the passions of the roman princes there is some pleasure in discovering a single action which may be ascribed to their virtue in the sixth year of his reign constantine visited the city of autun and generously remitted the arrears of tribute reducing at the same time the proportion of their assessment from twentyfive to eighteen thousand heads subject to the real and personal capitation see the viiith panegyr in which eumenius displays in the presence of constantine the misery and the gratitude of the city of autun  yet even this indulgence affords the most unquestionable proof of the public misery this tax was so extremely oppressive either in itself or in the mode of collecting it that whilst the revenue was increased by extortion it was diminished by despair a considerable part of the territory of autun was left uncultivated and great numbers of the provincials rather chose to live as exiles and outlaws than to support the weight of civil society it is but too probable that the bountiful emperor relieved by a partial act of liberality one among the many evils which he had caused by his general maxims of administration but even those maxims were less the effect of choice than of necessity and if we except the death of maximian the reign of constantine in gaul seems to have been the most innocent and even virtuous period of his life the provinces were protected by his presence from the inroads of the barbarians who either dreaded or experienced his active valor after a signal victory over the franks and alemanni several of their princes were exposed by his order to

capable of receiving italy and africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant as contemptible as he was odious the zeal of flattery and faction has indeed too frequently sacrificed the reputation of the vanquished to the glory of their successful rivals but even those writers who have revealed with the most freedom and pleasure the faults of constantine unanimously confess that maxentius was cruel rapacious and profligate julian excludes maxentius from the banquet of the caesars with abhorrence and contempt and zosimus l ii p    accuses him of every kind of cruelty and profligacy  he had the good fortune to suppress a slight rebellion in africa the governor and a few adherents had been guilty the province suffered for their crime the flourishing cities of cirtha and carthage and the whole extent of that fertile country were wasted by fire and sword the abuse of victory was followed by the abuse of law and justice a formidable army of sycophants and delators invaded africa the

capital was no less deserving of compassion than that of africa the wealth of rome supplied an inexhaustible fund for his vain and prodigal expenses and the ministers of his revenue were skilled in the arts of rapine it was under his reign that the method of exacting a free gift from the senators was first invented and as the sum was insensibly increased the pretenses of levying it a victory a birth a marriage or an imperial consulship were proportionably multiplied the passage of aurelius victor should be read in the following manner primus instituto pessimo munerum specie patres orator esque pecuniam confer prodigenti sibi cogeret  maxentius had imbibed the same implacable aversion to the senate which had characterized most of the former tyrants of rome nor was it possible for his ungrateful temper to forgive the generous fidelity which had raised him to the throne and supported him against all his enemies the lives of the senators were exposed to his jealous suspicions the dishonor of their wives and daughters heightened the gratification of his sensual passions panegyr vet ix   eusebius hist eccles viii    et in vit constant i       rusinus c    the virtuous matron who stabbed herself to escape the violence of maxentius was a christian wife to the prefect of the city and her name was sophronia it still remains a question among the casuists whether on such occasions suicide is justifiable  it may be presumed that an imperial lover was seldom reduced to sigh in vain but whenever persuasion proved ineffectual he had recourse to violence and there remains one memorable example of a noble matron who preserved her chastity by a voluntary death the soldiers were the only order of men whom he appeared to respect or studied to please he filled rome and italy with armed troops connived at their tumults suffered them with impunity to plunder and even to massacre the defenseless people praetorianis caedem vulgi quondam annucret is the vague expression of aurelius victor see more particular though somewhat different accounts of a tumult and massacre which happened at rome in eusebius l viii c    and in zosimus l ii p     and indulging them in the same licentiousness which their emperor enjoyed maxentius often bestowed on his military favorites the splendid villa or the beautiful wife of a senator a prince of such a character alike incapable of governing either in peace or in war might purchase the support but he could never obtain the esteem of the army yet his pride was equal to his other vices whilst he passed his indolent life either within the walls of his palace or in the neighboring gardens of sallust he was repeatedly heard to declare that he alone was emperor and that the other princes were no more than his lieutenants on whom he had devolved the defense of the frontier provinces that he might enjoy without interruption the elegant luxury of the capital rome which had so long regretted the absence lamented during the six years of his reign the presence of her sovereign see in the panegyrics ix    a lively description of the indolence and vain pride of maxentius in another place the orator observes that the riches which rome had accumulated in a period of  0 0 years were lavished by the tyrant on his mercenary bands redemptis ad civil latrocinium manibus ingesserat   though constantine might view the conduct civil war between constantine and maxentius a d     of maxentius with abhorrence and the situation of the romans with compassion we have no reason to presume that he would have taken up arms to punish the one or to relieve the other but the tyrant of italy rashly ventured to provoke a formidable enemy whose ambition had been hitherto restrained by considerations of prudence rather than by principles of justice after the victory of constantine it was universally allowed that the motive of delivering the republic from a detested tyrant would at any time have justified his expedition into italy eusebius in vit constantin l i c    panegyr vet ix    after the death of maximian his titles according to the established custom had been erased and his statues thrown down with ignominy his son who had persecuted and deserted him when alive affected to display the most pious regard for his memory and gave orders that a similar treatment should be immediately inflicted on all the statues that had been erected in italy and africa to the honor of constantine that wise prince who sincerely wished to decline a war with the difficulty and importance of which he was sufficiently acquainted at first dissembled the insult and sought for redress by the milder expedients of negotiation till he was convinced that the hostile and ambitious designs of the italian emperor made it necessary for him to arm in his own defense maxentius who openly avowed his pretensions to the whole monarchy of the west had already prepared a very considerable force to invade the gallic provinces on the side of rhaetia and though he could not expect any assistance from licinius he was flattered with the hope that the legions of illyricum allured by his presents and promises would desert the standard of that prince and unanimously declare themselves his soldiers and subjects zosimus l ii p       nazarius in panegyr x        constantine no longer hesitated he had deliberated with caution he acted with vigor he gave a private audience to the ambassadors who in the name of the senate and people conjured him to deliver rome from a detested tyrant and without regarding the timid remonstrances of his council he resolved to prevent the enemy and to carry the war into the heart of italy see panegyr vet ix   omnibus fere tuis comitibus et ducibus non solum tacit mussantibus sed etiam aperte timentibus contra consilia hominum contra haruspicum monita ipse per temet liberandae urbis tempus venisse sentires the embassy of the romans is mentioned only by zonaras l xiii and by cedrenus in compend hist p   0 but those modern greeks had the opportunity of consulting many writers which have since been lost among which we may reckon the life of constantine by praxagoras photius p    has made a short extract from that historical work   the enterprise was as full of danger as of glory and the unsuccessful event of two former invasions was sufficient to inspire the most serious preparations apprehensions the veteran troops who revered the name of maximian had embraced in both those wars the party of his son and were now restrained by a sense of honor as well as of interest from entertaining an idea of a second desertion maxentius who considered the praetorian guards as the firmest defense of his throne had increased them to their ancient establishment and they composed including the rest of the italians who were inlisted into his service a formidable body of fourscore thousand men forty thousand moors and carthaginians had been raised since the reduction of africa even sicily furnished its proportion of troops and the armies of maxentius amounted to one hundred and seventy thousand foot and eighteen thousand horse the wealth of italy supplied the expenses of the war and the adjacent provinces were exhausted to form immense magazines of corn and every other kind of provisions the whole force of constantine consisted of ninety thousand foot and eight thousand horse zosimus l ii p    has given us this curious account of the forces on both sides he makes no mention of any naval armaments though we are assured panegyr vet ix    that the war was carried on by sea as well as by land and that the fleet of constantine took possession of sardinia corsica and the ports of italy  and as the defense of the rhine required an extraordinary attention during the absence of the emperor it was not in his power to employ above half his troops in the italian expedition unless he sacrificed the public safety to his private quarrel panegyr vet ix   it is not surprising that the orator should diminish the numbers with which his sovereign achieved the conquest of italy but it appears somewhat singular that he should esteem the tyrants army at no more than  00000 men  at the head of about forty thousand soldiers he marched to encounter an enemy whose numbers were at least four times superior to his own but the armies of rome placed at a secure distance from danger were enervated by indulgence and luxury habituated to the baths and theaters of rome they took the field with reluctance and were chiefly composed of veterans who had almost forgotten or of new levies who had never acquired the use of arms and the practice of war the hardy legions of gaul had long defended the frontiers of the empire against the barbarians of the north and in the performance of that laborious service their valor was exercised and their discipline confirmed there appeared the same difference between the leaders as between the armies caprice or flattery had tempted maxentius with the hopes of conquest but these aspiring hopes soon gave way to the habits of pleasure and the consciousness of his inexperience the intrepid mind of constantine had been trained from his earliest youth to war to action and to military command  when hannibal marched from gaul into italy constantine passes the alps he was obliged first to discover and then to open a way over mountains and through savage nations that had never yielded a passage to a regular army the three principal passages of the alps between gaul and italy are those of mount st bernard mount cenis and mount genevre tradition and a resemblance of names alps penninae had assigned the first of these for the march of hannibal see simler de alpibus the chevalier de folard polybe tom iv and m danville have led him over mount genevre but notwithstanding the authority of an experienced officer and a learned geographer the pretensions of mount cenis are supported in a specious not to say a convincing manner by m grosley observations sur litalie tom i p  0 etc  the alps were then guarded by nature they are now fortified by art citadels constructed with no less skill than labor and expense command every avenue into the plain and on that side render italy almost inaccessible to the enemies of the king of sardinia la brunette near suse demont exiles fenestrelles coni etc  but in the course of the intermediate period the generals who have attempted the passage have seldom experienced any difficulty or resistance in the age of constantine the peasants of the mountains were civilized and obedient subjects the country was plentifully stocked with provisions and the stupendous highways which the romans had carried over the alps opened several communications between gaul and italy see ammian marcellin xv  0 his description of the roads over the alps is clear lively and accurate  constantine preferred the road of the cottian alps or as it is now called of mount cenis and led his troops with such active diligence that he descended into the plain of piedmont before the court of maxentius had received any certain intelligence of his departure from the banks of the rhine the city of susa however which is situated at the foot of mount cenis was surrounded with walls and provided with a garrison sufficiently numerous to check the progress of an invader but the impatience of constantines troops disdained the tedious forms of a siege the same day that they appeared before susa they applied fire to the gates and ladders to the walls and mounting to the assault amidst a shower of stones and arrows they entered the place sword in hand and cut in pieces the greatest part of the garrison the flames were extinguished by the care of constantine and the remains of susa preserved from total destruction about forty miles from thence a more severe contest awaited him a numerous army of italians was assembled under the lieutenants of maxentius in the battle of turin plains of turin its principal strength consisted in a species of heavy cavalry which the romans since the decline of their discipline had borrowed from the nations of the east the horses as well as the men were clothed in complete armor the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions of their bodies the aspect of this cavalry was formidable their weight almost irresistible and as on this occasion their generals had drawn them up in a compact column or wedge with a sharp point and with spreading flanks they flattered themselves that they should easily break and trample down the army of constantine they might perhaps have succeeded in their design had not their experienced adversary embraced the same method of defense which in similar circumstances had been practiced by aurelian the skilful evolutions of constantine divided and baffled this massy column of cavalry the troops of maxentius fled in confusion toward turin and as the gates of the city were shut against them very few escaped the sword of the victorious pursuers by this important service turin deserved to experience the clemency and even favor of the conqueror he made his entry into the imperial palace of milan and almost all the cities of italy between the alps and the po not only acknowledged the power but embraced with zeal the party of constantine zosimus as well as eusebius hasten from the passage of the alps to the decisive action near rome we must apply to the two panegyrics for the intermediate actions of constantine   from milan to rome the aemilian and flaminian siege and battle of verona highways offered an easy march of about four hundred miles but though constantine was impatient to encounter the tyrant he prudently directed his operations against another army of italians who by their strength and position might either oppose his progress or in case of a misfortune might intercept his retreat ruricius pompeianus a general distinguished by his valor and ability had under his command the city of verona and all the troops that were stationed in the province of venetia as soon as he was informed that constantine was advancing toward him he detached a large body of cavalry which was defeated in an engagement near brescia and pursued by the gallic legions as far as the gates of verona the necessity the importance and the difficulties of the siege of verona immediately presented themselves to the sagacious mind of constantine the marquis maffei has examined the siege and battle of verona with that degree of attention and accuracy which was due to a memorable action that happened in his native country the fortifications of that city constructed by gallienus were less extensive than the modern walls and the amphitheatre was not included within their circumference see verona illustrata part i p       0 the city was accessible only by a narrow peninsula toward the west as the other three sides were surrounded by the adige a rapid river which covered the province of venetia from whence the besieged derived an inexhaustible supply of men and provisions it was not without great difficulty and after several fruitless attempts that constantine found means to pass the river at some distance above the city and in a place where the torrent was less violent he then encompassed verona with strong lines pushed his attacks with prudent vigor and repelled a desperate sally of pompeianus that intrepid general when he had used every means of defense that the strength of the place or that of the garrison could afford secretly escaped from verona anxious not for his own but for the public safety with indefatigable diligence he soon collected an army sufficient either to meet constantine in the field or to attack him if he obstinately remained within his lines the emperor attentive to the motions and informed of the approach of so formidable an enemy left a part of his legions to continue the operations of the siege whilst at the head of those troops on whose valor and fidelity he more particularly depended he advanced in person to engage the general of maxentius the army of gaul was drawn up in two lines according to the usual practice of war but their experienced leader perceiving that the numbers of the italians far exceeded his own suddenly changed his disposition and reducing the second extended the front of his first line to a just proportion with that of the enemy such evolutions which only veteran troops can execute without confusion in a moment of danger commonly prove decisive but as this engagement began toward the close of the day and was contested with great obstinacy during the whole night there was less room for the conduct of the generals than for the courage of the soldiers the return of light displayed the victory of constantine and a field of carnage covered with many thousands of the vanquished italians their general pompeianus was found among the slain verona immediately surrendered at discretion and the garrison was made prisoners of war they wanted chains for so great a multitude of captives and the whole council was at a loss but the sagacious conqueror imagined the happy expedient of converting into fetters the swords of the vanquished panegyr vet ix     when the officers of the victorious army congratulated their master on this important success they ventured to add some respectful complaints of such a nature however as the most jealous monarchs will listen to without displeasure they represented to constantine that not contented with performing all the duties of a commander he had exposed his own person with an excess of valor which almost degenerated into rashness and they conjured him for the future to pay more regard to the preservation of a life in which the safety of rome and of the empire was involved panegyr vet ix  0   while constantine signalized his conduct and indolence and fears of maxentius valor in the field the sovereign of italy appeared insensible of the calamities and danger of a civil was which raged in the heart of his dominions pleasure was still the only business of maxentius concealing or at least attempting to conceal from the public knowledge the misfortunes of his arms literas calamitatum suarum indices supprimebat panegyr vet ix     he indulged himself in a vain confidence which deferred the remedies of the approaching evil without deferring the evil itself remedia malorum potius quam mala differebat is the fine censure which tacitus passes on the supine indolence of vitellius  the rapid progress of constantine the marquis maffei has made it extremely probable that constantine was still at verona the  st of september a d     and that the memorable era of the indictions was dated from his conquest of the cisalpine gaul was scarcely sufficient to awaken him from this fatal security he flattered himself that his wellknown liberality and the majesty of the roman name which had already delivered him from two invasions would dissipate with the same facility the rebellious army of gaul the officers of experience and ability who had served under the banners of maximian were at length compelled to inform his effeminate son of the imminent danger to which he was reduced and with a freedom that at once surprised and convinced him to urge the necessity of preventing his ruin by a vigorous exertion of his remaining power the resources of maxentius both of men and money were still considerable the praetorian guards felt how strongly their own interest and safety were connected with his cause and a third army was soon collected more numerous than those which had been lost in the battles of turin and verona it was far from the intention of the emperor to lead his troops in person a stranger to the exercises of war he trembled at the apprehension of so dangerous a contest and as fear is commonly superstitious he listened with melancholy attention to the rumors of omens and presages which seemed to menace his life and empire shame at length supplied the place of courage and forced him to take the field he was unable to sustain the contempt of the roman people the circus resounded with their indignant clamours and they tumultuously besieged the gates of the palace reproaching the pusillanimity of their indolent sovereign and celebrating the heroic spirit of constantine see panegyr vet xi    lactantius de m p c     before maxentius left rome he consulted the sibylline books the guardians of these ancient oracles were as well versed in the arts of this world as they were ignorant of the secrets of fate and they returned him a very prudent answer which might adapt itself to the event and secure their reputation whatever should be the chance of arms illo die hostem romanorum esse periturum the vanquished prince became of course the enemy of rome   the celerity of constantines march has been victory of constantine near rome a d       th oct compared to the rapid conquest of italy by the first of the caesars nor is the flattering parallel repugnant to the truth of history since no more than fiftyeight days elapsed between the surrender of verona and the final decision of the war constantine had always apprehended that the tyrant would consult the dictates of fear and perhaps of prudence and that instead of risking his last hopes in a general engagement he would shut himself up within the walls of rome his ample magazines secured him against the danger of famine and as the situation of constantine admitted not of delay he might have been reduced to the sad necessity of destroying with fire and sword the imperial city the noblest reward of his victory and the deliverance of which had been the motive or rather indeed the pretense of the civil war see panegyr vet ix    x    the former of these orators magnifies the hoards of corn which maxentius had collected from africa and the islands and yet if there is any truth in the scarcity mentioned by eusebius in vit constantin l i c    the imperial granaries must have been open only to the soldiers  it was with equal surprise and pleasure that on his arrival at a place called saxa rubra about nine miles from rome maxentius tandem urbe in saxa rubra millia ferme novem aegerrime progressus aurelius victor see cellarius geograph antiq tom i p     saxa rubra was in the neighborhood of the cremera a trifling rivulet illustrated by the valor and glorious death of the three hundred fabii  he discovered the army of maxentius prepared to give him battle the post which maxentius had taken with the tyber in his rear is very clearly described by the two panegyrists ix    x     their long front filled a very spacious plain and their deep array reached to the banks of the tyber which covered their rear and forbade their retreat we are informed and we may believe that constantine disposed his troops with consummate skill and that he chose for himself the post of honor and danger distinguished by the splendor of his arms he charged in person the cavalry of his rival and his irresistible attack determined the fortune of the day the cavalry of maxentius was principally composed either of unwieldy cuirassiers or of light moors and numidians they yielded to the vigor of the gallic horse which possessed more activity than the one more firmness than the other the defeat of the two wings left the infantry without any protection on its flanks and the undisciplined italians fled without reluctance from the standard of a tyrant whom they had always hated and whom they no longer feared the praetorians conscious that their offenses were beyond the reach of mercy were animated by revenge and despair notwithstanding their repeated efforts those brave veterans were unable to recover the victory they obtained however an honorable death and it was observed that their bodies covered the same ground which had been occupied by their ranks exceptis latrocinii illius primis auctoribus qui desperata venia locum quem pugnae sumpserant texere corporibus panegyr vet ix     the confusion then became general and the dismayed troops of maxentius pursued by an implacable enemy rushed by thousands into the deep and rapid stream of the tyber the emperor himself attempted to escape back into the city over the milvian bridge but the crowds which pressed together through that narrow passage forced him into the river where he was immediately drowned by the weight of his armor a very idle rumor soon prevailed that maxentius who had not taken any precaution for his own retreat had contrived a very artful snare to destroy the army of the pursuers but that the wooden bridge which was to have been loosened on the approach of constantine unluckily broke down under the weight of the flying italians m de tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv part i p     very seriously examines whether in contradiction to common sense the testimony of eusebius and zosimus ought to prevail over the silence of lactantius nazarius and the anonymous but contemporary orator who composed the ninth panegyric  his body which had sunk very deep into the mud was found with some difficulty the next day

constantine who thus achieved by his valor and ability the most splendid enterprise of his life zosimus l ii p        and the two panegyrics the former of which was pronounced a few months afterward

clemency nor incurred the censure of immoderate rigor zosimus the enemy of constantine allows l ii p    that only a few of the friends of maxentius were put to death but we may remark the expressive passage of nazarius panegyr vet x   omnibus qui labefactari statum ejus poterant cum stirpe deletis the other orator panegyr vet ix  0    contents himself with observing that constantine when he entered rome did not imitate the cruel massacres of cinna of marius or of sylla  he inflicted the same treatment to which a defeat would have exposed his own person and family put to death the two sons of the tyrant and carefully extirpated his whole race the most distinguished adherents of maxentius must have expected to share his fate as they had shared his prosperity and his crimes but when the roman people loudly demanded a greater number of victims the conqueror resisted with firmness and humanity those servile clamours which were dictated by flattery as well as by resentment informers were punished and discouraged the innocent who had suffered under the late tyranny were recalled from exile and restored to their estates a general act of oblivion quieted the minds and settled the property of the people both in italy and in africa see the two panegyrics and the laws of this and the ensuing year in the theodosian code  the first time that constantine honored the senate with his presence he recapitulated his own services and exploits in a modest oration assured that illustrious order of his sincere regard and promised to reestablish its ancient dignity and privileges the grateful senate repaid these unmeaning professions by the empty titles of honor which it was yet in their power to bestow and without presuming to ratify the authority of constantine they passed a decree to assign him the first rank among the three augusti who governed the roman world panegyr vet ix  0 lactantius de m p c    maximin who was confessedly the eldest caesar claimed with some show of reason the first rank among the augusti  games and festivals were instituted to preserve the fame of his victory and several edifices raised at the expense of maxentius were dedicated to the honor of his successful rival the triumphal arch of constantine still remains a melancholy proof of the decline of the arts and a singular testimony of the meanest vanity as it was not possible to find in the capital of the empire a sculptor who was capable of adorning that public monument the arch of trajan without any respect either for his memory or for the rules of propriety was stripped of its most elegant figures the difference of times and persons of actions and characters was totally disregarded the parthian captives appear prostrate at the feet of a prince who never carried his arms beyond the euphrates and curious antiquarians can still discover the head of trajan on the trophies of constantine the new ornaments which it was necessary to introduce between the vacancies of ancient sculpture are executed in the rudest and most unskilful manner adhuc cuncta opera quae magnifice construxerat urbis fanum atque basilicam flavii meritis patres sacravere aurelius victor with

guards and conduct at rome was a measure of prudence as well as of revenge those haughty troops whose numbers and privileges had been restored and even augmented by maxentius were for ever suppressed by constantine their fortified camp was destroyed and the few praetorians who had escaped the fury of the sword were dispersed among the legions and banished to the frontiers of the empire where they might be serviceable without again becoming dangerous praetoriae legiones ac subsidia factionibus aptiora quam urbi romae sublata penitus simul arma atque usus indumenti militaris aurelius victor zosimus l ii p    mentions this fact as an historian and it is very pompously celebrated in the ninth panegyric  by suppressing the troops which were usually stationed in rome constantine gave the fatal blow to the dignity of the senate and people and the disarmed capital was exposed without protection to the insults or neglect of its distant master we may observe that in this last effort to preserve their expiring freedom the romans from the apprehension of a tribute had raised maxentius to the throne he exacted that tribute from the senate under the name of a free gift they implored the assistance of constantine he vanquished the tyrant and converted the free gift into a perpetual tax the senators according to the declaration which was required of their property were divided into several classes the most opulent paid annually eight pounds of gold the next class paid four the last two and those whose poverty might have claimed an exemption were assessed however at seven pieces of gold besides the regular members of the senate their sons their descendants and even their relations enjoyed the vain privileges and supported the heavy burdens of the senatorial order nor will it any longer excite our surprise that constantine should be attentive to increase the number of persons who were included under so useful a description ex omnibus provinciis optimates viros curiae tuae

emperor passed no more than two or three months in rome which he visited twice during the remainder of his life to celebrate the solemn festivals of the tenth and of the twentieth years of his reign constantine was almost perpetually in motion to exercise the legions or to inspect the state of the provinces treves milan aquileia sirmium naissus and thessalonica were the occasional places of his residence till he founded a new rome on the confines of europe and asia from the theodosian code we may now begin to trace the motions of the emperors but the dates both of time and place have frequently been altered by the carelessness of transcribers   before constantine marched into italy he had his alliance with licinius a d     march secured the friendship or at least the neutrality of licinius the illyrian emperor he had promised his sister constantia in marriage to that prince but the celebration of the nuptials was deferred till after the conclusion of the war and the interview of the two emperors at milan which was appointed for that purpose appeared to cement the union of their families and interests zosimus l ii p    observes that before the war the sister of constantine had been betrothed to licinius according to the younger victor diocletian was invited to the nuptials but having ventured to plead his age and infirmities he received a second letter filled with reproaches for his supposed partiality to the cause of maxentius and maximin  in the midst of the public festivity they were suddenly obliged to take leave of each other an inroad of the franks summoned constantine to the rhine and the hostile approach of the sovereign of asia demanded the immediate presence of licinius maximin had war between maximin and licinius a d     been the secret ally of maxentius and without being discouraged by his fate he resolved to try the fortune of a civil war he moved out of syria toward the frontiers of bythynia in the depth of winter the season was severe and tempestuous great numbers of men as well as horses perished in the snow and as the roads were broken up by incessant rains he was obliged to leave behind him a considerable part of the heavy baggage which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced marches by this extraordinary effort of diligence he arrived with a harassed but formidable army on the banks of the thracian bosphorus before the lieutenants of licinius were apprised of his hostile intentions byzantium surrendered to the power of maximin after a siege of eleven days he was detained some days under the walls of heraclea and he had no sooner taken possession of that city than he was alarmed by the intelligence that licinius had pitched his camp at the distance of only eighteen miles after a fruitless negotiation the defeat april  0 in which the two princes attempted to seduce the fidelity of each others adherents they had recourse to arms the emperor of the east commanded a disciplined and veteran army of above seventy thousand men and licinius who had collected about thirty thousand illyrians was at first oppressed by the superiority of numbers his military skill and the firmness of his troops restored the day and obtained a decisive victory the incredible speed which maximin exerted in his flight is much more celebrated than his prowess in the battle twentyfour hours afterward he was seen pale trembling and without his imperial ornaments at nicomedia one hundred and sixty miles from the place of his defeat the wealth of asia was yet unexhausted and though the flower of his veterans had fallen in the late action he had still power if he could obtain time to draw very numerous levies from syria and egypt but he and death of the former  august   survived his misfortune only three or four months his death which happened at tarsus was variously ascribed to despair to poison and to the divine justice as maximin was alike destitute of abilities and of virtue he was lamented neither by the people nor by the soldiers the provinces of the east delivered from the terrors of civil war cheerfully acknowledged the authority of licinius zosimus mentions the defeat and death of maximin as ordinary events but lactantius expatiates on them de m p c      0 ascribing them to the miraculous interposition of heaven licinius at that time was one of the protectors of the church   the vanquished emperor left behind him two cruelty of licinius children a boy of about eight and a girl of about seven years old their inoffensive age might have excited compassion but the compassion of licinius was a very feeble resource nor did it restrain him from extinguishing the name and memory of his adversary the death of severianus will admit of less excuse as it was dictated neither by revenge nor by policy the conqueror had never received any injury from the father of that unhappy youth and the short and obscure reign of severus in a distant part of the empire was already forgotten but the execution of candidianus was an act of the blackest cruelty and ingratitude he was the natural son of galerius the friend and benefactor of licinius the prudent father had judged him too young to sustain the weight of a diadem but he hoped that under the protection of princes who were indebted to his favor for the imperial purple candidianus might pass a secure and honorable life he was now advancing toward the twentieth year of his age and the royalty of his birth though unsupported either by merit or ambition was sufficient to exasperate the jealous mind of licinius lactantius de m p c  0 aurelius victor touches on the different conduct of licinius and of constantine in the use of victory  to these innocent and illustrious victims of his tyranny we must add the wife and daughter of the emperor diocletian when that prince conferred on galerius the title of caesar he had given him in marriage his daughter valeria whose melancholy adventures might furnish a very singular subject for tragedy she had fulfilled and even surpassed the duties of unfortunate fate of the empress valeria and her mother a wife as she had not any children herself she condescended to adopt the illegitimate son of her husband and invariably displayed toward the unhappy candidianus the tenderness and anxiety of a real mother after the death of galerius her ample possessions provoked the avarice and her personal attractions excited the desires of his successor maximin the sensual appetites of maximin were gratified at the expense of his subjects his eunuchs who forced away wives and virgins examined their naked charms with anxious curiosity lest any part of their body should be found unworthy of the royal embraces coyness and disdain were considered as treason and the obstinate fair one was condemned to be drowned a custom was gradually introduced that no person should marry a wife without the permission of the emperor ut ipse in omnibus nuptiis praegustator esset lactantius de m p c     he had a wife still alive but divorce was permitted by the roman law and the fierce passions of the tyrant demanded an immediate gratification the answer of valeria was such as became the daughter and widow of emperors but it was tempered by the prudence which her defenseless condition compelled her to observe she represented to the persons whom maximin had employed on this occasion that even if honor could permit a woman of her character and dignity to entertain a thought of second nuptials decency at least must forbid her to listen to his addresses at a time when the ashes of her husband and his benefactor were still warm and while the sorrows of her mind were still expressed by her mourning garments she ventured to declare that she could place very little confidence in the professions of a man whose cruel inconstancy was capable of repudiating a faithful and affectionate wife lactantius de m p c     on this repulse the love of maximin was converted into fury and as witnesses and judges were always at his disposal it was easy for him to cover his fury with an appearance of legal proceedings and to assault the reputation as well as the happiness of valeria her estates were confiscated her eunuchs and domestics devoted to the most inhuman tortures and several innocent and respectable matrons who were honored with her friendship suffered death on a false accusation of adultery the empress herself together with her mother prisca was condemned to exile and as they were ignominiously hurried from place to place before they were confined to a sequestered village in the deserts of syria they exposed their shame and distress to the provinces of the east which during thirty years had respected their august dignity diocletian made several ineffectual efforts to alleviate the misfortunes of his daughter and as the last return that he expected for the imperial purple which he had conferred upon maximin he entreated that valeria might be permitted to share his retirement of salona and to close the eyes of her afflicted father diocletian at last sent cognatum suum quendam militarem ac potentem virum to intercede in favor of his daughter lactantius de m p c    we are not sufficiently acquainted with the history of these times to point out the person who was employed  he entreated but as he could no longer threaten his prayers were received with coldness and disdain and the pride of maximin was gratified in treating diocletian as a suppliant and his daughter as a criminal the death of maximin seemed to assure the empresses of a favorable alteration in their fortune the public disorders relaxed the vigilance of their guard and they easily found means to escape from the place of their exile and to repair though with some precaution and in disguise to the court of licinius his behavior in the first days of his reign and the honorable reception which he gave to young candidianus inspired valeria with a secret satisfaction both on her own account and on that of her adopted son but these grateful prospects were soon succeeded by horror and astonishment and the bloody executions which stained the palace of nicomedia sufficiently convinced her that the throne of maximin was filled by a tyrant more inhuman than himself valeria consulted her safety by a hasty flight and still accompanied by her mother prisca they wandered above fifteen months valeria quoque per varias provincias quindecim mensibus plebeio cultu pervagata lactantius de m p c    there is some doubt whether we should compute the fifteen months from the moment of her exile or from that of her escape the expression of pervagata seems to denote the latter but in that case we must suppose that the treatise of lactantius was written after the first civil war between licinius and constantine see cuper p     through the provinces concealed in the disguise of plebeian habits they were at length discovered at thessalonica and as the sentence of their death was already pronounced they were immediately beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea the people gazed on the melancholy spectacle but their grief and indignation were suppressed by the terrors of a military guard such was the unworthy fate of the wife and daughter of diocletian we lament their misfortunes we cannot discover their crimes and whatever idea we may justly entertain of the cruelty of licinius it remains a matter of surprise that he was not contented with some more secret and decent method of revenge ita illis pudicitia et conditio exitio fuit lactantius de m p e    he relates the misfortunes of the innocent wife and daughter of diocletian with a very natural mixture of pity and exultation   the roman world was now divided between quarrel between constantine and licinius a d     constantine and licinius the former of whom was master of the west and the latter of the east it might perhaps have been expected that the conquerors fatigued with civil war and connected by a private as well as public alliance would have renounced or at least would have suspended any farther designs of ambition and yet a year had scarcely elapsed after the death of maximin before the victorious emperors turned their arms against each other the genius the success and the aspiring temper of constantine may seem to mark him out as the aggressor but the perfidious character of licinius justifies the most unfavourable suspicions and by the faint light which history reflects on this transaction the curious reader who consults the valesian fragment p     will perhaps accuse me of giving a bold and licentious paraphrase but if he considers it with attention he will acknowledge that my interpretation is probable and consistent  we may discover a conspiracy fomented by his arts against the authority of his colleague constantine had lately given his sister anastasia in marriage to bassianus a man of a considerable family and fortune and had elevated his new kinsman to the rank of caesar according to the system of government instituted by diocletian italy and perhaps africa were designed for his department in the empire but the performance of the promised favor was either attended with so much delay or accompanied with so many unequal conditions that the fidelity of bassianus was alienated rather than secured by the honorable distinction which he had obtained his nomination had been ratified by the consent of licinius and that artful prince by the means of his emissaries soon contrived to enter into a secret and dangerous correspondence with the new caesar to irritate his discontents and to urge him to the rash enterprise of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit from the justice of constantine but the vigilant emperor discovered the conspiracy before it was ripe for execution and after solemnly renouncing the alliance of bassianus despoiled him of the purple and inflicted the deserved punishment on his treason and ingratitude the haughty refusal of licinius when he was required to deliver up the criminals who had taken refuge in his dominions confirmed the suspicions already entertained of his perfidy and the indignities offered at aemona on the frontiers of italy to the statues of constantine became the signal of discord between the two princes the situation of aemona or as it is now called laybach in carniola danville geographie ancienne tom i p     may suggest a conjecture as it lay to the northeast of the julian alps that important territory became a natural object of dispute between the sovereigns of italy and of illyricum   the first battle was fought near cibalis a city of pannonia situated on the river save about first civil war between them fifty miles above sirmium cibalis or cibalae whose name is still preserved in the obscure ruins of swilei was situated about fifty miles from sirmium the capital of illyricum and about one hundred from taurunum or belgrade and the conflux of the danube and the save the roman garrisons and cities on those rivers are finely illustrated by m danville in a memoir inserted in lacademie des inscriptions tom xxviii  from the inconsiderable forces which in this important contest two such powerful monarchs brought into the battle of cibalis a d      th oct field it may be inferred that the one was suddenly provoked and that the other was unexpectedly surprised the emperor of the west had only twenty thousand and the sovereign of the east no more than five and thirty thousand men the inferiority of number was however compensated by the advantage of the ground constantine had taken post in a defile about half a mile in breadth between a steep hill and a deep morass and in that situation he steadily expected and repulsed the first attack of the enemy he pursued his success and advanced into the plain but the veteran legions of illyricum rallied under the standard of a leader who had been trained to arms in the school of probus and diocletian the missile weapons on both sides were soon exhausted the two armies with equal valor rushed to a closer engagement of swords and spears and the doubtful contest had already lasted from the dawn of the day to a late hour of the evening when the right wing which constantine led in person made a vigorous and decisive charge the judicious retreat of licinius saved the remainder of his troops from a total defeat but when he computed his loss which amounted to more than twenty thousand men he thought it unsafe to pass the night in the presence of an active and victorious enemy abandoning his camp and magazines he marched away with secrecy and diligence at the head of the greatest part of his cavalry and was soon removed beyond the danger of a pursuit his diligence preserved his wife his son and his treasures which he had deposited at sirmium licinius passed through that city and breaking down the bridge on the save hastened to collect a new army in dacia and thrace in his flight he bestowed the precarious title of caesar on valens his general of the illyrian frontier zosimus l ii p  0    gives a very particular account of this battle but the descriptions of zosimus are rhetorical rather than military   the plain of mardia in thrace was the theater battle of mardia of a second battle no less obstinate and bloody than the former the troops on both sides displayed the same valor and discipline and the victory was once more decided by the superior abilities of constantine who directed a body of five thousand men to gain an advantageous height from whence during the heat of the action they attacked the rear of the enemy and made a very considerable slaughter the troops of licinius however presenting a double front still maintained their ground till the approach of night put an end to the combat and secured their retreat toward the mountains of macedonia zosimus l ii p       anonym valesian p     the epitomes furnish some circumstances but they frequently confound the two wars between licinius and constantine  the loss of two battles and of his bravest veterans reduced the fierce spirit of licinius to sue for peace his ambassador mistrianus was admitted to the audience of constantine he expatiated on the common topics of moderation and humanity which are so familiar to the eloquence of the vanquished represented in the most insinuating language that the event of the war was still doubtful whilst its inevitable calamities were alike pernicious to both the contending parties and declared that he was authorized to propose a lasting and honorable peace in the name of the two emperors his masters constantine received the mention of valens with indignation and contempt it was not for such a purpose he sternly replied that we have advanced from the shores of the western ocean in an uninterrupted course of combats and victories that after rejecting an ungrateful kinsman we should accept for our colleague a contemptible slave the abdication of valens is the first article of the treaty petrus patricius in excerpt legate p    if it should be thought that  signifies more properly a soninlaw we might conjecture that constantine assuming the name as well as the duties of a father had adopted his younger brothers and sisters the children of theodora but in the best authors  sometimes signifies a husband sometimes a fatherinlaw and sometimes a kinsman in general see spanheim observat ad julian orat i p     it was necessary to accept this humiliating condition and the unhappy valens after a reign of a few days was deprived of the purple and of his life as soon as this obstacle was removed the tranquillity of the roman world was easily restored the successive defeats of licinius had ruined his forces but they had displayed his courage and abilities his situation was almost desperate but the efforts of despair are sometimes formidable and the good sense of constantine preferred a great and certain advantage to a third trial of the chance of arms he consented treaty of peace  december   to leave his rival or as he again styled licinius his friend and brother in the possession of thrace asia minor syria and egypt but the provinces of pannonia dalmatia dacia macedonia and greece were yielded to the western empire and the dominions of constantine now extended from the confines of caledonia to the extremity of peloponnesus it was stipulated by the same treaty that three royal youths the sons of the emperors should be called to the hopes of the succession crispus and the young constantine were soon afterward declared caesars in the west while the younger licinius was invested with the same dignity in the east in this double proportion of honors the conqueror asserted the superiority of his arms and power zosimus l ii p    anonym valesian p     eutropius x   aurelius victor eusebius in chron sozomen l i c   four of these writers affirm that the promotion of the caesars was an article of the treaty it is however certain that the younger constantine and licinius were not yet born and it is highly probable that the promotion was made the  st of march a d     the treaty had probably stipulated that two caesars might be created by the western and one only by the eastern emperor but each of them reserved to himself the choice of the persons   the reconciliation of constantine and licinius though it was embittered by resentment and jealousy by the remembrance of recent injuries general peace and laws of constantine a d          and by the apprehension of future dangers maintained however above eight years the tranquillity of the roman world as a very regular series of the imperial laws commences about this period it would not be difficult to transcribe the civil regulations which employed the leisure of constantine but the most important of his institutions are intimately connected with the new system of policy and religion which was not perfectly established till the last and peaceful years of his reign there are many of his laws which as far as they concern the rights and property of individuals and the practice of the bar are more properly referred to the private than to the public jurisprudence of the empire and he published many edicts of so local and temporary a nature that they would ill deserve the notice of a general history two laws however may be selected from the crowd the one for its importance the other for its singularity the former for its remarkable benevolence the latter for its excessive severity   the horrid practice so familiar to the ancients of exposing or murdering their newborn infants was become every day more frequent in the provinces and especially in italy it was the effect of distress and the distress was principally occasioned by the intolerable burden of taxes and by the vexatious as well as cruel prosecutions of the officers of the revenue against their insolent debtors the less opulent or less industrious part of mankind instead of rejoicing in an increase of family deemed it an act of paternal tenderness to release their children from the impending miseries of a life which they themselves were unable to support the humanity of constantine moved perhaps by some recent and extraordinary instances of despair engaged him to address an edict to all the cities of italy and afterward of africa directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given to those parents who should produce before the magistrates the children whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate but the promise was too liberal and the provision too vague to effect any general or permanent benefit codex theodosian l xi tit    tom iv p     with godefrys observations see likewise l v tit       the law though it may merit some praise served rather to display than to alleviate the public distress it still remains an authentic monument to contradict and confound those venal orators who were too well satisfied with their own situation to discover either vice or misery under the government of a generous sovereign omnia foris placita domi prospera annonae ubertate fructuum copia etc panegyr vet x    this oration of nazarius was pronounced on the day of the quinquennalia of the caesars the  st of march a d        the laws of constantine against rapes were dictated with very little indulgence for the most amiable weaknesses of human nature since the description of that crime was applied not only to the brutal violence which compelled but even to the gentle seduction which might persuade an unmarried woman under the age of twentyfive to leave the house of her parents the successful ravisher was punished with death and as if simple death was inadequate to the enormity of his guilt he was either burnt alive or torn in pieces by wild beasts in the amphitheatre the virgins declaration that she had been carried away with her own consent instead of saving her lover exposed her to share his fate the duty of a public prosecution was entrusted to the parents of the guilty or unfortunate maid and if the sentiments of nature prevailed on them to dissemble the injury and to repair by a subsequent marriage the honor of their family they were themselves punished by exile and confiscation the slaves whether male or female who were convicted of having been accessory to the rape or seduction were burnt alive or put to death by the ingenious torture of pouring down their throats a quantity of melted lead as the crime was of a public kind the accusation was permitted even to strangers the commencement of the action was not limited to any term of years and the consequences of the sentence were extended to the innocent offspring of such an irregular union see the edict of constantine addressed to the roman people in the theodosian code l ix tit    tom iii p      but whenever the offense inspires less horror than the punishment the rigor of penal law is obliged to give way to the common feelings of mankind the most odious parts of this edict were softened or repealed in the subsequent reigns his son very fairly assigns the true reason of the repeal ne sub specie atrocioris judicii aliqua in ulciscendo crimine dilatio nasceretur cod theod tom iii p      and even constantine himself very frequently alleviated by partial acts of mercy the stern temper of his general institutions such indeed was the singular humor of that emperor who showed himself as indulgent and even remiss in the execution of his laws as he was severe and even cruel in the enacting of them it is scarcely possible to observe a more decisive symptom of weakness either in the character of the prince or in the constitution of the government eusebius in vita constant l iii c   chooses to affirm that in the reign of his hero the sword of justice hung idle in the hands of the magistrates eusebius himself l iv c       and the theodosian code will inform us that this excessive lenity was not owing to the want either of atrocious criminals or of penal laws   the civil administration was sometimes interrupted the gothic war by the military defense of the empire crispus a youth of the most amiable character a d     who had received with the title of caesar the command of the rhine distinguished his conduct as well as valor in several victories over the franks and alemanni and taught the barbarians of that frontier to dread the eldest son of constantine and the grandson of constantius nazarius in panegyr vet x the victory of crispus over the alemanni is expressed on some medals  the emperor himself had assumed the more difficult and important province of the danube the goths who in the time of claudius and aurelian had felt the weight of the roman arms respected the power of the empire even in the midst of its intestine divisions but the strength of that warlike nation was now restored by a peace of near fifty years a new generation had arisen who no longer remembered the misfortunes of ancient days the sarmatians of the lake moeotis followed the gothic standard either as subjects or as allies and their united force was poured upon the countries of illyricum campona margus and bononia appear to have been the scenes of several memorable sieges and battles see zosimus l ii p       though the narrative of that historian is neither clear nor consistent the panegyric of optatianus c    mentions the alliance of the sarmatians with the carpi and getae and points out the several fields of battle it is supposed that the sarmatian games celebrated in the month of november derived their origin from the success of this war  and though constantine encountered a very obstinate resistance he prevailed at length in the contest and the goths were compelled to purchase an ignominious retreat by restoring the booty and prisoners which they had taken nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indignation of the emperor he resolved to chastise as well as to repulse the insolent barbarians who had dared to invade the territories of rome at the head of his legions he passed the danube after repairing the bridge which had been constructed by trajan penetrated into the strongest recesses of dacia in the caesars of julian p     commentaire de spanheim p     constantine boasts that he had recovered the province dacia which trajan had subdued but it is insinuated by silenus that the conquests of constantine were like the gardens of adonis which fade and wither almost the moment they appear  and when he had inflicted a severe revenge condescended to give peace to the suppliant goths on condition that as often as they were required they should supply his armies with a body of forty thousand soldiers jornandes de rebus geticis c    i know not whether we may entirely depend on his authority such an alliance has a very recent air and scarcely is suited to the maxims of the beginning of the fourth century  exploits like these were no doubt honorable to constantine and beneficial to the state but it may surely be questioned whether they can justify the exaggerated assertion of eusebius that all scythia as far as the extremity of the north divided as it was into so many names and nations of the most various and savage manners had been added by his victorious arms to the roman empire eusebius in vit constantin l i c   this passage however is taken from a general declamation on the greatness of constantine and not from any particular account of the gothic war   in this exalted state of glory it was impossible second civil war between constantine and licinius a d     that constantine should any longer endure a partner in the empire confiding in the superiority of his genius and military power he determined without any previous injury to exert them for the destruction of licinius whose advanced age and unpopular vices seemed to offer a very easy conquest constantinus tamen vir ingens et omnia efficere nitens quae animo praeparasset simul principatum totius orbis affectans licinio bellum intulit eutropius x   zosimus l ii p    the reasons which they have assigned for the first civil war may with more propriety be applied to the second  but the old emperor awakened by the approaching danger deceived the expectations of his friends as well as of his enemies calling forth that spirit and those abilities by which he had deserved the friendship of galerius and the imperial purple he prepared himself for the contest collected the forces of the east and soon filled the plains of hadrianople with his troops and the streights of the hellespont with his fleet the army consisted of one hundred and fifty thousand foot and fifteen thousand horse and as the cavalry was drawn for the most part from phrygia and cappadocia we may conceive a more favorable opinion of the beauty of the horses than of the courage and dexterity of their riders the fleet was composed of three hundred and fifty galleys of three ranks of oars an hundred and thirty of these were furnished by egypt and the adjacent coast of africa an hundred and ten sailed from the ports of phoenicia and the isle of cyprus and the maritime countries of bithynia ionia and caria were likewise obliged to provide an hundred and ten galleys the troops of constantine were ordered to rendezvous at thessalonica they amounted to above an hundred and twenty thousand horse and foot zosimus l ii p        their emperor was satisfied with their martial appearance and his army contained more soldiers though fewer men than that of his eastern competitor the legions of constantine were levied in the warlike provinces of europe action had confirmed their discipline victory had elevated their hopes and there were among them a great number of veterans who after seventeen glorious campaigns under the same leader prepared themselves to deserve an honorable dismission by a last effort of their valor constantine was very attentive to the privileges and comforts of his fellowveterans conveterani as he now began to style them see the theodosian code l vii tit  0 tom ii p          but the naval preparations of constantine were in every respect much inferior to those of licinius the maritime cities of greece sent their respective quotas of men and ships to the celebrated harbor of piraeus and their united forces consisted of no more than two hundred small vessels a very feeble armament if it is compared with those formidable fleets which were equipped and maintained by the republic of athens during the peloponnesian war whilst the athenians maintained the empire of the sea their fleet consisted of three and afterward of four hundred galleys of three ranks of oars all completely equipped and ready for immediate service the arsenal in the port of piraeus had cost the republic a thousand talents about two hundred and sixteen thousand pounds see thucydides de bell peloponn l ii c    and meursius de fortuna attica c     since italy was no longer the seat of government the naval establishments of misenum and ravenna had been gradually neglected and as the shipping and mariners of the empire were supported by commerce rather than by war it was natural that they should the most abound in the industrious provinces of egypt and asia it is only surprising that the eastern emperor who possessed so great a superiority at sea should have neglected the opportunity of carrying an offensive war into the center of his rivals dominions  instead of embracing such an active resolution battle of hadrianople a d     july   which might have changed the whole face of the war the prudent licinius expected the approach of his rival in a camp near hadrianople which he had fortified with an anxious care that betrayed his apprehension of the event constantine directed his march from thessalonica toward that part of thrace till he found himself stopped by the broad and rapid stream of the hebrus and discovered the numerous army of licinius which filled the steep ascent of the hill from the river to the city of hadrianople many days were spent in doubtful and distant skirmishes but at length the obstacles of the passage and of the attack were removed by the intrepid conduct of constantine in this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of constantine which though it can scarcely be paralleled either in poetry or romance is celebrated not by a venal orator devoted to his fortune but by an historian the partial enemy of his fame we are assured that the valiant emperor threw himself into the river hebrus accompanied only by twelve horsemen and that by the effort or terror of his invincible arm he broke slaughtered and put to slight a host of an hundred and fifty thousand men the credulity of zosimus prevailed so strongly over his passion that among the events of the memorable battle of hadrianople he seems to have selected and embellished not the most important but the most mavelous the valor and danger of constantine are attested by a slight wound which he received in the thigh but it may be discovered even from an imperfect narration and perhaps a corrupted text that the victory was obtained no less by the conduct of the general than by the courage of the hero that a body of five thousand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear of the enemy whose attention was diverted by the construction of a bridge and that licinius perplexed by so many artful evolutions was reluctantly drawn from his advantageous post to combat on equal ground in the plain the contest was no longer equal his confused multitude of new levies was easily vanquished by the experienced veterans of the west thirtyfour thousand men are reported to have been slain the fortified camp of licinius was taken by assault the evening of the battle the greater part of the fugitives who had retired to the mountains surrendered themselves the next day to the discretion of the conqueror and his rival who could no longer keep the field confined himself within the walls of byzantium zosimus l ii p       this great battle is described in the valesian fragment p     in a clear though concise manner licinius vero circum hadrianopolin maximo exercitu latera ardui montis impleverat illuc toto agmine constantinus inflexit cum bellum terra marique traheretur quamvis per arduum suis nitentibus attamen disciplina militari et felicitate constantinus licinii confusum et sine ordine agentem vicit exercitum leviter femore sauciatus   the siege of byzantium which was immediately siege of byzantium and naval victory of crispus undertaken by constantine was attended with great labor and uncertainty in the late civil wars the fortifications of that place so justly considered as the key of europe and asia had been repaired and strengthened and as long as licinius remained master of the sea the garrison was much less exposed to the danger of famine than the army of the besiegers the naval commanders of constantine were summoned to his camp and received his positive orders to force the passage of the hellespont as the fleet of licinius instead of seeking and destroying their feeble enemy continued inactive in those narrow streights where its superiority of numbers was of little use or advantage crispus the emperors eldest son was entrusted with the execution of this daring enterprise which he performed with so much courage and success that he deserved the esteem and most probably excited the jealousy of his father the engagement lasted two days and in the evening of the first the contending fleets after a considerable and mutual loss retired into their respective harbors of europe and asia the second day about noon a strong south wind

imperceptible see tourneforts voyage au levant let xi sprang up which carried the vessels of crispus against the enemy and as the casual advantage was improved by his skilful intrepidity he soon obtained a complete victory an hundred and thirty vessels were destroyed five thousand men were slain and amandus the admiral of the asiatic fleet escaped with the utmost difficulty to the shores of chalcedon as soon as the hellespont was open a plentiful convoy of provisions flowed into the camp of constantine who had already advanced the operations of the siege he constructed artificial mounds of earth of an equal height with the ramparts of byzantium the lofty towers which were erected on that foundation galled the besieged with large stones and darts from the military engines and the battering rams had shaken the walls in several places if licinius persisted much longer in the defense he exposed himself to be involved in the ruin of the place before he was surrounded he prudently removed his person and treasures to chalcedon in asia and as he was always desirous of associating companions to the hopes and dangers of his fortune he now bestowed the title of caesar on martinianus who exercised one of the most important offices of the empire aurelius victor zosimus l ii p    according to the latter martinianus was magister officiorum he uses the latin appellation in greek some medals seem to intimate that during his short reign he received the title of augustus   such were still the resources and such the battle of chrysopolis abilities of licinius that after so many successive defeats he collected in bithynia a new army of fifty or sixty thousand men while the activity of constantine was employed in the siege of byzantium the vigilant emperor did not however neglect the last struggles of his antagonist a considerable part of his victorious army was transported over the bosphorus in small vessels and the decisive engagement was sought soon after their landing on the heights of chrysopolis or as it is now called of scutari the troops of licinius though they were lately raised ill armed and worse disciplined made head against their conquerors with fruitless but desperate valor till a total defeat and the slaughter of five and twenty thousand men irretrievably determined the fate of their leader eusebius in vita constantin l ii c       ascribes this decisive victory to the pious prayers of the emperor the valesian fragment p     mentions a body of gothic auxiliaries under their chief aliquaca who adhered to the party of licinius  he retired to submission and death of licinius nicomedia rather with the view of gaining some time for negotiation than with the hope of any effectual defense constantia his wife and the sister of constantine interceded with her brother in favor of her husband and obtained from his policy rather than from his compassion a solemn promise confirmed by an oath that after the sacrifice of martinianus and the resignation of the purple licinius himself should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in peace and affluence the behavior of constantia and her relation to the contending parties naturally recals the remembrance of that virtuous matron who was the sister of augustus and the wife of antony but the temper of mankind was altered and it was no longer esteemed infamous for a roman to survive his honor and independence licinius solicited and accepted the pardon of his offenses laid himself and his purple at the feet of his lord and master was raised from the ground with insulting pity was admitted the same day to the imperial banquet and soon afterward was sent away to thessalonica which had been chosen for the place of his confinement zosimus l ii p  0  victor junior in epitome anonym valesian p      his confinement was soon terminated by death and it is doubtful whether a tumult of the soldiers or a decree of the senate was suggested as a motive for his execution according to the rules of tyranny he was accused of forming a conspiracy and of holding a treasonable correspondence with the barbarians but as he was never convicted either by his own conduct or by any legal evidence we may perhaps be allowed from his weakness to presume his innocence contra religionem sacramenti thessalonicae privatus occisus est eutropius x   and his evidence is confirmed by jerome in chronic as well as by zosimus l ii p  0  the valesian writer is the only one who mentions the soldiers and it is zonaras alone who calls in the assistance of the senate eusebius prudently slides over this delicate transaction but sozomen a century afterward ventures to assert the treasonable practices of licinius  the memory of licinius was branded with infamy his statues were thrown down and by a hasty edict of such mischievous tendency that it was almost immediately corrected all his laws and all the judicial proceedings of his reign were at once abolished see the theodosian code l    tit    tom v p  0   0  these edicts of constantine betray a degree of passion and precipitancy very unbecoming of the character of a lawgiver  by reunion of the empire a d     this victory of constantine the roman world was again united under the authority of one emperor thirtyseven years after diocletian had divided his power and provinces with his associate maximian  the successive steps of the elevation of constantine from his first assuming the purple at york to the resignation of licinius at nicomedia have been related with some minuteness and precision not only as the events are in themselves both interesting and important but still more as they contributed to the decline of the empire by the expense of blood and treasure and by the perpetual increase as well of the taxes as of the military establishment the foundation of constantinople and the establishment of the christian religion were the immediate and memorable consequences of this revolution  chap xv the progress of the christian religion and the sentiments manners numbers and condition of the primitive christians a candid but rational inquiry into the progress and establishment of christianity may be considered as a very essential part of the importance of the inquiry history of the roman empire while that great body was invaded by open violence or undermined by slow decay a pure and humble religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men grew up in silence and obscurity derived new vigor from opposition and finally erected the triumphant banner of the cross on the ruins of the capitol nor was the influence of christianity confined to the period or to the limits of the roman empire after a revolution of thirteen or fourteen centuries that religion is still professed by the nations of europe the most distinguished portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms by the industry and zeal of the europeans it has been widely diffused to the most distant shores of asia and africa and by the means of their colonies has been firmly established from canada to chili in a world unknown to the ancients  but this inquiry however useful or entertaining its difficulties is attended with two peculiar difficulties the scanty and suspicious materials of ecclesiastical history seldom enable us to dispel the dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the church the great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers of the gospel and to a careless observer their faults may seem to cast a shade on the faith which they professed but the scandal of the pious christian and the fallacious triumph of the infidel should cease as soon as they recollect not only by whom but likewise to whom the divine revelation was given the theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing religion as she descended from heaven arrayed in her native purity a more melancholy duty is imposed on the historian he must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption which she contracted in a long residence upon earth among a weak and degenerate race of beings  our curiosity is naturally prompted to inquire five causes of the growth of christianity by what means the christian faith obtained so remarkable a victory over the established religions of the earth to this inquiry an obvious but satisfactory answer may be returned that it was owing to the convincing evidence of the doctrine itself and to the ruling providence of its great author but as truth and reason seldom find so favorable a reception in the world and as the wisdom of providence frequently condescends to use the passions of the human heart and the general circumstances of mankind as instruments to execute its purpose we may still be permitted though with becoming submission to ask not indeed what were the first but what were the secondary causes of the rapid growth of the christian church it will perhaps appear that it was most effectually favored and assisted by the five following causes i the inflexible and if we may use the expression the intolerant zeal of the christians derived it is true from the jewish religion but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which instead of inviting had deterred the gentiles from embracing the law of moses ii the doctrine of a future life improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth iii the miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church iv the pure and austere morals of the christians v the union and discipline of the christian republic which gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the roman empire  i we have already described the religious the first cause zeal of the

religions the current of zeal and devotion as it was contracted into a narrow channel ran with the strength and sometimes with the fury of a torrent  this inflexible perseverance which appeared its gradual increase so odious or so ridiculous to the ancient world assumes a more awful character since providence has deigned to reveal to us the mysterious history of the chosen people but the devout and even scrupulous attachment to the mosaic religion so conspicuous among the jews who lived under the second temple becomes still more surprising if it is compared with the stubborn incredulity of their forefathers when the law was given in thunder from mount sinai when the tides of the ocean and the course of the planets were suspended for the convenience of the israelites and when temporal rewards and punishments were the immediate consequences of their piety or disobedience they perpetually relapsed into rebellion against the visible majesty of their divine king placed the idols of the nations in the sanctuary of jehovah and imitated every fantastic ceremony that was practiced in the tents of the arabs or in the cities of phoenicia for the enumeration of the syrian and arabian deities it may be observed that milton has comprised in one hundred and thirty very beautiful lines the two large and learned syntagmas which seldom had composed on that abstruse subject  as the protection of heaven was deservedly withdrawn from the ungrateful race their faith acquired a proportionable degree of vigor and purity the contemporaries of moses and joshua had beheld with careless indifference the most amazing miracles under the pressure of every calamity the belief of those miracles has preserved the jews of a later period from the universal contagion of idolatry and in contradiction to every known principle of the human mind that singular people seems to have yielded a stronger and more ready assent to the traditions of their remote ancestors than to the evidence of their own senses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which i have shown among them numbers xiv    it would be easy but it would be unbecoming to justify the complaint of the deity from the whole tenor of the mosaic history   the jewish religion was admirably fitted for their religion better suited to defense than to conquest defense but it was never designed for conquest and it seems probable that the number of proselytes was never much superior to that of apostates the divine promises were originally made and the distinguishing rite of circumcision was enjoined to a single family when the posterity of abraham had multiplied like the sands of the sea the deity from whose mouth they received a system of laws and ceremonies declared himself the proper and as it were the national god of israel and with the most jealous care separated his favorite people from the rest of mankind the conquest of the land of canaan was accompanied with so many wonderful and with so many bloody circumstances that the victorious jews were left in a state of irreconcilable hostility with all their neighbors they had been commanded to extirpate some of the most idolatrous tribes and the execution of the divine will had seldom been retarded by the weakness of humanity with the other nations they were forbidden to contract any marriages or alliances and the prohibition of receiving them into the congregation which in some cases was perpetual almost always extended to the third to the seventh or even to the tenth generation the obligation of preaching to the gentiles the faith of moses had never been inculcated as a precept of the law nor were the jews inclined to impose it on themselves as a voluntary duty in the admission of new citizens that unsocial people was actuated by the selfish vanity of the greeks rather than by the generous policy of rome the descendants of abraham were flattered by the opinion that they alone were the heirs of the covenant and they were apprehensive of diminishing the value of their inheritance by sharing it too easily with the strangers of the earth a larger acquaintance with mankind extended their knowledge without correcting their prejudices and whenever the god of israel acquired any new votaries he was much more indebted to the inconstant humor of polytheism than to the active zeal of his own missionaries all that relates to the jewish proselytes has been very ably treated by basnage hist des juifs l vi c      the religion of moses seems to be instituted for a particular country as well as for a single nation and if a strict obedience had been paid to the order that every male three times in the year should present himself before the lord jehovah it would have been impossible that the jews could ever have spread themselves beyond the narrow limits of the promised land see exodus xxiv    deuteronomy xvi    the commentators and a very sensible note in the universal history vol i p  0  edit fol  that obstacle was indeed removed by the destruction of the temple of jerusalem but the most considerable part of the jewish religion was involved in its destruction and the pagans who had long wondered at the strange report of an empty sanctuary when pompey using or abusing the right of conquest entered into the holy of holies it was

to discover what could be the object or what could be the instruments of a worship which was destitute of temples and of altars of priests and of sacrifices yet even in their fallen state the jews still asserting their lofty and exclusive privileges shunned instead of courting the society of strangers they still insisted with inflexible rigor on those parts of the law which it was in their power to practice their peculiar distinctions of days of meats and a variety of trivial though burdensome observances were so many objects of disgust and aversion for the other nations to whose habits and prejudices they were diametrically opposite the painful and even dangerous rite of circumcision was alone capable of repelling a willing proselyte from the door of the synagogue a second kind of circumcision was inflicted on a samaritan or egyptian proselyte the sullen indifference of the talmudists with respect to the conversion of strangers may be seen in basnage histoire des juifs l vi c     under these circumstances christianity offered more liberal zeal of christianity itself to the world armed with the strength of the mosaic law and delivered from the weight of its fetters an exclusive zeal for the truth of religion and the unity of god was as carefully inculcated in the new as in the ancient system and whatever was now revealed to mankind concerning the nature and designs of the supreme being was fitted to increase their reverence for that mysterious doctrine the divine authority of moses and the prophets was admitted and even established as the firmest basis of christianity from the beginning of the world an uninterrupted series of predictions had announced and prepared the long expected coming of the messiah who in compliance with the gross apprehensions of the jews had been more frequently represented under the character of a king and conqueror than under that of a prophet a martyr and the son of god by his expiatory sacrifice the imperfect sacrifices of the temple were at once consummated and abolished the ceremonial law which consisted only of types and figures was succeeded by a pure and spiritual worship equally adapted to all climates as well as to every condition of mankind and to the initiation of blood was substituted a more harmless initiation of water the promise of divine favor instead of being partially confined to the posterity of abraham was universally proposed to the freeman and the slave to the greek and to the barbarian to the jew and to the gentile every privilege that could raise the proselyte from earth to heaven that could exalt his devotion secure his happiness or even gratify that secret pride which under the semblance of devotion insinuates itself into the human heart was still reserved for the members of the christian church but at the same time all mankind was permitted and even solicited to accept the glorious distinction which was not only proffered as a favor but imposed as an obligation it became the most sacred duty of a new convert to diffuse among his friends and relations the inestimable blessing which he had received and to warn them against a refusal that would be severely punished as a criminal disobedience to the will of a benevolent but allpowerful deity  the enfranchisement of the church from the obstinacy and reasons of the believing jews bonds of the synagogue was a work however of some time and of some difficulty the jewish converts who acknowledged jesus in the character of the messiah foretold by their ancient oracles respected him as a prophetic teacher of virtue and religion but they obstinately adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors and were desirous of imposing them on the gentiles who continually augmented the number of believers these judaising christians seem to have argued with some degree of plausibility from the divine origin of the mosaic law and from the immutable perfections of its great author they affirmed that if the being who is the same through all eternity had designed to abolish those sacred rites which had served to distinguish his chosen people the repeal of them would have been no less clear and solemn than their first promulgation that instead of those frequent declarations which either suppose or assert the perpetuity of the mosaic religion it would have been represented as a provisionary scheme intended to last only till the coming of the messiah who should instruct mankind in a more perfect mode of faith and of worship these arguments were urged with great ingenuity by the jew orobio and refuted with equal ingenuity and candor by the christian limborch see the amica collatio it well deserves that name or account of the dispute between them  that the messiah himself and his disciples who conversed with him on earth instead of authorizing by their example the most minute observances of the mosaic law jesus  circumcisus erat cibis utebatur judaicis vestitu simili purgatos scabie mittebat ad sacerdotes

christianae l v c   a little afterward c    he expatiates on the condescension of the apostles  would have published to the world the abolition of those useless and obsolete ceremonies without suffering christianity to remain during so many years obscurely confounded among the sects of the jewish church arguments like these appear to have been used in the defense of the expiring cause of the mosaic law but the industry of our learned divines has abundantly explained the ambiguous language of the old testament and the ambiguous conduct of the apostolic teachers it was proper gradually to unfold the system of the gospel and to pronounce with the utmost caution and tenderness a sentence of condemnation so repugnant to the inclination and prejudices of the believing jews  the history of the church of jerusalem affords a lively proof of the necessity of those precautions and of the deep impression which the jewish the nazarene church of jerusalem religion had made on the minds of its sectaries the first fifteen bishops of jerusalem were all circumcised jews and the congregation over which they presided united the law of moses with the doctrine of christ paene omnes christum deum sub legis observatione credebant sulpicius severus ii    see eusebius hist ecclesiast l iv c    it was natural that the primitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days after the death of christ and was governed almost as many years under the immediate inspection of his apostle should be received as the standard of orthodoxy mosheim de rebus christianis ante constantinum magnum p     in this masterly performance which i shall often have occasion to quote he enters much more fully into the state of the primitive church than he has an opportunity of doing in his general history  the distant churches very frequently appealed to the authority of their venerable parent and relieved her distresses by a liberal contribution of alms but when numerous and opulent societies were established in the great cities of the empire in antioch alexandria ephesus corinth and rome the reverence which jerusalem had inspired to all the christian colonies insensibly diminished the jewish converts or as they were afterward called the nazarenes who had laid the foundations of the church soon found themselves overwhelmed by the increasing multitudes that from all the various religions of polytheism inlisted under the banner of christ and the gentiles who with the approbation of their peculiar apostle had rejected the intolerable weight of mosaic ceremonies at length refused to their more scrupulous brethren the same toleration which at first they had humbly solicited for their own practice the ruin of the temple of the city and of the public religion of the jews was severely felt by the nazarenes as in their manners though not in their faith they maintained so intimate a connection with their impious countrymen whose misfortunes were attributed by the pagans to the contempt and more justly ascribed by the christians to the wrath of the supreme deity the nazarenes retired from the ruins of jerusalem to the little town of pella beyond the jordan where that ancient church languished above sixty years in solitude and obscurity eusebius l iii c   le clerc hist ecclesiast p  0  during this occasional absence the bishop and church of pella still retained the title of jerusalem in the same manner the roman pontiffs resided seventy years at avignon and the patriarchs of alexandria have long since transferred their episcopal seat to cairo  they still enjoyed the comfort of making frequent and devout visits to the holy city and the hope of being one day restored to those seats which both nature and religion taught them to love as well as to revere but at length under the reign of hadrian the desperate fanaticism of the jews filled up the measure of their calamities and the romans exasperated by their repeated rebellions exercised the rights of victory with unusual rigor the emperor founded under the name of aelia capitolina a new city on mount sion dion cassius l lxix the exile of the jewish nation from jerusalem is attested by aristo of pella apud eusebius l iv c   and is mentioned by several ecclesiastical writers though some of them too hastily extend this interdiction to the whole country of palestine  to which he gave the privileges of a colony and denouncing the severest penalties against any of the jewish people who should dare to approach its precincts he fixed a vigilant garrison of a roman cohort to enforce the execution of his orders the nazarenes had only one way left to escape the common proscription and the force of truth was on this occasion assisted by the influence of temporal advantages they elected marcus for their bishop a prelate of the race of the gentiles and most probably a native either of italy or of some of the latin provinces at his persuasion the most considerable part of the congregation renounced the mosaic law in the practice of which they had persevered above a century by this sacrifice of their habits and prejudices they purchased a free admission into the colony of hadrian and more firmly cemented their union with the catholic church eusebius l iv c   sulpicius severus ii    by comparing their unsatisfactory accounts mosheim p     etc has drawn out a very distinct representation of the circumstances and motives of this revolution   when the name and honors of the church of the ebionites jerusalem had been restored to mount sion the crimes of heresy and schism were imputed to the obscure remnant of the nazarenes which refused to accompany their latin bishop they still preserved their former habitation of pella spread themselves into the villages adjacent to damascus and formed an inconsiderable church in the city of boerea or as it is now called of aleppo in syria le clerc hist ecclesiast p         seems to have collected from eusebius jerome epiphanius and other writers all the principal circumstances that relate to the nazarenes or ebionites the nature of their opinions soon divided them into a stricter and a milder sect and there is some reason to conjecture that the family of jesus christ remained members at least of the latter and more moderate party  the name of nazarenes was deemed too honorable for those christian jews and they soon received from the supposed poverty of their understanding as well as of their condition the contemptuous epithet of ebionites some writers have been pleased to create an ebion the imaginary author of their sect and name but we can more safely rely on the learned eusebius than on the vehement tertullian or the credulous epiphanius according to le clerc the hebrew word ebjonim may be translated into latin by that of pauperes see hist ecclesiast p      in a few years after the return of the church of jerusalem it became a matter of doubt and controversy whether a man who sincerely acknowledged jesus as the messiah but who still continued to observe the law of moses could possibly hope for salvation the humane temper of justin martyr inclined him to answer this question in the affirmative and though he expressed himself with the most guarded diffidence he ventured to determine in favor of such an imperfect christian if he were content to practice the mosaic ceremonies without pretending to assert their general use or necessity but when justin was pressed to declare the sentiment of the church he confessed that there were very many among the orthodox christians who not only excluded their judaising brethren from the hope of salvation but who declined any intercourse with them in the common offices of friendship hospitality and social life see the very curious dialogue of justin martyr with the jew tryphon the conference between them was held at ephesus in the reign of antoninus pius and about twenty years after the return of the church of pella to jerusalem for this date consult the accurate note of tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom ii p      the more rigorous opinion prevailed as it was natural to expect over the milder and an eternal bar of separation was fixed between the disciples of moses and those of christ the unfortunate ebionites rejected from one religion as apostates and from the other as heretics found themselves compelled to assume a more decided character and although some traces of that obsolete sect may be discovered as late as the fourth century they insensibly melted away either into the church or the synagogue of all the systems of christianity that of abyssinia is the only one which still adheres to the mosaic rites geddess church history of aethiopia and dissertations de le grand sur la relation du p lobo the eunuch of the queen candace might suggest some suspicions but as we are assured socrates i    sozomen ii    ludolphus p     that the aethiopians were not converted till the fourth century it is more reasonable to believe that they respected the sabbath and distinguished the forbidden meats in imitation of the jews who in a very early period were seated on both sides of the red sea circumcision had been practiced by the most ancient aethiopians from motives of health and cleanliness which seem to be explained in the recherches philosophiques sur les americains tom ii p       while the orthodox church preserved a just medium between excessive veneration and improper contempt for the law of moses the various the gnostics heretics deviated into equal but opposite extremes of error and extravagance from the acknowledged truth of the jewish religion the ebionites had concluded that it could never be abolished from its supposed imperfections the gnostics as hastily inferred that it never was instituted by the wisdom of the deity there are some objections against the authority of moses and the prophets which too readily present themselves to the skeptical mind though they can only be derived from our ignorance of remote antiquity and from our incapacity to form an adequate judgment of the divine economy these objections were eagerly embraced and as petulantly urged by the vain science of the gnostics beausobre histoire du manicheisme l i c   has stated their objections particularly those of faustus the adversary of augustine with the most learned impartiality  as those heretics were for the most part averse to the pleasures of sense they morosely arraigned the polygamy of the patriarchs the gallantries of david and the seraglio of solomon the conquest of the land of canaan and the extirpation of the unsuspecting natives they were at a loss how to reconcile with the common notions of humanity and justice but when they recollected the sanguinary list of murders of executions and of massacres which stain almost every page of the jewish annals they acknowledged that the barbarians of palestine had exercised as much compassion toward their idolatrous enemies as they had ever shown to their friends or countrymen apud ipsos fides obstinata misericordia in promptu adversus omnes alios hostile odium tacit hist v   surely tacitus had seen the jews with too favorable an eye the perusal of josephus must have destroyed the antithesis  passing from the sectaries of the law to the law itself they asserted that it was impossible that a religion which consisted only of bloody sacrifices and trifling ceremonies and whose rewards as well as punishments were all of a carnal and temporal nature could inspire the love of virtue or restrain the impetuosity of passion the mosaic account of the creation and fall of man was treated with profane derision by the gnostics who would not listen with patience to the repose of the deity after six days labor to the rib of adam the garden of eden the trees of life and of knowledge the speaking serpent the forbidden fruit and the condemnation pronounced against human kind for the venal offense of their first progenitors dr burnet archaeologia l ii c   has discussed the first chapters of genesis with too much wit and freedom  the god of israel was impiously represented by the gnostics as a being liable to passion and to error capricious in his favor implacable in his resentment meanly jealous of his superstitious worship and confining his partial providence to a single people and to this transitory life in such a character they could discover none of the features of the wise and omnipotent father of the universe the milder gnostics considered jehovah the creator as a being of a mixed nature between god and the demon others confounded him with the evil principle consult the second century of the general history of mosheim which gives a very distinct though concise account of their strange opinions on this subject  they allowed that the religion of the jews was somewhat less criminal than the idolatry of the gentiles but it was their fundamental doctrine that the christ whom they adored as the first and brightest emanation of the deity appeared upon earth to rescue mankind from their various errors and to reveal a new system of truth and perfection the most learned of the fathers by a very singular condescension have imprudently admitted the sophistry of the gnostics acknowledging that the literal sense is repugnant to every principle of faith as well as reason they deem themselves secure and invulnerable behind the ample veil of allegory which they carefully spread over every tender part of the mosaic dispensation see beausobre hist du manicheisme l i c   origin and st augustine were among the allegorists   it has been remarked with more ingenuity their sects progress and influence than truth that the virgin purity of the church was never violated by schism or heresy before the reign of trajan or hadrian about one hundred years after the death of christ hegesippus ap eusebius l iii    iv    clemens alexandrin stromat vii     we may observe with much more propriety that during that period the disciples of the messiah were indulged in a freer latitude both of faith and practice than has ever been allowed in succeeding ages as the terms of communion were insensibly narrowed and the spiritual authority of the prevailing party was exercised with increasing severity many of its most respectable adherents who were called upon to renounce were provoked to assert their private opinions to pursue the consequences of their mistaken principles and openly to erect the standard of rebellion against the unity of the church the gnostics were distinguished as the most polite the most learned and the most wealthy of the christian name and that general appellation which expressed a superiority of knowledge was either assumed by their own pride or ironically bestowed by the envy of their adversaries they were almost without exception of the race of the gentiles and their principal founders seem to have been natives of syria or egypt where the warmth of the climate disposes both the mind and the body to indolent and contemplative devotion the gnostics blended with the faith of christ many sublime but obscure tenets which they derived from oriental philosophy and even from the religion of zoroaster concerning the eternity of matter the existence of two principles and the mysterious hierarchy of the invisible world in the account of the gnostics of the second and third centuries mosheim is ingenious and candid le clerc dull but exact beausobre almost always an apologist and it is much to be feared that the primitive fathers are very frequently calumniators  as soon as they launched out into that vast abyss they delivered themselves to the guidance of a disordered imagination and as the paths of error are various and infinite the gnostics were imperceptibly divided into more than fifty particular sects see the catalogues of irenaeus and epiphanius it must indeed be allowed that those writers were inclined to multiply the number of sects which opposed the unity of the church  of whom the most celebrated appear to have been the basilidians the valentinians the marcionites and in a still later period the manichaeans each of these sects could boast of its bishops and congregations of its doctors and martyrs eusebius l iv c    sozomen l ii c    see in bail in the article of marcion a curious detail of a dispute on that subject it should seem that some of the gnostics the basilidians declined and even refused the honor of martyrdom their reasons were singular and abstruse see mosheim p      and instead of the four gospels adopted by the church the heretics produced a multitude of histories in which the actions and discourses of christ and of his apostles were adapted to their respective tenets see a very remarkable passage of origin proem ad lucan that indefatigable writer who had consumed his life in the study of the scriptures relies for their authenticity on the inspired authority of the church it was impossible that the gnostics could receive our present gospels many parts of which particularly in the resurrection of christ are directly and as it might seem designedly pointed against their favorite tenets it is therefore somewhat singular that ignatius epist ad smyrn patr apostol tom ii p    should choose to employ a vague and doubtful tradition instead of quoting the certain testimony of the evangelists  the success of the gnostics was rapid and extensive faciunt favos et vespae faciunt ecclesias et marcionitae is the strong expression of tertullian which i am obliged to quote from memory in the time of epiphanius advers haereses p  0  the marcionites were very numerous in italy syria egypt arabia and persia  they covered asia and egypt established themselves in rome and sometimes penetrated into the provinces of the west for the most part they arose in the second century flourished during the third and were suppressed in the fourth or fifth by the prevalence of more fashionable controversies and by the superior ascendant of the reigning power though they constantly disturbed the peace and frequently disgraced the name of religion they contributed to assist rather than to retard the progress of christianity the gentile converts whose strongest objections and prejudices were directed against the law of moses could find admission into many christian societies which required not from their untutored mind any belief of an antecedent revelation their faith was insensibly fortified and enlarged and the church was ultimately benefited by the conquests of its most inveterate enemies augustine is a memorable instance of this gradual progress from reason to faith he was during several years engaged in the manichaean sect   but whatever difference of opinion might subsist the demons considered as the gods of antiquity between the orthodox the ebionites and the gnostics concerning the divinity or the obligation of the mosaic law they were all equally animated by the same exclusive zeal and by the same abhorrence for idolatry which had distinguished the jews from the other nations of the ancient world the philosopher who considered the system of polytheism as a composition of human fraud and error could disguise a smile of contempt under the mask of devotion without apprehending that either the mockery or the compliance would expose him to the resentment of any invisible or as he conceived them imaginary powers but the established religions of paganism were seen by the primitive christians in a much more odious and formidable light it was the universal sentiment both of the church and of heretics that the demons were the authors the patrons and the objects of idolatry the unanimous sentiment of the primitive church is very clearly explained by justin martyr apolog major by athenagoras legate c    etc and by lactantius institut divin ii       those rebellious spirits who had been degraded from the rank of angels and cast down into the infernal pit were still permitted to roam upon earth to torment the bodies and to seduce the minds of sinful men the demons soon discovered and abused the natural propensity of the human heart toward devotion and artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from their creator they usurped the place and honors of the supreme deity by the success of their malicious contrivances they at once gratified their own vanity and revenge and obtained the only comfort of which they were yet susceptible the hope of involving the human species in the participation of their guilt and misery it was confessed or at least it was imagined that they had distributed among themselves the most important characters of polytheism one demon assuming the name and attributes of jupiter another of aesculapius a third of venus and a fourth perhaps of apollo tertullian apolog c    alleges the confession of the demons themselves as often as they were tormented by the christian exorcists  and that by the advantage of their long experience and aerial nature they were enabled to execute with sufficient skill and dignity the parts which they had undertaken they lurked in the temples instituted festivals and sacrifices invented fables pronounced oracles and were frequently allowed to perform miracles the christians who by the interposition of evil spirits could so readily explain every praeternatural appearance were disposed and even desirous to admit the most extravagant fictions of the pagan mythology but the belief of the christian was accompanied with horror the most trifling mark of respect to the national worship he considered as a direct homage yielded to the demon and as an act of rebellion against the majesty of god  in consequence of this opinion it was the first abhorrence of the christians for idolatry but arduous duty of a christian to preserve himself pure and undefiled by the practice of idolatry the religion of the nations was not merely a speculative doctrine professed in the schools or preached in the temples the innumerable deities and rites of polytheism were closely interwoven with every circumstance of business or pleasure of public or of private life and it seemed impossible to escape the observance of them without at the same time renouncing the commerce of mankind and all the offices and amusements of society tertullian has written a most severe treatise against idolatry to caution his brethren against the hourly danger of incurring that guilt recogita sylvam et quantae latitant spinae de corona militis c  0  the important ceremonies transactions of peace and war were prepared or concluded by solemn sacrifices in which the magistrate the senator and the soldier were obliged to preside or to

people celebrated in honor of their peculiar festivals see tertullian de spectaculis this severe reformer shows no more indulgence to a tragedy of euripides than to a combat of gladiators the dress of

ancient practice of concluding the entertainment with libations may be found in every classic socrates and seneca in their last moments made a noble application of this custom postquam stagnum calidae

procession of the dead slowly moved toward the funeral pile the ancient funerals in those of misenus and pallas are no less accurately described by virgil than they are illustrated by his commentator servius the pile itself was an altar the flames were fed with the blood of victims and all the assistants were sprinkled with lustral water  the christian on these interesting occasions was compelled to desert the persons who were the dearest to him rather than contract the guilt inherent to those impious ceremonies every art and every trade that was arts in the least concerned in the framing or adorning of idols was polluted by the stain of idolatry tertullian de idololatria c     a severe sentence since it devoted to eternal misery the far greater part of the community which is employed in the exercise of liberal or mechanic professions if we cast our eyes over the numerous remains of antiquity we shall perceive that besides the immediate representations of the gods and the holy instruments of their worship the elegant forms and agreeable fictions consecrated by the imagination of the greeks were introduced as the richest ornaments of the houses the dress and the furniture of the pagans see every part of montsaucons antiquities even the reverses of the greek and roman coins were frequently of an idolatrous nature here indeed the scruples of the christian were suspended by a stronger passion  even the arts of music and painting of eloquence and poetry flowed from the same impure origin in the style of the fathers apollo and the muses were the organs of the infernal spirit homer and virgil were the most eminent of his servants and the beautiful mythology which pervades and animates the compositions of their genius is destined to celebrate the glory of the demons

temptations which on every festivals side lurked in ambush to surprise the unguarded believer assailed him with redoubled violence on the days of solemn festivals so artfully were they framed and disposed throughout the year that superstition always wore the appearance of pleasure and often of virtue consult the most labored work of ovid his imperfect fasti he finished no more than the first six months of the year the compilation of macrobius is called the saturnalia but it is only a small part of the first book that bear any relation to the title  some of the most sacred festivals in the roman ritual were destined to salute the new calends of january with vows of public and private felicity to indulge the pious remembrance of the dead and living to ascertain the inviolable bounds of property to hail on the return of spring the genial powers of fecundity to perpetuate the two memorable aeras of rome the foundation of the city and that of the republic and to restore during the humane license of the saturnalia the primitive equality of mankind some idea may be conceived of the abhorrence of the christians for such impious ceremonies by the scrupulous delicacy which they displayed on a much less alarming occasion on days of general festivity it was the custom of the ancients to adorn their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel and to crown their heads with a garland of flowers this innocent and elegant practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil institution but it most unluckily happened that the doors were under the protection of the household gods that the laurel was sacred to the lover of daphne and that garlands of flowers though frequently worn as a symbol either of joy or mourning had been dedicated in their first origin to the service of superstition the trembling christians who were persuaded in this instance to comply with the fashion of their country and the commands of the magistrate labored under the most gloomy apprehensions from the reproaches of their own conscience the censures of the church and the denunciations of divine vengeance tertullian has composed a defense or rather panegyric of the rash action of a christian soldier who by throwing away his crown of laurel had exposed himself and his brethren to the most imminent danger by the mention of the emperors severus and caracalla it is evident notwithstanding the wishes of m de tillemont that tertullian composed his treatise de corona long before he was engaged in the errors of the montanists see memoires ecclesiastiques tom iii p       such was the anxious diligence which was required zeal for christianity to guard the chastity of the gospel from the infectious breath of idolatry the superstitious observances of public or private rites were carelessly practiced from education and habit by the followers of the established religion but as often as they occurred they afforded the christians an opportunity of declaring and confirming their zealous opposition by these frequent protestations their attachment to the faith was continually fortified and in proportion to the increase of zeal they combated with the more ardour and success in the holy war which they had undertaken against the empire of the demons  ii the writings of cicero in particular the first book of the tusculan questions and the treatise de senectute and the somnium scipionis contain in the most beautiful language every thing that grecian philosophy or roman good sense could possibly suggest on this dark but important object represent in the the second cause the doctrine of the immortality of the soul among the philosophers most lively colors the ignorance the errors and the uncertainty of the ancient philosophers with regard to the immortality of the soul when they are desirous of arming their disciples against the fear of death they inculcate as an obvious though melancholy position that the fatal stroke of our dissolution releases us from the calamities of life and that those can no longer suffer who no longer exist yet there were a few sages of greece and rome who had conceived a more exalted and in some respects a juster idea of human nature though it must be confessed that in the sublime inquiry their reason had been often guided by their imagination and that their imagination had been prompted by their vanity when they viewed with complacency the extent of their own mental powers when they exercised the various faculties of memory of fancy and of judgment in the most profound speculations or the most important labors and when they reflected on the desire of same which transported them into future ages far beyond the bounds of death and of the grave they were unwilling to confound themselves with the beasts of the field or to suppose that a being for whose dignity they entertained the most sincere admiration could be limited to a spot of earth and to a few years of duration with this favorable prepossession they summoned to their aid the science or rather the language of metaphysics they soon discovered that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the operations of the mind the human soul must consequently be a substance distinct from the body pure simple and spiritual incapable of dissolution and susceptible of a much higher degree of virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal prison from these specious and noble principles the philosophers who trod in the footsteps of plato deduced a very unjustifiable conclusion since they asserted not only the future immortality but the past eternity of the human soul which they were too apt to consider as a portion of the infinite and selfexisting spirit which pervades and sustains the universe the preexistence of human souls so far at least as that doctrine is compatible with religion was adopted by many of the greek and latin fathers see beausobre hist du manicheisme l vi c    a doctrine thus removed beyond the senses and the experience of mankind might serve to amuse the leisure of a philosophic mind or in the silence of solitude it might sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding virtue but the faint impression which had been received in the schools was soon obliterated by the commerce and business of active life we are sufficiently acquainted with the eminent persons who flourished in the age of cicero and of the first caesars with their actions their characters and their motives to be assured that their conduct in this life was never regulated by any serious conviction of the rewards or punishments of a future state at the bar and in the senate of rome the ablest orators were not apprehensive of giving offense to their hearers by exposing that doctrine as an idle and extravagant opinion which was rejected with contempt by every man of a liberal education and understanding see cicero pro cluent c    caesar ap sallust de bell catilin c  0 juvenal satir ii     esse aliquos manes et subterranea regna  nec pueri credunt nisi qui nondum aere lavantur    since therefore the most sublime efforts of philosophy among the pagans of greece and rome can extend no farther than feebly to point out the desire the hope or at most the probability of a future state there is nothing except a divine revelation that can ascertain the existence and describe the condition of the invisible country which is destined to receive the souls of men after their separation from the body but we may perceive several defects inherent to the popular religions of greece and rome which rendered them very unequal to so arduous a task   the general system of their mythology was unsupported by any solid proofs and the wisest among the pagans had already disclaimed its usurped authority   the description of the infernal regions had been abandoned to the fancy of painters and of poets who peopled them with so many phantoms and monsters who dispensed their rewards and punishments with so little equity that a solemn truth the most congenial to the human heart was oppressed and disgraced by the absurd mixture of the wildest fictions the xith book of the odyssey gives a very dreary and incoherent account of the infernal shades pindar and virgil have embellished the picture but even those poets though more correct than their great model are guilty of very strange inconsistencies see bail responses aux questions dun provincial part iii c       the doctrine of a future state was scarcely considered among the devout polytheists of greece and rome as a fundamental article of faith the providence of the gods as it related to public communities rather than to private individuals was principally displayed on the visible theater of the present world the petitions which were offered on the altars of jupiter or apollo expressed the anxiety of their worshippers for temporal happiness and their ignorance or indifference concerning a future life see the xvith epistle of the first book of horace the xiiith satire of juvenal and the iid satire of persius these popular discourses express the sentiment and language of the multitude  the important truth of the immortality of the soul was inculcated with more diligence as well as success in india in assyria in egypt and in gaul and since we cannot attribute such a difference among the barbarians to the superior knowledge of the barbarians we must ascribe it to the influence of an established priesthood which employed the motives of virtue as the instrument of ambition if we confine ourselves to the gauls we may observe that they entrusted not only their lives but even their money to the security of another world vetus ille mos gallorum occurrit says valerius maximus l ii c   p  0 quos memoria proditur est

soul as an opinion that received no countenance from the divine book which they revered as the only rule of their faith to the authority of scripture the pharisees added that of tradition and they accepted under the name of traditions several speculative tenets from the philosophy or religion of the eastern nations the doctrines of fate or predestination of angels and spirits and of a future state of rewards and punishments were in the number of these new articles of belief and as the pharisees by the austerity of their manners had drawn into their party the body of the jewish people the immortality of the soul became the prevailing sentiment of the synagogue under the reign of the asmonaean princes and pontiffs the temper of the jews was incapable of contenting itself with such a cold and languid assent as might satisfy the mind of a polytheist and as soon as they admitted the idea of a future state they embraced it with the zeal which has always formed the characteristic of the nation their zeal however added nothing to its evidence or even probability and it was still necessary that the doctrine of life and immortality which had been dictated by nature approved by reason and received by superstition should obtain the sanction of divine truth from the authority and example of christ  when the promise of eternal happiness was among the christians proposed to mankind on condition of adopting the faith and of observing the precepts of the gospel it is no wonder that so advantageous an offer should have been accepted by great numbers of every religion of every rank and of every province in the roman empire the ancient christians were animated by a contempt for their present existence and by a just confidence of immortality of which the doubtful and imperfect faith of modern ages cannot give us any adequate notion in the primitive church the influence of truth was very powerfully strengthened approaching end of the world by an opinion which however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity has not been found agreeable to experience it was universally believed that the end of the world and the kingdom of heaven were at hand the near approach of this wonderful event had been predicted by the apostles the tradition of it was preserved by their earliest disciples and those who understood in their literal sense the discourses of christ himself were obliged to expect the second and glorious coming of the son of man in the clouds before that generation was totally extinguished which had beheld his humble condition upon earth and which might still be witness of the calamities of the jews under vespasian or hadrian the revolution of seventeen centuries has instructed us not to press too closely the mysterious language of prophecy and revelation but as long as for wise purposes this error was permitted to subsist in the church it was productive of the most salutary effects on the faith and practice of christians who lived in the awful expectation of that moment when the globe itself and all the various race of mankind should tremble at the appearance of their divine judge this expectation was countenanced by the twentyfourth chapter of st matthew and by the first epistle of st paul to the thessalonians erasmus removes the difficulty by the help of allegory and metaphor and the learned grotius ventures to insinuate that for wise purposes the pious deception was permitted to take place   the ancient and popular doctrine of the millennium doctrine of the millennium was intimately connected with the second coming of christ as the works of the creation had been finished in six days their duration in their present state according to a tradition which was attributed to the prophet

to have been half a jew  by the same analogy it was inferred that this long period of labor and contention which was now almost elapsed the primitive church of antioch computed almost  000 years from the creation of the world to the birth of christ africanus lactantius and the greek church have reduced that number to   00 and eusebius has contented himself with   00 years these calculations were formed on the septuagint which was universally received during the six first centuries the authority of the vulgate and of the hebrew text has determined the moderns protestants as well as catholics to prefer a period of about  000 years though in the study of profane antiquity they often find themselves streightened by those narrow limits  would be succeeded by a joyful sabbath of a thousand years and that christ with the triumphant band of the saints and the elect who had escaped death or who had been miraculously revived would reign upon earth till the time appointed for the last and general resurrection so pleasing was this hope to the mind of believers that the new jerusalem the seat of this blissful kingdom was quickly adorned with all the gayest colors of the imagination a felicity consisting only of pure and spiritual pleasure would have appeared too refined for its inhabitants who were still supposed to possess their human nature and senses a garden of eden with the amusements of the pastoral life was no longer suited to the advanced state of society which prevailed under the roman empire a city was therefore erected of gold and precious stones and a supernatural plenty of corn and wine was bestowed on the adjacent territory in the free enjoyment of whose spontaneous productions the happy and benevolent people was never to be restrained by any jealous laws of

inconsistency we may impute it as we think proper either to the author or to his transcribers  though it might not be universally received it appears to have been the reigning sentiment of the orthodox believers and it seems so well adapted to the desires and apprehensions of mankind that it must have contributed in a very considerable degree to the progress of the christian faith but when the edifice of the church was almost completed the temporary support was laid aside the doctrine of christs reign upon earth was at first treated as a profound allegory was considered by degrees as a doubtful and useless opinion and was at length rejected as the absurd invention of heresy and fanaticism dupin bibliotheque ecclesiastique tom i p     tom ii p     and mosheim p   0 though the latter of these learned divines is not altogether candid on this occasion  a mysterious prophecy which still forms a part of the sacred canon but which was thought to favor the exploded sentiment has very narrowly escaped the proscription of the church in the council of laodicea about the year   0 the apocalypse was tacitly excluded from the sacred canon by the same churches of asia to which it is addressed and we may learn from the complaint of sulpicius severus that their sentence had been ratified by the greater number of christians of his time from what causes then is the apocalypse at present so generally received by the greek the roman and the protestant churches the following ones may be assigned   the greeks were subdued by the authority of an impostor who in the sixth century assumed the character of dionysius the areopagite   a just apprehension that the grammarians might become more important than the theologians engaged the council of trent to fix the seal of their infallibility on all the books of scripture contained in the latin vulgate in the number of which the apocalypse was fortunately included fra paolo istoria del concilio tridentino l ii   the advantage of turning those mysterious prophecies against the sea of rome inspired the protestants with uncommon veneration for so useful an ally see the ingenious and elegant discourses of the present bishop of litchfield on that unpromising subject   whilst the happiness and glory of a temporal reign were promised to the disciples of christ conflagration of rome and of the world the most dreadful calamities were denounced against an unbelieving world the edification of the new jerusalem was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of the mystic babylon and as long as the emperors who reigned before constantine persisted in the profession of idolatry the epithet of babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of rome a regular series was prepared of all the moral and physical evils which can afflict a flourishing nation intestine discord and the invasion of the fiercest barbarians from the unknown regions of the north pestilence and famine comets and eclipses earthquakes and inundations lactantius institut divin vii    etc relates the dismal tale of futurity with great spirit and eloquence  all these were only so many preparatory and alarming signs of the great catastrophe of rome when the country of the scipios and caesars should be consumed by a flame from heaven and the city of the seven hills with her palaces her temples and her triumphal arches should be buried in a vast lake of fire and brimstone it might however afford some consolation to roman vanity that the period of their empire would be that of the world itself which as it had once perished by the element of water was destined to experience a second and speedy destruction from the element of fire in the opinion of a general conflagration the faith of the christian very happily coincided with the tradition of the east the philosophy of the stoics and the analogy of nature and even the country which from religious motives had been chosen for the origin and principal scene of the conflagration was the best adapted for that purpose by natural and physical causes by its deep caverns beds of sulphur and numerous volcanoes of which those of aetna of vesuvius and of lipari exhibit a very imperfect representation the calmest and most intrepid skeptic could not refuse to acknowledge that the destruction of the present system of the world by fire was in itself extremely probable the christian who founded his belief much less on the fallacious arguments of reason than on the authority of tradition and the interpretation of scripture expected it with terror and confidence as a certain and approaching event and as his mind was perpetually filled with the solemn idea he considered every disaster that happened to the empire as an infallible symptom of an expiring world on this subject every reader of taste will be entertained with the third part of burnets sacred theory he blends philosophy scripture and tradition into one magnificent system in the description of which he displays

disbelief of the divine truth seems to offend the reason and the humanity of the present age and yet whatever may be the language of individuals it is still the public doctrine of all the christian churches nor can even our own refuse to admit the conclusions which must be drawn from the viiith and the xviiith of her articles the jansenists who have so diligently studied the works of the fathers

has ever adopted the milder sentiment and he gave no less offense to the lutherans than to the catholics see bossuet histoire des variations des eglises protestants l ii c         but the primitive

of socrates or some other sages of antiquity who had consulted the light of reason before that of the gospel had arisen justin and clemens of alexandria allow that some of the philosophers were instructed by the logos confounding its double signification of the human reason and of the divine word  but it was unanimously affirmed that those who since the birth or the death of christ had obstinately persisted in the worship of the demons neither deserved nor could expect a pardon from the irritated justice of the deity these rigid sentiments which had been unknown to the ancient world appear to have infused a spirit of bitterness into a system of love and harmony the ties of blood and friendship were frequently torn asunder by the difference of religious faith and the christians who in this world found themselves oppressed by the power of the pagans were sometimes seduced by resentment and spiritual pride to delight in the prospect of their future triumph you are fond of

to allege the testimony of cyprian the doctor and guide of all the western churches see prudent hymn xiii  00 as often as he applied himself to his daily study of the writings of tertullian he was accustomed to say  da mihi magistrum give me my master hieronym de viris illustribus tom i p       doubtless there were many among the primitive were often converted by their fears christians of a temper more suitable to the meekness and charity of their profession there were many who felt a sincere compassion for the danger of their friends and countrymen and who exerted the most benevolent zeal to save them from the impending destruction the careless polytheist assailed by new and unexpected terrors against which neither his priests nor his philosophers could afford him any certain protection was very frequently terrified and subdued by the menace of eternal tortures his fears might assist the progress of his faith and reason and if he could once persuade himself to suspect that the christian religion might possibly be true it became an easy task to convince him that it was the safest and most prudent party that he could possibly embrace  iii the supernatural gifts which even in this the third cause miraculous powers of the primitive church life were ascribed to the christians above the rest of mankind must have conduced to their own comfort and very frequently to the conviction of infidels besides the occasional prodigies which might sometimes be effected by the immediate interposition of the deity when he suspended the laws of nature for the service of religion the christian church from the time of the apostles and their first disciples notwithstanding the evasions of dr middleton it is impossible to overlook the clear traces of visions and inspiration which may be found in the apostolic fathers  has claimed an uninterrupted succession of miraculous powers the gift of tongues of vision and of prophecy the power of expelling demons of healing the sick and of raising the dead the knowledge of foreign languages was frequently communicated to the contemporaries of irenaeus though irenaeus himself was left to struggle with the difficulties of a barbarous dialect whilst he preached the gospel to the natives of gaul irenaeus adv haeres proem p   dr middleton free inquiry p    etc observes that as this pretension of all others was the most difficult to support by art it was the soonest given up the observation suits his hypothesis  the divine inspiration whether it was conveyed in the form of a waking or of a sleeping vision is described as a favor very liberally bestowed on all ranks of the faithful on women as on elders on boys as well as upon bishops when their devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of prayer of fasting and of vigils to receive the extraordinary impulse they were transported out of their senses and delivered in ecstasy what was inspired being mere organs of the holy spirit just as a pipe or flute is of him who blows into it athenagoras in legatione justin martyr cohort ad gentes tertullian advers marcionit l iv these descriptions are not very unlike the prophetic fury for which cicero de divinat ii    expresses so little reverence  we may add that the design of these visions was for the most part either to disclose the future history or to guide the present administration of the church the expulsion of the demons from the bodies of those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted to torment was considered as a signal though ordinary triumph of religion and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apologists as the most convincing evidence of the truth of christianity the awful ceremony was usually performed in a public manner and in the presence of a great number of spectators the patient was relieved by the power or skill of the exorcist and the vanquished demon was heard to confess that he was one of the fabled gods of antiquity who had impiously usurped the adoration of mankind tertullian apolog c    throws out a bold defiance to the pagan magistrates of the primitive miracles the power of exorcising is the only one which has been assumed by protestants  but the miraculous cure of diseases of the most inveterate or even preternatural kind can no longer occasion any surprise when we recollect that in the days of irenaeus about the end of the second century the resurrection of the dead was very far from being esteemed an uncommon event that the miracle was frequently performed on necessary occasions by great fasting and the joint supplication of the church of the place and that the persons thus restored to their prayers had lived afterward among them many years irenaeus adv haereses l ii       l v c   mr dodwell dissert ad irenaeum ii    concludes that the second century was still more fertile in miracles than the first  at such a period when faith could boast of so many wonderful victories over death it seems difficult to account for the skepticism of those philosophers who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the resurrection a noble grecian had rested on this important ground the whole controversy and promised theophilus bishop of antioch that if he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who had been actually raised from the dead he would immediately embrace the christian religion it is somewhat remarkable that the prelate of the first eastern church however anxious for the conversion of his friend thought proper to decline this fair and reasonable challenge theophilus ad autolycum l i p     edit benedictin

introduction in the year      published his free inquiry in      and before his death which happened in    0 he had prepared a vindication of it against his numerous adversaries  which though it has met with the most favorable reception from the public appears to have excited a general scandal among the divines of our own as well as of the other protestant churches of europe the university of oxford conferred degrees on his opponents from the indignation of mosheim p     we may discover the sentiments of the lutheran divines  our different sentiments on this subject will be much less influenced by any particular arguments than by our habits of study and reflection and above all by the degree of the evidence which we have accustomed ourselves to require for the proof of a miraculous event the duty of an historian does not call upon him our perplexity in defining the miraculous period to interpose his private judgment in this nice and important controversy but he ought not to dissemble the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may reconcile the interest of religion with that of reason of making a proper application of that theory and of defining with precision the limits of that happy period exempt from error and from deceit to which we might be disposed to extend the gift of supernatural powers from the first of the fathers to the last of the popes a succession of bishops of saints of martyrs and of miracles is continued without interruption and the progress of superstition was so gradual and almost imperceptible that we know not in what particular link we should break the chain of tradition every age bears testimony to the wonderful events by which it was distinguished and its testimony appears no less weighty and respectable than that of the preceding generation till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own inconsistency if in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the venerable bede or to the holy bernard the same degree of confidence which in the second century we had so liberally granted to justin or to irenaeus it may seem somewhat remarkable that bernard of clairvaux who records so many miracles of his friend st malachi never takes any notice of his own which in their turn however are carefully related by his companions and disciples in the long series of ecclesiastical history does there exist a single instance of a saint asserting that he himself possessed the gift of miracles  if the truth of any of those miracles is appreciated by their apparent use and propriety every age had unbelievers to convince heretics to confute and idolatrous nations to convert and sufficient motives might always be produced to justify the interposition of heaven and yet since every friend to revelation is persuaded of the reality and every reasonable man is convinced of the cessation of miraculous powers it is evident that there must have been some period in which they were either suddenly or gradually withdrawn from the christian church whatever era is chosen for that purpose the death of the apostles the conversion of the roman empire or the extinction of the arian heresy the conversion of constantine is the era which is most usually fixed by protestants the more rational divines are unwilling to admit the miracles of the ivth whilst the more credulous are unwilling to reject those of the vth century  the insensibility of the christians who lived at that time will equally afford a just matter of surprise they still supported their pretensions after they had lost their power credulity performed the office of faith fanaticism was permitted to assume the language of inspiration and the effects of accident or contrivance were ascribed to supernatural causes the recent experience of genuine miracles should have instructed the christian world in the ways of providence and habituated their eye if we may use a very inadequate expression to the style of the divine artist should the most skilful painter of modern italy presume to decorate his feeble imitations with the name of raphael or of correggio the insolent fraud would be soon discovered and indignantly rejected  whatever opinion may be entertained of the use of the primitive miracles miracles of the primitive church since the time of the apostles this unresisting softness of temper so conspicuous among the believers of the second and third centuries proved of some accidental benefit to the cause of truth and religion in modern times a latent and even involuntary skepticism adheres to the most pious dispositions their admission of supernatural truths is much less an active consent than a cold and passive acquiescence accustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable order of nature our reason or at least our imagination is not sufficiently prepared to sustain the visible action of the deity but in the first ages of christianity the situation of mankind was extremely different the most curious or the most credulous among the pagans were often persuaded to enter into a society which asserted an actual claim of miraculous powers the primitive christians perpetually trod on mystic ground and their minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most extraordinary events they felt or they fancied that on every side they were incessantly assaulted by demons comforted by visions instructed by prophecy and surprisingly delivered from danger sickness and from death itself by the supplications of the church the real or imaginary prodigies of which they so frequently conceived themselves to be the objects the instruments or the spectators very happily disposed them to adopt with the same ease but with far greater justice the authentic wonders of the evangelic history and thus miracles that exceeded not the measure of their own experience inspired them with the most lively assurance of mysteries which were acknowledged to surpass the limits of their understanding it is this deep impression of supernatural truths which has been so much celebrated under the name of faith a state of mind described as the surest pledge of the divine favor and of future felicity and recommended as the first or perhaps the only merit of a christian according to the more rigid doctors the moral virtues which may be equally practiced by infidels are destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of our justification  iv but the primitive christian demonstrated the fourth cause virtues of the first christians his faith by his virtues and it was very justly supposed that the divine persuasion which enlightened or subdued the understanding must at the same time purify the heart and direct the actions of the believer the first apologists of christianity who justify the innocence of their brethren and the writers of a later period who celebrate the sanctity of their ancestors display in the most lively colors the reformation of manners which was introduced into the world by the preaching of the gospel as it is my intention to remark only such human causes as were permitted to second the influence of revelation i shall slightly mention two motives which might naturally render the lives of the primitive christians much purer and more austere than those of their pagan contemporaries or their degenerate successors repentance for their past sins and the laudable desire of supporting the reputation of the society in which they were engaged  it is a very ancient reproach suggested by the effects of their repentance ignorance or the malice of infidelity that the christians allured into their party the most atrocious criminals who as soon as they were touched by a sense of remorse were easily persuaded to wash away in the water of baptism the guilt of their past conduct for which the temples of the gods refused to grant them any expiation but this reproach when it is cleared from misrepresentation contributes as much to the honor as it did to the increase of the church the imputations of celsus and julian with the defense of the fathers are very fairly stated by spanheim commentaire sur les cesars de julian p      the friends of christianity may acknowledge without a blush that many of the most eminent saints had been before their baptism the most abandoned sinners those persons who in the world had followed though in an imperfect manner the dictates of benevolence and propriety derived such a calm satisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude as rendered them much less susceptible of the sudden emotions of shame of grief and of terror which have given birth to so many wonderful conversions after the example of their divine master the missionaries of the gospel disdained not the society of men and especially of women oppressed by the consciousness and very often by the effects of their vices as they emerged from sin and superstition to the glorious hope of immortality they resolved to devote themselves to a life not only of virtue but of penitence the desire of perfection became the ruling passion of their soul and it is well known that while reason embraces a cold medicrity our passions hurry us with rapid violence over the space which lies between the most opposite extremes  when the new converts had been enrolled in care of their reputation the number of the faithful and were admitted to the sacraments of the church they found themselves restrained from relapsing into their past disorders by another consideration of a less spiritual but of a very innocent and respectable nature any particular society that has departed from the great body of the nation or the religion to which it belonged immediately becomes the object of universal as well as invidious observation in proportion to the smallness of its numbers the character of the society may be affected by the virtue and vices of the persons who compose it and every member is engaged to watch with the most vigilant attention over his own behavior and over that of his brethren since as he must expect to incur a part of the common disgrace he may hope to enjoy a share of the common reputation when the christians of bithynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger pliny they assured the proconsul that far from being engaged in any unlawful conspiracy they were bound by a solemn obligation to abstain from the commission of those crimes which disturb the private or public peace of society from theft robbery adultery perjury and fraud plin epist x     near a century afterward tertullian with an honest pride could boast that very few christians had suffered by the hand of the executioner except on account of their religion tertullian apolog c    he adds however with some degree of hesitation aut si aliud jam non christianus  their serious and sequestered life averse to the gay luxury of the age inured them to chastity temperance economy and all the sober and domestic virtues as the greater number were of some trade or profession it was incumbent on them by the strictest integrity and the fairest dealing to remove the suspicions which the profane are too apt to conceive against the appearances of sanctity the contempt of the world exercised them in the habits of humility meekness and patience the more they were persecuted the more closely they adhered to each other their mutual charity and unsuspecting confidence has been remarked by infidels and was too often abused by perfidious friends the philosopher peregrinus of whose life and death lucian has left us so entertaining an account imposed for a long time on the credulous simplicity of the christians of asia   it is a very honorable circumstance for the morality of the fathers morals of the primitive christians that even their faults or rather errors were derived from an excess of virtue the bishops and doctors of the church whose evidence attests and whose authority might influence the professions the principles and even the practice of their contemporaries had studied the scriptures with less skill than devotion and they often received in the most literal sense those rigid precepts of christ and the apostles to which the prudence of succeeding commentators has applied a looser and more figurative mode of interpretation ambitious to exalt the perfection of the gospel above the wisdom of philosophy the zealous fathers have carried the duties of selfmortification of purity and of patience to a height which it is scarcely possible to attain and much less to preserve in our present state of weakness and corruption a doctrine so extraordinary and so sublime must inevitably command the veneration of the people but it was ill calculated to obtain the suffrage of those worldly philosophers who in the conduct of this transitory life consult only the feelings of nature and the interest of society see a very judicious treatise of barbeyrac sur la morale des peers   there are two very natural propensities which principles of human nature we may distinguish in the most virtuous and liberal dispositions the love of pleasure and the love of action if the former is refined by art and learning improved by the charms of social intercourse and corrected by a just regard to economy to health and to reputation it is productive of the greatest part of the happiness of private life the love of action is a principle of a much stronger and more doubtful nature it often leads to anger to ambition and to revenge but when it is guided by the sense of propriety and benevolence it becomes the parent of every virtue and if those virtues are accompanied with equal abilities a family a state or an empire may be indebted for their safety and prosperity to the undaunted courage of a single man to the love of pleasure we may therefore ascribe most of the agreeable to the love of action we may attribute most of the useful and respectable qualifications the character in which both the one and the other should be united and harmonised would seem to constitute the most perfect idea of human nature the insensible and inactive disposition which should be supposed alike destitute of both would be rejected by the common consent of mankind as utterly incapable of procuring any happiness to the individual or any public benefit to the world but it was not in this world that the primitive christians were desirous of making themselves either agreeable or useful  the acquisition of knowledge the exercise of the primitive christians condemn pleasure and luxury our reason or fancy and the cheerful flow of unguarded conversation may employ the leisure of a liberal mind such amusements however were rejected with abhorrence or admitted with the utmost caution by the severity of the fathers who despised all knowledge that was not useful to salvation and who considered all levity of discourse as a criminal abuse of the gift of speech in our present state of existence the body is so inseparably connected with the soul that it seems to be our interest to taste with innocence and moderation the enjoyments of which that faithful companion is susceptible very different was the reasoning of our devout predecessors vainly aspiring to imitate the perfection of angels they disdained or they affected to disdain every earthly and corporeal delight lactant institut divin l vi c  0        some of our senses indeed are necessary for our preservation others for our subsistence and others again for our information and thus far it was impossible to reject the use of them the first sensation of pleasure was marked as the first moment of their abuse the unfeeling candidate for heaven was instructed not only to resist the grosser allurements of the taste or smell but even to shut his ears against the profane harmony of sounds and to view with indifference the most finished productions of human art gay apparel magnificent houses and elegant furniture were supposed to unite the double guilt of pride and of sensuality a simple and mortified appearance was more suitable to the christian who was certain of his sins and doubtful of his salvation in their censures of luxury the fathers are extremely minute and circumstantial consult a work of clemens of alexandria entitled the paedagogue which contains the rudiments of ethics as they were taught in the most celebrated of the christian schools  and among the various articles which excite their pious indignation we may enumerate false hair garments of any color except white instruments of music vases of gold or silver downy pillows as jacob reposed his head on a stone white bread foreign wines public salutations the use of warm baths and the practice of shaving the beard which according to the expression of tertullian is a lie against our own faces and an impious attempt to improve the works of the creator tertullian de spectaculis c    clemens alexandrin paedagog l iii c    when christianity was introduced among the rich and the polite the observation of these singular laws was left as it would be at present to the few who were ambitious of superior sanctity but it is always easy as well as agreeable for the inferior ranks of mankind to claim a merit from the contempt of that pomp and pleasure which fortune has placed beyond their reach the virtue of the primitive christians like that of the first romans was very frequently guarded by poverty and ignorance  the chaste severity of the fathers in whatever their sentiments concerning marriage and chastity related to the commerce of the two sexes flowed from the same principle their abhorrence of every enjoyment which might gratify the sensual and degrade the spiritual nature of man it was their favorite opinion that if adam had preserved his obedience to the creator he would have lived for ever in a state of virgin purity and that some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise with a race of innocent and immortal beings beausobre hist critique du manicheisine l vii c   justin gregory of nyssa augustine etc strongly inclined to this opinion  the use of marriage was permitted only to his fallen posterity as a necessary expedient to continue the human species and as a restraint however imperfect on the natural licentiousness of desire the hesitation of the orthodox casuists on this interesting subject betrays the perplexity of men unwilling to approve an institution which they were compelled to tolerate some of the gnostic heretics were more consistent they rejected the use of marriage  the enumeration of the very whimsical laws which they most circumstantially imposed on the marriage bed would force a smile from the young and a blush from the fair it was their unanimous sentiment that a first marriage was adequate to all the purposes of nature and of society the sensual connection was refined into a resemblance of the mystic union of christ with his church and was pronounced to be indissoluble either by divorce or by death the practice of second nuptials was branded with the name of a legal adultery and the persons who were guilty of so scandalous an offense against christian purity were soon excluded from the honors and even from the alms of the church see a chain of tradition from justin martyr to jerome in the morale des peers c iv        since desire was imputed as a crime and marriage was tolerated as a defect it was consistent with the same principles to consider a state of celibacy as the nearest approach to the divine perfection it was with the utmost difficulty that ancient rome could support the institution of six vestals see a very curious dissertation on the vestals in the memoires de lacademie des inscriptions tom iv p          notwithstanding the honors and rewards which were bestowed on those virgins it was difficult to procure a sufficient number nor could the dread of the most horrible death always restrain their incontinence  but the primitive church was filled with a great number of persons of either sex who had devoted themselves to the profession of perpetual chastity

learned origin judged it the most prudent to disarm the temper eusebius l vi   before the fame of origin had excited envy and persecution this extraordinary action was rather admired than censured as it was his general practice to allegorize scripture it seems unfortunate that in this instance only he should have adopted the literal sense  some were insensible and some were invincible against the assaults of the flesh disdaining an ignominious flight the virgins of the warm climate of africa encountered the enemy in the closest engagement they permitted priests and deacons to share their bed and gloried amidst the flames in their unsullied purity but insulted nature sometimes vindicated her rights and this new species of martyrdom served only to introduce a new scandal into the church cyprian epist   and dodwell dissertat cyprianic iii something like this rash attempt was long afterward imputed to the founder of the order of fontevrault bail has amused himself and his readers on that very delicate subject  among the christian ascetics however a name which they soon acquired from their painful exercise many as they were less presumptuous were probably more successful the loss of sensual pleasure was supplied and compensated by spiritual pride even the multitude of pagans were inclined to estimate the merit of the sacrifice by its apparent difficulty and it was in the praise of these chaste spouses of christ that the fathers have poured forth the troubled stream of their eloquence dupin bibliotheque ecclesiastique tom i p     gives a particular account of the dialogue of the ten virgins as it was composed by methodius bishop of tire the praises of virginity are excessive  such are the early traces of monastic principles and institutions which in a subsequent age have counterbalanced all the temporal advantages of christianity the ascetics as early as the second century made a public profession of mortifying their bodies and of abstaining from the use of flesh and wine mosheim p   0   the christians were not less averse to the business than to the pleasures of this world the defense of our persons and property they knew their aversion to the business of war and government not how to reconcile with the patient doctrine which enjoined an unlimited forgiveness of past injuries and commanded them to invite the repetition of fresh insults their simplicity was offended by the use of oaths by the pomp of magistracy and by the active contention of public life nor could their humane ignorance be convinced that it was lawful on any occasion to shed the blood of our fellow creatures either by the sword of justice or by that of war even though their criminal or hostile attempts should threaten the peace and safety of the whole community see the morale des peers the same patient principles have been revived since the reformation by the socinians the modern anabaptists and the quakers barclay the apologist of the quakers has protected his brethren by the authority of the primitive christians p           it was acknowledged that under a less perfect law the powers of the jewish constitution had been exercised with the approbation of heaven by inspired prophets and by anointed kings the christians felt and confessed that such institutions might be necessary for the present system of the world and they cheerfully submitted to the authority of their pagan governors but while they inculcated the maxims of passive obedience they refused to take any active part in the civil administration or the military defense of the empire some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to those persons who before their conversion were already engaged in such violent and sanguinary occupations tertullian apolog c    de idololatria c       origin contra celsum l v p     l vii p     l viii p           but it was impossible that the christians without renouncing a more sacred duty could assume the character of soldiers of magistrates or of princes tertullian de corona militis c    suggests to them the expedient of deserting a counsel which if it had been generally known was not very proper to conciliate the favor of the emperors toward the christian sect  this indolent or even criminal disregard to the public welfare exposed them to the contempt and reproaches of the pagans who very frequently asked what must be the fate of the empire attacked on every side by the barbarians if all mankind should adopt the pusillanimous sentiments of the new sect as well as we can judge from the mutilated representation of origin l viii p     his adversary celsus had urged his objection with great force and candor  to this insulting question the christian apologists returned obscure and ambiguous answers as they were unwilling to reveal the secret cause of their security the expectation that before the conversion of mankind was accomplished war government the roman empire and the world itself would be no more it may be observed that in this instance likewise the situation of the first christians coincided very happily with their religious scruples and that their aversion to an active life contributed rather to excuse them from the service than to exclude them from the honors of the state and army  v but the human character however it may be exalted or depressed by a temporary enthusiasm will return by degrees to its proper and the fifth cause the christians active in the government of the church natural level and will resume those passions that seem the most adapted to its present condition the primitive christians were dead to the business and pleasures of the world but their love of action which could never be entirely extinguished soon revived and found a new occupation in the government of the church a separate society which attacked the established religion of the empire was obliged to adopt some form of internal policy and to appoint a sufficient number of ministers entrusted not only with the spiritual functions but even with the temporal direction of the christian commonwealth the safety of that society its honor its aggrandisement were productive even in the most pious minds of a spirit of patriotism such as the first of the romans had felt for the republic and sometimes of a similar indifference in the use of whatever means might probably conduce to so desirable an end the ambition of raising themselves or their friends to the honors and offices of the church was disguised by the laudable intention of devoting to the public benefit the power and consideration which for that purpose only it became their duty to solicit in the exercise of their functions they were frequently called upon to detect the errors of heresy or the arts of faction to oppose the designs of perfidious brethren to stigmatize their characters with deserved infamy and to expel them from the bosom of a society whose peace and happiness they had attempted to disturb the ecclesiastical governors of the christians were taught to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove but as the former was refined so the latter was insensibly corrupted by the habits of government in the church as well as in the world the persons who were placed in any public station rendered themselves considerable by their eloquence and firmness by their knowledge of mankind and by their dexterity in business and while they concealed from others and perhaps from themselves the secret motives of their conduct they too frequently relapsed into all the turbulent passions of active life which were tinctured with an additional degree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infusion of spiritual zeal  the government of the church has often been its primitive freedom and equality the subject as well as the prize of religious contention the hostile disputants of rome of paris of oxford and of geneva have alike struggled to reduce the primitive and apostolic model the aristocratical party in france as well as in england has strenuously maintained the divine origin of bishops but the calvinistical presbyters were impatient of a superior and the roman pontiff refused to acknowledge an equal see fra paolo  to the respective standards of their own policy the few who have pursued this inquiry with more candor and impartiality are of opinion in the history of the christian hierarchy i have for the most part followed the learned and candid mosheim  that the apostles declined the office of legislation and rather chose to endure some partial scandals and divisions than to exclude the christians of a future age from the liberty of varying their forms of ecclesiastical government according to the changes of times and circumstances the scheme of policy which under their approbation was adopted for the use of the first century may be discovered from the practice of jerusalem of ephesus or of corinth the societies which were instituted in the cities of the roman empire were united only by the ties of faith and charity independence and equality formed the basis of their internal constitution the want of discipline and human learning was supplied by the occasional assistance of the prophets for the prophets of the primitive church see mosheim dissertationes ad hist eccles pertinentes tom ii p       0   who were called to that function without distinction of age of sex or of natural abilities and who as often as they felt the divine impulse poured forth the effusions of the spirit in the assembly of the faithful but these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused or misapplied by the prophetic teachers they displayed them at an improper season presumptuously disturbed the service of the assembly and by their pride or mistaken zeal they introduced particularly into the apostolic church of corinth a long and melancholy train of disorders see the epistles of st paul and of clemens to the corinthians  as the institution of prophets became useless and even pernicious their powers were withdrawn and their office abolished the public functions of religion were solely entrusted to the established ministers of the church the bishops and the presbyters two appellations which in their first origin appear to have distinguished the same office and the same order of persons the name of presbyter was expressive of their age or rather of their gravity and wisdom the title of bishop denoted their inspection over the faith and manners of the christians who were committed to their pastoral care in proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful a larger or smaller number of these episcopal presbyters guided each infant congregation with equal authority and with united counsels hookers ecclesiastical polity l vii   but the most perfect equality of freedom requires institution of bishops as presidents of the college of presbyters the directing hand of a superior magistrate and the order of public deliberations soon introduces the office of a president invested at least with the authority of collecting the sentiments and of executing the resolutions of the assembly a regard for the public tranquillity which would so frequently have been interrupted by annual or by occasional elections induced the primitive christians to constitute an honorable and perpetual magistracy and to choose one of the wisest and most holy among their presbyters to execute during his life the duties of their ecclesiastical governor it was under these circumstances that the lofty title of bishop began to raise itself above the humble appellation of presbyter and while the latter remained the most natural distinction for the members of every christian senate the former was appropriated to the dignity of its new president see jerome ad titum c   and epistol    in the benedictine edition  0  and the elaborate apology of blondel prosententia hieronymi the ancient state as it is described by jerome of the bishop and presbyters of alexandria receives a remarkable confirmation from the patriarch eutichius annal tom i p   0 verse pocock whose testimony i know not how to reject in spite of all the objections of the learned pearson in his vindiciae ignatianae part i c     the advantages of this episcopal form of government which appears to have been introduced before the end of the first century see the introduction to the apocalypse bishops under the name of angels were already instituted in seven cities of asia and yet the epistle of clemens which is probably of as ancient a date does not lead us to discover any traces of episcopacy either at corinth or rome  were so obvious and so important for the future greatness as well as the present peace of christianity that it was adopted without delay by all the societies which were already scattered over the empire had acquired in a very early period the sanction of antiquity nulla ecclesia sine episcopo has been a fact as well as a maxim since the time of tertullian and irenaeus  and is still revered by the most powerful churches both of the east and of the west as a primitive and even as a divine establishment after we have passed the difficulties of the first century we find the episcopal government universally established till it was interrupted by the republican genius of the swiss and german reformers  it is needless to observe that the pious and humble presbyters who were first dignified with the episcopal title could not possess and would probably have rejected the power and pomp which now encircles the tiara of the roman pontiff or the mitre of a german prelate but we may define in a few words the narrow limits of their original jurisdiction which was chiefly of a spiritual though in some instances of a temporal nature see mosheim in the first and second centuries ignatius ad smyrnaeos c   etc is fond of exalting the episcopal dignity le clerc hist eccles p     very bluntly censures his conduct mosheim with a more critical judgment p     suspects the purity even of the smaller epistles  it consisted in the administration of the sacraments and discipline of the church the superintendency of religious ceremonies which imperceptibly increased in number and variety the consecration of ecclesiastical ministers to whom the bishop assigned their respective functions the management of the public fund and the determination of all such differences as the faithful were unwilling to expose before the tribunal of an idolatrous judge these powers during a short period were exercised according to the advice of the presbyteral college and with the consent and approbation of the assembly of christians the primitive bishops were considered only as the first of their equals and the honorable servants of a free people whenever the episcopal chair became vacant by death a new president was chosen among the presbyters by the suffrage of the whole congregation every member of which supposed himself invested with a sacred and sacerdotal character nonne et laici sacerdotes sumus tertullian exhort ad castitat c   as the human heart is still the same several of the observations which mr hume has made on enthusiasm essays vol i p    quarto edit may be applied even to real inspiration   such was the mild and equal constitution by provincial councils which the christians were governed more than an hundred years after the death of the apostles every society formed within itself a separate and independent republic and although the most distant of these little states maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourse of letters and deputations the christian world was not yet connected by any supreme authority or legislative assembly as the numbers of the faithful were gradually multiplied they discovered the advantages that might result from a closer union of their interest and designs toward the end of the second century the churches of greece and asia adopted the useful institutions of provincial synods and they may justly be supposed to have borrowed the model of a representative council from the celebrated examples of their own country the amphictyons the achaean league or the assemblies of the ionian cities it was soon established as a custom and as a law that the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the capital of the province at the stated periods of spring and autumn their deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few distinguished presbyters and moderated by the presence of a listening multitude acta council carthag apud cyprian edit fell p     this council was composed of eightyseven bishops from the provinces of mauritania numidia and africa some presbyters and deacons assisted at the assembly praesente plebis maxima part  their decrees which were styled canons regulated every important controversy of faith and discipline and it was natural to believe that a liberal effusion of the holy spirit would be poured on the united assembly of the delegates of the christian people the institution of synods was so well suited to private ambition and to public interest that in the space of a few years it was received throughout the whole empire a regular correspondence union of the church was established between the provincial councils which mutually communicated and approved their respective proceedings and the catholic church soon assumed the form and acquired the strength of a great soederative republic aguntur praeterea per graecias illas certis in locis concilia etc tertullian de jejuniis c    the african mentions it as a recent and foreign institution the coalition of the christian churches is very ably explained by mosheim p        0   as the legislative authority of the particular progress of episcopal authority churches was insensibly superseded by the use of councils the bishops obtained by their alliance a much larger share of executive and arbitrary power and as soon as they were connected by a sense of their common interest they were enabled to attack with united vigor the original rights of their clergy and people the prelates of the third century imperceptibly changed the language of exhortation into that of command scattered the seeds of future usurpations and supplied by scripture allegories and declamatory rhetoric their deficiency of force and of reason they exalted the unity and power of the church as it was represented in the episcopal office of which every bishop enjoyed an equal and undivided portion cyprian in his admired treatise de unitate ecclesiae p         princes and magistrates it was often repeated might boast an earthly claim to a transitory dominion it was the episcopal authority alone which was derived from the deity and extended itself over this and over another world the bishops were the vicegerents of christ the successors of the apostles and the mystic substitutes of the high priest of the mosaic law their exclusive privilege of conferring the sacerdotal character invaded the freedom both of clerical and of popular elections and if in the administration of the church they still consulted the judgment of the presbyters or the inclination of the people they most carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary condescension the bishops acknowledged the supreme authority which resided in the assembly of their brethren but in the government of his peculiar diocese each of them exacted from his flock the same implicit obedience as if that favorite metaphor had been literally just and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted nature than that of his sheep we may appeal to the whole tenor of cyprians conduct of his doctrine and of his epistles le clerc in a short life of cyprian bibliotheque universelle tom xii p  0       has laid him open with great freedom and accuracy  this obedience however was not imposed without some efforts on one side and some resistance on the other the democratical part of the constitution was in many places very warmly supported by the zealous or interested opposition of the inferior clergy but their patriotism received the ignominious epithets of faction and schism and the episcopal cause was indebted for its rapid progress to the labors of many active prelates who like cyprian of carthage could reconcile the arts of the most ambitious statesman with the christian virtues which seem adapted to the character of a saint and martyr if novatus felicissimus etc whom the bishop of carthage expelled from his church and from africa were not the most detestable monsters of wickedness the zeal of cyprian must occasionally have prevailed over his veracity for a very just account of these obscure quarrels see mosheim p            the same causes which at first had destroyed preeminence of the metropolitan churches the equality of the presbyters introduced among the bishops a preeminence of rank and from thence a superiority of jurisdiction as often as in the spring and autumn they met in provincial synod the difference of personal merit and reputation was very sensibly felt among the members of the assembly and the multitude was governed by the wisdom and eloquence of the few but the order of public proceedings required a more regular and less invidious distinction the office of perpetual presidents in the councils of each province was conferred on the bishops of the principal city and these aspiring prelates who soon acquired the lofty titles of metropolitans and primates secretly prepared themselves to usurp over their episcopal brethren the same authority which the bishops had so lately assumed above the college of presbyters mosheim p         dupin antiquae eccles discipline p     0  nor was it long before an emulation of preeminence and power prevailed among the metropolitans themselves each of them affecting to display in the most pompous terms the temporal honors and advantages of the city over which he presided the numbers and opulence of the christians who were subject to their pastoral care the saints and martyrs who had arisen among them and the purity with which they preserved the tradition of the faith as it had been transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops from the apostle or the apostolic disciple to whom the foundation of their church was ascribed tertullian in a distinct treatise has pleaded against the heretics the right of prescription as it was held by the apostolic churches  from every cause either of a civil or of an ecclesiastical nature it was easy to foresee that rome must enjoy the respect and would soon claim the obedience of the provinces the society of the faithful ambition of the roman pontiff bore a just proportion to the capital of the empire and the roman church was the greatest the most numerous and in regard to the west the most ancient of all the christian establishments many of which had received their religion from the pious labors of her missionaries instead of one apostolic founder the utmost boast of antioch of ephesus or of corinth the banks of the tyber were supposed to have been honored with the preaching and martyrdom of the two most eminent among the apostles the journey of st peter to rome is mentioned by most of the ancients see eusebius ii    maintained by all the catholics allowed by some protestants see pearson and dodwell de success episcop roman but has been vigorously attacked by spanheim miscellanea sacra iii   according to father hardouin the monks of the thirteenth century who composed the aeneid represented st peter under the allegorical character of the trojan hero  and the bishops of rome very prudently claimed the inheritance of whatsoever prerogatives were attributed either to the person or to the office of st peter it is in french only that the famous allusion to st peters name is exact tu es pierre et sur cette pierre  the same is imperfect in greek latin italian etc and totally unintelligible in our teutonic languages  the bishops of italy and of the provinces were disposed to allow them a primacy of order and association such was their very accurate expression in the christian aristocracy irenaeus adv haereses iii   tertullian de praescription c    and cyprian epistol             le clerc hist eccles p     and mosheim p         labor in the interpretation of these passages but the loose and rhetorical style of the fathers often appears favorable to the pretensions of rome  but the power of a monarch was rejected with abhorrence and the aspiring genius of rome experienced from the nations of asia and africa a more vigorous resistance to her spiritual than she had formerly done to her temporal dominion the patriotic cyprian who ruled with the most absolute sway the church of carthage and the provincial synods opposed with resolution and success the ambition of the roman pontiff artfully connected his own cause with that of the eastern bishops and like hannibal sought out new allies in the heart of asia see the sharp epistle from firmilianus bishop of caesarea to stephen bishop of rome ap cyprian epistol     if this punic war was carried on without any effusion of blood it was owing much less to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending prelates invectives and excommunications were their only weapons and these during the progress of the whole controversy they hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion the hard necessity of censuring either a pope or a saint and martyr distresses the modern catholics whenever they are obliged to relate the particulars of a dispute in which the champions of religion indulged such passions as seem much more adapted to the senate or to the camp concerning this dispute of the rebaptism of heretics see the epistles of cyprian and the seventh book of eusebius   the progress of the ecclesiastical authority laity and clergy gave birth to the memorable distinction of the laity and of the clergy which had been unknown to the greeks and romans for the origin of these words see mosheim p     spanheim hist ecclesiast p     the distinction of clerus and laicus was established before the time of tertullian  the former of these appellations comprehended the body of the christian people the latter according to the signification of the word was appropriated to the chosen portion that had been set apart for the service of

oppressed rather than assisted by the civil magistrate but they had acquired and they employed within their own society the two most efficacious instruments of government rewards and punishments the

have been corrupted and abused by the returning selfishness of human nature and the converts who embraced the new religion were permitted to retain the possession of their patrimony to receive legacies and inheritances and to increase their separate property by all the lawful means of trade and industry instead of an absolute sacrifice a moderate proportion was accepted by the ministers of

fluctuating a nature must have varied with the poverty or the opulence of the faithful as they were dispersed in obscure villages or collected in the great cities of the empire in the time of the emperor decius it was the opinion of the magistrates that the christians of rome were possessed of very considerable wealth that vessels of gold and silver were used in their religious worship and that many among their proselytes had sold their lands and houses to increase the public riches of the sect at the expense indeed of their unfortunate children who found themselves beggars because

persecute the christians by their own avarice or that of their praetorian praefects    we should listen with distrust to the suspicions of strangers and enemies on this occasion however they receive a very specious and probable color from the two following circumstances the only ones that have reached our knowledge which define any precise sums or convey any distinct idea almost at the same period the bishop of carthage from a society less opulent than that of rome collected an hundred thousand sesterces above eight hundred and fifty pounds sterling on a sudden call of charity to redeem the brethren of numidia who had been carried away captives by the barbarians of the desert cyprian epistol     about an hundred years before the reign of decius the roman church had received in a single donation the sum of two hundred thousand sesterces from a stranger of pontus who proposed to fix his residence in the capital tertullian de prescriptione c  0  these oblations for the most part were made in money nor was the society of christians either desirous or capable of acquiring to any considerable degree the encumbrance of landed property it had been provided by several laws which were enacted with the same design as our statutes of mortmain that no real estates should be given or bequeathed to any corporate body without either a special privilege or a particular dispensation from the emperor or from the senate diocletian gave a rescript which is only a declaration of the old law collegium si nullo speciali privilegio subnixum sit haereditatem capere non posse dubium non est frapaolo c   thinks that these regulations had been much neglected since the reign of valerian  who were seldom disposed to grant them in favor of a sect at first the object of their contempt and at last of their fears and jealousy a transaction however is related under the reign of alexander severus which discovers that the restraint was sometimes eluded or suspended and that the christians were permitted to claim and to possess lands within the limits of rome itself hist august p     the ground had been public and was now disputed between the society of christians and that of butchers  the progress of christianity and the civil confusion of the empire contributed to relax the severity of the laws and before the close of the third century many considerable estates were bestowed on the opulent churches of rome milan carthage antioch alexandria and the other great cities of italy and the provinces  the bishop was the natural steward of the distribution of the revenue church the

management and distribution of the ecclesiastical revenue constitut apostol ii     if we may give credit to the vehement declamations of cyprian there were too many among his african brethren who in the execution of their charge violated every precept not only of evangelic perfection but even of moral virtue by some of these unfaithful stewards the riches of the church were lavished in sensual pleasures by others they were perverted to the purposes of private gain of fraudulent purchases and of rapacious usury cyprian de lapsis p    epistol    the charge is confirmed by the   th and  0th canon of the council of illiberis  but as long as the contributions of the christian people were free and unconstrained the abuse of their confidence could not be very frequent and the general uses to which their liberality was applied reflected honor on the religious society a decent portion was reserved for the maintenance of the bishop and his clergy a sufficient sum was allotted for the expenses of the public worship of which the feasts of love the agapae as they were called constituted a very pleasing part the whole remainder was the sacred patrimony of the poor according to the discretion of the bishop it was distributed to support widows and orphans the lame the sick and the aged of the community to comfort strangers and pilgrims and to alleviate the misfortunes of prisoners and captives more especially when their sufferings had been occasioned by their firm attachment to the cause of religion see the apologies of justin tertullian etc  a generous intercourse of charity united the most distant provinces and the smaller congregations were cheerfully assisted by the alms of their more opulent brethren the wealth and liberality of the romans to their most distant brethren is gratefully celebrated by dionysius of corinth ap eusebius l iv c     such an institution which paid less regard to the merit than to the distress of the object very materially conduced to the progress of christianity the pagans who were actuated by a sense of humanity while they derided the doctrines acknowledged the benevolence of the new sect see lucian in peregrin julian epist    seems mortified that the christian charity maintains not only their own but likewise the heathen poor  the prospect of immediate relief and of future protection allured into its hospitable bosom many of those unhappy persons whom the neglect of the world would have abandoned to the miseries of want of sickness and of old age there is some reason likewise to believe that great numbers of infants who according to the inhuman practice of the times had been exposed by their parents were frequently rescued from death baptized educated and maintained by the piety of the christians and at the expense of the public treasure such at least has been the laudable conduct of more modern missionaries under the same circumstances above three thousand newborn infants are annually exposed in the streets of pekin see le comte memoires sur la chine and the recherches sur les chinois et les egyptiens tom i p      ii it is the undoubted right of every society to exclude from its communion and benefits such among its members as reject or violate those excommunication regulations which have been established by general consent in the exercise of this power the censures of the christian church were chiefly directed against scandalous sinners and particularly those who were guilty of murder of fraud or of incontinence against the authors or the followers of any heretical opinions which had been condemned by the judgment of the episcopal order and against those unhappy persons who whether from choice or from compulsion had polluted themselves after their baptism by any act of idolatrous worship the consequences of excommunication were of a temporal as well as a spiritual nature the christian against whom it was pronounced was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful the ties both of religious and of private friendship were dissolved he found himself a profane object of abhorrence to the persons whom he the most esteemed or by whom he had been the most tenderly beloved and as far as an expulsion from a respectable society could imprint on his character a mark of disgrace he was shunned or suspected by the generality of mankind the situation of these unfortunate exiles was in itself very painful and melancholy but as it usually happens their apprehensions far exceeded their sufferings the benefits of the christian communion were those of eternal life nor could they erase from their minds the awful opinion that to those ecclesiastical governors by whom they were condemned the deity had committed the keys of hell and of paradise the heretics indeed who might be supported by the consciousness of their intentions and by the flattering hope that they alone had discovered the true path of salvation endeavored to regain in their separate assemblies those comforts temporal as well as spiritual which they no longer derived from the great society of christians but almost all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or idolatry were sensible of their fallen condition and anxiously desirous of being restored to the benefits of the christian communion  with regard to the treatment of these penitents two opposite opinions the one of justice the other of mercy divided the primitive church the more rigid and inflexible casuists refused them for ever and without exception the meanest place in the holy community which they had disgraced or deserted and leaving them to the remorse of a guilty conscience indulged them only with a faint ray of hope that the contrition of their life and death might possibly be accepted by the supreme being the montanists and the novatians who adhered to this opinion with the greatest rigor and obstinacy found themselves at last in the number of excommunicated heretics see the learned and copious mosheim secul ii and iii  a milder sentiment was embraced in practice as well as in theory by the purest and most respectable of the christian churches dionysius ap eusebius iv    cyprian de lapsis  the gates of reconciliation and of heaven were seldom shut against the returning penitent but a severe and solemn form of discipline was instituted which while it served to expiate his crime might powerfully deter the spectators from the imitation of his example humbled by a public confession emaciated by public penance fasting and clothed in sackcloth the penitent lay prostrate at the door of the assembly imploring with tears the pardon of his offenses and soliciting the prayers of the faithful caves primitive christianity part iii c   the admirers of antiquity regret the loss of this public penance  if the fault was of a very heinous nature whole years of penance were esteemed an inadequate satisfaction to the divine justice and it was always by slow and painful gradations that the sinner the heretic or the apostate was readmitted into the bosom of the church a sentence of perpetual excommunication was however reserved for some crimes of an extraordinary magnitude and particularly for the inexcusable relapses of those penitents who had already experienced and abused the clemency of their ecclesiastical superiors according to the circumstances or the number of the guilty the exercise of the christian discipline was varied by the discretion of the bishops the councils of ancyra and illiberis were held about the same time the one in galatia the other in spain but their respective canons which are still extant seem to breathe a very different spirit the galatian who after his baptism had repeatedly sacrificed to idols might obtain his pardon by a penance of seven years and if he had seduced others to imitate his example only three years more were added to the term of his exile but the unhappy spaniard who had committed the same offense was deprived of the hope of reconciliation even in the article of death and his idolatry was placed at the head of a list of seventeen other crimes against which a sentence no less terrible was pronounced among these we may distinguish the inexpiable guilt of calumniating a bishop a presbyter or even a deacon see in dupin bibliotheque ecclesiastique tom ii p  0       a short but rational exposition of the canons of those councils which were assembled in the first moments of tranquillity after the persecution of diocletian this persecution had been much less severely felt in spain than in galatia a difference which may in some measure account for the contrast of their regulations   the welltempered mixture of liberality and rigor the judicious dispensation of rewards and the dignity of episcopal government punishments according to the maxims of policy as well as justice constituted the human strength of the church the bishops whose paternal care extended itself to the government of both worlds were sensible of the importance of these prerogatives and covering their ambition with the fair pretense of the love of order they were jealous of any rival in the exercise of a discipline so necessary to prevent the desertion of those troops which had inlisted themselves under the banner of the cross and whose numbers every day became more considerable from the imperious declamations of cyprian we should naturally conclude that the doctrines of excommunication and penance formed the most essential part of religion and that it was much less dangerous for the disciples of christ to neglect the observance of the moral duties than to despise the censures and authority of their bishops sometimes we might imagine that we were listening to the voice of moses when he commanded the earth to open and to swallow up in consuming flames the rebellious race which refused obedience to the priesthood of aaron and we should sometimes suppose that we heard a roman consul asserting the majesty of the republic and declaring his inflexible resolution to enforce the rigor of the laws if such irregularities are suffered with impunity it is thus that the bishop of carthage chides the lenity of his colleague if such irregularities are suffered there is an end of episcopal vigor cyprian epist     an end of the sublime and divine power of governing the church an end of christianity itself cyprian had renounced those temporal honors which it is probable he would never have obtained but the acquisition of such absolute command over the consciences and understanding of a congregation however obscure or despised by the world is more truly grateful to the pride of the human heart than the possession of the most despotic power imposed by arms and conquest on a reluctant people  in the course of this important though perhaps recapitulation of the five causes tedious inquiry i have attempted to display the secondary causes which so efficaciously assisted the truth of the christian religion if among these causes we have discovered any artificial ornaments any accidental circumstances or any mixture of error and passion it cannot appear surprising that mankind should be the most sensibly affected by such motives as were suited to their imperfect nature it was by the aid of these causes exclusive zeal the immediate expectation of another world the claim of miracles the practice of rigid virtue and the constitution of the primitive church that christianity spread itself with so much success in the roman empire to the first of these the christians were indebted for their invincible valor which disdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were resolved to vanquish the three succeeding causes supplied their valor with the most formidable arms the last of these causes united their courage directed their arms and gave their efforts that irresistible weight which even a small band of welltrained and intrepid volunteers has so often possessed over an undisciplined multitude ignorant of the subject and careless of the event of the war in the various religions of polytheism some weakness of polytheism wandering fanatics of egypt and syria who addressed themselves to the credulous superstition of the populace were perhaps the only order of priests the arts the manners and the vices of the priests of the syrian goddess are very humourously described by apuleius in the eighth book of his metamorphoses that derived their whole support and credit from their sacerdotal profession and were very deeply affected by a personal concern for the safety or prosperity of their tutelar deities the ministers of polytheism both in rome and in the provinces were for the most part men of a noble birth and of an affluent fortune who received as an honorable distinction the care of a celebrated temple or of a public sacrifice exhibited very frequently at their own expense the sacred games the office of asiarch was of this nature and it is frequently mentioned in aristides the inscriptions etc it was annual and elective none but the vainest citizens could desire the honor none but the most wealthy could support the expense see in the patres apostol tom ii p  00 with how much indifference philip the asiarch conducted himself in the martyrdom of polycarp there were likewise bithyniarchs lyciarchs etc  and with cold indifference performed the ancient rites according to the laws and fashion of their country as they were engaged in the ordinary occupations of life their zeal and devotion were seldom animated by a sense of interest or by the habits of an ecclesiastical character confined to their respective temples and cities they remained without any connection of discipline or government and whilst they acknowledged the supreme jurisdiction of the senate of the college of pontiffs and of the emperor those civil magistrates contented themselves with the easy task of maintaining in peace and dignity the general worship of mankind we have already seen how various how loose and how uncertain were the religious sentiments of polytheists they were abandoned almost without control to the natural workings of a superstitious fancy the accidental circumstances of their life and situation determined the object as well as the degree of their devotion and as long as their adoration was successively prostituted to a thousand deities it was scarcely possible that their hearts could be susceptible of a very sincere or lively passion for any of them  when christianity appeared in the world even the skepticism of the pagan world proved favorable to the new religion these faint and imperfect impressions had lost much of their original power human reason which by its unassisted strength is incapable of perceiving the mysteries of faith had already obtained an easy triumph over the folly of paganism and when tertullian or lactantius employ their labors in exposing its falsehood and extravagance they are obliged to transcribe the eloquence of cicero or the wit of lucian the contagion of these skeptical writings had been diffused far beyond the number of their readers the fashion of incredulity was communicated from the philosopher to the man of pleasure or business from the noble to the plebeian and from the master to the menial slave who waited at his table and who eagerly listened to the freedom of his conversation on public occasions the philosophic part of mankind affected to treat with respect and decency the religious institutions of their country but their secret contempt penetrated through the thin and awkward disguise and even the people when they discovered that their deities were rejected and derided by those whose rank or understanding they were accustomed to reverence were filled with doubts and apprehensions concerning the truth of those doctrines to which they had yielded the most implicit belief the decline of ancient prejudice exposed a very numerous portion of human kind to the danger of a painful and comfortless situation a state of skepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive minds but the practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude that if they are forcibly awakened they still regret the loss of their pleasing vision their love of the mavelous and supernatural their curiosity with regard to future events and their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond the limits of the visible world were the principal causes which favored the establishment of polytheism so urgent on the vulgar is the necessity of believing that the fall of any system of mythology will most probably be succeeded by the introduction of some other mode of superstition some deities of a more recent and fashionable cast might soon have occupied the deserted temples of jupiter and apollo if in the decisive moment the wisdom of providence had not interposed a genuine revelation fitted to inspire the most rational esteem and conviction whilst at the same time it was adorned with all that could attract the curiosity the wonder and the veneration of the people in their actual disposition as many were almost disengaged from their artificial prejudices but equally susceptible and desirous of a devout attachment an object much less deserving would have been sufficient to fill the vacant place in their hearts and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of their passions those who are inclined to pursue this reflection instead of viewing with astonishment the rapid progress of christianity will perhaps be surprised that its success was not still more rapid and still more universal  it has been observed with truth as well as as well as the peace and union of the roman empire propriety that the conquests of rome prepared and facilitated those of christianity in the second chapter of this work we have attempted to explain in what manner the most civilized provinces of europe asia and africa were united under the dominion of one sovereign and gradually connected by the most intimate ties of laws of manners and of language the jews of palestine who had fondly expected a temporal deliverer gave so cold a reception to the miracles of the divine prophet that it was found unnecessary to publish or at least to preserve any hebrew gospel the modern critics are not disposed to believe what the fathers almost unanimously assert that st matthew composed a hebrew gospel of which only the greek translation is extant it seems however dangerous to reject their testimony  the authentic histories of the actions of christ were composed in the greek language at a considerable distance from jerusalem and after the gentile converts were grown extremely numerous under the reigns of nero and domitian and in the cities of alexandria antioch rome and ephesus see mill prolegomena ad nov testament and dr lardners fair and extensive collection vol xv  as soon as those histories were translated into the latin tongue they were perfectly intelligible to all the subjects of rome excepting only to the peasants of syria and egypt for whose benefit particular versions were afterward made the public highways which had been constructed for the use of the legions opened an easy passage for the christian missionaries from damascus to corinth and from italy to the extremity of spain or britain nor did those spiritual conquerors encounter any of the obstacles which usually retard or prevent the introduction of a foreign religion into a distant country there is the strongest reason to believe that before the reigns of diocletian and constantine the faith of christ had been preached in every province and in all the great cities of the empire but the foundation of the several historical view of the progress of christianity congregations the numbers of the faithful who composed them and their proportion to the unbelieving multitude are now buried in obscurity or disguised by fiction and declamation such imperfect circumstances however as have reached our knowledge concerning the increase of the christian name in asia and greece in egypt in italy and in the west we shall now proceed to relate without neglecting the real or imaginary acquisitions which lay beyond the frontiers of the roman empire  the rich provinces that extend from the in the east euphrates to the ionian sea were the principal theater on which the apostle of the gentiles displayed his zeal and piety the seeds of the gospel which he had scattered in a fertile soil were diligently cultivated by his disciples and it should seem that during the two first centuries the most considerable body of christians was contained within those limits among the societies which were instituted in syria none were more ancient or more illustrious than those of damascus of berea or aleppo and of antioch the prophetic introduction of the apocalypse has described and immortalised the seven churches of asia ephesus smyrna pergamus thyatira the alogians epiphanius de haeres    disputed the genuineness of the apocalypse because the church of thyatira was not yet founded epiphanius who allows the fact extricates himself from the difficulty by ingeniously supposing that st john wrote in the spirit of prophecy see abauzit discourse sur lapocalypse  sardes laodicea and philadelphia and their colonies were soon diffused over that populous country in a very early period the islands of cyprus and crete the provinces of thrace and macedonia gave a favorable reception to the new religion and christian republics were soon founded in the cities of corinth of sparta and of athens the epistles of ignatius and dionysius ap eusebius iv    point out many churches in asia and greece that of athens seems to have been one of the least flourishing  the antiquity of the greek and asiatic churches allowed a sufficient space of time for their increase and multiplication and even the swarms of gnostics and other heretics serve to display the flourishing condition of the orthodox church since the appellation of heretics has always been applied to the less numerous party to these domestic testimonies we may add the confession the complaints and the apprehensions of the gentiles themselves from the writings of lucian a philosopher who had studied mankind and who describes their manners in the most lively colors we may learn that under the reign of commodus his native country of pontus was filled with epicureans and christians lucian in alexandro c    christianity however must have been very unequally diffused over pontus since in the middle of the third century there were no more than seventeen believers in the extensive diocese of neocaesarea see m de tillemont memoires ecclesiast tom iv p     from basil and gregory of nyssa who were themselves natives of cappadocia  within fourscore years after the death of christ according to the ancients jesus christ suffered under the consulship of the two gemini in the year    of our present era pliny was sent into bithynia according to pagi in the year   0  the humane pliny laments the magnitude of the evil which he vainly attempted to eradicate in his very curious epistle to the emperor trajan he affirms that the temples were almost deserted that the sacred victims scarcely found any purchasers and that the superstition had not only infected the cities but had even spread itself into the villages and the open country of pontus and bithynia plin epist x      without descending into a minute scrutiny of the church of antioch the expressions or of the motives of those writers who either celebrate or lament the progress of christianity in the east it may in general be observed that none of them have left us any grounds from whence a just estimate might be formed of the real numbers of the faithful in those provinces one circumstance however has been fortunately preserved which seems to cast a more distinct light on this obscure but interesting subject under the reign of theodosius after christianity had enjoyed during more than sixty years the sunshine of imperial favor the ancient and illustrious church of antioch consisted of one hundred thousand persons three thousand of whom were supported out of the public oblations chrysostom opera tom vii p       0  the splendor and dignity of the queen of the east the acknowledged populousness of caesarea seleucia and alexandria and the destruction of two hundred and fifty thousand souls in the earthquake which afflicted antioch under the elder justin john malela tom ii p     he draws the same conclusion with regard to the populousness of antioch  are so many convincing proofs that the whole number of its inhabitants was not less than half a million and that the christians however multiplied by zeal and power did not exceed a fifth part of that great city how different a proportion must we adopt when we compare the persecuted with the triumphant church the west with the east remote villages with populous towns and countries recently converted to the faith with the place where the believers first received the appellation of christians it must not however be dissembled that in another passage chrysostom to whom we are indebted for this useful information computes the multitude of the faithful as even superior to that of the jews and pagans chrysostom tom i p     i am indebted for these passages though not for my inference to the learned dr lardner credibility of the gospel history vol xii p   0  but the solution of this apparent difficulty is easy and obvious the eloquent preacher draws a parallel between the civil and the ecclesiastical constitution of antioch between the list of christians who had acquired heaven by baptism and the list of citizens who had a right to share the public liberality slaves strangers and infants were comprised in the former they were excluded from the latter  the extensive commerce of alexandria and in egypt its proximity to palestine gave an easy entrance to the new religion it was at first embraced by great numbers of the therapeutae or essenians of the lake mareotis a jewish sect which had abated much of its reverence for the mosaic ceremonies the austere life of the essenians their fasts and excommunications the community of goods the love of celibacy their zeal for martyrdom and the warmth though not the purity of their faith already offered a very lively image of the primitive discipline basnage histoire des juifs l   c  0          has examined with the most critical accuracy the curious treatise of philo which describes the therapeutae by proving that it was composed as early as the time of augustus basnage has demonstrated in spite of eusebius l ii c    and a crowd of modern catholics that the therapeutae were neither christians nor monks it still remains probable that they changed their name preserved their manners adopted some new articles of faith and gradually became the fathers of the egyptian ascetics  it was in the school of alexandria that the christian theology appears to have assumed a regular and scientifical form and when hadrian visited egypt he found a church composed of jews and of greeks sufficiently important to attract the notice of that inquisitive prince see a letter of hadrian in the augustan history p      but the progress of christianity was for a long time confined within the limits of a single city which was itself a foreign colony and till the close of the second century the predecessors of demetrius were the only prelates of the egyptian church three bishops were consecrated by the hands of demetrius and the number was increased to twenty by his successor heraclas for the succession of alexandrian bishops consult renaudots history p    etc this curious fact is preserved by the patriarch eutychius annal tom i p     verse pocock and its internal evidence would alone be a sufficient answer to all the objections which bishop pearson has urged in the vindiciae ignatianae  the body of the natives a people distinguished by a sullen inflexibility of temper ammian marcellin xxii     entertained the new doctrine with coldness and reluctance and even in the time of origin it was rare to meet with an egyptian who had surmounted his early prejudices in favor of the sacred animals of his country origin contra celsum l i p  0  as soon indeed as christianity ascended the throne the zeal of those barbarians obeyed the prevailing impulsion the cities of egypt were filled with bishops and the deserts of thebais swarmed with hermits  a perpetual stream of strangers and provincials in rome flowed into the capacious bosom of rome whatever was strange or odious whoever was guilty or suspected might hope in the obscurity of that immense capital to elude the vigilance of the law in such a various conflux of nations every teacher either of truth or of falsehood every founder whether of a virtuous or a criminal association might easily multiply his disciples or accomplices the christians of rome at the time of the accidental persecution of nero are represented by tacitus as already amounting to a very great multitude ingens multitudo is the expression of tacitus xv     and the language of that great historian is almost similar to the style employed by livy when he relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of bacchus after the bacchanals had awakened the severity of the senate it was likewise apprehended that a very great multitude as it were another people had been initiated into those abhorred mysteries a more careful inquiry soon demonstrated that the offenders did not exceed seven thousand a number indeed sufficiently alarming when considered as the object of public justice t live xxxix             nothing could exceed the horror and consternation of the senate on the discovery of the bacchanalians whose depravity is described and perhaps exaggerated by livy  it is with the same candid allowance that we should interpret the vague expressions of tacitus and in a former instance of pliny when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded fanatics who had forsaken the established worship of the gods the church of rome was undoubtedly the first and most populous of the empire and we are possessed of an authentic record which attests the state of religion in that city about the middle of the third century and after a piece of thirtyeight years the clergy at that time consisted of a bishop fortysix presbyters seven deacons as many subdeacons fortytwo acolythes and fifty readers exorcists and porters the number of widows of the infirm and of the poor who were maintained by the oblations of the faithful amounted to fifteen hundred eusebius l vi c    the latin translator m de valois has though proper to reduce the number of presbyters to fortyfour  from reason as well as from the analogy of antioch we may venture to estimate the christians of rome at about fifty thousand the populousness of that great capital cannot perhaps be exactly ascertained but the most modest calculation will not surely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants of whom the christians might constitute at the most a twentieth part this proportion of the presbyters and of the poor to the rest of the people was originally fixed by burnet travels into italy p     and is approved by moyle vol ii p     they were both unacquainted with the passage of chrysostom which converts their conjecture almost into a fact   the western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge of christianity from the same source which had diffused among them the language in africa and the western provinces the sentiments and the manners of rome in this more important circumstance africa as well as gaul was gradually fashioned to the imitation of the capital yet notwithstanding

principal members of the primitive church the practice introduced into that province of appointing bishops to the most inconsiderable towns and very frequently to the most obscure villages contributed to multiply the splendor and importance of their religious societies which during the course of the third century were animated by the zeal of tertullian directed by the abilities of cyprian and adorned by the eloquence of lactantius but if on the contrary we turn our eyes toward gaul we must content ourselves with discovering in the time of marcus antoninus the feeble and united congregations of lions and vienna and even as late as the reign of decius we are assured that in a few cities only arles narbonne thoulouse limoges clermont tours and paris some scattered churches

recently founded see memoires de tillemont tom vi part i p         silence is indeed very consistent with devotion but as it is seldom compatible with zeal we may perceive and lament the languid state of christianity in those provinces which had exchanged the celtic for the latin tongue since they did not during the three first centuries give birth to a single ecclesiastical writer from gaul which claimed a just preeminence of learning and authority over all the countries on this side of the alps the light of the gospel was more faintly reflected on the remote provinces of spain and britain and if we may credit the vehement assertions of tertullian they had already received the first rays of the faith when he addressed his apology to the magistrates of the emperor severus the date of tertullians apology is fixed in a dissertation of mosheim to the year      but the obscure and imperfect origin of the western churches of europe has been so negligently recorded that if we would relate the time and manner of their foundation we must supply the silence of antiquity by those legends which avarice or superstition long afterward dictated to the monks in the lazy gloom of their convents in the fifteenth century there were few who had either inclination or courage to question whether joseph of arimathea founded the monastery of glastenbury and whether dionysius the areopagite

rash sally of a devout but careless writer the measure of whose belief was regulated by that of his wishes but neither the belief nor the wishes of the fathers can alter the truth of history it will still remain an undoubted fact that the barbarians of scythia and germany who afterward subverted the roman monarchy were involved in the darkness of paganism and that even the conversion of iberia of armenia or of aethiopia was not attempted with any degree of success till the scepter was in the hands of an orthodox emperor see the fourth century of mosheims history of the church many though very confused circumstances that relate to the conversion of iberia and armenia may be found in moses of chorene l ii c         before that time the various accidents of war and commerce might indeed diffuse an imperfect knowledge of the gospel among the tribes of caledonia according to tertullian the christian faith had penetrated into parts of britain inaccessible to the roman arms about a

great numbers of captives some of whom were christians and became missionaries see tillemont memoires ecclesiast tom iv p     beyond the lastmentioned river edessa was distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the faith the legend of abgarus fabulous as it is affords a decisive proof that many years before eusebius wrote his history the greatest part of the inhabitants of edessa had embraced christianity their rivals the citizens of carrhae adhered on the contrary to the cause of paganism as late as the sixth century  from edessa the principles of christianity were easily introduced into the greek and syrian cities which obeyed the successors of artaxerxes but they do not appear to have made any deep impression on the minds of the persians whose religious system by the labors of a welldisciplined order of priests had been constructed with much more art and solidity than the uncertain mythology of greece and rome according to bardesanes ap eusebius praepar evangel there were some christians in persia before the end of the second century in the time of constantine see his epistle to sapor vit l iv c    they composed a flourishing church consult beausobre hist critique du manicheisme tom i p   0 and the bibliotheca orientalis of assemani   from this impartial though imperfect survey of the progress of christianity it may perhaps seem probable that the number of its proselytes general proportion of christians and pagans has been excessively magnified by fear on the one side and by devotion on the other according to the irreproachable testimony of origin origin contra celsum l viii p      the proportion of the faithful was very inconsiderable when compared with the multitude of an unbelieving world but as we are left without any distinct information it is impossible to determine and it is difficult even to conjecture the real numbers of the primitive christians the most favorable calculation however that can be deduced from the examples of antioch and of rome will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth part of the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under the banner of the cross before the important conversion of constantine but their habits of faith of zeal and of union seemed to multiply their numbers and the same causes which contributed to their future increase served to render their actual strength more apparent and more formidable  such is the constitution of civil society that whether the first christians were mean and ignorant whilst a few persons are distinguished by riches by honors and by knowledge the body of the people is condemned to obscurity ignorance and poverty the christian religion which addressed itself to the whole human race must consequently collect a far greater number of proselytes from the lower than from the superior ranks of life this innocent and natural circumstance has been improved into a very odious imputation which seems to be less strenuously denied by the apologists than it is urged by the adversaries of the faith that the new sect of christians was almost entirely composed of the dregs of the populace of peasants and mechanics of boys and women of beggars and slaves the last of whom might sometimes introduce the missionaries into the rich and noble families to which they belonged these obscure teachers such was the charge of malice and infidelity are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in private whilst they cautiously avoid the dangerous encounter of philosophers they mingle with the

resemblance betrays by its dark coloring and distorted features the pencil of an enemy as the humble faith of christ diffused itself through the world it was embraced by several persons who derived some consequence from the advantages of nature or fortune aristides who presented an eloquent apology to the emperor hadrian was an athenian philosopher eusebius hist eccles iv   hieronym epist     justin martyr had sought divine knowledge in the schools of zeno of aristotle of pythagoras and of plato before he fortunately was accosted by the old man or rather the angel who turned his attention to the study of the jewish prophets the story is prettily told in justins dialogues tillemont mem ecclesiast tom ii p     who relates it after him is sure that the old man was a disguised angel  clemens of alexandria had acquired much various reading in the greek and tertullian in the latin language julius africanus and origin possessed a very considerable share of the learning of their times and although the style of cyprian is very different from that of lactantius we might almost discover that both those writers had been public teachers of rhetoric even the study of philosophy was at length introduced among the christians but it was not always productive of the most salutary effects knowledge was as often the parent of heresy as of devotion and the description which was designed for the followers of artemon may with equal propriety be applied to the various sects that resisted the successors of the apostles they presume to alter the holy scriptures to abandon the ancient rule of faith and to form their opinions according to the subtle precepts of logic the science of the church is neglected for the study of geometry and they lose sight of heaven while they are employed in measuring the earth euclid is perpetually in their hands aristotle and theophrastus are the objects of their admiration and they express an uncommon reverence for the works of galen their errors are derived from the abuse of the arts and sciences of the infidels and they corrupt the simplicity of the gospel by the refinements of human reason eusebius v    it may be hoped that none except the heretics gave occasion to the complaint of celsus ap origin l ii p    that the christians were perpetually correcting and altering their gospels   nor can it be affirmed with truth that the with regard to rank and fortune advantages of birth and fortune were always separated from the profession of christianity several roman citizens were brought before the tribunal of pliny and he soon discovered that a great number of persons of every order of men in bithynia had deserted the religion of their ancestors plin epist x    fuerunt alii similis amentiae cives romani  multi enim omnis aetatis omnis ordinis utriusque sexus etiam vocantur in periculum et vocabuntur  his unsuspected testimony may in this instance obtain more credit than the bold challenge of tertullian when he addresses himself to the fears as well as to the humanity of the proconsul of africa by assuring him that if he persists in his cruel intentions he must decimate carthage and that he will find among the guilty many persons of his own rank senators and matrons of noblest extraction and the friends or relations of his most intimate friends tertullian ad scapulam yet even his rhetoric rises no higher than to claim a tenth part of carthage  it appears however that about forty years afterwards the emperor valerian was persuaded of the truth of this assertion since in one of his rescripts he evidently supposes that senators roman knights and ladies of quality were engaged in the christian sect cyprian epist     the church still continued to increase its outward splendor as it lost its internal purity and in the reign of diocletian the palace the courts of justice and even the army concealed a multitude of christians who endeavored to reconcile the interests of the present with those of a future life  and yet these exceptions are either too few in christianity most favorably received by the poor and simple number or too recent in time entirely to remove the imputation of ignorance and obscurity which has been so arrogantly cast on the first proselytes of christianity instead of employing in our defense the fictions of later ages it will be more prudent to convert the occasion of scandal into a subject of edification our serious thoughts will suggest to us that the apostles themselves were chosen by providence among the fishermen of galilee and that the lower we depress the temporal condition of the first christians the more reason we shall find to admire their merit and success it is incumbent on us diligently to remember that the kingdom of heaven was promised to the poor in spirit and that minds afflicted by calamity and the contempt of mankind cheerfully listen to the divine promise of future happiness while on the contrary the fortunate are satisfied with the possession of this world and the wise abuse in doubt and dispute their vain superiority of reason and knowledge  we stand in need of such reflections to comfort rejected by some eminent men of the first and second centuries us for the loss of some illustrious characters which in our eyes might have seemed the most worthy of the heavenly present the names of seneca of the elder and the younger pliny of tacitus of plutarch of galen of the slave epictetus and of the emperor marcus antoninus adorn the age in which they flourished and exalt the dignity of human nature they filled with glory their respective stations either in active or contemplative life their excellent understandings were improved by study philosophy had purified their minds from the prejudices of the popular superstition and their days were spent in the pursuit of truth and the practice of virtue yet all these sages it is no less an object of surprise than of concern overlooked or rejected the perfection of the christian system their language or their silence equally discover their contempt for the growing sect which in their time had diffused itself over the roman empire those among them who condescend to mention the christians consider them only as obstinate and perverse enthusiasts who exacted an implicit submission to their mysterious doctrines without being able to produce a single argument that could engage the attention of men of sense and learning dr lardner in his first and second volume of jewish and christian testimonies collects and illustrates those of pliny the younger of tacitus of galen of marcus antoninus and perhaps of epictetus for it is doubtful whether that philosopher means to speak of the christians the new sect is totally unnoticed by seneca the elder pliny and plutarch   it is at least doubtful whether any of these philosophers perused the apologies which the primitive christians repeatedly published in behalf of their neglect of prophecy themselves and of their religion but it is much to be lamented that such a cause was not defended by abler advocates they expose with superfluous wit and eloquence the extravagance of polytheism they interest our compassion by displaying the innocence and sufferings of their injured brethren but when they would demonstrate the divine origin of christianity they insist much more strongly on the predictions which announced than on the miracles which accompanied the appearance of the messiah their favorite argument might serve to edify a christian or to convert a jew since both the one and the other acknowledge the authority of those prophecies and both are obliged with devout reverence to search for their sense and their accomplishment but this mode of persuasion loses much of its weight and influence when it is addressed to those who neither understand nor respect the mosaic dispensation and the prophetic style if the famous prophecy of the seventy weeks had been alleged to a roman philosopher would he not have replied in the words of cicero quae tandem ista auguratio est annorum potius quam aut mensium aut dierum de divinatione ii  0 observe with what irreverence lucian in alexandro c    and his friend celsus ap origin l vii p     express themselves concerning the hebrew prophets  in the unskilful hands of justin and of the succeeding apologists the sublime meaning of the hebrew oracles evaporates in distant types affected conceits and cold allegories and even their authenticity was rendered suspicious to an unenlightened gentile by the mixture of pious forgeries which under the names of orpheus hermes and the sibyls the philosophers who derided the more ancient predictions of the sybils would easily have detected the jewish and christian forgeries which have been so triumphantly quoted by the fathers from justin martyr to lactantius when the sibylline verses had performed their appointed task they like the system of the millennium were quietly laid aside the christian sibyl had unluckily fixed the ruin of rome for the year     a u c      were obtruded on him as of equal value with the genuine inspirations of heaven the adoption of fraud and sophistry in the defense of revelation too often reminds us of the injudicious conduct of those poets who load their invulnerable heroes with a useless weight of cumbersome and brittle armor  but how shall we excuse the supine inattention and of miracles of the pagan and philosophic world to those evidences which were presented by the hand of omnipotence not to their reason but to their senses during the age of christ of his apostles and of their first disciples the doctrine which they preached was confirmed by innumerable prodigies the lame walked the blind saw the sick were healed the dead were raised demons were expelled and the laws of nature were frequently suspended for the benefit of the church but the general silence concerning the darkness of the passion sages of greece and rome turned aside from the awful spectacle and pursuing the ordinary occupations of life and study appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world under the reign of tiberius the whole earth the fathers as they are drawn out in battle array by dom calmet dissertations sur la bible tom iii p     0  seem to cover the whole earth with darkness in which they are

notice in an age of science and history the celebrated passage of phlegon is now wisely abandoned when tertullian assures the pagans that the mention of the prodigy is found in arcanis not archivis vestris see his apology c    he probably appeals to the sibylline verses which relate it exactly in the words of the gospel  it happened during the lifetime of seneca and the elder pliny who must have

roman government toward the christians from the reign of nero to that of constantine if we seriously consider the purity of the christian religion the sanctity of its moral precepts and the innocent as well as austere lives of the greater christianity persecuted by the roman emperors number of those who during the first ages embraced the faith of the gospel we should naturally suppose that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received with due reverence even by the unbelieving world that the learned and the polite however they might deride the miracles would have esteemed the virtues of the new sect and that the magistrates instead of persecuting would have protected an order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws though they declined the active cares of war and government if on the other hand we recollect the universal toleration of polytheism as it was invariably maintained by the faith of the people the incredulity of philosophers and the policy of the roman senate and emperors we are at a loss to discover what new offense the christians had committed what new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity and what new motives could urge the roman princes who beheld without concern a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their gentle sway to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their subjects who had chosen for themselves a singular but an inoffensive mode of faith and worship  the religious policy of the ancient world seems to have assumed a more stern and intolerant character to oppose the progress of christianity about fourscore years after the death of christ his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic character and according to the laws of an emperor distinguished by the wisdom and justice of his general administration the apologies which were repeatedly addressed to the successors of trajan are filled with the most pathetic complaints that the christians who obeyed the dictates and solicited the liberty of conscience were alone among all the subjects of the roman empire excluded from the common benefits of their auspicious government the deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care and from the time that christianity was invested with the supreme power the governors of the church have been no less diligently employed in displaying the cruelty than in imitating the conduct of their pagan adversaries to separate if it be possible a few authentic as well as interesting facts from an undigested mass of fiction and error and to relate in a clear and rational manner the causes the extent the duration and the most important circumstances of the persecutions to which the first christians were exposed is the design of the present chapter  the sectaries of a persecuted religion depressed inquiry into their motives by fear animated with resentment and perhaps heated by enthusiasm are seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate or heartily to appreciate the motives of their enemies which often escape the impartial and discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure distance from the flames of persecution a reason has been assigned for the conduct of the emperors toward the primitive christians which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of polytheism it has already been observed that the religious concord of the world was principally supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expressed for their respective traditions and ceremonies it might therefore be expected that they would unite with indignation against any sect or people which should separate itself from the communion of mankind and claiming the exclusive possession of divine knowledge should disdain every form of worship except its own as impious and idolatrous the rights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence they were justly forfeited by a refusal of the accustomed tribute as the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refused by the jews and by them alone the consideration of the treatment which they experienced from the roman magistrates will serve to explain how far these speculations are justified by facts and will lead us to discover the true causes of the persecution of christianity  without repeating what has been already mentioned rebellious spirit of the jews of the reverence of the roman princes and governors for the temple of jerusalem we shall only observe that the destruction of the temple and city was accompanied and followed by every circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the conquerors and authorize religious persecution by the most specious arguments of political justice and the public safety from the reign of nero to that of antoninus pius the jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections humanity is shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of egypt of cyprus and of cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives in cyrene they massacred   0000 greeks in cyprus   0000 in egypt a very great multitude many of these unhappy victims were sawed asunder according to a precedent to which david had given the sanction of his example the victorious jews devoured the flesh licked up the blood and twisted the entrails like a girdle round their bodies see dion cassius l lxviii p       and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the roman government but of humankind without repeating the wellknown narratives of josephus we may learn from dion l lxix p      that in hadrians war   0000 jews were cut off by the sword besides an infinite number which perished by famine by disease and by fire  the enthusiasm of the jews was supported by the opinion that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an idolatrous master and by the flattering promise which they derived from their ancient oracles that a conquering messiah would soon arise destined to break their fetters and to invest the favorites of heaven with the empire of the earth it was by announcing himself as their longexpected deliverer and by calling on all the descendants of abraham to assert the hope of israel that the famous barchochebas collected a formidable army with which he resisted during two years the power of the emperor hadrian for the sect of the zealots see basnage histoire des juiss l i c    for the characters of the messiah according to the rabbis l v c          for the actions of barchochebas l vii c      notwithstanding these repeated provocations toleration of the jewish religion the resentment of the roman princes expired after the victory nor were their apprehensions continued beyond the period of war and danger by the general indulgence of polytheism and by the mild temper of antoninus pius the jews were restored to their ancient privileges and once more obtained the permission of circumcising their children with the easy restraint that they should never confer on any foreign proselyte that distinguishing mark of the hebrew race it is to modestinus a roman lawyer l vi regular that we are indebted for a distinct knowledge of the edict of antoninus see casaubon ad hist august p     the numerous remains of that people though they were still excluded from the precincts of jerusalem were permitted to form and to maintain considerable establishments both in italy and in the provinces to acquire the freedom of rome to enjoy municipal honors and to obtain at the same time an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of society the moderation or the contempt of the romans gave a legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical police which was instituted by the vanquished sect the patriarch who had fixed his residence at tiberias was empowered to appoint his subordinate ministers and apostles to exercise a domestic jurisdiction and to receive from his dispersed brethren an annual contribution see basnage histoire des juifs l iii c     the office of patriarch was suppressed by theodosius the younger  new synagogues were frequently erected in the principal cities of the empire and the sabbaths the fasts and the festivals which were either commanded by the mosaic law or enjoined by the traditions of the rabbis were celebrated in the most solemn and public manner we need only mention the purim or deliverance of the jews from the rage of haman which till the reign of theodosius was celebrated with insolent triumph and riotous intemperance basnage hist des juifs l vi c    l viii c    such gentle treatment insensibly assuaged the stern temper of the jews awakened from their dream of prophecy and conquest they assumed the behavior of peaceable and industrious subjects their irreconcilable hatred of mankind instead of flaming out in acts of blood and violence evaporated in less dangerous gratifications they embraced every opportunity of overreaching the idolaters in trade and they pronounced secret and ambiguous imprecations against the haughty kingdom of edom according to the false josephus tsepho the grandson of esau conducted into italy the army of aeneas king of carthage another colony of idumaeans flying from the sword of david took refuge in the dominions of romulus for these or for other reasons of equal weight the name of edom was applied by the jews to the roman empire   since the jews who rejected with abhorrence the jews were a people which followed the christians a sect which deserted the religion of their fathers the deities adored by their sovereign and by their fellow subjects enjoyed however the free exercise of their unsocial religion there must have existed some other cause which exposed the disciples of christ to those severities from which the posterity of abraham was exempt the difference between them is simple and obvious but according to the sentiments of antiquity it was of the highest importance the jews were a nation the christians were a sect and if it was natural for every community to respect the sacred institutions of their neighbors it was incumbent on them to persevere in those of their ancestors the voice of oracles the precepts of philosophers and the authority of the laws unanimously enforced this national obligation by their lofty claim of superior sanctity the jews might provoke the polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race by disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might deserve their contempt the laws of moses might be for the most part frivolous or absurd yet since they had been received during many ages by a large society his followers were justified by the example of mankind and it was universally acknowledged that they had a right to practice what it would have been criminal in them to neglect but this principle which protected the jewish synagogue afforded not any favor or security to the primitive church by embracing the faith of the gospel the christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offense they dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education violated the religious institutions of their country and presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as true or had reverenced as sacred nor was this apostasy if we may use the expression merely of a partial or local kind since the pious deserter who withdrew himself from the temples of egypt or syria would equally disdain to seek an asylum in those of athens or carthage every christian rejected with contempt the superstitions of his family his city and his province the whole body of christians unanimously refused to hold any communion with the gods of rome of the empire and of mankind it was in vain that the oppressed believer asserted the inalienable rights of conscience and private judgment though his situation might excite the pity his arguments could never reach the understanding either of the philosophic or of the believing part of the pagan world to their apprehensions it was no less a matter of surprise that any individuals should entertain scruples against complying with the established mode of worship than if they had conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners the dress or the language of their native country from the arguments of celsus as they are represented and refuted by origin l v p        we may clearly discover the distinction that was made between the jewish people and the christian sect see in the dialogue of minucius foelix c     a fair and not inelegant description of the popular sentiments with regard to the desertion of the established worship   the surprise of the pagans was soon succeeded christianity accused of atheism and mistaken by the people and philosophers by resentment and the most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but dangerous imputation of impiety malice and prejudice concurred in representing the christians as a society of atheists who by the most daring attack on the religious constitution of the empire had merited the severest animadversion of the civil magistrate they had separated themselves they gloried in the confession from every mode of superstition which was received in any part of the globe by the various temper of polytheism but it was not altogether so evident what deity or what form of worship they had substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity the pure and sublime idea which they entertained of the supreme being escaped the gross conception of the pagan multitude who were at a loss to discover a spiritual and solitary god that was neither represented under any corporeal figure or visible symbol nor was adored with the accustomed pomp of libations and festivals of altars and sacrifices cur nullas aras habent templa nulla nulla nota simulacra  unde autem vel quis ille aut ubi deus unicus solitarius destitutus minucius foelix c  0 the pagan interlocutor goes on to make a distinction in favor of the jews who had once a temple altars victims etc  the sages of greece and rome who had elevated their minds to the contemplation of the existence and attributes of the first cause were induced by reason or by vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples the privilege of this philosophical devotion it is difficult says plato to attain and dangerous to publish the knowledge of the true god see the theology des philosophes in the abbe dolivets french translation of tully de natura deorum tom i p      they were far from admitting the prejudices of mankind as the standard of truth but they considered them as flowing from the original disposition of human nature and they supposed that any popular mode of faith and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the senses would in proportion as it receded from superstition find itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy and the visions of fanaticism the careless glance which men of wit and learning condescended to cast on the christian revelation served only to confirm their hasty opinion and to persuade them that the principle which they might have revered of the divine unity was defaced by the wild enthusiasm and annihilated by the airy speculations of the new sectaries the author of a celebrated dialogue which has been attributed to lucian whilst he affects to treat the mysterious subject of the trinity in a style of ridicule and contempt betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human reason and of the inscrutable nature of the divine perfections the author of the philopatris perpetually treats the christians as a company of dreaming enthusiasts  etc and in one place manifestly alludes to the vision in which st paul was transported to the third heaven in another place triephon who personates a christian after deriding the gods of paganism proposes a mysterious oath      is the profane answer of critias      it might appear less surprising that the founder of christianity should not only be revered by his disciples as a sage and a prophet but that he should be adored as a god the polytheists were disposed to adopt every article of faith which seemed to offer any resemblance however distant or imperfect with the popular mythology and the legends of bacchus of hercules and of aesculapius had in some measure prepared their imagination for the appearance of the son of god under a human form according to justin martyr apolog major c  0   the demon who had gained some imperfect knowledge of the prophecies purposely contrived this resemblance which might deter though by different means both the people and the philosophers from embracing the says of christ  but they were astonished that the christians should abandon the temples of those ancient heroes who in the infancy of the world had invented arts instituted laws and vanquished the tyrants or monsters who infested the earth in order to choose for the exclusive object of their religious worship an obscure teacher who in a recent age and among a barbarous people had fallen a sacrifice either to the malice of his own countrymen or to the jealousy of the roman government the pagan multitude reserving their gratitude for temporal benefits alone rejected the inestimable present of life and immortality which was offered to mankind by jesus of nazareth his mild constancy in the midst of cruel and voluntary sufferings his universal benevolence and the sublime simplicity of his actions and character were insufficient in the opinion of those carnal men to compensate for the want of fame of empire and of success and whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupendous triumph over the powers of darkness and of the grave they misrepresented or they insulted the equivocal birth wandering life and ignominious death of the divine author of christianity in the first and second books of origin celsus treats the birth and character of our savior with the most impious contempt the orator libanius praises porphyry and julian for consuting the folly of a sect which styled a dead man of palestine god and the son of god socrates hist ecclesiast iii      the personal guilt which every christian had the union and assemblies of the christians considered as a dangerous conspiracy contracted in thus preferring his private sentiment to the national religion was aggravated in a very high degree by the number and union of the criminals it is well known and has been already observed that roman policy viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any association among its subjects and that the privileges of private corporations though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes were bestowed with a very sparing hand the emperor trajan refused to incorporate a company of   0 firemen for the use of the city of nicomedia he disliked all associations see plin epist x        the religious assemblies of the christians who had separated themselves from the public worship appeared of a much less innocent nature they were illegal in their principle and in their consequences might become dangerous nor were the emperors conscious that they violated the laws of justice when for the peace of society they prohibited those secret and sometimes nocturnal meetings the proconsul pliny had published a general edict against unlawful meetings the prudence of the christians suspended their agapae but it was impossible for them to omit the exercise of public worship  the pious disobedience of the christians made their conduct or perhaps their designs appear in a much more serious and criminal light and the roman princes who might perhaps have suffered themselves to be disarmed by a ready submission deeming their honor concerned in the execution of their commands sometimes attempted by rigorous punishments to subdue this independent spirit which boldly acknowledged an authority superior to that of the magistrate the extent and duration of this spiritual conspiracy seemed to render it every day more deserving of his animadversion we have already seen that the active and successful zeal of the christians had insensibly diffused them through every province and almost every city of the empire the new converts seemed to renounce their family and country that they might connect themselves in an indissoluble band of union with a peculiar society which every where assumed a different character from the rest of mankind their gloomy and austere aspect their abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of life and their frequent predictions of impending calamities as the prophecies of the antichrist approaching conflagration etc provoked those pagans whom they did not convert they were mentioned with caution and reserve and the montanists were censured for disclosing too freely the dangerous secret see mosheim p      inspired the pagans with the apprehension of some danger which would arise from the new sect the more alarming as it was the more obscure whatever

pervicaciam certe et inflexibilem obstinationem debere puniri   the precautions with which the disciples of christ performed the offices of religion were at their manners calumniated first dictated by fear and necessity but they were continued from choice by imitating the awful secresy which reigned in the eleusinian mysteries the christians had flattered themselves that they should render their sacred institutions more respectable in the eyes of the pagan world see mosheims ecclesiastical history vol i p  0  and spanheim remarques sur les caesars de julien p     etc  but the event as it often happens to the operations of subtle policy deceived their wishes and their expectations it was concluded that they only concealed what they would have blushed to disclose their mistaken prudence afforded an opportunity for malice to invent and for suspicious credulity to believe the horrid tales which described the christians as the most wicked of human kind who practiced in their dark recesses every abomination that a depraved fancy could suggest and who solicited the favor of their unknown god by the sacrifice of every moral virtue there were many who pretended to confess or to relate the ceremonies of this abhorred society it was asserted that a newborn infant entirely covered over with flour was presented like some mystic symbol of initiation to the knife of the proselyte who unknowingly inflicted many a secret and mortal wound on the innocent victim of his error that as soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated the sectaries drank up the blood greedily tore asunder the quivering members and pledged themselves to eternal secresy by a mutual consciousness of guilt it was as confidently affirmed that this inhuman sacrifice was succeeded by a suitable entertainment in which intemperance served as a provocative to brutal lust till at the appointed moment the lights were suddenly extinguished shame was banished nature was forgotten and as accident might direct the darkness of the night was polluted by the incestuous commerce of sisters and brothers of sons and of mothers see justin martyr apolog i    ii    athenagoras in legation c    tertullian apolog c

of the ancient apologies was their imprudent defense sufficient to remove even the slightest suspicion from the mind of a candid adversary the christians with the intrepid security of innocence appeal from the voice of rumor to the equity of the magistrates they acknowledge that if any proof can be produced of the crimes which calumny has imputed to them they are worthy of the most severe punishment they provoke the punishment and they challenge the proof at the same time they urge with equal truth and propriety that the charge is not less devoid of probability than it is destitute of evidence they ask whether any one can seriously believe that the pure and holy precepts of the gospel which so frequently restrain the use of the most lawful enjoyments should inculcate the practice of the most abominable crimes that a large society should resolve to dishonor itself in the eyes of its own members and that a great number of persons of either sex and every age and character

same incestuous festivals which were so falsely ascribed to the orthodox believers were in reality celebrated by the marcionites by the carpocratians and by several other sects of the gnostics who

upon the church by the schismatics who had departed from its communion when tertullian became a montanist he aspersed the morals of the church which he had so resolutely defended sed majoris est agape

often polluted the vigils of the church and disgraced the christian name in the eyes of unbelievers  and it was confessed on all sides that the most scandalous licentiousness of manners prevailed among great numbers of those who affected the name of christians a pagan magistrate who possessed neither leisure nor abilities to discern the almost imperceptible line which divides the orthodox faith from heretical pravity might easily have imagined that their mutual animosity had extorted the discovery of their common guilt it was fortunate for the repose or at least for the reputation of the first christians that the magistrates sometimes proceeded with more temper and moderation than is usually consistent with religious zeal and that they reported as the impartial result of their judicial inquiry that the sectaries who had deserted the established worship appeared to them sincere in their professions and blameless in their manners however they might incur by their absurd and excessive superstition the censure of the laws tertullian apolog c   expatiates on the fair and honorable testimony of pliny with much reason and some declamation   history which undertakes to record the transactions idea of the conduct of the emperors toward the christians of the past for the instruction of future ages would ill deserve that honorable office if she condescended to plead the cause of tyrants or to justify the maxims of persecution it must however be acknowledged that the conduct of the emperors who appeared the least favorable to the primitive church is by no means so criminal as that of modern sovereigns who have employed the arm of violence and terror against the religious opinions of any part of their subjects from their reflections or even from their own feelings a charles v or a louis xiv might have acquired a just knowledge of the rights of conscience of the obligation of faith and of the innocence of error but the princes and magistrates of ancient rome were strangers to those principles which inspired and authorized the inflexible obstinacy of the christians in the cause of truth nor could they themselves discover in their own breasts any motive which would have prompted them to refuse a legal and as it were a natural submission to the sacred institutions of their country the same reason which contributes to alleviate the guilt must have tended to abate the rigor of their persecutions as they were actuated not by the furious zeal of bigots but by the temperate policy of legislators contempt must often have relaxed and humanity must frequently have suspended the execution of those laws which they enacted against the humble and obscure followers of christ from the general view of their character and motives we might naturally conclude i that a considerable time elapsed before they considered the new sectaries as an object deserving of the attention of government ii that in the conviction of any of their subjects who were accused of so very singular a crime they proceeded with caution and reluctance iii that they were moderate in the use of punishments and iv that the afflicted church enjoyed many intervals of peace and tranquillity notwithstanding the careless indifference which the most copious and the most minute of the pagan writers have shown to the affairs of the christians in the various compilation of the augustan history a part of which was composed under the reign of constantine there are not six lines which relate to the christians nor has the diligence of xiphilin discovered their name in the large history of dion cassius  it may still be in our power to confirm each of these probable suppositions by the evidence of authentic facts  i by the wise dispensation of providence a they neglected the christians as a sect of jews mysterious veil was cast over the infancy of the church which till the faith of the christians was matured and their numbers were multiplied served to protect them not only from the malice but even from the knowledge of the pagan world the slow and gradual abolition of the mosaic ceremonies afforded a safe and innocent disguise to the more early proselytes of the gospel as they were far the greater part of the race of abraham they were distinguished by the peculiar mark of circumcision offered up their devotions in the temple of jerusalem till its final destruction and received both the law and the prophets as the genuine inspirations of the deity the gentile converts who by a spiritual adoption had been associated to the hope of israel were likewise confounded under the garb and appearance of jews an obscure passage of suetonius in claud c    may seem to offer a proof how strangely the jews and christians of rome were confounded with each other  and as the polytheists paid less regard to articles of faith than to the external worship the new sect which carefully concealed or faintly announced its future greatness and ambition was permitted to shelter itself under the general toleration which was granted to an ancient and celebrated people in the roman empire it was not long perhaps before the jews themselves animated with a fiercer zeal and a more jealous faith perceived the gradual separation of their nazarene brethren from the doctrine of the synagogue and they would gladly have extinguished the dangerous heresy in the blood of its adherents but the decrees of heaven had already disarmed their malice and though they might sometimes exert the licentious privilege of sedition they no longer possessed the administration of criminal justice nor did they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of a roman magistrate the rancour of their own zeal and prejudice the provincial governors declared themselves ready to listen to any accusation that might affect the public safety but as soon as they were informed that it was a question not of facts but of words a dispute relating only to the interpretation of the jewish laws and prophecies they deemed it unworthy of the majesty of rome seriously to discuss the obscure differences which might arise among a barbarous and superstitious people the innocence of the first christians was protected by ignorance and contempt and the tribunal of the pagan magistrate often proved their most assured refuge against the fury of the synagogue see in the xviiith and xxvth chapters of the acts of the apostles the behavior of gallio proconsul of achaia and of festus procurator of judea  if indeed we were disposed to adopt the traditions of a too credulous antiquity we might relate the distant peregrinations the wonderful achievements and the various deaths of the twelve apostles but a more accurate inquiry will induce us to doubt whether any of those persons who had been witnesses to the miracles of christ were permitted beyond the limits of palestine to seal with their blood the truth of their testimony in the time of tertullian and clemens of alexandria the glory of martyrdom was confined to st peter st paul and st james it was gradually bestowed on the rest of the apostles by the more recent greeks who prudently selected for the theater of their preaching and sufferings some remote country beyond the limits of the roman empire see mosheim p    and tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom i part iii  from the ordinary term of human life it may very naturally be presumed that most of them were deceased before the discontent of the jews broke out into that furious war which was terminated only by the ruin of jerusalem during a long period from the death of christ to that memorable rebellion we cannot discover any traces of roman intolerance unless they are to be found in the sudden the transient but the cruel persecution which was exercised by nero against the christians of the capital thirtyfive years after the former and only two years before the latter of those great events the character of the philosophic historian to whom we are principally indebted for the knowledge of this singular transaction would alone be sufficient to recommend it to our most attentive consideration  in the tenth year of the reign of nero the the fire of rome under the reign of nero capital of the empire was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory or example of former ages tacit annal xv        sueton in neron c    dion cassius l lxii p  0   orosius vii    the monuments of grecian art and of roman virtue the trophies of the punic and gallic wars the most holy temples and the most splendid palaces were involved in one common destruction of the fourteen regions or quarters into which rome was divided four only subsisted entire three were levelled with the ground and the remaining seven which had experienced the fury of the flames displayed a melancholy prospect of ruin and desolation the vigilance of government appears not to have neglected any of the precautions which might alleviate the sense of so dreadful a calamity the imperial gardens were thrown open to the distressed multitude temporary buildings were erected for their accommodation and a plentiful supply of corn and provisions was distributed at a very moderate price the price of wheat probably of the modius was reduced as low as terni nummi which would be equivalent to about fifteen shillings the english quarter  the most generous policy seemed to have dictated the edicts which regulated the disposition of the streets and the construction of private houses and as it usually happens in an age of prosperity the conflagration of rome in the course of a few years produced a new city more regular and more beautiful than the former but all the prudence and humanity affected by nero on this occasion were insufficient to preserve him from the popular suspicion every crime might be imputed to the assassin of his wife and mother nor could the prince who prostituted his person and dignity on the theater be deemed incapable of the most extravagant folly the voice of rumor accused the emperor as the incendiary of his own capital and as the most incredible stories are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people it was gravely reported and firmly believed that nero enjoying the calamity which he had occasioned amused himself with singing to his lyre the destruction of ancient troy we may observe that the rumor is mentioned by tacitus with a very becoming distrust and hesitation whilst it is greedily transcribed by suetonius and solemnly confirmed by dion  to divert a suspicion which the power of despotism was unable to suppress the emperor resolved to substitute in his own place some fictitious criminals with this view continues tacitus he inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men who under the vulgar appellation of christians were already branded cruel punishment of the christians as the incendiaries of the city with deserved infamy they derived their name and origin from christ who in the reign of tiberius had suffered death by the sentence of the procurator pontius pilate this testimony is alone sufficient to expose the anachronism of the jews who place the birth of christ near a century sooner basnage histoire des juifs l v c       we may learn from josephus antiquitat xviii   that the procuratorship of pilate corresponded with the last ten years of tiberius a d        as to the particular time of the death of christ a very early tradition fixed it to the   th of march a d    under the consulship of the two gemini tertullian adv judaeos c   this date which is adopted by pagi cardinal norris and le clerc seems at least as probable as the vulgar era which is placed i know not from what conjectures four years later  for a while this dire superstition was checked but it again burst forth and not only spread itself over judaea the first seat of this mischievous sect but was even introduced into rome the common asylum which receives and protects whatever is impure whatever is atrocious the confessions of those who were seized discovered a great multitude of their accomplices and they were all convicted not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city as for their hatred of human kind odio humani generis convicti these words may either signify the hatred of mankind toward the christians or the hatred of the christians toward mankind i have preferred the latter sense as the most agreeable to the style of tacitus and to the popular error of which a precept of the gospel see luke xiv    had been perhaps the innocent occasion my interpretation is justified by the authority of lipsius of the italian the french and the english translators of tacitus of mosheim p  0  of le clerc historia ecclesiast p     of dr lardner testimonies vol i p     and of the bishop of gloucester divine legation vol iii p    but as the word convicti does not unite very happily with the rest of the sentence james gronovius has preferred the reading of conjuncti which is authorized by the valuable ms of florence  they died in torments and their torments were embittered by insult and derision some were nailed on crosses others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts and exposed to the fury of dogs others again smeared over with combustible materials were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night the gardens of nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle which was accompanied with a horse race and honored with the presence of the emperor who mingled with the populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer the guilt of the christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment but the public abhorrence was changed into commiseration from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed not so much to the public welfare as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant tacit annal xv     those who survey with a curious eye the revolutions of mankind may observe that the gardens and circus of nero on the vatican which were polluted with the blood of the first christians have been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by the abuse of the persecuted religion on the same spot nardini roma antica p     donatus de roma antiqua l iii p      a temple which far surpasses the ancient glories of the capitol has been since erected by the christian pontiffs who deriving their claim of universal dominion from an humble fisherman of galilee have succeeded to the throne of the caesars given laws to the barbarian conquerors of rome and extended their spiritual jurisdiction from the coast of the baltic to the shores of the pacific ocean  but it would be improper to dismiss this account of neros persecution till we have made some observations that may serve to remove the difficulties with which it is perplexed and to throw some light on the subsequent history of the church    the most skeptical criticism is obliged to remarks on the passage of tacitus relative to the persecution of the christians by nero respect the truth of this extraordinary fact and the integrity of this celebrated passage of tacitus the former is confirmed by the diligent and accurate suetonius who mentions the punishment which nero inflicted on the christians a sect of men who had embraced a new and criminal superstition sueton in nerone c    the epithet of malefica which some sagacious commentators have translated magical is considered by the more rational mosheim as only synonymous to the exitiabilis of tacitus  the latter may be proved by the consent of the most ancient manuscripts by the inimitable character of the style of tacitus by his reputation which guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud and by the purport of his narration which accused the first christians of the most atrocious crimes without insinuating that they possessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of mankind the passage concerning jesus christ which was inserted into the text of josephus between the time of origin and that of eusebius may furnish an example of no vulgar forgery the accomplishment of the prophecies the virtues miracles and resurrection of jesus are distinctly related josephus acknowledges that he was the messiah and hesitates whether he should call him a man if any doubt can still remain concerning this celebrated passage the reader may examine the pointed objections of le fevre havercamp joseph tom ii p          the labored answers of daubuz p          and the masterly reply bibliotheque ancienne et modern tom vii p          of an anonymous critic whom i believe to have been the learned abbe de longuerue    notwithstanding it is probable that tacitus was born some years before the fire of rome see the lives of tacitus by lipsius and the abbe de la bleterie dictionnaire de bail a larticle tacit and fabricius biblioth latin tom ii p     edit ernest  he could derive only from reading and conversation the knowledge of an event which happened during his infancy before he gave himself to the public he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity and he was more than forty years of age when a grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous agricola extorted from him the most early of those historical compositions which will delight and instruct the most distant posterity after making a trial of his strength in the life of agricola and the description of germany he conceived and at length executed a more arduous work the history of rome in thirty books from the fall of nero to the accession of nerva the administration of nerva introduced an age of justice and prosperity which tacitus had destined for the occupation of his old age principatum divi nervae et imperium trajani uberiorem securioremque materiam senectuti seposui tacit hist i  but when he took a nearer view of his subject judging perhaps that it was a more honorable or a less invidious office to record the vices of past tyrants than to celebrate the virtues of a reigning monarch he chose rather to relate under the form of annals the actions of the four immediate successors of augustus to collect to dispose and to adorn a series of fourscore years in an immortal work every sentence of which is pregnant with the deepest observations and the most lively images was an undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of tacitus himself during the greatest part of his life in the last years of the reign of trajan whilst the victorious monarch extended the power of rome beyond its ancient limits the historian was describing in the second and fourth books of his annals the tyranny of tiberius see tacit annal ii    iv    and the emperor hadrian must have succeeded to the throne before tacitus in the regular prosecution of his work could relate the fire of the capital and the cruelty of nero toward the unfortunate christians at the distance of sixty years it was the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of contemporaries but it was natural for the philosopher to indulge himself in the description of the origin the progress and the character of the new sect not so much according to the knowledge or prejudices of the age of nero as according to those of the time of hadrian   tacitus very frequently trusts to the curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those intermediate circumstances and ideas which in his extreme conciseness he has thought proper to suppress we may therefore presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the cruelty of nero against the christians of rome whose obscurity as well as innocence should have shielded them from his indignation and even from his notice the jews who were numerous in the capital and oppressed in their own country were a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the people nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation who already discovered their abhorrence of the roman yoke might have recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge but the jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace and even in the heart of the tyrant his wife and mistress the beautiful poppaea and a favorite player of the race of abraham who had already employed their intercession in behalf of the obnoxious people the players name was aliturus through the same channel josephus de vita sua c   about two years before had obtained the pardon and release of some jewish priests who were prisoners at rome  in their room it was necessary to offer some other victims and it might easily be suggested that although the genuine followers of moses were innocent of the fire of rome there had arisen among them a new and pernicious sect of galilaeans which was capable of the most horrid crimes under the appellation of galilaeans two distinctions of men were confounded the most opposite to each other in their manners and principles the disciples who had embraced the faith of jesus of nazareth the learned dr lardner jewish and heathen testimonies vol ii p  0   0  has proved that the name of galilaeans was a very ancient and perhaps the primitive appellation of the christians  and the zealots who had followed the standard of judas

fortress with   0 of his most desperate followers when the battering ram had made a breach they turned their swords against their wives their children and at length against their own breasts they died to the last man  the former were the friends the latter were the enemies of humankind and the only resemblance between them consisted in the same inflexible constancy which in the defense of their cause rendered them insensible of death and tortures the followers of judas who impelled their countrymen into rebellion were soon buried under the ruins of jerusalem whilst those of jesus known by the more celebrated name of christians diffused themselves over the roman empire how natural was it for tacitus in the time of hadrian to appropriate to the christians the guilt and the sufferings which he might with far greater truth and justice have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost extinguished   whatever opinion may be entertained of this conjecture for it is no more than a conjecture it is evident that the effect as well as the cause of neros persecution were confined to the walls of rome see dodwell paucitat mart l xiii the spanish inscription in gruter p     no   is a manifest and acknowledged forgery contrived by that noted impostor cyriacus of ancona to flatter the pride and prejudices of the spaniards see ferreras histoire despagne tom i p      that the religious tenets of the galilaeans or christians were never made a subject of punishment or even of inquiry and that as the idea of their sufferings was for a long time connected with the idea of cruelty and injustice the moderation of succeeding princes inclined them to spare a sect oppressed by a tyrant whose rage had been usually directed against virtue and innocence  it is somewhat remarkable that the flames of oppression of the jews and christians by domitian war consumed almost at the same time the temple of jerusalem and the capitol of rome the capitol was burnt during the civil war between vitellius and vespasian the   th of december a d    on the  0th of august a d  0 the temple of jerusalem was destroyed by the hands of the jews themselves rather than by those of the romans  and it appears no less singular that the tribute which devotion had destined to the former should have been converted by the power of an assaulting victor to restore and adorn the splendor of

severity with which it was exacted were considered as an intolerable grievance with regard to the tribute see dion cassius l lxvi p  0   with reimaruss notes spanheim de usu numismatum tom ii p     and basnage histoire des juifs l vii c    since the officers of the revenue extended their unjust claim to many persons who were strangers to the blood or religion of the jews it was impossible that

christians who were brought before the tribunal of the emperor or as it seems more probable before that of the procurator of judaea two persons are said to have appeared distinguished by their extraction which was more truly noble than that of the greatest monarchs these were the grandsons of st jude the apostle who himself was the brother of jesus christ this appellation was at first understood in the most obvious sense and it was supposed that the brothers of jesus were the lawful issue of joseph and of mary a devout respect for the virginity of the mother of god suggested to the gnostics and afterward to the orthodox greeks the expedient of bestowing a second wife on joseph the latins from the time of jerome improved on that hint asserted the perpetual celibacy of joseph and

had never assisted at any judicial proceedings against the christians with whose name alone he seems to be acquainted and he was totally uninformed with regard to the nature of their guilt the method of their conviction and the degree of their punishment in this perplexity he had recourse to his usual expedient of submitting to the wisdom of trajan an impartial and in some respects a favorable account of the new superstition requesting the emperor that he would condescend to resolve his doubts and to instruct his ignorance plin epistol x    the learned mosheim expresses himself p         with the highest approbation of plinys moderate and candid temper notwithstanding dr lardners suspicions see jewish and heathen testimonies vol ii p    i am unable to discover any bigotry in his language or proceedings  the life of pliny had been employed in the acquisition of learning and in the business of the world since the age of nineteen he had pleaded with distinction in the tribunals of rome plin epist v   he pleaded his first cause a d    the year after the famous eruptions of mount vesuvius in which his uncle lost his life  filled a place in the senate had been invested with the honors of the consulship and had formed very numerous connexions with every order of men both in italy and in the provinces from his ignorance therefore we may derive some useful information we may assure ourselves that when he accepted the government of bithynia there were no general laws or decrees of the senate in force against the christians that neither trajan nor any of his virtuous predecessors whose edicts were received into the civil and criminal jurisprudence had publicly declared their intentions concerning the new sect and that whatever proceedings had been carried on against the christians there were none of sufficient weight and authority to establish a precedent for the conduct of a roman magistrate  the answer of trajan to which the christians trajan and his successors establish a legal mode of proceeding against them of the succeeding age have frequently appealed discovers as much regard for justice and humanity as could be reconciled with his mistaken notions of religious policy plin epistol x    tertullian apolog c   considers this rescript as a relaxation of the ancient penal laws quas trajanus ex part frustratus est and yet tertullian in another part or his apologists exposes the inconsistency of prohibiting inquiries and enjoining punishments  instead of displaying the implacable zeal of an inquisitor anxious to discover the most minute particles of heresy and exulting in the number of his victims the emperor expresses much more solicitude to protect the security of the innocent than to prevent the escape of the guilty he acknowledges the difficulty of fixing any general plan but he lays down two salutary rules which often afforded relief and support to the distressed christians though he directs the magistrates to punish such persons as are legally convicted he prohibits them with a very humane inconsistency from making any inquiries concerning the supposed criminals nor was the magistrate allowed to proceed on every kind of information anonymous charges the emperor rejects as too repugnant to the equity of his government and he strictly requires for the conviction of those to whom the guilt of christianity is imputed the positive evidence of a fair and open accuser it is likewise probable that the persons who assumed so invidious an office were obliged to declare the grounds of their suspicions to specify both in respect to time and place the secret assemblies which their christian adversary had frequented and to disclose a great number of circumstances which were concealed with the most vigilant jealousy from the eye of the profane if they succeeded in their prosecution they were exposed to the resentment of a considerable and active party to the censure of the more liberal portion of mankind and to the ignominy which in every age and country has attended the character of an informer if on the contrary they failed in their proofs they incurred the severe and perhaps capital penalty which according to a law published by the emperor hadrian was inflicted on those who falsely attributed to their fellowcitizens the crime of christianity the violence of personal or superstitious animosity might sometimes prevail over the most natural apprehensions of disgrace and danger but it cannot surely be imagined that accusations of so unpromising an appearance were either lightly or frequently undertaken by the pagan subjects of the roman empire eusebius hist ecclesiast l iv c   has preserved the edict of hadrian he has likewise c    given us one still more favorable under the name of antoninus the authenticity of which is not so universally allowed the second apology of justin contains some curious particulars relative to the accusations of christians   the expedient which was employed to elude popular clamours the prudence of the laws affords a sufficient proof how effectually they disappointed the mischievous designs of private malice or superstitious zeal in a large and tumultuous assembly the restraints of fear and shame so forcible on the minds of individuals are deprived of the greatest part of their influence the pious christian as he was desirous to obtain or to escape the glory of martyrdom expected either with impatience or with terror the stated returns of the public games and festivals on those occasions the inhabitants of the great cities of the empire were collected in the circus of the theater where every circumstance of the place as well as of the ceremony contributed to kindle their devotion and to extinguish their humanity whilst the numerous spectators crowned with garlands perfumed with incense purified with the blood of victims and surrounded with the altars and statues of their tutelar deities resigned themselves to the enjoyment of pleasures which they considered as an essential part of their religious worship they recollected that the christians alone abhorred the gods of mankind and by their absence and melancholy on these solemn festivals seemed to insult or to lament the public felicity if the empire had been afflicted by any recent calamity by a plague a famine or an unsuccessful war if the tyber had or if the nile had not risen beyond its banks if the earth had shaken or if the temperate order of the seasons had been interrupted the superstitious pagans were convinced that the crimes and the impiety of the christians who were spared by the excessive lenity of the government had at length provoked the divine justice it was not among a licentious and exasperated populace that the forms of legal proceedings could be observed it was not in an amphitheatre stained with the blood of wild beasts and gladiators that the voice of compassion could be heard the impatient clamours of the multitude denounced the christians as the enemies of gods and men doomed them to the severest tortures and venturing to accuse by name some of the most distinguished of the new sectaries required with irresistible vehemence that they should be instantly apprehended and cast to the lions see tertullian apolog c  0 the acts of the martyrdom of polycarp exhibit a lively picture of these tumults which were usually fomented by the malice of the jews  the provincial governors and magistrates who presided in the public spectacles were usually inclined to gratify the inclinations and to appease the rage of the people by the sacrifice of a few obnoxious victims but the wisdom of the emperors protected the church from the danger of these tumultuous clamours and irregular accusations which they justly censured as repugnant both to the firmness and to the equity of their administration the edicts of hadrian and of antoninus pius expressly declared that the voice of the multitude should never be admitted as legal evidence to convict or to punish those unfortunate persons who had embraced the enthusiasm of the christians these regulations are inserted in the abovementioned edicts of hadrian and pius see the apology of melito apud eusebius l iv c      iii punishment was not the inevitable consequence trials of the christians of conviction and the christians whose guilt was the most clearly proved by the testimony of witnesses or even by their voluntary confession still retained in their own power the alternative of life or death it was not so much the past offense as the actual resistance which excited the indignation of the magistrate he was persuaded that he offered them an easy pardon since if they consented to cast a few grains of incense upon the altar they were dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause it was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavor to reclaim rather than to punish those deluded enthusiasts varying his tone according to the age the sex or the situation of the prisoners he frequently condescended to set before their eyes every circumstance which could render life more pleasing or death more terrible and to solicit nay to entreat them that they would show some compassion to themselves to their families and to their friends see the rescript of trajan and the conduct of pliny the most authentic acts of the martyrs abound in these exhortations  if threats and persuasions proved ineffectual he had often recourse to violence the scourge and the rack were called in to supply the deficiency of argument and every art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible and as it appeared to the pagans such criminal obstinacy the ancient apologists of christianity have censured with equal truth and severity the irregular conduct of their persecutors who contrary to every principle of judicial proceeding admitted the use of torture in order to obtain not a confession but a denial of the crime which was the object of their inquiry in particular see tertullian apolog c     and lactantius institut divin v   their reasonings are almost the same but we may discover that one of these apologists had been a lawyer and the other a rhetorician  the monks of succeeding ages who in their peaceful solitudes entertained themselves with diversifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive martyrs have frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious nature in particular it has pleased them to suppose that the zeal of the roman magistrates disdaining every consideration of moral virtue or public decency endeavored to seduce those whom they were unable to vanquish and that by their orders the most brutal violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible to seduce it is related that pious females who were prepared to despise death were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial and called upon to determine whether they set a higher value on their religion or on their chastity the youths to whose licentious embraces they were abandoned received a solemn exhortation from the judge to exert their most strenuous efforts to maintain the honor of venus against the impious virgin who refused to burn incense on her altars their violence however was commonly disappointed and the seasonable interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses of christ from the dishonor even of an involuntary defeat we should not indeed neglect to remark that the more ancient as well as authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted with these extravagant and indecent fictions see two instances of this kind of torture in the acta sincera martyrum published by ruinart p   0     jerome in his legend of paul the hermit tells a strange story of a young man who was chained naked on a bed of flowers and assaulted by a beautiful and wanton courtezan he quelled the rising temptation by biting off his tongue   the total disregard of truth and probability in humanity of the roman magistrates the representation of these primitive martyrdoms was occasioned by a very natural mistake the ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries ascribed to the magistrates of rome the same degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal which filled their own breasts against the heretics or the idolators of their own times it is not improbable that some of those persons who were raised to the dignities of the empire might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace and that the cruel disposition of others might occasionally be stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal resentment the conversion of his wife provoked claudius herminianus governor of cappadocia to treat the christians with uncommon severity tertullian ad scapulam c    but it is certain and we may appeal to the grateful confessions of the first christians that the greatest part of those magistrates who exercised in the provinces the authority of the emperor or of the senate and to whose hands alone the jurisdiction of life and death was entrusted behaved like men of polished manners and liberal educations who respected the rules of justice and who were conversant with the precepts of philosophy they frequently declined the odious task of persecution dismissed the charge with contempt or suggested to the accused christian some legal evasion by which he might elude the severity of the laws tertullian in his epistle to the governor of africa mentions several remarkable instances of lenity and forbearance which had happened within his knowledge  whenever they were invested with a discretionary power neque enim in universum aliquid quod quasi certam formam habeat constitui potest an expression of trajan which gave a very great latitude to the governors of provinces  they used it much less for the oppression than for the relief and benefit of the afflicted church they were far from condemning all the christians who were accused before their tribunal and very far from punishing with death all those who were convicted of an obstinate adherence to the new superstition contenting themselves for the most part with the milder chastisements of imprisonment exile or slavery in the mines in metalla damnamur in insulas relegemur tertullian apolog c    the mines of numidia contained nine bishops with a proportionable number of their clergy and people to whom cyprian addressed a pious epistle of praise and comfort see cyprian epistol        they left the unhappy victims of their justice some reason to hope that a prosperous event the accession the marriage or the triumph of an emperor might speedily restore them by a general pardon to their former state the martyrs inconsiderable number of martyrs devoted to immediate execution by the roman magistrates appear to have been selected from the most opposite extremes they were either bishops and presbyters the persons the most distinguished among the christians by their rank and influence and whose example might strike terror into the whole sect though we cannot receive with entire confidence either the epistles or the acts of ignatius they may be found in the  d volume of the apostolic fathers yet we may quote that bishop of antioch as one of these exemplary martyrs he was sent in chains to rome as a public spectacle and when he arrived at troas he received the pleasing intelligence that the persecution of antioch was already at an end  or else they were the meanest and most abject among them particularly those of the servile condition whose lives were esteemed of little value and whose sufferings were viewed by the ancients with too careless an indifference among the martyrs of lions eusebius l v c   the slave blandina was distinguished by more exquisite tortures of the five martyrs so much celebrated in the acts of felicitas and perpetua two were of a servile and two others of a very mean condition  the learned origin who from his experience as well as reading was intimately acquainted with the history of the christians declares in the most express terms that the number of martyrs was very inconsiderable origin advers celsum l iii p     his words deserve to be transcribed   his authority would alone be sufficient to annihilate that formidable army of martyrs whose relics drawn for the most part from the catacombs of rome have replenished so many churches if we recollect that all the plebeians of rome were not christians and that all the christians were not saints and martyrs we may judge with how much safety religious honors can be ascribed to bones or urns indiscriminately taken from the public burialplace after ten centuries of a very free and open trade some suspicions have arisen among the more learned catholics they now require as a proof of sanctity and martyrdom the letters b m a viol full of red liquor supposed to be blood or the figure of a palmtree but the two former signs are of little weight and with regard to the last it is observed by the critics   that the figure as it is called of a palm is perhaps a cypress and perhaps only a stop the flourish of a comma used in the monumental inscriptions   that the palm was the symbol of victory among the pagans   that among the christians it served as the emblem not only of martyrdom but in general of a joyful resurrection see the epistle of p mabillon on the worship of unknown saints and muratori sopra le antichita italiane dissertat lviii  and whose mavelous achievements have been the subject of so many volumes of holy romance as a specimen of these legends we may be satisfied with  0000 christian soldiers crucified in one day either by trajan or hadrian on mount ararat see baronius ad martyrologium romanum tillemont mem ecclesiast tom ii part ii p     and geddess miscellanies vol ii p  0  the abbreviation of mil which may signify either soldiers or thousands is said to have occasioned some extraordinary mistakes  but the general assertion of origin may be explained and confirmed by the particular testimony of his friend dionysius who in the immense city of alexandria and under the rigorous persecution of decius reckons only ten men and seven women who suffered for the profession of the christian name dionysius ap eusebius l vi c    one of the seventeen was likewise accused of robbery   during the same period of persecution the zealous example of cyprian bishop of carthage the eloquent the ambitious cyprian governed the church not only of carthage but even of africa he possessed every quality which could engage the reverence of the faithful or provoke the suspicions and resentment of the pagan magistrates his character as well as his station seemed to mark out that holy prelate as the most distinguished object of envy and of danger the letters of cyprian exhibit a very curious and original picture both of the man and of the times see likewise the two lives of cyprian composed with equal accuracy though with very different views the one by le clerc bibliotheque universelle tom xii p  0     the other by tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom iv part i p        the experience however of the life of cyprian is sufficient to prove that our fancy has exaggerated the perilous situation of a christian bishop and that the dangers to which he was exposed were less imminent than those which temporal ambition is always prepared to encounter in the pursuit of honors four roman emperors with their families their favorites and their adherents perished by the sword in the space of ten years during which the bishop of carthage guided by his authority and eloquence the counsels of the african church it was only in the third year of his administration that he had reason during a few months to apprehend the severe edicts of decius the vigilance his danger and flight of the magistrate and the clamours of the multitude who loudly demanded that cyprian the leader of the christians should be thrown to the lions prudence suggested the necessity of a temporary retreat and the voice of prudence was obeyed he withdrew himself into an obscure solitude from whence he could maintain a constant correspondence with the clergy and people of carthage and concealing himself till the tempest was past he preserved his life without relinquishing either his power or his reputation his extreme caution did not however escape the censure of the more rigid christians who lamented or the reproaches of his personal enemies who insulted a conduct which they considered as a pusillanimous and criminal desertion of the most sacred duty see the polite but severe epistle of the clergy of rome to the bishop of carthage cyprian epist     pontius labors with the greatest care and diligence to justify his master against the general censure  the propriety of reserving himself for the future exigencies of the church the example of several holy bishops in particular those of dionysius of alexandria and gregory thaumaturgus of neocaesarea see eusebius hist ecclesiast l vi c  0 and memoires de tillemont tom iv part ii p      and the divine admonitions which as he declares himself he frequently received in visions and ecstasies were the reasons alleged in his justification see cyprian epist    and his life by pontius  but his best apology may be found in the cheerful resolution with which about eight years afterward he suffered death in the cause of religion the authentic history of his martyrdom has been recorded with unusual candor and impartiality a short abstract therefore of its most important circumstances will convey the clearest information of the spirit and of the forms of the roman persecutions we have an original life of cyprian by the deacon pontius the companion of his exile and the spectator of his death and we likewise possess the ancient proconsular acts of his martyrdom these two relations are consistent with each other and with probability and what is somewhat remarkable they are both unsullied by any miraculous circumstances   when valerian was consul for the third and gallienus for the fourth time paternus proconsul a d     his banishment of africa summoned cyprian to appear in his private council chamger he there acquainted him with the imperial mandate which he had just received it should seem that these were circular orders sent at the same time to all the governors dionysius ap eusebius l vii c    relates the history of his own banishment from alexandria almost in the same manner but as he escaped and survived the persecution we must account him either more or less fortunate than cyprian  that those who had abandoned the roman religion should immediately return to the practice of the ceremonies of their ancestors cyprian replied without hesitation that he was a christian and a bishop devoted to the worship of the true and only deity to whom he offered up his daily supplications for the safety and prosperity of the two emperors his lawful sovereigns with modest confidence he pleaded the privilege of a citizen in refusing to give any answer to some invidious and indeed illegal questions which the proconsul had proposed a sentence of banishment was pronounced as the penalty of cyprians disobedience and he was conducted without delay to curubis a free and maritime city of zeugitania in a pleasant situation a fertile territory and at the distance of about forty miles from carthage see plin hist nature v   cellarius geograph antiq part iii p    shaws travels p  0 and for the adjacent country which is terminated by cape bona or the promontory of mercury lafrique de marmol tom ii p     there are the remains of an aqueduct near curubis or curbis at present altered into gurbes and dr

promissum est qui regnum et justitiam dei quaerunt  the exiled bishop enjoyed the conveniences of life and the consciousness of virtue his reputation was diffused over africa and italy an account of his behavior was published for the edification of the christian world see cyprian epistol    edit fell  and his solitude was frequently interrupted by the letters the visits and the congratulations of the faithful on the arrival of a new proconsul in the province the fortune of cyprian appeared for some time to wear a still more favorable aspect he was recalled from banishment and though not yet permitted to return to carthage his own gardens in the neighborhood of the capital were assigned for the place of his residence upon his conversion he had sold those gardens for the benefit of the poor the indulgence of god most probably the liberality of some christian friend restored them to cyprian see pontius c      at length exactly one year when cyprian a twelvemonth before was sent into exile he dreamt that he should be put to death the next day the event made it necessary to explain that word as signifying a year pontius c    after cyprian his condemnation was first apprehended galerius maximus proconsul of africa received the imperial warrant for the execution of the christian teachers the bishop of carthage was sensible that he should be singled out for one of the first victims and the frailty of nature tempted him to withdraw himself by a secret flight from the danger and the honor of martyrdom but soon recovering that fortitude which his character required he returned to his gardens and patiently expected the ministers of death two officers of rank who were entrusted with that commission placed cyprian between them in a chariot and as the proconsul was not then at leisure they conducted him not to a prison but to a private house in carthage which belonged to one of them an elegant supper was provided for the entertainment of the bishop and his christian friends were permitted for the last time to enjoy his society whilst the streets were filled with a multitude of the faithful anxious and alarmed at the approaching fate of their spiritual father pontius c    acknowledges that cyprian with whom he supped passed the night custodia delicata the bishop exercised a last and very proper act of jurisdiction by directing that the younger females who watched in the street should be removed from the dangers and temptations of a nocturnal crowd act proconsularia c    in the morning he appeared before the tribunal of the proconsul who after informing himself of the name and situation of cyprian commanded him to offer sacrifice and pressed him to reflect on the consequences of his disobedience the refusal of cyprian was firm and decisive and the magistrate when he had taken the opinion of his council pronounced with some reluctance the sentence of death it was conceived in the following terms that thascius cyprianus should be immediately beheaded as the enemy of the gods of rome and as the chief and ringleader of a criminal association which he had seduced into an impious resistance against the laws of the most holy emperors valerian and gallienus see the original sentence in the acts c   and in pontius c    the latter expresses it in a more rhetorical manner  the manner of his execution was the mildest and least painful that could be inflicted on a person convicted of any capital offense nor was the use of torture admitted to obtain from the bishop of carthage either the recantation of his principles or the discovery of his accomplices  as soon as the sentence was proclaimed a his martyrdom general cry of we will die with him arose at once among the listening multitude of christians who waited before the palace gates the generous effusions of their zeal and affection were neither serviceable to cyprian nor dangerous to themselves he was led away under a guard of tribunes and centurions without resistance and without insult to the place of his execution a spacious and level plain near the city which was already filled with great numbers of spectators his faithful presbyters and deacons were permitted to accompany their holy bishop they assisted him in laying aside his upper garment spread linen on the ground to catch the precious relics of his blood and received his orders to bestow fiveandtwenty pieces of gold on the executioner the martyr then covered his face with his hands and at one blow his head was separated from his body his corpse remained during some hours exposed to the curiosity of the gentiles but in the night it was removed and transported in a triumphal procession and with a splendid illumination to the burialplace of the christians the funeral of cyprian was publicly celebrated without receiving any interruption from the roman magistrates and those among the faithful who had performed the last offices to his person and his memory were secure from the danger of inquiry or of punishment it is remarkable that of so great a multitude of bishops in the province of africa cyprian was the first who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom pontius c    m de tillemont memoires tom iv part i p   0 note  0 is not pleased with so positive an exclusion of any former martyrs of the episcopal rank   it was in the choice of cyprian either to die a martyr or to live an apostate but on that choice depended the alternative of honor or various incitements to martyrdom infamy could we suppose that the bishop of carthage had employed the profession of the christian faith only as the instrument of his avarice or ambition it was still incumbent on him to support the character which he had assumed whatever opinion we may entertain of the character or principles of thomas becket we must acknowledge that he suffered death with a constancy not unworthy of the primitive martyrs see lord lytteltons history of henry ii vol ii p     etc  and if he possessed the smallest degree of manly fortitude rather to expose himself to the most cruel tortures than by a single act to exchange the reputation of a whole life for the abhorrence of his christian brethren and the contempt of the gentile world but if the zeal of cyprian was supported by the sincere conviction of the truth of those doctrines which he preached the crown of martyrdom must have appeared to him as an object of desire rather than of terror it is not easy to extract any distinct ideas from the vague though eloquent declamations of the fathers or to ascertain the degree of immortal glory and happiness which they confidently promised to those who were so fortunate as to shed their blood in the cause of religion see in particular the treatise of cyprian de lapsis p        edit fell the learning of dodwell dissertat cyprianic xii xiii and the ingenuity of middleton free enquiry p     etc have left scarcely any thing to add concerning the merit the honors and the motives of the martyrs  they inculcated with becoming diligence that the fire of martyrdom supplied every defect and expiated every sin that while the souls of ordinary christians were obliged to pass through a slow and painful purification the triumphant sufferers entered into the immediate fruition of eternal bliss where in the society of the patriarchs the apostles and the prophets they reigned with christ and acted as his assessors in the universal judgment of mankind the assurance of a lasting reputation upon earth a motive so congenial to the vanity of human nature often served to animate the courage of the martyrs the honors which rome or athens bestowed on those citizens who had fallen in the cause of their country were cold and unmeaning demonstrations of respect when compared with the ardent gratitude and devotion which the primitive church expressed toward the victorious champions of the faith the annual commemoration of their virtues and sufferings was observed as a sacred ceremony and at length terminated in religious worship among the christians who had publicly confessed their religious principles those who as it very frequently happened had been dismissed from the tribunal or the prisons of the pagan magistrates obtained such honors as were justly due to their imperfect martyrdom and their generous resolution the most pious females courted the permission of imprinting kisses on the fetters which they had worn and on the wounds which they had received their persons were esteemed holy their decisions were admitted with deference and they too often abused by their spiritual pride and licentious manners the preeminence which their zeal and intrepidity had acquired cyprian epistol             and de unitat ecclesiae the number of pretended martyrs has been very much multiplied by the custom which was introduced of bestowing that honorable name on confessors  distinctions like these whilst they display the exalted merit betray the inconsiderable number of those who suffered and of those who died for the profession of christianity  the sober discretion of the present age will ardour of the first christians more readily censure than admire but can more easily admire than imitate the fervor of the first christians who according to the lively expression of sulpicius severus desired martyrdom with more eagerness than his own contemporaries solicited a bishopric certatim gloriosa in certamina ruebatur multique avidius tum martyria gloriosis mortibus quaerebantur quam nunc episcopatus pravis ambitionibus appetuntur sulpicius severus l ii he might have omitted the word nunc  the epistles which ignatius composed as he was carried in chains through the cities of asia breathe sentiments the most repugnant to the ordinary feelings of human nature he earnestly beseeches the romans that when he should be exposed in the amphitheatre they would not by their kind but unseasonable intercession deprive him of the crown of glory and he declares his resolution to provoke and irritate the wild beasts which might be employed as the instruments of his death see epist ad roman c     ap patres apostol tom ii p    it suited the purpose of bishop pearson see vindiciae ignatianae part ii c   to justify by a profusion of examples and authorities the sentiments of ignatius  some stories are related of the courage of martyrs who actually performed what ignatius had intended who exasperated the fury of the lions pressed the executioner to hasten his office cheerfully leaped into the fires which were kindled to consume them and discovered a sensation of joy and pleasure in the midst of the most exquisite tortures several examples have been preserved of a zeal impatient of those restraints which the emperors had provided for the security of the church the christians sometimes supplied by their voluntary declaration the want of an accuser rudely disturbed the public service of paganism the story of polyeuctes on which corneille has founded a very beautiful tragedy is one of the most celebrated though not perhaps the most authentic instances of this excessive zeal we should observe that the  0th canon of the council of illiberis refuses the title of martyrs to those who exposed themselves to death by publicly destroying the idols  and rushing in crowds round the tribunal of the magistrates called upon them to pronounce and to inflict the sentence of the law the behavior of the christians was too remarkable to escape the notice of the ancient philosophers but they seem to have considered it with much less admiration than astonishment incapable of conceiving the motives which sometimes transported the fortitude of believers beyond the bounds of prudence or reason they treated such an eagerness to die as the strange result of obstinate despair of stupid insensibility or of superstitious phrenzy see epictetus l iv c   though there is some doubt whether he alludes to the christians marcus antoninus de rebus fuis l xi c   lucian in peregrin  unhappy men exclaimed the proconsul antoninus to the christians of asia unhappy men if you are thus weary of your lives is it so difficult for you to find ropes and precipices tertullian ad scapul c   the learned are divided between three persons of the same name who were all proconsuls of asia i am inclined to ascribe this story to antoninus pius who was afterward emperor and who may have governed asia under the reign of trajan  he was extremely cautious as it is observed by a learned and pious historian of punishing men who had found no accusers but themselves the imperial laws not having made any provision for so unexpected a case condemning therefore a few as a warning to their brethren he dismissed the multitude with indignation and contempt mosheim de rebus christ ante constantin p      notwithstanding this real or affected disdain the intrepid constancy of the faithful was productive of more salutary effects on those minds which nature or grace had disposed for the easy reception of religious truth on these melancholy occasions there were many among the gentiles who pitied who admired and who were converted the generous enthusiasm was communicated from the sufferer to the spectators and the blood of martyrs according to a wellknown observation became the seed of the church  but although devotion had raised and eloquence continued to inflame this fever of the mind it insensibly gave way to the more natural gradual relaxation hopes and fears of the human heart to the love of life the apprehension of pain and the horror of dissolution the more prudent rulers of the church found themselves obliged to restrain the indiscreet ardour of their followers and to distrust a constancy which too often abandoned them in the hour of trial see the epistle of the church of smyrna ap eusebius hist eccles l iv c     as the lives of the faithful became less mortified and austere they were every day less ambitious of the honors of martyrdom and the soldiers of christ instead of distinguishing themselves by voluntary deeds of heroism frequently deserted their post and fled in confusion before the enemy whom it was their duty to resist there were three methods however of escaping the flames of persecution which were not attended with an equal degree of guilt the first indeed was generally allowed to be innocent the second was of a doubtful or at least of a venial nature but the third implied a direct and criminal apostasy from the christian faith  i a modern inquisitor would hear with surprise three methods of escaping martyrdom that whenever an information was given to a roman magistrate of any person within his jurisdiction who had embraced the sect of the christians the charge was communicated to the party accused and that a convenient time was allowed him to settle his domestic concerns and to prepare an answer to the crime which was imputed to him in the second apology of justin there is a particular and very curious instance of this legal delay the same indulgence was granted to accused christians in the persecution of decius and cyprian de lapsis expressly mentions the dies negantibus praestitutus  if he entertained any doubt of his own constancy such a delay afforded him the opportunity of preserving his life and honor by flight of withdrawing himself into some obscure retirement or some distant province and of patiently expecting the return of peace and security a measure so consonant to reason was soon authorized by the advice and example of the most holy prelates and seems to have been censured by few except by the montanists who deviated into heresy by their strict and obstinate adherence to the rigor of ancient discipline tertullian considers flight from persecution as an imperfect but very criminal apostasy as an impious attempt to elude the will of god etc etc he has written a treatise on this subject see p          edit rigalt which is filled with the wildest fanaticism and the most incoherent declamation it is however somewhat remarkable that tertullian did not suffer martyrdom himself  ii the provincial governors whose zeal was less prevalent than their avarice had countenanced the practice of selling certificates or libels as they were called which attested that the persons therein mentioned had complied with the laws and sacrificed to the roman deities by producing these false declarations the opulent and timid christians were enabled to silence the malice of an informer and to reconcile in some measure their safety with their religion a slight penance atoned for this profane dissimulation the libellatici who are chiefly known by the writings of cyprian are described with the utmost precision in the copious commentary of mosheim p           iii in every persecution there were great numbers of unworthy christians who publicly disowned or renounced the faith which they had professed and who confirmed the sincerity of their abjuration by the legal acts of burning incense or of offering sacrifices some of these apostates had yielded on the first menace or exhortation of the magistrate whilst the patience of others had been subdued by the length and repetition of tortures the affrighted countenances of some betrayed their inward remorse while others advanced with confidence and alacrity to the altars of the gods plin epistol x    dionysius alexandrin ap eusebius i vi c    ad prima statim verba minantis inimici maximus fratrum numerus fidem suam prodidit nec prostiatus est persecutionis impetu sed voluntario lapsu seipsum prostravit cyprian opera p    among these deserters were many priests and even bishops  but the disguise which fear had imposed subsisted no longer than the present danger as soon as the severity of the persecution was abated the doors of the churches were assailed by the returning multitude of penitents who detested their idolatrous submission and who solicited with equal ardour but with various success their readmission into the society of christians it was on this occasion that cyprian wrote his treatise de lapsis and many of his epistles the controversy concerning the treatment of penitent apostates does not occur among the christians of the preceding century shall we ascribe this to the superiority of their faith and courage or to our less intimate knowledge of their history   iv notwithstanding the general rules established for the conviction and punishment of the christians the fate of those sectaries in an extensive alternatives of severity and toleration and arbitrary government must still in a great measure have depended on their own behavior the circumstances of the times and the temper of their supreme as well as subordinate rulers zeal might sometimes provoke and prudence might sometimes avert or assuage the superstitious fury of the pagans a variety of motives might dispose the provincial governors either to enforce or to relax the execution of the laws and of these motives the most forcible was their regard not only for the public edicts but for the secret intentions of the emperor a glance from whose eye was sufficient to kindle or to extinguish the flames of persecution as often as any occasional severities were exercised in the different parts of the empire the primitive christians lamented and perhaps magnified their own sufferings but the celebrated the ten persecutions number of ten persecutions has been determined by the ecclesiastical writers of the fifth century who possessed a more distinct view of the prosperous or adverse fortunes of the church from the age of nero to that of diocletian the ingenious parallels of the ten plagues of egypt and of the ten horns of the apocalypse first suggested this calculation to their minds and in their application of the faith of prophecy to the truth of history they were careful to select those reigns which were indeed the most hostile to the christian cause see mosheim p    sulpicius severus was the first author of this computation though he seemed desirous of reserving the tenth and greatest persecution for the coming of the antichrist  but these transient persecutions served only to revive the zeal and to restore the discipline of the faithful and the moments of extraordinary rigor were compensated by much longer intervals of peace and security the indifference of some princes and the indulgence of others permitted the christians to enjoy though not perhaps a legal yet an actual and public toleration of their religion  the apology of tertullian contains two very supposed edicts of tiberius and marcus antoninus ancient very singular but at the same time very suspicious instances of imperial clemency the edicts published by tiberius and by marcus antoninus and designed not only to protect the innocence of the christians but even to proclaim those stupendous miracles which had attested the truth of their doctrine the first of these examples is attended with some difficulties which might perplex a skeptical mind the testimony given by pontius pilate is first mentioned by justin the successive improvements which the story has acquired as it passed through the hands of tertullian eusebius epiphanius chrysostom orosius gregory of tours and the authors of the several editions of the acts of pilate are very fairly stated by dom calmet dissertat sur lecriture tom iii p     etc  we are required to believe that pontius pilate informed the emperor of the unjust sentence of death which he had pronounced against an innocent and as it appeared a divine person and that without acquiring the merit he exposed himself to the danger of martyrdom that tiberius who avowed his contempt for all religion immediately conceived the design of placing the jewish messiah among the gods of rome that his servile senate ventured to disobey the commands of their master that tiberius instead of resenting their refusal contented himself with protecting the christians from the severity of the laws many years before such laws were enacted or before the church had assumed any distinct name or existence and lastly that the memory of this extraordinary transaction was preserved in the most public and authentic records which escaped the knowledge of the historians of greece and rome and were only visible to the eyes of an african christian who composed his apology one hundred and sixty years after the death of tiberius the edict of marcus antoninus is supposed to have been the effect of his devotion and gratitude for the miraculous deliverance which he had obtained in the marcomannic war the distress of the legions the seasonable tempest of rain and hail of thunder and of lightning and the dismay and defeat of the barbarians have been celebrated by the eloquence of several pagan writers if there were any christians in that army it was natural that they should ascribe some merit to the servent prayers which in the moment of danger they had offered up for their own and the public safety but we are still assured by monuments of brass and marble by the imperial medals and by the antonine column that neither the prince nor the people entertained any sense of this signal obligation since they unanimously attribute their deliverance to the providence of jupiter and to the interposition of mercury during the whole course of his reign marcus despised the christians as a philosopher and punished them as a sovereign on this miracle as it is commonly called of the thundering legion see the admirable criticism of mr moyle in his works vol ii p       0   by a singular fatality the hardships which they had endured under the government of a state of the christians in the reigns of commodus and severus a d   0 virtuous prince immediately ceased on the accession of a tyrant and as none except themselves had experienced the injustice of marcus so they alone were protected by the lenity of commodus the celebrated marcia the most favored of his concubines and who at length contrived the murder of her imperial lover entertained a singular affection for the oppressed church and though it was impossible that she could reconcile the practice of vice with the precepts of the gospel she might hope to atone for the frailties of her sex and profession by declaring herself the patroness of the christians dion cassius or rather his abbreviator xiphilin l lxxii p   0  mr moyle p     has explained the condition of the church under the reign of commodus  under the gracious protection of marcia they passed in safety the thirteen years of a cruel tyranny and when the empire was established in the house of severus they formed a domestic but more honorable connection with the new court the emperor was persuaded that in a dangerous sickness he had derived some benefit either spiritual or physical from the holy oil with which one of his slaves had anointed him he always treated with peculiar distinction several persons of both sexes who had embraced the new religion the nurse as well as the preceptor of caracalla were christians and if that young prince ever betrayed a sentiment of humanity it was occasioned by an incident which however trifling bore some relation to the cause of christianity compare the life of caracalla in the augustan history with the epistle of tertullian to scapula dr jortin remarks on ecclesiastical history vol ii p   etc considers the cure of severus by the means of holy oil with a strong desire to convert it into a miracle  under the reign of severus the fury of the populace was checked the rigor of ancient laws was for some time suspended and the provincial governors were satisfied with receiving an annual present from the churches within their jurisdiction as the price or as the reward of their moderation tertullian de fuga c    the present was made during the feast of the saturnalia and it is a matter of serious concern to tertullian that the faithful should be confounded with the most infamous professions which purchased the connivance of the government  the controversy concerning the precise time of the celebration of easter armed the bishops of asia and italy against each other and was considered as the most important business of this period of leisure and tranquillity eusebius l v c       mosheim p           nor was the peace a d     of the church interrupted till the increasing numbers of proselytes seem at length to have attracted the attention and to have alienated the mind of severus with the design of restraining the progress of christianity he published an edict which though it was designed to affect only the new converts could not be carried into strict execution without exposing to danger and punishment the most zealous of their teachers and missionaries in this mitigated persecution we may still discover the indulgent spirit of rome and of polytheism which so readily admitted every excuse in favor of those who practiced the religious ceremonies of their fathers judaeos fieri sub gravi poena vetuit idem etiam de christianis sanxit hist august p  0   but the laws which severus had enacted soon of the successors of severus expired with the authority of that emperor and the christians after this accidental tempest enjoyed a d          a calm of thirtyeight years sulpicius severus l ii p     this computation allowing for a single exception is confirmed by the history of eusebius and by the writings of cyprian  till this period they had usually held their assemblies in private houses and sequestered places they were now permitted to erect and consecrate convenient edifices for the purpose of religious worship the antiquity of christian churches is discussed by tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom iii part ii p        and by mr moyle vol i p          the former refers the first construction of them to the peace of alexander severus the latter to the peace of gallienus  to purchase lands even at rome itself for the use of the community and to conduct the elections of their ecclesiastical ministers in so public but at the same time in so exemplary a manner as to deserve the respectful attention of the gentiles see the augustan history p   0 the emperor alexander adopted their method of publicly proposing the names of those persons who were candidates for ordination it is true that the honor of this practice is likewise attributed to the jews  this long repose of the church was accompanied with dignity the reigns of those princes who derived their extraction from the asiatic provinces proved the most favorable to the christians the eminent persons of the sect instead of being reduced to implore the protection of a slave or concubine were admitted into the palace in the honorable characters of priests and philosophers and their mysterious doctrines which were already diffused among the people insensibly attracted the curiosity of their sovereign when the empress mammaea passed through antioch she expressed a desire of conversing with the celebrated origin the fame of whose piety and learning was spread over the east origin obeyed so flattering an invitation and though he could not expect to succeed in the conversion of an artful and ambitious woman she listened with pleasure to his eloquent exhortations and honorably dismissed him to his retirement in palestine eusebius hist ecclesiast l vi c    hieronym de script eccles c    mammaea was styled a holy and pious woman both by the christians and the pagans from the former therefore it was impossible that she should deserve that honorable epithet  the sentiments of mammaea were adopted by her son alexander and the philosophic devotion of that emperor was marked by a singular but injudicious regard for the christian religion in his domestic chapel he placed the statues of abraham of orpheus of apollonius and of christ as an honor justly due to those respectable sages who had instructed mankind in the various modes of addressing their homage to the supreme and universal deity see the augustan history p     mosheim p     seems to refine too much on the domestic religion of alexander his design of building a public temple to christ hist august p     and the objection which was suggested either to him or in similar circumstances to hadrian appear to have no other foundation than an improbable report invented by the christians and credulously adopted by an historian of the age of constantine  a purer faith as well as worship was openly professed and practiced among his household bishops perhaps for the first time were seen at court and after the death of alexander when the inhuman maximin discharged his fury on the a d     favorites and servants of his unfortunate benefactor a great number of christians of every rank and of both sexes were involved in the promiscuous massacre which on their account has improperly received the name of persecution eusebius l vi c    it may be presumed that the success of the christians had exasperated the increasing bigotry of the pagans dion cassius who composed his history under the former reign had most probably intended for the use of his master those counsels of persecution which he ascribes to a better age and to the favorite of augustus concerning this oration of maecenas or rather of dion i may refer to my own unbiassed opinion vol i p    not    and to the abbe de la bleterie memoires de lacademie tom xxiv p  0  tom xxv p       notwithstanding the cruel disposition of maximin the effects of his resentment against the christians were of a very local and temporary of maximin philip and decius nature and the pious origin who had been proscribed as a devoted victim was still reserved to convey the truths of the gospel to the ear of monarchs orosius l vii c    mentions origin as the object of maximins resentment and firmilianus a cappadocian bishop of that age gives a just and confined idea of this persecution apud cyprian epist     he addressed several edifying letters to the emperor philip to his wife and to his a d     mother and as soon as that prince who was born in the neighborhood of palestine had usurped the imperial scepter the christians acquired a friend and a protector the public and even partial favor of philip toward the sectaries of the new religion and his constant reverence for the ministers of the church gave some color to the suspicion which prevailed in his own times that the emperor himself was become a convert to the faith the mention of those princes who were publicly supposed to be christians as we find it in an epistle of dionysius of alexandria ap eusebius l vii c  0 evidently alludes to philip and his family and forms a contemporary evidence that such a report had prevailed but the egyptian bishop who lived at an humble distance from the court of rome expresses himself with a becoming diffidence concerning the truth of the fact the epistles of origin which were extant in the time of eusebius see l vi c    would most probably decide this curious rather than important question  and afforded some grounds for a fable which was afterward invented that he had been purified by confession and penance from the guilt contracted by the murder of his innocent predecessor eusebius l vi c    the story as is usual has been embellished by succeeding writers and is confuted with much superfluous learning by frederick spanheim opera varia tom ii p  00 etc  the fall a d     of philip introduced with the change of masters a new system of government so oppressive to the christians that their former condition ever since the time of domitian was represented as a state of perfect freedom and security if compared with the rigorous treatment which they experienced under the short reign of decius lactantius de mortibus persecutorum c     after celebrating the felicity and increase of the church under a long succession of good princes he adds extitit post annos plurimos execrabile animal decius qui vexaret ecclesiam  the virtues of that prince will scarcely allow us to suspect that he was actuated by a mean resentment against the favorites of his predecessor and it is more reasonable to believe that in the prosecution of his general design to restore the purity of roman manners he was desirous of delivering the empire from what he condemned as a recent and criminal superstition the bishops of the most considerable cities were removed by exile or death the vigilance of the magistrates prevented the clergy of rome during sixteen months from proceeding to a new election and it was the opinion of the christians that the emperor would more patiently endure a competitor for the purple than a bishop in the capital eusebius l vi c    cyprian epistol    the sea of rome remained vacant from the martyrdom of fabianus the  0th of january a d   0 till the election of cornelius the  th of june a d     decius had probably left rome since he was killed before the end of that year  were it possible to suppose that the penetration of decius had discovered pride under the disguise of humility or that he could foresee the temporal dominion which might insensibly arise from the claims of spiritual authority we might be less surprised that he should consider the successors of st peter as the most formidable rivals to those of augustus  the administration of valerian was distinguished of valerian gallienus and his successors by a levity and inconstancy illsuited to the gravity of the roman censor in the first part of his reign he surpassed in clemency those a d        0 princes who had been suspected of an attachment to the christian faith in the last three years and a half listening to the insinuations of a minister addicted to the superstitions of egypt he adopted the maxims and imitated the severity of his predecessor decius eusebius l vii c  0 mosheim p     has very clearly shown that the prefect macrianus and the egyptian magus are one and the same person  the accession of gallienus which increased the calamities of the empire restored peace to the church and the christians obtained the free exercise of their religion by an edict addressed to the bishops and conceived in such terms as seemed to acknowledge their office and public character eusebius l vii c    gives us a greek version of this latin edict which seems to have been very concise by another edict he directed that the coemeteria should be restored to the christians  the ancient laws without being formally repealed were suffered to sink into oblivion and excepting only some hostile intentions which are attributed to the emperor aurelian eusebius l vii c  0 lactantius de m p c   hieronym in chron p     orosius l vii c    their language is in general so ambiguous and incorrect that we are at a loss to determine how far aurelian had carried his intentions before he was assassinated most of the moderns except dodwell dissertat cyprian xi    have seized the occasion of gaining a few extraordinary martyrs  the disciples of christ passed above forty years in a state of prosperity far more dangerous to their virtue than the severest trials of persecution  the story of paul of samosata who filled the paul of samosata his manners metropolitan see of antioch while the east was in the hands of odenathus and zenobia may serve to illustrate the condition and character of a d   0 the times the wealth of that prelate was a sufficient evidence of his guilt since it was neither derived from the inheritance of his fathers nor acquired by the arts of honest industry but paul considered the service of the church as a very lucrative profession paul was better pleased with the title of ducenarius than with that of bishop the ducenarius was an imperial procurator so called from his salary of two hundred sestertia or   00 l a year see salmasius ad hist august p     some critics suppose that the bishop of antioch had actually obtained such an office from zenobia while others consider it only as a figurative expression of his pomp and insolence  his ecclesiastical jurisdiction was venal and rapacious he extorted frequent contributions from the most opulent of the faithful and converted to his own use a considerable part of the public revenue by his pride and luxury the christian religion was rendered odious in the eyes of the gentiles his council chamber and his throne the splendor with which he appeared in public the suppliant crowd who solicited his attention the multitude of letters and petitions to which he dictated his answers and the perpetual hurry of business in which he was involved were circumstances much better suited to the state of a civil magistrate simony was not unknown in those times and the clergy sometimes bought what they intended to sell it appears that the bishopric of carthage was purchased by a wealthy matron named lucilla for her servant majorinus the price was  00 folles monument antiq ad calcem optati p     every follis contained     pieces of silver and the whole sum may be computed at about   00 l  than to the humility of a primitive bishop when he harangued his people from the pulpit paul affected the figurative style and the theatrical gestures of an asiatic sophist while the cathedral resounded with the loudest and most extravagant acclamations in the praise of his divine eloquence against those who resisted his power or refused to flatter his vanity the prelate of antioch was arrogant rigid and inexorable but he relaxed the discipline and lavished the treasures of the church on his dependent clergy who were permitted to imitate their master in the gratification of every sensual appetite for paul indulged himself very freely in the pleasures of the table and he had received into the episcopal palace two young and beautiful women as the constant companions of his leisure moments if we are desirous of extenuating the vices of paul we must suspect the assembled bishops of the east of publishing the most malicious calumnies in circular epistles addressed to all the churches of the empire ap eusebius l vii c  0   notwithstanding these scandalous vices if paul he is degraded from the sea of antioch of samosata had preserved the purity of the orthodox faith his reign over the capital of syria would have ended only with his life and a d   0 had a seasonable persecution intervened an effort of courage might perhaps have placed him in the rank of saints and martyrs some nice and subtle errors which he imprudently adopted and obstinately maintained concerning the doctrine of the trinity excited the zeal and indignation of the eastern churches his heresy like those of noetus and sabellius in the same century tended to confound the mysterious distinction of the divine persons see mosheim p  0  etc  from egypt to the euxine sea the bishops were in arms and in motion several councils were held confutations were published excommunications were pronounced ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused treaties were concluded and violated and at length paul of samosata was degraded from his episcopal character by the sentence of seventy or eighty bishops who assembled for that purpose at antioch and who without consulting the rights of the clergy or people appointed a successor by their own authority the manifest irregularity of this proceeding increased the numbers of the discontented faction and as paul who was no stranger to the arts of courts had insinuated himself into the favor of zenobia he maintained above four years the possession of the episcopal house and office the victory of aurelian changed the face of the east and the two contending parties who applied to each other the epithets of schism and heresy were either commanded or permitted to plead their cause before the tribunal of the conqueror this public and very singular trial affords a convincing proof that the existence the property the privileges and the internal policy of the christians were acknowledged if not by the laws at least by the magistrates of the empire as a pagan and as a soldier it could scarcely by expected that aurelian should enter into the discussion whether the sentiments of paul or those of his adversaries were most agreeable to the true standard of the orthodox faith his determination however was founded on the general principles of equity and reason the sentence is executed by aurelian he considered the bishops of italy as the most impartial and respectable judges among the christians and as soon as he was informed that they a d     had unanimously approved the sentence of the council he acquiesced in their opinion and immediately gave orders that paul should be compelled to relinquish the temporal possessions belonging to an office of which in the judgment of his brethren he had been regularly deprived but while we applaud the justice we should not overlook the policy of aurelian who was desirous of restoring and cementing the dependence of the provinces on the capital by every means which could bind the interest or prejudices of any part of his subjects eusebius hist ecclesiast l vii c  0 we are entirely indebted to him for the curious story of paul of samosata   amidst the frequent revolutions of the empire peace and prosperity of the church under diocletian the christians still flourished in peace and prosperity and notwithstanding a celebrated era of martyrs has been deduced from the accession of diocletian the era of martyrs which is still in use among the copts and the abyssinians must be reckoned from the   th of august a d     as the beginning of the egyptian year was nineteen days earlier than the real accession of

years to breathe the mildest and most liberal spirit of religious toleration the mind of diocletian himself was less adapted indeed to speculative inquiries than to the active labors of war and government his prudence rendered him averse to any great innovation and though his temper was not very susceptible of zeal or enthusiasm he always maintained an habitual regard for the ancient deities of the empire but the leisure of the two empresses of his wife prisca and of valeria his daughter permitted them to listen with more attention and respect to the truths of christianity which in every age has acknowledged its important obligations to female devotion the expression of lactantius de m p c    sacrificio pollui coegit implies their antecedent conversion to the faith but does not seem to justify the assertion of mosheim p     that they had been privately baptized  the principal eunuchs lucian m de tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom v part i p       has quoted from the spicilegium of dom luc dacheri a very curious instruction which bishop theonas composed for the use of lucian and dorotheus gorgonius and andrew who attended the person possessed the favor and governed the household of diocletian protected by their powerful influence the faith which they had embraced their example was imitated by many of the most considerable officers of the palace who in

accompany the emperor when he sacrificed in the temple lactantius de m p c  0  they enjoyed with their wives their children and their slaves the free exercise of the christian religion diocletian and his colleagues frequently conferred the most important offices on those persons who avowed their abhorrence for the worship of the gods but who had displayed abilities proper for the service of the state the bishops held an honorable rank in their respective provinces and were treated with distinction and respect not only by the people but by the magistrates themselves almost in every city the ancient churches were found insufficient to contain the increasing multitude of proselytes and in their place more stately and capacious edifices were erected for the public worship of the faithful the corruption of manners and principles so forcibly lamented by eusebius eusebius hist ecclesiast l viii c   the reader who consults the original will not accuse me of heightening the picture eusebius was about sixteen years of age at the accession of the emperor diocletian  may be considered not only as a consequence but as a proof of the liberty which the christians enjoyed and abused under the reign of diocletian prosperity had relaxed the nerves of discipline fraud envy and malice prevailed in every congregation the presbyters aspired to the episcopal office which every day became an object more worthy of their ambition the bishops who contended with each other for ecclesiastical preeminence appeared by their conduct to claim a secular and tyrannical power in the church and the lively faith which still distinguished the christians from the gentiles was shown much less in their lives than in their controversial writings  notwithstanding this seeming security an attentive progress of zeal and superstition among the pagans observer might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a more violent persecution than any which she had yet endured the zeal and rapid progress of the christians awakened the polytheists from their supine indifference in the cause of those deities whom custom and education had taught them to revere the mutual provocations of a religious war which had already continued above two hundred years exasperated the animosity of the contending parties the pagans were incensed at the rashness of a recent and obscure sect which presumed to accuse their countrymen of error and to devote their ancestors to eternal misery the habits of justifying the popular mythology against the invectives of an implacable enemy produced in their minds some sentiments of faith and reverence for a system which they had been accustomed to consider with the most careless levity the supernatural powers assumed by the church inspired at the same time terror and emulation the followers of the established religion entrenched themselves behind a similar fortification of prodigies invented new modes of sacrifice of expiation and of initiation we might quote among a great number of instances the mysterious worship of mythras and the taurobolia the latter of which became fashionable in the time of the antonines see a dissertation

to acknowledge the truth of those miracles which were claimed by their adversaries and while they were contented with ascribing them to the arts of magic and to the power of demons they mutually concurred in restoring and establishing the reign of superstition it is seriously to be lamented that the christian fathers by acknowledging the supernatural or as they deem it the infernal part of paganism destroy with their own hands the great advantage which we might otherwise derive from the liberal concessions of our adversaries  philosophy her most dangerous enemy was now converted into her most useful ally the groves of the academy the gardens of epicurus and even the portico of the stoics were almost deserted as so many different schools of skepticism or impiety julian p  0  edit

lactantius divin institut l v c     gives a very clear and spirited account of two of these philosophic adversaries of the faith the large treatise of porphyry against the christians consisted of thirty books and was composed in sicily about the year   0  which have since been committed to the flames by the prudence of orthodox emperors see socrates hist ecclesiast l i c   and codex justinian l i tit i l     although the policy of diocletian and the maximian and galerius punish a few christian soldiers humanity of constantius inclined them to preserve inviolate the maxims of toleration it was soon discovered that their two associates maximian and galerius entertained the most implacable aversion for the name and religion of the christians the minds of those princes had never been enlightened by science education had never softened their temper they owed their greatness to their swords and in their most elevated fortune they still retained their superstitious prejudices of soldiers and peasants in the general administration of the provinces they obeyed the laws which their benefactor had established but they frequently found occasions of exercising within their camp and palaces a secret persecution eusebius l viii c   c    he limits the number of military martyrs by a remarkable expression  of which neither his latin nor french translator have rendered the energy notwithstanding the authority of eusebius and the silence of lactantius ambrose sulpicius orosius etc it has been long believed that the thebaean legion consisting of  000 christians suffered martyrdom by the order of maximian in the valley of the penine alps the story was first published about the middle of the vth century by eucherius bishop of lions who received it from certain persons

declaring that his conscience would not permit him to embrace the profession of a soldier see the acta sincera p     the accounts of his martyrdom and of that of marcellus bear every mark of truth and

than of martial or even civil law but they served to alienate the mind of the emperors to justify the severity of galerius who dismissed a great number of christian officers from their employments and to authorize the opinion that a sect of enthusiasts which avowed principles so repugnant to the public safety must either remain useless or would soon become dangerous subjects of the empire  after the success of the persian war had raised galerius prevails on diocletian to begin a general persecution the hopes and the reputation of galerius he passed a winter with diocletian in the place of

lenity and though he readily consented to exclude the christians from holding any employments in the household or the army he urged in the strongest terms the danger as well as cruelty of shedding the blood of those deluded fanatics galerius at length extorted from him the permission of summoning a council composed of a few persons the most distinguished in the civil and military departments of the state the important question was agitated in their presence and those ambitious courtiers easily discerned that it was incumbent on them to second by their eloquence the importunate violence of the caesar it may be presumed that they insisted on every topic which might interest the pride the piety or the fears of their sovereign in the destruction of christianity perhaps they represented that the glorious work of the deliverance of the empire was left imperfect as long as an independent people was permitted to subsist and multiply in the heart of the provinces the christians it might speciously be alleged renouncing the gods and the institutions of rome had constituted a distinct republic which might yet be suppressed before it had acquired any military force but which was already governed by its own laws and magistrates was possessed of a public treasure and was intimately connected in all its parts by the frequent assemblies of the bishops to whose decrees their numerous and opulent congregations yielded an implicit obedience arguments like these may seem to have determined the reluctant mind of diocletian to embrace a new system of persecution but though we may suspect it is not in our power to relate the secret intrigues of the palace the private views and resentments the jealousy of women or eunuchs and all those trifling but decisive causes which so often influence the fate of empires and the counsels of the wisest monarchs the only circumstance which we can discover is the devotion and jealousy of the mother of galerius she is described by lactantius as deorum montium cultrix mulier admodum superstitiosa she had a great influence over her son and was offended by the disregard of some of her christian servants   the pleasure of the emperors was at length signified to the christians who during the course of this melancholy winter had expected with demolition of the church of nicomedia a d  0    d feb anxiety the result of so many secret consultations the twentythird of february which coincided with the roman festival of the terminalia the worship and festival of the god terminus are elegantly illustrated by m de boze mem de lacademie des inscriptions tom i p  0  was appointed whether from accident or design to set bounds to the progress of christianity at the earliest dawn of day the praetorian prefect in our only ms of lactantius we read profectus but reason and the authority of all the critics allow us instead of that word which destroys the sense of the passage to substitute praefectus  accompanied by several generals tribunes and officers of the revenue repaired to the principal church of nicomedia which was situated on an eminence in the most populous and beautiful part of the city the doors were instantly broke open they rushed into the sanctuary and as they searched in vain for some visible object of worship they were obliged to content themselves with committing to the flames the volumes of holy scripture the ministers of diocletian were followed by a numerous body of guards and pioneers who marched in order of battle and were provided with all the instruments used in the destruction of fortified cities by their incessant labor a sacred edifice which towered above the imperial palace and had long excited the indignation and envy of the gentiles was in a few hours levelled with the ground lactantius de m p c    gives a very lively picture of the destruction of the church   the next day the general edict of persecution was published mosheim p          from many scattered passages of lactantius and eusebius has collected a very just and accurate notion of this edict though he sometimes deviates into conjecture and refinement  and though diocletian still the first edict against the christians   th of february averse to the effusion of blood had moderated the fury of galerius who proposed that every one refusing to offer sacrifice should immediately be burnt alive the penalties inflicted on the obstinacy of the christians might be deemed sufficiently rigorous and effectual it was enacted that their churches in all the provinces of the empire should be demolished to their foundations and the punishment of death was denounced against all who should presume to hold any secret assemblies for the purpose of religious worship the philosophers who now assumed the unworthy office of directing the blind zeal of persecution had diligently studied the nature and genius of the christian religion and as they were not ignorant that the speculative doctrines of the faith were supposed to be contained in the writings of the prophets of the evangelists and of the apostles they most probably suggested the order that the bishops and presbyters should deliver all their sacred books into the hands of the magistrates who were commanded under the severest penalties to burn them in a public and solemn manner by the same edict the property of the church was at once confiscated and the several parts of which it might consist were either sold to the highest bidder united to the imperial domain bestowed on the cities and corporations or granted to the solicitations of rapacious courtiers after taking such effectual measures to abolish the worship and to dissolve the government of the christians it was thought necessary to subject to the most intolerable hardships the condition of those perverse individuals who should still reject the religion of nature of rome and of their ancestors persons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of holding any honors or employments slaves were for ever deprived of the hopes of freedom and the whole body of the people were put out of the protection of the law the judges were authorized to hear and to determine every action that was brought against a christian but the christians were not permitted to complain of any injury which they themselves had suffered and thus those unfortunate sectaries were exposed to the severity while they were excluded from the benefits of public justice this new species of martyrdom so painful and lingering so obscure and ignominious was perhaps the most proper to weary the constancy of the faithful nor can it be doubted that the passions and interest of mankind were disposed on this occasion to second the designs of the emperors but the policy of a wellordered government must sometimes have interposed in behalf of the oppressed christians nor was it possible for the roman princes entirely to remove the apprehension of punishment or to connive at every act of fraud and violence without exposing their own authority and the rest of their subjects to the most alarming dangers many ages afterward edward i practiced with great success the same mode of persecution against the clergy of england see humes history of england vol ii p  00 last   to edition   this edict was scarcely exhibited to the public zeal and  a christian view in the most conspicuous place of nicomedia before it was torn down by the hands of a christian who expressed at the same time by the bitterest invectives his contempt as well as abhorrence for such impious and tyrannical governors his offense according to the mildest laws amounted to treason and deserved death and if it be true that he was a person of rank and education those circumstances could serve only to aggravate his guilt he was burnt or rather roasted by a slow fire and his executioners zealous to revenge the personal insult which had been offered to the emperors exhausted every refinement of cruelty without being able to subdue his patience or to alter the steady and insulting smile which in his dying agonies he still preserved in his countenance the christians though they confessed that his conduct had not been strictly conformable to the laws of prudence admired the divine fervor of his zeal and the excessive commendations which they lavished on the memory of their hero and martyr contributed to fix a deep impression of terror and hatred in the mind of diocletian lactantius only calls him quidam etsi non recte magno tamen animo etc c    eusebius l viii c   adorns him with secular honors neither have condescended to mention his name but the greeks celebrate his memory under that of john see tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom v part ii p   0   his fears were soon alarmed by the view of a fire of the palace of nicomedia imputed to the christians danger from which he very narrowly escaped within fifteen days the palace of nicomedia and even the bedchamber of diocletian were twice in flames and though both times they were extinguished without any material damage the singular repetition of the fire was justly considered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of chance or negligence the suspicion naturally fell on the christians and it was suggested with some degree of probability that those desperate fanatics provoked by their present sufferings and apprehensive of impending calamities had entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren the eunuchs of the palace against the lives of two emperors whom they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of the church of god jealousy and resentment prevailed in every breast but especially in that of diocletian a great number of persons distinguished either by the offices which they had filled or by the favor which they had enjoyed were thrown into prison every mode of torture was put in practice and the court as well as city was polluted with many bloody executions lactantius de m p c       potentissimi quondam eunuchi necati per quos palatium et ipse constabat eusebius l viii c   mentions the cruel extortions of the eunuchs gorgonius and dorotheus and of anthimius bishop of nicomedia and both those writers describe in a vague but tragical manner the horrid scenes which were acted even in the imperial presence  but as it was found impossible to extort any discovery of this mysterious transaction it seems incumbent on us either to presume the innocence or to admire the resolution of the sufferers a few days afterward galerius hastily withdrew himself from nicomedia declaring that if he delayed his departure from that devoted palace he should fall a sacrifice to the rage of the christians the ecclesiastical historians from whom alone we derive a partial and imperfect knowledge of this persecution are at a loss how to account for the fears and dangers of the emperors two of these writers a prince and a rhetorician were eyewitnesses of the fire of nicomedia the one ascribes it to lightning and the divine wrath the other affirms that it was kindled by the malice of galerius himself see lactantius eusebius and constantine ad coetum sanctorum c    eusebius confesses his ignorance of the cause of the fire   as the edict against the christians was designed execution of the first edict for a general law of the whole empire and as diocletian and galerius though they might not wait for the consent were assured of the concurrence of the western princes it would appear more consonant to our ideas of policy that the governors of all the provinces should have received secret instructions to publish on one and the same day this declaration of war within their respective departments it was at least to be expected that the convenience of the public highways and established posts would have enabled the emperors to transmit their orders with the utmost dispatch from the palace of nicomedia to the extremities of the roman world and that they would not have suffered fifty days to elapse before the edict was published in syria and near four months before it was signified to the cities of africa tillemont memoires ecclesiast tom v part i p     this delay may perhaps be imputed to the cautious temper of diocletian who had yielded a reluctant consent to the measures of persecution and who was desirous of trying the experiment under his more immediate eye before he gave way to the disorders and discontent which it must inevitably occasion in the distant provinces at first indeed the magistrates were restrained from the effusion of blood but the use of every other severity was permitted and even recommended to their zeal nor could the christians though they cheerfully resigned the ornaments of their churches resolve to interrupt their religious assemblies or to deliver their sacred books to the flames the pious obstinacy of felix an african bishop appears to have embarrassed the subordinate ministers of the government the curator of his city sent him in chains to the proconsul the proconsul transmitted him to the praetorian prefect of italy and felix who disdained even to give an evasive answer was at length beheaded at venusia in lucania a place on which the birth of horace has conferred fame see the acta sincera of ruinart p     those of foelix of thibara or tibiur appear much less corrupted than in the other editions which afford a lively specimen of legendary license  this precedent and perhaps some imperial rescript which was issued in consequence of it appeared to authorize the governors of provinces in punishing with death the refusal of the christians to deliver up their sacred books there were undoubtedly many persons who embraced this opportunity of obtaining the crown of martyrdom but there were likewise too many who purchased an ignominious life by discovering and betraying the holy scripture into the hands of infidels a great number even of bishops and presbyters acquired by this criminal compliance the opprobrious epithet of traditors and their offense was productive of much present scandal and of much future discord in the african church see the first book of optatus of milevis against the donatists at paris   00 edit dupin he lived under the reign of valens   the copies as well as the versions of scripture demolition of the churches were already so multiplied in the empire that the most severe inquisition could no longer be attended with any fatal consequences and even the sacrifice of those volumes which in every congregation were preserved for public use required the consent of some treacherous and unworthy christians but the ruin of the churches was easily effected by the authority of the government and by the labor of the pagans in some provinces however the magistrates contented themselves with shutting up the places of religious worship in others they more literally complied with the terms of the edict and after taking away the doors the benches and the pulpit which they burnt as it were in a funeral pile they completely demolished the remainder of the edifice the ancient monuments published at the end of optatus p     etc describe in a very circumstantial manner the proceedings of the governors in the destruction of churches they made a minute inventory of the plate etc which they found in them that of the church of cirta in numidia is still extant it consisted of two chalices of gold and six of silver six urns one kettle seven lamps all likewise of silver besides a large quantity of brass utensils and wearing apparel  it is perhaps to this melancholy occasion that we should apply a very remarkable story which is related with so many circumstances of variety and improbability that it serves rather to excite than to satisfy our curiosity in a small town in phrygia of whose name as well as situation we are left ignorant it should seem that the magistrates and the body of the people had embraced the christian says and as some resistance might be apprehended to the execution of the edict the governor of the province was supported by a numerous detachment of legionaries on their approach the citizens threw themselves into the church with the resolution either of defending by arms that sacred edifice or of perishing in its ruins they indignantly rejected the notice and permission which was given them to retire till the soldiers provoked by their obstinate refusal set fire to the building on all sides and consumed by this extraordinary kind of martyrdom a great number of phrygians with their wives and children lactantius institut divin v    confines the calamity to the conventiculum with its congregation eusebius viii    extends it to a whole city and introduces something very like a regular siege his ancient latin translator rufinus adds the important circumstance of the permission given to the inhabitants of retiring from thence as phrygia reached to the confines of isauria it is possible that the restless temper of those independent barbarians may have contributed to this misfortune   some slight disturbances though they were suppressed almost as soon as excited in syria subsequent edicts and the frontiers of armenia afforded the enemies of the church a very plausible occasion to insinuate that those troubles had been secretly fomented by the intrigues of the bishops who had already forgotten their ostentatious professions of passive and unlimited obedience eusebius l viii c   m de valois with some probability thinks that he has discovered the syrian rebellion in an oration of libanius and that it was a rash attempt of the tribune eugenius who with only five hundred men seized antioch and might perhaps allure the christians by the promise of religious toleration from eusebius l ix c   as well as from moses of chorene hist armen l ii c    etc it may be inferred that christianity was already introduced into armenia  the resentment or the fears of diocletian at length transported him beyond the bounds of moderation which he had hitherto preserved and he declared in a series of cruel edicts his intention of abolishing the christian name by the first of these edicts the governors of the provinces were directed to apprehend all persons of the ecclesiastical order and the prisons destined for the vilest criminals were soon filled with a multitude of bishops presbyters deacons readers and exorcists by a second edict the magistrates were commanded to employ every method of severity which might reclaim them from their odious superstition and oblige them to return to the established worship of the gods this rigorous order was extended by a subsequent edict to the whole body of christians who were exposed to a violent and general persecution see mosheim p     the text of eusebius very plainly shows that the governors whose powers were enlarged not restrained by the new laws could punish with death the most obstinate christians as an example to their brethren  instead of those salutary restraints which had required the direct and solemn testimony of an accuser it became the duty as well as the interest of the imperial officers to discover to pursue and to torment the most obnoxious among the faithful heavy penalties were denounced against all who should presume to save a proscribed sectary from the just indignation of the gods and of the emperors yet notwithstanding the severity of this law the virtuous courage of many of the pagans in concealing their friends or relations affords an honorable proof that the rage of superstition had not extinguished in their minds the sentiments of nature and humanity athanasius p     ap tillemont mem ecclesiast tom v part i p  0   diocletian had no sooner published his edicts general idea of the persecution against the christians than as if he had been desirous of committing to other hands the work of persecution he divested himself of the imperial purple the character and situation of his colleagues and successors sometimes urged them to enforce and sometimes inclined them to suspend the execution of these rigorous laws nor can we acquire a just and distinct idea of this important period of ecclesiastical history unless we separately consider the state of christianity in the different parts of the empire during the space of ten years which elapsed between the first edicts of diocletian and the final peace of the church  the mild and humane temper of constantius in the western provinces under constantius and constantine was averse to the oppression of any part of his subjects the principal offices of his palace were exercised by christians he loved their persons esteemed their fidelity and entertained not any dislike to their religious principles but as long as constantius remained in the subordinate station of caesar it was not in his power openly to reject the edicts of diocletian or to disobey the commands of maximian his authority contributed however to alleviate the sufferings which he pitied and abhorred he consented with reluctance to the ruin of the churches but he ventured to protect the christians themselves from the fury of the populace and from the rigor of the laws the provinces of gaul under which we may probably include those of britain were indebted for the singular tranquillity which they enjoyed to the gentle interposition of their sovereign eusebius l viii c    lactantius de m p c    dodwell dissertat cyprian xi    represents them as inconsistent with each other but the former evidently speaks of constantius in the station of caesar and the latter of the same prince in the rank of augustus  but datianus the president or governor of spain actuated either by zeal or policy chose rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors than to understand the secret intentions of constantius and it can scarcely be doubted that his provincial administration was stained with the blood of a few martyrs datianus is mentioned in gruters inscriptions as having determined the limits between the territories of pax julia and those of ebora both cities in the southern part of lusitania if we recollect the neighborhood of those places to cape st vincent we may suspect that the celebrated deacon and martyr of that name has been inaccurately assigned by prudentius etc to saragossa or valentia see the pompous history of his sufferings in the memoires de tillemont tom v part ii p        some critics are of opinion that the department of constantius as caesar did not include spain which still continued under the immediate jurisdiction of maximian  the elevation of constantius to the supreme and independent dignity of augustus gave a free scope to the exercise of his virtues and the shortness of his reign did not prevent him from establishing a system of toleration of which he left the precept and the example to his son constantine his fortunate son from the first moment of his accession declaring himself the protector of the church at length deserved the appellation of the first emperor who publicly professed and established the christian religion the motives of his conversion as they may variously be deduced from benevolence from policy from conviction or from remorse and the progress of the revolution which under his powerful influence and that of his sons rendered christianity the reigning religion of the roman empire will form a very interesting and important chapter in the third volume of this history at present it may be sufficient to observe that every victory of constantine was productive of some relief or benefit to the church  the provinces of italy and africa experienced in italy and africa under maximian and severus a short but violent persecution the rigorous edicts of diocletian were strictly and cheerfully executed by his associate maximian who had long hated the christians and who delighted in acts of blood and violence in the autumn of the first year of the persecution the two emperors met at rome to celebrate their triumph several oppressive laws appear to have issued from their secret consultations and the diligence of the magistrates was animated by the presence of their sovereigns after diocletian had divested himself of the purple italy and africa were administered under the name of severus and were exposed without defense to the implacable resentment of his master galerius among the martyrs of rome adauctus deserves the notice of posterity he was of a noble family in italy and had raised himself through the successive honors of the palace to the important office of treasurer of the private demesnes adauctus is the more remarkable for being the only person of rank and distinction who appears to have suffered death during the whole course of this general persecution eusebius l viii c    gruter inscript p      no    rufinus has mistaken the office of adauctus as well as the place of his martyrdom   the revolt of maxentius immediately restored peace to the churches of italy and africa and the same tyrant who oppressed every other class under maxentius of his subjects showed himself just humane and even partial toward the afflicted christians he depended on their gratitude and affection and very naturally presumed that the injuries which they had suffered and the dangers which they still apprehended from his most inveterate enemy would secure the fidelity of a party already considerable by their numbers and opulence eusebius l viii c    but as maxentius was vanquished by constantine it suited the purpose of lactantius to place his death among those of the persecutors  even the conduct of maxentius toward the bishops of rome and carthage may be considered as the proof of his toleration since it is probable that the most orthodox princes would adopt the same measures with regard to their established clergy marcellus the former of those prelates had thrown the capital into confusion by the severe penance which he imposed on a great number of christians who during the late persecution had renounced or dissembled their religion the rage of faction broke out in frequent and violent seditions the blood of the faithful was shed by each others hands and the exile of marcellus whose prudence seems to have been less eminent than his zeal was found to be the only measure capable of restoring peace to the distracted church of rome the epitaph of marcellus is to be found in gruter inscript p      no   and it contains all that we know of his history marcellinus and marcellus whose names follow in the list of popes are supposed by many critics to be different persons but the learned abbe de longuerre was convinced that they were one and the same veridicus rector lapsis quia crimina flere praedixit miseris fuit omnibus hostis amarus hinc furor hinc odium sequitur discordia lites seditio caedes solvuntur foedera pacis crimen ob alterius christum qui in pace negavit finibus expulsus patriae est feritate tyranni haec breviter damasus voluit comperta refer marcelli populus meritum cognoscere posset we may observe that damasus was made bishop of rome a d        the behavior of mensurius bishop of carthage appears to have been still more reprehensible a deacon of that city had published a libel against the emperor the offender took refuge in the episcopal palace and though it was somewhat early to advance any claims of ecclesiastical immunities the bishop refused to deliver him up to the officers of justice for this treasonable resistance mensurius was summoned to court and instead of receiving a legal sentence of death or banishment he was permitted after a short examination to return to his diocese optatus contr donatist l i c        such was the happy condition of the christian subjects of maxentius that whenever they were desirous of procuring for their own use any bodies of martyrs they were obliged to purchase them from the most distant provinces of the east a story is related of aglae a roman lady descended from a consular family and possessed of so ample an estate that it required the management of seventythree stewards among these boniface was the favorite of his mistress and as aglae mixed love with devotion it is reported that he was admitted to share her bed her fortune enabled her to gratify the pious desire of obtaining some sacred relics from the east she entrusted boniface with a considerable sum of gold and a large quantity of aromatics and her lover attended by twelve horsemen and three covered chariots undertook a remote pilgrimage as far as tarsus in cilicia the acts of the passion of st boniface which abound in miracles and declamation are published by ruinart p        both in greek and latin from the authority of very ancient manuscripts   the sanguinary temper of galerius the first in illyricum and the east under galerius and maximian and principal author of the persecution was formidable to those christians whom their misfortunes had placed within the limits of his dominions and it may fairly be presumed that many persons of a middle rank who were not confined by the chains either of wealth or of poverty very frequently deserted their native country and sought a refuge in the milder climate of the west as long as he commanded only the armies and provinces of illyricum he could with difficulty either find or make a considerable number of martyrs in a warlike country which had entertained the missionaries of the gospel with more coldness and reluctance than any other part of the empire during the four first centuries there exist few traces of either bishops or bishoprics in the western illyricum it has been thought probable that the primate of milan extended his jurisdiction over sirmium the capital of that great province see the geographia sacra of charles de st paul p      with the observations of lucas holstenius  but when galerius had obtained the supreme power and the government of the east he indulged in their fullest extent his zeal and cruelty not only in the provinces of thrace and asia which acknowledged his immediate jurisdiction but in those of syria palestine and egypt where maximin gratified his own inclination by yielding a rigorous obedience to the stern commands of his benefactor the viiith book of eusebius as well as the supplement concerning the martyrs of palestine principally relate to the persecution of galerius and maximin the general lamentations with which lactantius opens the vth book of his divine institutions allude to their cruelty  the frequent disappointments of his ambitious views the experience of six years of persecution and the salutary reflections which a lingering and painful distemper suggested to the mind of galerius at length convinced him that the most violent efforts of despotism are insufficient to extirpate a whole people or to subdue their religious prejudices desirous of repairing the mischief that he had occasioned he published in his own name and in those of licinius and constantine a general edict which after a pompous recital of the imperial titles proceeded in the following manner  among the important cares which have occupied galerius publishes an edict of toleration our mind for the utility and preservation of the empire it was our intention to correct and reestablish all things according to the ancient laws and public discipline of the romans we were particularly desirous of reclaiming into the way of reason and nature the deluded christians who had renounced the religion and ceremonies instituted by their fathers and presumptuously despising the practice of antiquity had invented extravagant laws and opinions according to the dictates of their fancy and had collected a various society from the different provinces of our empire the edicts which we have published to enforce the worship of the gods having exposed many of the christians to danger and distress many having suffered death and many more who still persist in their impious folly being left destitute of any public exercise of religion we are disposed to extend to those unhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency we permit them therefore freely to profess their private opinions and to assemble in their conventicles without fear or molestation provided always that they preserve a due respect to the established laws and government by another rescript we shall signify our intentions to the judges and magistrates and we hope that our indulgence will engage the christians to offer up their prayers to the deity whom they adore for our safety and prosperity for their own and for that of the republic eusebius l viii c    has given us a greek version and lactantius de m p c    the latin original of this memorable edict neither of these writers seems to recollect how directly it contradicts whatever they have just affirmed of the remorse and repentance of galerius  it is not usually in the language of edicts and manifestos that we should search for the real character or the secret motives of princes but as these were the words of a dying emperor his situation perhaps may be admitted as a pledge of his sincerity  when galerius subscribed this edict of toleration peace of the church he was well assured that licinius would readily comply with the inclinations of his friend and benefactor and that any measures in favor of the christians would obtain the approbation of constantine but the emperor would not venture to insert in the preamble the name of maximin whose consent was of the greatest importance and who succeeded a few days afterward to the provinces of asia in the first six months however of his new reign maximin affected to adopt the prudent counsels of his predecessor and though he never condescended to secure the tranquillity of the church by a public edict sabinus his praetorian prefect addressed a circular letter to all the governors and magistrates of the provinces expatiating on the imperial clemency acknowledging the invincible obstinacy of the christians and directing the officers of justice to cease their ineffectual prosecutions and to connive at the secret assemblies of those enthusiasts in consequence of these orders great numbers of christians were released from prison or delivered from the mines the confessors singing hymns of triumph returned into their own countries and those who had yielded to the violence of the tempest solicited with tears of repentance their readmission into the bosom of the church eusebius l ix c   he inserts the epistle of the prefect   but this treacherous calm was of short duration maximin prepares to renew the persecution nor could the christians of the east place any confidence in the character of their sovereign cruelty and superstition were the ruling passions of the soul of maximin the former suggested the means the latter pointed out the objects of persecution the emperor was devoted to the worship of the gods to the study of magic and to the belief of oracles the prophets or philosophers whom he revered as the favorites of heaven were frequently raised to the government of provinces and admitted into his most secret councils they easily convinced him that the christians had been indebted for their victories to their regular discipline and that the weakness of polytheism had principally flowed from a want of union and subordination among the ministers of religion a system of government was therefore instituted which was evidently copied from the policy of the church in all the great cities of the empire the temples were repaired and beautified by the order of maximin and the officiating priests of the various deities were subjected to the authority of a superior pontiff destined to oppose the bishop and to promote the cause of paganism these pontiffs acknowledged in their turn the supreme jurisdiction of the metropolitans or highpriests of the province who acted as the immediate vicegerents of the emperor himself a white robe was the ensign of their dignity and these new prelates were carefully selected from the most noble and opulent families by the influence of the magistrates and of the sacerdotal order a great number of dutiful addresses were obtained particularly from the cities of nicomedia antioch and tire which artfully represented the wellknown intentions of the court as the general sense of the people solicited the emperor to consult the laws of justice rather than the dictates of his clemency expressed their abhorrence of the christians and humbly prayed that those impious sectaries might at least be excluded from the limits of their respective territories the answer of maximin to the address which he obtained from the citizens of tire is still extant he praises their zeal and devotion in terms of the highest satisfaction descants on the obstinate impiety of the christians and betrays by the readiness with which he consents to their banishment that he considered himself as receiving rather than as conferring an obligation the priests as well as the magistrates were empowered to enforce the execution of his edicts which were engraved on tables of brass and though it was recommended to them to avoid the effusion of blood the most cruel and ignominious punishments were inflicted on the refractory christians see eusebius l viii c    l ix c      lactantius de m p c    these writers agree in representing the arts of maximin but the former relates the execution of several martyrs while the latter expressly affirms occidi servos dei vetuit   the asiatic christians had every thing to dread from the severity of a bigoted monarch who prepared his measures of violence with such end of the persecutions deliberate policy but a few months had scarcely elapsed before the edicts published by the two western emperors obliged maximin to suspend the prosecution of his designs the civil war which he so rashly undertook against licinius employed all his attention and the defeat and death of maximin soon delivered the church from the last and most implacable of her enemies a few days before his death he published a very ample edict of toleration in which he imputes all the severities which the christians suffered to the judges and governors who had misunderstood his intentions see the edict in eusebius l ix c  0   in this general view of the persecution which probable account of the sufferings of the martyrs and confessors was first authorized by the edicts of diocletian i have purposely refrained from describing the particular sufferings and deaths of the christian martyrs it would have been an easy task from the history of eusebius from the declamations of lactantius and from the most ancient acts to collect a long series of horrid and disgustful pictures and to fill many pages with racks and scourges with iron hooks and red hot beds and with all the variety of tortures which fire and steel savage beasts and more savage executioners could inflict on the human body these melancholy scenes might be enlivened by a crowd of visions and miracles destined either to delay the death to celebrate the triumph or to discover the relics of those canonized saints who suffered for the name of christ but i cannot determine what i ought to transcribe till i am satisfied how much i ought to believe the gravest of the ecclesiastical historians eusebius himself indirectly confesses that he has related whatever might redound to the glory and that he has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace of religion such is the fair deduction from two remarkable passages in eusebius l viii c   and de martyr palestin c    the prudence of the historian has exposed his own character to censure and suspicion it was well known that he himself had been thrown into prison and it was suggested that he had purchased his deliverance by some dishonorable compliance the reproach was urged in his lifetime and even in his presence at the council of tire see tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom viii part i p     such an acknowledgment will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so openly violated one of the fundamental laws of history has not paid a very strict regard to the observance of the other and the suspicion will derive additional credit from the character of eusebius which was less tinctured with credulity and more practiced in the arts of courts than that of almost any of his contemporaries on some particular occasions when the magistrates were exasperated by some personal motives of interest or resentment when the zeal of the martyrs urged them to forget the rules of prudence and perhaps of decency to overturn the altars to pour out imprecations against the emperors or to strike the judge as he sat on his tribunal it may be presumed that every mode of torture which cruelty could invent or constancy could endure was exhausted on those devoted victims the ancient and perhaps authentic account of the sufferings of tarachus and his companions acta sincera ruinart p          is filled with strong expressions of resentment and contempt which could not fail of irritating the magistrate the behavior of aedesius to hierocles prefect of egypt was still more extraordinary  eusebius de martyr palestin c    two circumstances however have been unwarily mentioned which insinuate that the general treatment of the christians who had been apprehended by the officers of justice was less intolerable than it is usually imagined to have been   the confessors who were condemned to work in the mines were permitted by the humanity or the negligence of their keepers to build chapels and freely to profess their religion in the midst of those dreary habitations eusebius de martyr palestin c       the bishops were obliged to check and to censure the forward zeal of the christians who voluntarily threw themselves into the hands of the magistrates some of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debts who blindly sought to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious death others were allured by the hope that a short confinement would expiate the sins of a whole life and others again were actuated by the less honorable motive of deriving a plentiful subsistence and perhaps a considerable profit from the alms which the charity of the faithful bestowed on the prisoners augustine collat carthagin dei iii c    ap tillemont memoires ecclesiastiques tom v part i p    the controversy with the donatists has reflected some though perhaps a partial light on the history of the african church  after the church had triumphed over all her enemies the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering a convenient distance of time or place gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs whose wounds had been instantly healed whose strength had been renewed and whose lost members had miraculously been restored were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every difficulty and of silencing every objection the most extravagant legends as they conduced to the honor of the church were applauded by the credulous multitude countenanced by the power of the clergy and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history  the vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment number of martyrs of pain and torture are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an artful orator that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more distinct and stubborn kind the number of persons who suffered death in consequence of the edicts published by diocletian his associates and his successors the recent legendaries record whole armies and cities which were at once swept away by the undistinguishing rage of persecution the more ancient writers content themselves with pouring out a liberal effusion of loose and tragical invectives without conderscending to ascertain the precise number of those persons who were permitted to seal with their blood their belief of the gospel from the history of eusebius it may however be collected that only nine bishops were punished with death and we are assured by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of palestine that no more than ninetytwo christians were entitled to that honorable appellation eusebius de martyr palestin c    he closes his narration by assuring us that these were the martyrdoms inflicted in palestine during the whole course of the persecution the vth chapter of his viiith book which relates to the province of thebais in egypt may seem to contradict our moderate computation but it will only lead us to admire the artful management of the historian choosing for the scene of the most exquisite cruelty the most remote and sequestered country of the roman empire he relates that in thebais from ten to one hundred persons had frequently suffered martyrdom in the same day but when he proceeds to mention his own journey into egypt his language insensibly becomes more cautious and moderate instead of a large but definite number he speaks of many christians  and most artfully selects two ambiguous words  and  which may signify either what he had seen or what he had heard either the expectation or the execution of the punishment having thus provided a secure evasion he commits the equivocal passage to his readers and translators justly conceiving that their piety would induce them to prefer the most favorable sense there was perhaps some malice in the remark of theodorus metochita that all who like eusebius had been conversant with the egyptians delighted in an obscure and intricate style see valesius ad loc  as we are unacquainted with the degree of episcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at that time it is not in our power to draw any useful inferences from the former of these facts but the latter may serve to justify a very important and probable conclusion according to the distribution of roman provinces palestine may be considered as the sixteenth part of the eastern empire when palestine was divided into three the praefecture of the east contained fortyeight provinces as the ancient distinctions ofnations were long since abolished the romans distributed the provinces according to a general proportion of their extent and opulence  and since there were some governors who from a real or affected clemency had preserved their hands unstained with the blood of the faithful ut gloriari possint nullum se innocentium peremisse nam et ipse audivi aliquos gloriantes quia administratio sua in hac part fuerit incruenta lactant institut divin v     it is reasonable to believe that the country which had given birth to christianity produced at least the sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of galerius and maximin the whole might consequently amount to about fifteen hundred a number which if it is equally divided between the ten years of the persecution will allow an annual consumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs allotting the same proportion to the provinces of italy africa and perhaps spain where at the end of two or three years the rigor of the penal laws was either suspended or abolished the multitude of christians in the roman empire on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicial sentence will be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons since it cannot be doubted that the christians were more numerous and their enemies more exasperated in the time of diocletian than they had ever been in any former persecution this probable and moderate computation may teach us to estimate the number of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the important purpose of introducing christianity into the world  we shall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth which obtrudes itself on the reluctant mind that even admitting without hesitation conclusion or enquiry all that history has recorded or devotion has feigned on the subject of martyrdoms it must still be acknowledged that the christians in the course of their intestine dissentions have inflicted far greater severities on each other than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels during the ages of ignorance which followed the subversion of the roman empire in the west the bishops of the imperial city extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the latin church the fabric of superstition which they had erected and which might long have defied the feeble efforts of reason was at length assaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics who from the twelfth to the sixteenth century assumed the popular character of reformers the church of rome defended by violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud a system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscriptions wars massacres and the institution of the holy office and as the reformers were animated by the love of civil as well as of religious freedom the catholic princes connected their own interest with that of the clergy and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of spiritual censures in the netherlands alone more than one hundred thousand of the subjects of charles the fifth are said to have suffered by the hand of the executioner and this extraordinary number is attested by grotius grot annal de rebus belgicis l i p    edit fol  a man of genius and learning who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contending sects and who composed the annals of his own age and country at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the means of intelligence and increased the danger of detection if we are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of grotius it must be allowed that the number of protestants who were executed in a single province and a single reign far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three centuries and of the roman empire but if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the weight of evidence if grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and sufferings of the reformers frapaolo istoria del concilio tridentino l iii reduces the number of belgic martyrs to  0000 in learning and moderation frapaolo was not inferior to grotius the priority of time gives some advantage to the evidence of the former which he loses on the other hand by the distance of venice from the netherlands  we shall be naturally led to inquire what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and imperfect monuments of ancient credulity what degree of credit can be assigned to a courtly bishop and a passionate declaimer who under the protection of constantine enjoyed the exclusive privilege of recording the persecutions inflicted on the christians by the vanquished rivals or disregarded predecessors of their gracious sovereign  end of the second volume
