  hans sloane praeses censores joannes hawys thomas west gulielmus stukeley georgius wharton   a treatise of the urinary passages  containing their description powers and uses together with the principal distempers that affect them in particular the stone of the kidneys and bladder as delivered at the gulstonian lecture in the theater of the royal college of physicians london on the   th   th and   th days of march         by william rutty m d fellow of the said college or the royal society and reader of anatomy at surgeonshall  illustrated with copper plates  london printed for tho worrall at the judgeshead over against st dunstans church fleet street mdccxxvi  to sir hans sloane bart president of the royal college of physicians london etc sir the publication of the following lecture read by your command is owing in great measure to the request of several of the faculty and others who heard it but chiefly to your desire which as soon as communicated bore with me the authority of a command for he who by his own labors has brought so much honor to the profession in general has an undoubted right i think to that of every member in the particular body of which he is the head accordingly i have ventured to expose it to public censure which from the many defects in it i take for granted will be severe enough however i dared not do even this without first putting it under your patronage well knowing that if you pronounce favorably upon it who from your extensive knowledge and large experience are so deservedly eminent the generality will soften their reflections  you cannot be surpised sir that i should be desirous of your protection if you will but reflect on your merit and the character you bear in the world one who has made all nature his study has outgone the most emulating of his cotemporaries both at home and abroad bears such a sway in the physical world without caballing for a reputation or using the low methods too frequently taken to raise one must surely be a desirable patron and if this pittance of a performance happens to please you as much in the reading as it to do upon hearing it i flatter my self that it will meet with your approbation  in discourses of this sort much novelty is not to be expected the design of them being to set before the audience in a clear light and narrow compass the stated rules and established laws of the science they treat of as well as to communicate what may have occurred to private observation if therefore the description of the parts is just their uses and powers properly ascertained the distempers incident to them rightly investigated it is sufficient this will answer the design of the founder which if i have succeeded in it will be lucky if any thing is advanced besides that may be of use to the students of the science i shall be very well pleased and if the performance upon the whole is not so mean as to be a disgrace to that learned body of which i am a member and whose honor i hold in the greatest estimation i shall be fully satisfied  the two first sections of this lecture with the first part of the third were finished four years ago upon receiving your orders for undertaking it the last upon the stone of the bladder has been added since to make the subject more complete such as it is i now offer it to you as a token of my respect being  sir your very humble servant william rutty  a treatise of the urinary passages etc sect i in pursuance to the institution of this lecture which obliges me to read upon some particular parts of the body and upon two or more distempers that are incident to such parts i have pitched upon those that are formed for the separation of the urine or are immediately subservient to it afterward in its passage out of the body which i have taken more out of necessity than choice the most considerable organs having been treated of already by some of our learned members whose notions and observations i cannot pretend to amend to this purpose it is necessary before i enter upon the diseases that affect them to give an anatomical description of the vrinary passages and to enquire into the nature of the fluid secreted by them and flowing through them as the knowledge of these will lead us to the uses and powers peculiar to each and thereby inform us in great measure by what means they become so altered and vitiated as to produce the distempers we shall give an account of and by such a method as i take it the dr gulston founders design will be best answered in ordering this lecture to be read over a human body  the first then that are concerned and present themselves to our inspection are the kidneys which as is commonly known are situate in a duplicature of the peritonaeum one on each side the right between the liver and the musculus lumbaris or psoas the left between the spleen and the same muscle on that side in human subjects the right is placed lower than the left in order to make more room for the large viscus of the liver as in brutes frequently the contrary not only as the prone situation of their bodies does not require such a position the liver in them projecting forwards and downwards and thence leaving a greater space for the right kidney but because these animals being very voracious their stomachs are often so distended with food that it was necessary to place the left kidney lower to prevent its being compressed by this organ together with the spleen during so great a distension  the kidneys are covered with two coats or membranes the exterior of which is borrowed from the peritonaeum and envelops them but loosely generally abounding with fat which not only lubricates their surface but forms a proper nidus wherein they lay secure from the pressure and action of the circumjacent parts their interior or proper coat is only a production of the outer integument of the blood vessels for which reason it adheres closely to their surface tho not so firmly but it may be separated from it without any considerable laceration of their substance  they are connected to different parts in order either to keep them in their just situation or to communicate their proper fluids to each other the tunica adiposa strongly affixes them to the loins and prevents their falling down into the cavity of the abdomen which would occasion the sides of the emulgent vessels to collapse at their orifices next the great blood vessels and thereby take off any communication between them and the kidneys as a farther security the right is sometimes connected to the liver sometimes to the intestinum caecum and the left to the colon and spleen they communicate with the aorta and vena cava by means of the emulgents and arteria and vena adiposa and have a near relation to the bladder by means of the vreters  they have nerves from the intercostals and spinal marrow which together form the plexus renalis though very few in number and their twigs very small seeming only designed to be subservient to the other vessels that are immediately employed in the secretion of urine but they are pretty plentifully stocked with lymphaticks some of which coming out of their concave side and making several anastomoses in various places are at lengh inserted into a gland in human bodies and thence carry the lymph to the receptaculum chyli whilst others arising from their gibbose side form a double trunk one of which creeping upwards the other downwards along their back and both making a flexure toward the emulgent vessels terminate likewise in a gland and thence proceed to the same receptacle these lymphaticks spring from so minute an origin that it escapes the eye though assisted by the best microscope which has occasioned variety of conjectures concerning them but nucks experiments nuckii adenographia cap   p     from whom i have taken this account not being able my self to trace their beginning have taught us that they arise from the capillary branches of the emulgent arterties for by blowing into this artery the flatus easily passed into these ducts and distended them as this experiment demonstrates the communication between these vessels it at the same time gives us an insight into the use of the lymphaticks of these parts which is to receive and carry off the lymph from the blood brought for the nourishment of the kidney as the urinary tubes receive the excrementitious parts or the urine  we come now to the body of the kidneys whose external superficies in adults is uniform and even but in infants rough and unequal being divided as it were into distinct lobes which has made several imagine the kidney to be composed of a number of conglomerate glands but its inward structure has occasioned a great variety of opinions vid aristotle galen vesalius fallopius highmore veslingius bartholin suitable to the philosophy in vogue at the time the authors wrote concerning them to examine which is now altogether needless because the modern improvements in anatomy have demonstrated them to be so many fictions of learned men it will however be worth while to take notice that the great hippocrates lib de glandulis observing the matter contained in the glands to be white and resembling phlegm or pituita ascribes a use to them of receiving any redundancy of moisture in the body which by the peculiar sponginess of their substance they attract and accordingly tells us that the kidneys abounding with much humidity have glands and these larger than in any other part from this description of the largeness of these glands it is certain hippocrates did not say this from observing the inward structure of the kidneys but from reflecting on the quantity of urine proceeding from them which according to his notion must have glands proportionably large to attract and percolate it but however what he concluded from his penetrating sagacity laid a good foundation for farther anatomical inquiries into their make which it is a wonder were attended for so many ages after him with so little success excepting only by aretaeus who says the same thing lib   de causis etc auctorum morborum cap   id diuturnorum morb cap    and indeed i must say thus much for the honor of this great father of physic tho it has been endeavored to make us believe the contrary that even in this knowing age blackmore s preface to his essay on the smallpox whoever will take the pains to read him and has the proper requisites to understand him will find gains worthy of his labor and upon many accounts become the better physician for it  the first author who gives a description of all the constituent parts of the kidney that comes near the fact is bartholomaeus eustachius a scholar and cotemporary of vesalius he observes that in some animals as bulls bears etc the kidneys have glands which appear very conspicuous both in the exterior and interior part of them but that in human bodies these glandulous substances are found in the inmost part of the kidney only de renum structura cap    and are placed in that particular part of it where the branches of the vreter terminate covering the extremity of each branch which glands being divided lengthways certain furrows or little channels may be perceived like so many small hairs through which he does not doubt but that the urine percolates id cap    this account has a very near resemblance of their real structure but at the same time it proves that he mistook the carunculae papillares for glands as he did the interstices between the urinary ducts for channels to convey the urine for he does not admit of any tubes for this purpose but in opposition to some who imagined these small filaments might be so many minute vessels he gives it as his opinion that they are only furrows elegantly engraved in the substance of the kidney id cap      these mistakes are rectified by bellini who was the first discoverer of the vrinary ducts though very likely the former author gave him the hint and has also shown from whence they spring and how they are propagated de structura ren p     from what has been wrote by him and from reiterated inspections and experiments since his time it appears that the substance of the kidney is only a congeries of blood vessels and excretory ducts wrapped up in one common covering tab i for the emulgent artery which goes off from the trunk of the aorta ig i in its progress toward the kidney divides first into two branches and these again into two three and sometimes four more which pierce the concave side of it when they immediately disperse themselves between the coats of the pelvis these at their exit from hence send off smaller branches which being incurvated and meeting each other form several anastomoses from these toward the gibbose part of the kidney arise still more minute ramifications which are propagated to the outer superficies and by their different convolutions and contortions there form a sort of network fig ii not unlike a ball of silk but before their ultimate branches lose their form and assume that of excretory ducts they change their circular progress into a serpentine one ruysch thesaur   p     from the extremities of these capillary arterial branches arise the veins which being divided into the like ramifications tho differently modified are enclosed in one common capsula with the artery and accompany it throughout the whole kidney going out where the artery enters and terminating in the cava in some brutes of the catkind this vein is differently disposed for instead of accompanying the artery within the kidney it propagates its branches upon the surface as you may see in some very curious preparations of mr ranbys here given fig v   next within these appears a number of small filaments which look like fleshy fibers but are really membranous and hollow and agree with other excretory ducts both in substance and use these were first found out by bellini and are therefore called tubuli belliniani fig iii they seem so spring from the sides of the capillary arteries and extending themselves in a right line toward the center or pelvis of the kidney are collected at their extremities into twelve classes and form the papillae which are nothing else but the endings of these ducts so collected together and not glands as eustachius supposed the remaining part of the kidney is possessed by a dilatation of the vreter which forms the pelvis and then sends off twelve branches called fistulae membranaceae which join the papillae and have fat interspersed between each of them for the lubrication of their substance  this disposition and communication of the vessels in the kidneys easily appears by blowing into the emulgent artery or injecting a colored liquor into it which will not only very much distend the whole but will pass into the emulgent veins the tubes just mentioned and sometimes the vreter it self  but besides this aggregate of vessels the accurate malpighius has observed a considerable number of exceeding small bodies of a round figure like the eggs of fish which are annexed to the ends of the arteries and placed between them and the tubuli vrinarii to the last of which they are likewise joined by their proper excretory ducts and correspond to them in number and which upon filling the emulgent artery with ink will also he says appear tinged with it and their adhesion to the capillary branches thereby discovered de renibus cap    this has occasioned anatomists to differ about the structure of this part of the kidney malpighius will have these appearances to be distinct glands and the immediate instruments of the secretion of urine  the curious dr ruysch absolutely denies that there are any such vesicular bodies in this part and confirms his judgment by repeated injections which discovered the immediate continuity of the arteries and urinary ducts without any intervening substance thesaur   page        he acknowledges indeed to have observed certain round diaphanous bodies in the middle of the kidney but they were not in number sufficient to answer the ends assigned id page     and even these vanished upon injection and consequently could not be glands thesaur   p        the question between them then is not whether there are glands in the kidney for they both allow that but concerning the intimate structure of that particular part of them which is the immediate separating organ the one being of opinion that the blood is altered or in other words the urine is secreted in these membranous follicles which afterward empty themselves through their own proper excretory ducts into those of bellini the other that there are none such and if there were yet that they are not distinct glands but that the percolation is simply made by the orifices of the bellinian ducts themselves  if it be lawful in this place to enter into the nicer parts of anatomy we may observe that dr ruyschs assertions are very much confirmed by several preparations of this part in which the spherical bodies that seemed to be so many glands before they were injected appear after it to be only the convolutions of the capillary branches of the emulgent artery which the injected liquor subtly permeates and passes directly thence into the tubuli vrinarii this is more easily seen in the kidneys of infants which are the properest for this purpose because they are of a looser contexture and divided in a manner into clusters of glands so that if these membranous follicles would appear at all they would in such subjects whether as some will have it the injection at the same time it fills these vesiculae does not introduce such a confusion by enlarging their dimensions and making them press against one another on all sides that the exceeding thin membranes which compose them cannot be distinguished from the injected matter it self is not so easy absolutely to be determined nor whether from the distension it makes in the vessel it flows through it may not compress such others as lie contiguous and are not injected at the same time it makes the one visible totally obliterating the other but it is not likely that it produces such effects because in other preparations of this sort we find that it discovers the natural contexture of the part which renders dr ruyschs notion more certain and probable  however admitting there are such membranous bladders where malpighius has placed them which the favorers of this assertion strenuously contend for from the regular appearances in his different experiments malpighii epist ad spon p     and from other observations of their own especially upon morbid kidneys in which they have been found pretty large and turgid with urine when the urinary ducts have been obstructed memoires d academie des sciences ann   0  p  0  yet that they are distinct glands and the proper secretory organs of the urine is no way agreeable to nature in other parts of the like kind because wherever we find these follicles with their own proper investing membranes and excretory ducts they dont perform the office of a gland but are only appendages of it or receptacles to contain the fluid already separated by the gland till it is proper to discharge it into some common outlet analogous to the vesiculae seminales gallbladder and such like and by the way in this consists one difference in the composition of the glands of the body that those glands which secret a liquor that is afterward to be discharged from them at distant intervals as occasions require are furnished with these membranous follicles into which the separating canal empties its contents which are reserved there for that purpose such are the mamillary glands those of the stomach and guts and several other in different parts of the body as on the contrary those glands which separate a fluid that is continually to flow from them to some other part have no such provision within their substance neither do they want it of which sort are the brain the testicles several of the conglomerate kind and the kidneys this distinction founded upon the strictest inquiries may in some degree decide the controversy now depending between anatomists concerning the peculiar make of these bodies borhaave de fabrica glandularum  for both are in the right when they confine their assertions to particular glands as they both err when they expend them to the whole genus but to return  the remaining part of the kidneys as before observed is possessed by a dilatation of the vreters which make the pelvis these at their exit from hence contract their dimensions and form each of them a small tube which runs with a tortuous inflexion to the bladder fig v they are naturally of the bigness of a goosequill but are capable of being distended to a much greater size as is evident in some calculous cases of which sort i have seen two remarkable instances where their orifices were so enlarged that upon injecting the bladder in order to perform the high operation of cutting for the stone the water passed into the very pelvis of the kidney so that the bladder was never distended which appeared to be the case upon dissection they are of unequal diameters in different parts of them being contracted and dilated alternately throughout their whole lenth and not in that single part only where they descend over the iliack arteries according to the common opinion this appears by making a ligature at one end of the vreter and after having inflated it closing the other extremity and letting it dry hence morgagni adversar   animadvers    rightly infers that this alternate contraction and dilatation proceeds from their natural conformation to which i may add for a particular design too which will presently appear and not only because their sides are compressed by the pulsation of the iliack arteries which mr cowper assigns as the sole cause of this inequality of their dimensions cowpens appendix tab iv   they are composed of three coats which make them more than ordinary thick in proportion to the space they enclose and enable them the better to resist the weight of the distended intestines and in women the vterus likewise which might otherwise so compress them as to hinder the transflux of urine anatomists particularly describe the substance of these coats and call the outer membranous the middle muscular and the innermost nervous but upon the nicest inspection there is no such distinction appears but the whole seems to be a thick nervous membrane in the inside of which are placed diverse small glands that emit a mucus to guard them from the salts of the urine  they are inserted into the bladder very obliquely after having passed about a fingers breadth between its coats and are remarkably contracted at the place of their opening into it they are furnished with arteries and veins from the trunks of the aorta and vena cava and have nerves from the intercostals and spinal marrow which last render them extremely sensible and occasion that excessive pain upon any forcible distention  in the common course of nature there is only one vreter to each kidney but sometimes she furnishes both of them with two when unavoidable necessity requires such a deviation from her general rules double vreters have been often observed but seldom to both kidneys as in the preparation following tab ii in which may be observed fig i that there are two vreters arising distinctly the one above the emulgent vessels the other below them which running separately almost their whole course are at length conjoined just at their penetrating the outward coat of the bladder and there forming one tube terminate in a single orifice as usual  such an extraordinary provision in this subject was absolutely necessary from the uncommon structure of the kidneys in which the fistulae membranaceae do not discharge themselves into one common pelvis but into two distinct ones which not communicating with each other but being separated by the substance of the kidney it was requisite that each should be furnished with its proper vreter to carry off the urine sent into it  we come now to the grand receptacle of the urine the bladder this is situate in the pelvis of the abdomen between a duplicature of the peritonaeum the outer lamella covering its forepart the inner passing over its fundus and covering the hinder it is composed of three coats the outer is a covering of the peritonaeum the middle is muscular and made up partly of longitudinal and partly of fibers variously intersecting each other the inner is nervous in which are placed several glands that separate an unctuous matter to defend it from the acrimony of the urine this coat is capable of very great distention but not having a power of contracting its dimensions as the two others have it is therefore when not distended and the bladder empty corrugated in several places  the middle coat is placed by anatomists among the muscles tab iii fig i and named detrusor vrinae from its office but it is not easy to apprehend how the contraction of this muscle should produce such an effect as it is commonly described since its longitudinal fibers having no fixed point whence they spring but terminating at each end in the lower orifice of the bladder they would rather pull up the neck of it when they contract themselves fig i ii than bring the fundus downwards dr douglas among his other curious preparations of this part has one which gives us a different but the true disposition of these longitudinal fibers whence he found that they arise from the inner and lower part of the os pubis and the fore part of the prostata and passing from thence over the fundus of the bladder come down the hinder part of it and are inserted into the back part of this gland and that these fibers are ranged in the manner that accurate anatomist has described the two annexed preparations plainly show which have been made for that purpose since his communicating this his discovery to me for which i take this opportunity publicly to return him thanks as well as for several others that are well worthy observation and when he thinks proper to oblige the public with them will appear very much to his honor analogous to the prostata in women is the vagina vteri in which the fibers terminate as this muscle is so disposed we easily see that by its contraction the fundus of the bladder will be pulled forwards and downwards toward the os pubis by the longitudinal fibers at the same time that the oblique ones lessen its dimensions and so both together will exclude the urine  the bladder has three orifices one external for the exit of the urine and two internal for its admission where the vreters open into it fig iii from each of these latter morgagni has observed in both sexes that there proceeds a small but pretty thick and compact fleshy body which passing from the vreters obliquely downwards on the back part of the bladder and being somewhat protuberant within its neck joins its fellow and both together make an angle at their juncture from whence in males a line is extended downwards as far as the caput gallinaginis these bodies he takes to be a production of the vreters themselves and with very good reason for by depressing them with your fingers the mouths of the vreters contract and are closed adversar   page    the bladder is divided into two parts the fundus and the neck the former of which is the larger part which rests upon the intestinum rectum in men but in women upon the vagina vteri the neck is the smaller which is much more contracted and longer in men than in that sex at the bottom of this is placed a small muscle of circular fibers called the sphincter which prevents the involuntary emission of urine  the neck of the bladder is fixed behind to the rectum in men in women to the vagina and before in both to the os pubis by means of the peritonaeum its fundus is tied above to the navel by the vrachus degenerated into a ligament but besides this connection to these different parts dr bohn a professor of leipswick near fifty years ago observed another particular adhesion of the bladder which is that the greater part of the fundus in human bodies adheres to or is continuous on the forepart of it to the peritonaeum and muscles of the abdomen and upon this consideration and because this part of the bladder is not merely membranous but muscular also throughout its whole extent he admonishes us not at all to despair of wounds made in it inasmuch as the muscles peritonaeum and bladder being thus continuous to each other their fibers will grow together and all of em unite in one common cicatrix provided proper care is taken in the dressing and the wound not dilated with tents as he and the surgeons attending observed in a student about six years before oeconom animal progymnas    page      stalpart vander wiel who wrote his observations about that time has taken notice of the same thing centur   observat     and how near they both come to the truth our surgeons are now sufficiently informed of since mr douglas upon much the same principles has introduced a successful operation for extracting the stone out of the bladder above the os pubis by making an incision into this very part lithotomia douglassiana sect   page     but to go on the bladder has arteries and veins from the epigastricks and iliacks and nerves from the two plexuses in the pelvis made out of the branches of the par vagum and the nerves of the os sacrum  adjoining to the neck of the bladder is the vrethra which in men makes a curvature of about four inches in length under the os pubis and is extended underneath and between the corpora cavernosa penis to the end of the glands its substance is partly spongious and partly nervous but as it relates to the emission of urine in which circumstance only we consider it here we need only take notice of its inward membrane fig iv this is extremely soft and of exquisite sense the upper part of it is perforated in several places by the mouths of several small ducts which lie immediately upon it and run lengthways commencing about a thumbs breadth from the glans and ending about the breadth of seven or eight inches from it these ducts probably come from some small glands placed within the body of the vrethra and the liquor they separate is the same color and consistence with that separated by mr cowpers glands though the use of it seems rather to defend the cavity of the vrethra from the sharpness of the urine than to lubricate it for the freer passage of the seed which is the principal office of the others because the same are found in the vrethra of women over and above the lacunae where they can contribute nothing in coitu  the vrethra is likewise furnished with a muscle fig v which is serviceable to it as a urinary vessel and called from its office accelerator vrinae this arises fleshy from the upper part of the vrethra on both sides as it passes under the ossa pubis and encompassing the bulb meets on its inferior part where having run along a little way in the peritonaeum it divides its self and makes two tendinous insertions into the sides of the corpora cavernosa penis  as to the disposition and structure of the other parts of this tube as the corpora cavernosa the glandulae mucosae of mr cowper philosophical transactions no      the lacunae of de graaf de mulier organis cap   page      etc they relate to it as it is an instrument of generation and not as a conduitpipe to the urine and are therefore foreign to the subject in hand we shall only take notice in general that it has arteries and veins from the hypogastricks and in women from the pudenda and is furnished with nerves from those of the os sacrum  before we finish this section it will be proper to take notice of the glandulae renales because most anatomists have fancied that they contribute something to the kidneys in performing their office for they are situate so near each other that the membranes which invest them both externally are connected very fast together and in a foetus these bodies lie so contiguous that they seem at first sight to be the same these glands are about an inch broad and two long but much bigger proportionably in children and in a foetus near as big as the kidneys themselves but they dont increase in proportion with other parts within they have a pretty large sinus which the late dr tyson by blowing into found to empty themselves into two veins whereof the right passed immediately into the cava the left into the emulgent philosophical transactions no      they have arteries from the emulgents sometimes from the aorta itself but their excretory ducts could never be found and therefore the use of these glands has not been ascertained till very lately valsalva observed them which he says descend to the testicles in men but in women are sent to the ovaria and are therefore instrumental in generation id no      this has put several upon inspecting these bodies more narrowly but to no purpose for none such appeared however mr ranby has discovered instead of them two spermatick arteries never taken notice of before which very probably are what valsalva took for excretory ducts id no      for the description of the disposition and progress of both are very much alike and we all know that the smaller arteries in dead bodies appear white like those vessels these arteries are near as big as the seminal that on the right springs from the aorta about a fingers breadth above the seminal first sending off a large branch to the glandula renalis and then another which being enclosed in the same common capsula with the spermatick artery and vein descends along with them to the testicle that on the left is propagated in the same manner only sometimes it arises from the aorta sometimes from the emulgent but notwithstanding this discovery we are still as much at a loss for the use of these glands as ever for though these arteries distribute a branch both to them and the testicles yet there is nothing communicated from one to the other upon that account an that they separate a liquor for diluting the venal blood which is too thick after its being robbed of its aqueous parts by the filter of the kidneys as is the opinion of some does not appear altogether rational for if this was their office why are they so very large in a foetus where there is so little urine secreted what morgagni hints upon this subject appears much more probable that they are lymphatick glands and of the same nature with those placed near the receptaclum chyli and the beginning of the thoracick duct namely continually to pour forth a liquor through their lymphatick vessels in order either to dilute the chyle or to keep open and lubricate the passages and this may agree with their extraordinary bulk in foetuses since in them there is either no chyle and therefore a greater quantity of lymph is necessary to keep these viae lacteae open or if there is it is in so small a quantity and at the same time not acted upon by the diaphragm that more lymph is required to carry it through these ducts into the subclavian vein adversar o animaders   p      i have now gone through the anatomy of the parts in which i have taken notice of every late discovery that is confirmed by inspection and which dont commonly occur in authors some may reckon these among the minutiae of anatomy but then these minutiae are not only the immediate instruments of action but also the latent niduses of the grand distempers incident to these parts the searching these out therefore cannot be useless as they will lead us to the knowledge of the powers peculiar to each and to the rise and nature of these distempers themselves which i hope will appear in the sequel of this lctre  section ii of the uses and powers of the urinary organs we come now to inquire into the uses of the organs described and into the powers with which they respectively act upon the fluids that pass through their cavities that the general use of them is to separate the urine from the blood and to promote its passage afterward out of the body appears prima facie upon dissecting these several parts but the manner how this separation is performed has been very little understood by all the ancient writers as well as by many of the more modern ones which has occasioned this action to be attributed to different causes as that the urine was secreted from the blood by means of digestion van helmont  that the aqueous serum was precipitated from the cruor by a peculiar ferment residing in the kidneys sylvii praxis med lib   cap    du hamel de affect corpor lib   cap    that the blood was disposed to part with its serosity by a ferment that put it into fusion willis pharmaceut part   sect   cap    and that the kidneys separated the aqueous parts from the rest by an attractive power inherent in their substance galen de usu part lib   cap   and    the bare recital of which in this age is sufficient to show that they have no existence in this part of the animal economy  it will not however be amiss before we explain the nature of this secretion to premise that bellini and professor boerhaave though both of them reject these hypotheses have notwithstanding fallen into a mistake about this affair for the first imagines that the blood when arrived at the extremities of the emulgent arteries is extravasated through their patent orifices into a small space that lays between them and the origination of the tubuli vrinarii and emulgent veins the former receiving the urinous parts the latter the refluent blood by means of the different configuration of their orifices whereas it is not only evident to sense from injecting the kidney that the urinary ducts spring immediately from the extreme branches of of the artery but it is demonstrable likewise from the nature of fluids that the orifices of these vessels cannot be different in figure because the pressure of all liquors being constantly perpendicular to the sides of the containing vessels these will hereby be every where distended equally that is they must be circular bellini de structura renum page      the blood indeed is previously disposed for a particular secretion by the peculiar attrition of its parts and the pressure it undergoes in the various complications and contortions of the arteriolae of the gland whereby it is determined to part with such particles as are adapted to the orifices of of the secerning canals which will be impingd upon them with a certain velocity and as these complications and contortions are vastly different in different glands there will hence arise a variety of secretions in these bodies but that the orifices of the secretory ducts must be circular though their dimensions differ in different glands is evident from the necessary effects of fluids upon yielding vessels as they run through them and by the way the whole doctrine of secretion depends upon the particular contexture and disposition of the arterial branches of the gland the velocity with which the blood is impingd upon the orifices of the separating canals and the diameters of the orifices themselves  the last author has erred by concluding that the secretion of the urine is performed two ways the one more simple by the immediate percolation of the urinous parts through the bellinian ducts the other more complexd by the assistance of distinct glands whereas there are no such bodies in his sense of that word to be found in the kidneys boerhavei institut no       the separation of this liquor then from the blood is performed by a very simple piece of mechanism arising only from the structure of the kidneys and some properties of the blood circulating through them for from the description of the constituent parts of these organs already given it appears that the blood by the force of the heart is propelld through the various ramifications and convolutions of the emulgent arteries till it comes to the orifices of the bellinian ducts which are the separating canals but these not being capable from the smallness of their diameters of admitting the whole heterogeneous mass but only such parts of it as are proportionate to them these only will be received whilst the grosser compound will circulate through the more patent originations of the emulgent veins to be returned by them into the vena cava now the aqueous part of the blood consisting of much the smallest particles of it and the salts of the blood having a close union with the watery part as being dissolved in it these will first pass through the orifices of the secretory vessels and the secernd fluid will consequently for the most part consist of these principles which that the urine does will presently appear  the urine thus separated flows through these ducts to the papillae and is discharged by them into the fistulae mebranaceae which convey it to the pelvis this cavity though different from what nature practices in other glandulous parts the excretory ducts of such generally terminating in one large common duct without any cavity interposed yet is absolutely necessary from the figure of the kidney for this making a considerable segment of a circle in which the urinary tubes are propagated in great numbers from the circumference toward the center if they had opened there at once in a duct of a small diameter their orifices would have been brought so close to one another and with directions so opposite as necessarily to have hindered several of them from discharging their contents or at best have rendered such discharge very irregular which is prevented by this basin whereby their orifices are removed farther from the center and one another and the discharge rendered thereby equal and uniform  from hence the urine descends through the vreters into the bladder but whether by its own gravity or whether it is forwarded in its course by the action of these tubes has not yet been determined some verheyen anatom tractat   cap    dionis anatom demonstrat   anatomists of great note have inferred from the substance and disposition of their investing coats that they are not merely passive and barely afford a passage to the urine but that they are endud with a sort of peristaltick motion which promotes its descent into the bladder in brutes indeed this action of the vreters seems somewhat needful by reason of the horizontal situation of their bodies the urine not flowing downwards as in men and consequently its weight contributing little or nothing to its motion but in men there is no such necessity for this action because the urine will descend of course from the erect position of these tubes on the other hand i am apt to think that the course of the urine in us rather requires a check than a spur in order to prevent its coming too violently into the bladder which would create an uneasy sensation and that for this reason nature has made the vreters of unequal dimensions in different parts of them and has remarkably contracted their orifices at their opening into the bladder that they might be so many impediments to any sudden influx but besides this consideration it is still more probable that they want this power because these tubes contrary to all other parts that have muscular fibers when once they are forcibly distended never resume their former dimensions as is observed in hard drinkers and in nephritick cases ruysch thesaur no   p     which they would do if they enjoyed a peristaltick motion but to proceed  the urine is received from the vreters by the bladder and is prevented from regurgitating into them by the contraction of their orifices and the obliquity of their insertion here it remains till by its quantity and acrimony it distends and stimulates its inmost coat which causes the muscular coat to contract its fibers and act strongly upon it the two corpora carnosa of morgagni shortening their fibers at the same time and so straitening the orifices of the vreters that none should escape that way by this pressure and that of the abdominal muscles the urine is protruded downwards with a force sufficient to overcome the sphincter of the bladder and to carry it through the vrethra some distance from the body but lest any part of it should stay in this tube when the pressure ceases and the sphincter is closed the accelerator muscle begins to act which expels any remains that lodge therein  the force with which the bladder acts in projecting the urine has been attempted to be fixed by two speculative mathematicians but their calculations are widely different the one making it amount to an uncommon weight whilst the other reduces it to a trifle  the late ingenious dr keil has computed it exclusive of the keils essays page    abdominal muscles to be equal to no more than three ounces which seems too inconsiderable to overcome the contranitency of the sphincter and at the same time project the urine six foot from the body in a horizontal direction for the abdominal muscles contribute very little except when we hold our breath and strain and then indeed they force strongly downwards and press upon the bladder but this calculation is very defective for not to mention what michelotti has observed that dr keil has not at all taken notice of the vis compressionis innate to all parts of the bladders internal superficies but only to that part of it which answers to a transverse section of the vrethra it is farther deficient in that he has omitted to consider the length of the vrethra from the orifice of the bladder and the friction arising therefrom which he ought to have done to make it more perfect for though the force that causes a fluid to run out at an orifice with a certain velocity is as he has laid down yet if there is a tube expended any distance from it through which the fluid must pass afterward the velocity of it at its coming out at the end of this tube will be caeteris paribus as its length and a greater force will be required for example to move a fluid with a given velocity through a tube of twelve inches long than through one of four and of the same diameter this will raise the power of the bladder somewhat higher but will scarcely yet be sufficient to throw the urine so far from the body  michelotti on the other hand de separatione fluidorum page     and seq  from mechanical deductions raises the power of the bladder to  0  lb weight but then the principle he sets out upon is false for he lays down that the force by which a fluid running out at the orifice of any canal acquires a certain velocity is equal to the weight of a cylinder of the same fluid whose basis corresponds to the orifice it flows through and whose altitude is equal to the simple altitude of the extreme superficies of the fluid above it whereas it has been demonstrated by sir isaac newton philosophiae principia lib   prop    corollar    that this force must amount to that of a cylinder of the same basis but of double the height from whence any heavy body must fall to gain such a velocity however what deduces from the principle he lays down is just and if he had proceeded in the same manner upon sir isaac newtons as he has upon his own he would have come as near as possible to the entire force of this organ the whole proposition with what he draws from it is much too long to be transcribed into a discourse of this kind i shall therefore refer you to the work it self and only observe that from hence may be seen the uncertainty even of mechanical reasoning when applied to explain some powers in the animal economy though it is the best we can make use of in this part of learning  from this cursory view of the actions of the respective parts and of the nature of the urinous secretion may be drawn some conclusions which will serve as so many answers to several queries that commonly occur among the writers of institutions for from hence we learn that the urine is not an excrement of any particular concoction as the ancients term it but that all the digestions supply matter for it because whatever is brought to the kidneys has undergone the action of the stomach has been broken and divided in its passage through the lungs by the force of respiration and from thence flows blended with the nutritious part of the blood till it is separated from it by the orifices of the urinary tubes and consequently is an excrement of all the concoctions  hence likewise we can account why we urine so frequently when we drink plentifully and particularly why this excrement is secernd in so short a time and in such large quantities after taking diuretic liquors upon an empty stomach without having recourse to any occult passages from this organ to the bladder which anatomy has never shown and which repeated observations have proved to have no existence for notwithstanding an experiment printed in the philosophical transactions somewhat favors this notion a pretty quantity of urine being found in a dogs bladder though the vreters were tied and were also a little swelled above the ligature yet on the other hand upon opening the bladders of persons dead of a suppression of urine from an obstruction of the common passages of the kidneys and vreters there never was found a drop of urine in them philosoph transact no         neither indeed is there any occasion for a shorter conveyance than what nature has made apparent for as to the frequent emissions during the time of drinking it is to be observed that before this happens the stomach the smaller intestines and the lacteal veins are replete with the potables so that the blood receives a fresh supply of a fluid from the next draught that is taken down which if i may so call it protrudes what is already contained in the vessels abovementioned into the subclavian vein the consequence of which will be that a greater quantity of blood will be brought to the kidneys than usual and therefore more urine separated and so much the more the more frequent the draughts are repeated and this is the reason why the first urine that is voided is of a higher color and bears the tokens of concoction whereas the subsequent emissions lose these signs and the urine at length flows perfectly limpid and crude which it will continue to do till this extraordinary supply has quite passed off and then it will reassume its former color etc  as to the other case where the stomach is empty and the blood is supposed to be diverted of the urinous matter in great measure if we attend to the time which fluids take up in passing from the stomach into the blood and how soon afterward they are carried to the kidneys by the rapidity of its circulation we shall find the common passages altogether sufficient  it must be considered then that though solid substances require a good deal of time to be comminuted by the stomach in order to have their parts rendered small enough to enter the lacteals yet fluids when taken alone from the minuteness of their particles are naturally fit to pass through them and from their aptitude to motion will yield to the first impression for which reason they will make no stay there but very soon be protruded by the action of the stomach and guts into these vessels and that the progress of fluids through them takes up but a very short time is demonstrated from the almost instantaneous depletion of the lacteals in living animals that have been opened for this purpose some time after a full meal when the chyle has been flowing through them so that if that part of the liquids which comes away by urine is not longer in flowing through the heart to the orifices of the urinary ducts of the kidneys than the same is in passing from the stomach to the heart the common channels will be found every way to answer these emergencies  now as the heart throws out every systole one ounce of blood and beats sixty systoles in a minute there will pass into the aorta  00 ounces in a quarter of an hour taking therefore the dimensions of the emulgent arteries which spring immediately from its trunk to be one tenth of that of the aorta which is very near the matter the quantity of blood passing through them in that time will be ninety ounces or seven pounds six ounces troy add to this that the serum makes up the greater part of the blood and at this time is in a much larger proportion from the addition of the ingested liquor and we may conclude reasonably that two or three pints of urine may be secreted from such a quantity of blood in that time and great part of it much sooner which will answer every thing that has been observed as to the quick passage of diuretics the effects of which upon this secretion either as to its quantity or quality being at the soonest more than half this time  this notion of an immediate passage from the stomach to the bladder so contrary to anatomy and the nature of the animal economy one would imagine should have been exploded at the first dissection of an human body much more now when these parts are so accurately known but it seems it is again revived and strenuously argued for morgans principles of physic land       which is the reason for inserting the foregoing paragraphs but to proceed  as a corollary to the foregoing it may be laid down that the quantity of urine ought to be proportionate to the quantity we drink for caeteris paribus the quantity of the secernd fluid is in proportion to the quantity of blood brought to the orifice of the separating canal but the quantity of the aqueous part of the blood of which the urine chiefly consists is in proportion to the ingested liquors therefore the quantity of urine will be in proportion to them likewise but here some allowance must be made for what passes off by perspiration and sweat in exspiration and with the saliva as likewise for different circumstances for example from heat or exercise the aqueous parts of the blood passing through the pores of the skin in sweat the quantity of urine will be less as on the contrary the pores of the skin being stopped by cold a larger portion than usual will be voided  as the last inference from the foregoing theory it appears that other particles besides what naturally compose the urine though of unequal surfaces one of which too may be longer than the diameter of the secretory canal may nevertheless be separated together with it provided the surface that presents it self to the orifice does not exceed its diameter and that blood it self may pass through if it is impingd with a force sufficient to distend and enlarge the secretory ducts analogous to what happens to some other vessels that are naturally smaller but ampliated for a time as in critical and symptomatical haemorrhages and in the menstrua  the doctrine laid down is so well established upon the mechanical properties of the parts concerned that it is scarce liable to any objection the main one which seems to affect it is this that seeing all the parts that constitute the urine are in the blood when it is brought to the orifices of the urinary ducts if the percolation of these from the rest only depended on their diameters they would all be secernd at the same time being of the same nature and adapted to them which is contrary to fact the refluent blood found in the emulgent veins being still possessed of some of the principles of the urine but if we consider that part of the blood is spent upon the nourishment of the kidneys and does not come to these orifices but is immediately received by the venal branches that correspond to them we shall find the reason why it still retains these principles in some degree which by the way may be separated from it in some subsequent circulation through these organs and at the same time see this objection obviated  we come now to consider the nature and properties of the urine it self this consists of a fluid substance in which are sustained several dense and solid particles the elementary or more simple parts of it are water salt and earth which are manifested to the senses in the experiments of bellini bellini de urinis page     that simple water is the fluid part of the urine almost wholly is known from a gentle evaporation of it by which means what is exhaled is found to be limpid and insipid as the purest water and the inspissated residuum after the evaporation is over is in all respects restored to the state of true urine again that is in color taste smell and consistence by pouring the same quantity of common water upon it instead of the fluid that was evaporated  the existence of a salt is proved by the taste which becomes more pungent the more the aqueous menstruum is exhaled till at length there is left a black viscid substance that liquifies in the air like common salt and is so poignant as scarce to be borne by the tongue the nature of this essential salt has not been considered by this author but by experiments we find that it is not a pure alkali as some chemists have imagined neither is it an acid but is sui generis and partakes of both qualities for if you pour spirit of nitre aquafortis or the like acid upon the urine they will only produce a somewhat higher color in it which acid spirits when mixed with either a fixed or volatile alkali always occasion a considerable ebullition so if you put a nitrous salt into the spirit of urine it will turn it milky and the like will happen if you do the same salt of tartar which experiments plainly prove this salt to have both acid and alkali in its composition but to proceed  the particles of earth in the urine are perceived by the following one if you evaporate the urine till it comes to the consistence of honey and pour upon it the same quantity of common water the artificial urine will have this in common with the natural that it will grow turbid and putrify and before its putrefaction will let fall a perfectly insipid subpallid and impalpable powder every way agreeing with elementary earth  that there is a sulphur also in the urine though overlooked by bellini is evident from the strong smell it has when only voided but chiefly from that foetidness arising from it when it is in a state of putrefaction or during evaporation though there is indeed but a small quantity of this principle because there is scarce any of it comes off in distillation  upon these three principles of water salt and earth and the different proportions they bear to each other depend in great measure the color saltness and cousistence of the urine with all the varieties observable in each if the aqueous parts more than ordinary exceed the other the urine will be limpid or pale if the salts abound too plentifully it will be of a shining flammeous color but still clear the salts being pellucid bodies if the earth prevails being an opake body it will obstruct the passage of the rays of light and produce a more intense color taking off from the clearness and pellucidness of the urine and the more so as its quantity increases in an overproportion till at length the urine will be turbid and thick  but besides these three it is reasonable to think that the natural color of the urine is owing in great measure to the sulphur contained in it for though its quantity is but small yet it still retains its color after it is separated from the other principles and will give a considerable tincture to water when mixed with it which the other principles of salt and earth will not do after their separation and yet they are allowed on all hands to contribute chiefly to its color  the different degrees of saltness in the urine arise from the different quantities of salt floating in the aqueous menstruum whose pungency upon the tongue will be greater the less fluid there is to dissolve them and obtund their spiculae and so vice versa and that the urine will be of a grosser or thinner consistence as the solid particles are in a greater or lesser degree is so evident that it wants no explanation  the contents observable in the urine which bear the names of nubeculae suspensiones and sedimenta are nothing else but these solid particles which when this compound fluid is out of the body and at rest separate from the aqueous part and take place according to their specific gravities having these appellations given them as they are found in the upper middle or lowest part of the urine but so nevertheless that the different density of these contents at one time more than another and the different resistance of the medium in which they are suspended may afterward alter their situation insomuch that what was at first a suspension may at length subside and become a sediment  the nature of the urine being thus known we may draw several inferences from it that will explain some affections common to the animal economy hence first the reason appears why upon using exercise and in hot weather the urine is of a higher color and more salt and stimulating than at other times and why the like urine is made after having abstained some time from taking any liquid for in both cases the solid contents will be in a greater proportion than the aqueous menstruum this last being carried off through the pores of the skin in the first instance as in the second a fresh supply of it being for some time taken off from the blood what is secreted by the kidneys in such circumstances will be more than ordinarily saturated with these solid principles  the foregoing observation shows the cause which makes the urine of healthy people and of a strong habit of body to have seldom the nubeculae and suspensiones found in it but the sediment more frequently because the two first consisting of the more fine and subtle parts of the solid contents pass off together with the aqueous by sweat and perspiration which the more gross and heavy particles that form the sediment cannot do by reason of their bulk and figure and therefore will be secreted by the kidneys and subside by their own gravity the same shows the near relation between the urine and sweat and that the increase of the last may supply the defect of the urinous secretion in some measure which is the reason that patients linger so long under a total suppression of urine from a stoppage in the kidneys before this ailment kills them which some times in strong bodies is eighteen or twenty days and there are several instances where the urine has been totally suppressed from the same cause for fifteen and sixteen days together and yet the patients recovered stalpart observat centur   observat      to determine the exact color and consistence the urine ought to have in healthy persons is almost impossible by reason of the great latitude that must be allowed for the difference of age constitution and diet of different persons and of these in the same at different times but seeing the two extremes of a limpid urine and of a red and turbid one are produced as either the watery menstruum or the solid contents abound beyond measure we may venture to conclude thus far that from a due portion and mixture of these in a state of perfect health there should arise a medium between these extremes which is a light yellow or citrine color as to its consistence regard being had to the foregoing circumstances it should be pretty near that of common water but somewhat more thick and heavy by reason of the solid principles contained in it  why the natural sediment should be white light and equal is more easily accounted for for seeing the fluids secreted from the blood will be as the state of the blood at the time of their secretion and the blood in a natural state is supposed always to be alike and equal to it self whatsoever parts of it are separated by the kidneys in equal times will also be alike and equal and consequently when out of the body and at rest will mutually take place by one another and render the sediment equal the whiteness of it is owing to the large quantity of salts contained in it as is manifest from the bellinian experiment de urinis page    which being united with the thick viscid parts of the urine will subside along with them and by the rules of optics produce such a color  hence in the last place we may know how far the inspection of the urine is useful in the practice of physic for by comparing the several appearances in the urine of diseased persons with those that naturally arise in it and observing in what respects they differ from each other we shall be informed in great measure of the present state of the blood as to the mixture of its parts and the proportion between them and if we take notice at the same time of all the symptoms that accompany such appearances and follow upon them we shall discover what the distemper is that proceeds from such a crasis of blood and also prognosticate the event of it  it were easy to show from authors and private observation what state of blood each alteration of the urine discovers but being confined to treat only of the distempers belonging to some particular organs it will be impertinent to take notice of any other than what will lead us to the knowledge of these which will be seen in the remaining part of this lecture  we have now gone through the uses of the parts and inquired into the nature of the urine in which last i have for the most part followed bellini in the most concise manner possible as his account of it is the best both by his experiments and the conclusions he draws from them and as the latter are here proved by different mediums from what he himself made use of they so far make them bid fairer for truth  section iii part i of a stone in the kidneys the organs of urine are incident to several indispositions in common with other parts of the like structure and composition and which spring also from the same general causes as inflammations tumors abscesses ulcers schirri etc but the most frequent and indeed chief distempers that afflict them proceed from the urine separated by them or passing through them these are attended with very untoward symptoms and if of long continuance very fatal consequences none of which are more common than those arising from a stone in the kidneys or bladder which shall therefore be the subject of the remaining part of this lecture  if we compare what has been said in the foregoing part of it concerning the elementary principles of the urine with several experiments made upon these concreted substances it will appear that the material cause of a stone in the kidney is originally in the natural composition of this fluid for we find from chemistry and microscopical observations that what we call a stone almost entirely consists of a volatile and fixed salt such as the urine plentifully abounds with in order therefore to form a calculous concretion there is no petrefaction required as the naturalists term it nor any change of substance in the constituent parts of the urine but only a separation of the saline and some earthy particles of it from the fluid and such an intimate cohesion of these solid corpuscles thereupon as not to be disunited or dissolved again by any subsequent afflux of urine upon them  both these accidents will happen if either the salts are in such great abundance in the urine that they cannot pass through the exceeding small ducts that form the papillae or if they are hindered from moving through them by any viscid matter that is separated along with them and so unites them together or if these ducts themselves are so much compressed or contracted as not to admit the salts through their cavities for in all these circumstances the saline lympha will stagnate at the papillae whereby the salts will be brought too near one another which being corpuscles of very great attractive powers they will be more strongly attracted by each other than by the fluid in which they are suspended and consequently will separate from it and unite in one solid substance  that any of these three causes may singly produce such a concrete if they exist in the degree laid down is proved from the nature of salts in general when in fluore and the consequences that must follow from their being brought too much within the sphere of each others activity more particularly from the nature of those of which the stone consists which are so very attractive that even when a calculus is reduced to a caput mortuum and beat into an impalpable powder so that it will dissolve in water yet in a short time the salts will separate from it and coagulate so strongly that though the water is heated never so intensely they will not dissolve in it again  however it is reasonable to think that a nucleus of a firm consistence is seldom formed by the first or second cause without the concurrence of the last as on the other hand that the last alone will produce one for though there should be an over large quantity of salts in the urine or if an usual quantity should be envellopd in a viscid matter yet if the urinary ducts are of a natural dimension they would not stagnate at the papillae unless these qualities were in a very great degree but would be protruded through their orifices by the force and weight of the next urine flowing upon them whereas if these ducts should be much contracted even a natural proportion of salts would stagnate there and i think it is plainly proved that a nucleus is formed more from the fault of the kidney it self than from the qualities of the urine in that one kidney only is generally affected whilst the other remains free for if the fault lay as much in the urine they would both be affected alike the urine separated by both kidneys necessarily partaking of the same qualities however that the two first are concomitant causes and very much contribute toward the generation of a stone is highly probable and it is almost certain that a sabulous sediment or what is called the gravel may owe its origin to either of these causes singly  as a farther confirmation of the truth of what has been laid down it were easy to show that the antecedent causes of a nephritick fit introduce one or both of these qualities in the urine or affect the passages of the kidneys in the manner just mentioned but as it will be troubling you with frequent repetitions of the same way of reasoning to explain how each in particular operates toward producing one or more of these effects i shall mention the chief and most common procatartick causes which are comprehended in the following observation viz that those persons who make spirituous liquors their constant drink and use them too plentifully or those who have weak stomachs or live upon food that abounds with viscid juices or those who altogether lead an unactive and sedentary life are above all others most afflicted with this distemper and that the urine of such persons must necessarily be overstockd with salts or with a tenacious viscid matter or that the channels of the kidneys will be too much straightened or compressed according as either of these causes prevail will appear upon examination   st in the first part of this observation it is to be taken notice of that all spirituous liquors abound plentifully with salts a spirit being nothing else but a large quantity of these substances suspended in a little water and oil whence from frequent drinking these liquors the blood will be overstockd with this principle but besides this from an habitual use of them in process of time the serum which is the most aqueous part of the blood will contain a large portion of a spirituous fluid and we know from experiments that a urinous salt will not dissolve in such a menstruum upon which account the quantity of salts brought into the blood with our food will be daily increased now the urine being separated principally and immediately from the serum which is over salt upon a double account must likewise from the nature of its secretion be over salt too  hence we can account why the fits of the stone are not so severe in women as in men they generally drinking less wine and feeding less upon such gross meats as abound with salts and for the same reason we may conclude that the exemption those persons enjoy from this distemper who only drink malt liquors is owing a great deal to the lesser quantity of salts in these potables than in wine   dly as an over salt urine is the consequence of the foregoing cause so from a bad digestion and viscid food the urine will be slimy and roapy for the aliment being too viscid or not sufficiently comminuted in the stomach the chyle will be more than ordinary viscid which being constantly sent into the blood will render that in some time of the same nature but over and above this the salts which are the most incorruptible part of our food being not thoroughly broken through the weakness of the digestive powers will exist in larger combinations than usual and at the same time be enclosed in a gelatinous chyle which will hold them together for which reason the blood will not only be too viscid but the salts of it will not be sufficiently dissolved in its serum whence it follows from the same reasoning as in the former that the urine must be likewise too viscid and its salts brought too near one another which will occasion them to cohere from hence it appears that galen did not altogether err when he attributed the material cause of a stone to a thick slimy and tenacious matter de renum affect  notwithstanding withstanding his notion has been rejected by several modern writers since being thus explained as a concomitant cause it is agreeable both to reason and fact  accordingly we find that children are more tormented with the stone of the bladder than adults and especially the poorer sort of them who are generally nourished with food that affords slimy and tenacious juices hippocrates ascribes one principle of the stone in children to bad milk which he says being earthy and phlegmatic will induce a lentor into the stomach and when mixed with the sediment of the urine in the bladder cohere and become solid lib de morbis   sect     much more then will the same consequences follow from cheese fish and the other coarser diet of the poor and there has been no better reason assigned why such young subjects being once cut seldom require the operation a second time than that as they grow up their diet is either altered or the digestive powers increase and the solids become stronger whereby the aliment will be more intimately divided and any viscous matter or combination of salts be broken by this means and excluded the habit by the force of labor and exercise agreeable to this is another observation of hippocrates coacae praenotiones no     that a stone is not formed in the bladder from the fourteenth to the sixty third year of age in which time we all know the digestive powers are most vigorous   dly how an unactive sedentary life which is the last procatartick cause taken notice of should bring on a straitness in the urinary passages of the kidney a competent knowledge in anatomy will inform us this teaches us that by a sedentary and bending posture of the body not only all the viscera of the abdomen but the greater blood vessels themselves will be compressed especially the emulgents and that part of the aorta and vena cava whence they go off as being placed where the flexure is greatest but this is not the only consequence for from such a position the viscera will also be forced backwards and downwards and will consequently press externally upon these vessels so that the weighty viscus of the liver on one side and the spleen on the other will as it were squeeze the kidneys which are placed between them and the musculi lumbares upon both which accounts it is no wonder if the urinary ducts that are continued from the emulgent arteries and are by much the most yielding substance and of the finest contecture should suffer most and be so straightened as to occasion the saline lympha to stagnate in them  to this cause it is owing that those tradesmen and artificers who sit much at their work are troubled with pains in their loins as rammazzini has observed de morbis artificum cap     and that nephritick complaints are almost entailed upon studious men id cap     and from the same cause it comes to pass that few people who are troubled with the gout escape these complaints at the last for although as long as the kidneys are able to do their office and transmit all the constituent parts of the urine through them these nephritick symptoms will not arise though they proceed from one common parent yet when the fits of the gout become frequent and of such long continuance as to confine the patient very often and for a great while together the consequence will be such a disposition of the kidneys as is just described and the stone will come in aid to his destruction  many other errors in the nonnaturals which are reckoned by our writers among the procatartick causes of this disease are included in the foregoing observation or may be accounted for the same way excepting an hereditary disposition which cannot be ranked amongst any of them and requires a particular explanation to its self but this is needless formally to enter upon since it is as easy to conceive that parents may communicate a parricular disposition of their solids and fluids to their offspring as that they can stamp upon them their features or tinge them with their complexion  to proceed then a nucleus thus formed in the urinary tubes of the kidney will at length by its own weight and that of the urine coming upon it be forced through the carunculae papillares into the pelvis where if it makes no long stay but is small enough to pass through the vreter into the bladder it will not occasion a nephritick paroxism but only some pain from the roughness and hardness of its substance pressing against and vellicating the extreme sensible fibers of this tube but if from its pointed surface it should chance to adhere to the pelvis or from any other accident lodge in it so long till by the addition of adventitious concretions it is rendered too big to pass through the head of the vreter without distending it a true nephritick fit will be produced  this is attended with the following diagnosticks viz a fixed pain in the region of the loins which is propagated through the whole length of the ureter and accompanied with a nausea and vomiting a numbness in the thigh and leg of the side affected and a retraction of the testicle of the same side the urine about the beginning is thin aqueous and pale and voided in small quantities and if both kidneys are affected sometimes totally suppressed but in the decline of a fit and after the stone has passed into the bladder it becomes thick and turbid and is discharged copiously very often blood flows out together with the urine which is many times in so large a quantity as easily to discover it self at others in small a one as only to tinge it of a coffee color but the most certain diagnostick and which is a pathagnomick sign is if to any of the foregoing is added a frequent excretion of sabulous matter or a small stone  besides the diagnosticks now cited for the knowledge of which the world stands indebted to hippocrates lib de intern affect sect    id lib epidemic   sect    there is another taken notice of by him which although when alone does not particularly indicate a stone in this part yet together with some of the former will assist us in making a right judgment of the distemper this is contained in one of his aphorisms and is certainly above a nurses observation though we have been lately told the contrary let her be never so old or experienced he lays it down as a maxim that when bubbles swim upon the surface of the urine they indicate nephritick disorders and a long indisposition   these diagnosticks may all appear at one time or other in the course of one paroxism but generally the symptoms are in a greater or lesser degree and sometimes one sometimes another shows it self according to the nature of the stone and the particular place where it is lodged if it as yet remains within the body of the kidney and has not entered the head of the vreter the pain will be obtuse and easily born the substance of the kidney being very sparingly furnished with nerves nay it is certain that it may lie quiet a long time without creating any remarkable inconvenience from several examples in daily practice of such a bodys being found in this part which has filled the pelvis all its branches and even possessed the greatest part of the kidney and yet the subjects from whom it was taken have labored under no very painful symptoms nor have had but very little warning before some accidental shock has unfortunately altered its position and so brought on a paroxism that ended fatally agreeable to this heurnius aphorism    sect   cap     upon opening a patient took out of one kidney seventy small stones and from the other fourscore and yet the person had never before complained of any nephritick symptoms and bonetus medicin septentrional lib   de imo ventre sect    cap   relates from anton de pozzis that he found in each kidney a stone weighing six ounces without any previous symptoms either of gravel or numbness in the loins or a diminution in the quantity of urine it flowing more copiously but limpid as water only attended with an insatiable thirst fernelii opera a heurnio edit part   lib     but when the stone moves into the head of the vreter and twitches and distracts its extreme sensible membranes the pain will be acute pungent and lancing and all the other symptoms vehemently exaggerated the vomiting will be frequent and violent because the stone irritating the branches of the intercostal nerve the par vagum will suffer by consent being intimately interwoven with the former and both together making one plexus in this part of the body hence the animal spirits will flow convulsively and in great plenty to the stomach which receives nerves from the par vagum by which means its fibers will be brought into spasmodick contractions which will forcibly throw out any contents lodged therein  there will be a numbness felt in the thigh and leg of the side affected both by reason that the psoas muscle upon which the kidney and vreter lay will be compressed by this extraneous body and forasmuch as the nerve that is sent off from the spinal marrow and is distributed through the crural muscles will undergo the like compression whence the free influx of the animal spirits into the muscles being partly taken off such a sensation will naturally arise and to the same cause together with the nerves of these parts being convulsed by the stimulus of the stone is owing that difficulty of walking upright observable in the fit  this convulsive contraction from the violence of the pain will be propagated to all the parts that lie contiguous and have any near relation to those immediately affected for which reason the peritonaeum in whose duplicative the kidney is placed and which gives an outward coat to it as also the vasa praeparantia which run between its lamellae and are furnished with nerves from the same pair that the vreters are will be considerably contracted and draw up the testicle to which they are affixed but this symptom proceeds likewise in great measure if not principally from the praeternatural shortness of the vreter at this time whereby the vas deferens which passes over it and between it and the bladder will be pulled up by the vreter and draw the testicle after it  as all these symptoms are aggravated whilst the stone remains in the vreter so they abate or altogether cease as soon as it has passed into the bladder in like manner the other concomitant signs vary according to the nature of the stone if it is so large as to plug up the orifices of the vreter or papillae and both kidneys affected the urine will be totally suppressed or if it is so big or placed in such a manner as not to give room for the solid contents to pass through the urine will be thin aqueous and limpid if the stone by its pointed surface should have lacerated the blood vessels or by its bigness very much distended the vrinary ducts as it moved through them in both cases the urine will be bloody if its cohesion is so lax as easily to be broken some of its parts will be washed away gradually by the transfluent urine or if it occasions a paroxism before it is much indurated a portion of sand adhering to its surface will be abraded by the same transflux in both which cases there will be a frequent secretion of sabulous matter and if it is of a firm consistence but small enough to move through the vreter though with the utmost difficulty it will be voided entire  but there is another reason besides this now given why the urine at the beginning of a fit should be pale and made in small quantities but in its decline become turbid and discharged copiously which at the same time has no relation to the nature of the stone and that is because this praeternatural substance irritating the kidney the tubuli vrinarii which are the separating canals will be very much contracted as lying so near the greatest force of the stimulus by which means there will not only be very little urine separated during such circumstances but likewise what is will be thinner than usual the more gross parts of it not being small enough to pass through their orifices in this contracted state or if they do will stagnate at the papillae and these effects will be propagated in some degree also to the other kidney as it is furnished with nerves from the same plexus but when the stone has moved through the vreter or the stimulus it occasions is cluded by proper remedies these small tubes will be relaxed and recover their former dimensions whereby a larger quantity of urine will be separated and those solid particles that stagnated in them washed away which mixing with the urine will make it turbid  if we reflect on the nature of these various diagnosticks we shall find that though all of them taken together are direction sufficient to pronounce the complaint to be the stone yet when considered separately many of them are equivocal and may spring from other causes and it is commonly known that the symptoms of the cholick bear so near a resemblance to many of these that it is frequently difficult to distinguish between them indeed when any of the pathognomonick signs appear as sand or small stones in the urine the cause stands confessed or if the urine is bloody and a numbness perceived in the thigh and leg we may know that it is not the cholick but when none of these show themselves the cause is still latent and must be discovered by some distinguishing characteristicks peculiar to it self these were first marked out by galen from whom all succeeding writers have borrowed or rather copied what they have wrote on this subject to whom therefore i refer the inquisitive and so much the rather because it will thence appear that some beneficial knowledge may be got from galen too though one of the ancient writers of the faculty galen de loc affect lib   cap     the symptoms likewise that arise when the kidneys are hysterically affected mimick a nephritick fit not only in the nature and situation of the pain and the exorbitant vomiting which attends it but also in the propagation of it into the vreters etc and are not easily distinguished unless from the previous disposition of the patient to one complaint more than the other or from the discharge of a porraceous matter by vomit or from the constant limpidness of the urine which in the hysteric affection continues hi the same condition all the time it lasts whereas in the other it grows higher colored and turbid a rheumatick pain in the loins produces the same effects but may be discerned from the difficulty the patient finds in raising his body from a bending posture to an erect one and the sensation arising thereupon which is as if he was cut through the middle the last i shall mention is the nephritis or genuine inflammation of the kidney which resembles a nephritick paroxism in most points but may be known from the acute fever that constantly attends it and from the reversed condition of the urine which in this disease is red and flammeous at the beginning but when the inflammation is at the greatest height it becomes aqueous and limpid whereas in the nephritick paroxism it is just the contrary  the prognostic during a paroxism is taken from the vehemence and duration of the symptoms and the different appearances that arise in the course of it which any one may foresee the consequence of who is acquainted with the reason of their appearing as to the disease in general in old people who have been harassed with many shocks of it and whose urine and kidneys have been a long time faulty it is incurable hippocrat aph   sect    according to which aretaeus has observed that it is more difficult to prevent the kidneys and bladder that are obnoxious to a calculous disposition from generating these substances than it is to make a prolifick womb barren de curatione morbor diuturn lib   cap   when it proceeds likewise from an hereditary disposition or if at the same time there is an ulcer in the kidneys sennertus lib   part   sect   cap    the same judgment is to be made and indeed at best the general prognostic is melancholy enough the most that a physician can do being to relieve the patient from a present fit and ward off another as long as he can  the indications of cure during a paroxism are to force the stone into the bladder to facilitate its passage thither by relaxing and enlarging the dimensions of the vreters that they may yield and give way to its motion to guard them against the hardness and asperity of its substance that it may not injure them in irs way and lastly to mitigate and take off the exorbitant symptoms   st the first is answered by a plentiful administration of diuretic medicines especially such as by their attenuating and detersive qualities do thin viscid humors and scour the vessels they pass through but since in the present case there is a great stricture and tension of the parts from the violence of the pain and as the stronger diuretics act with a stimulus it is unsafe to use them lest instead of forcing a passage they should contract and straiten what was too strait before the only remedies of this class then that can safely be administered with a free hand are those which at the same time they increase the quantity of the urine do by their balsamic properties and smoothness lubricate and relax the urinary passages upon which account the turpentines and balsams are of singular service in these complaints especially when blended with medicines appropriated to the next intention   dly this indicates the use of emollient lenient and anodyne remedies of which sort are oily compositions and such roots and herbs as abound with smooth mucilaginous juices which at the same time they relax the solid fibers do by their smoothness and viscosity blunt the acrimony of the humors and defend the passages from the roughness of the stone emollient clysters injected at proper intervals very much contribute to these ends both as they empty the colon of wind and excrement which distending the intestine cause it to press against the kidney and vreter and as by their kindly warmth and softening quality they relax its fibers and communicate the same effects to the parts contiguous for the same reason a purge is necessary when the smaller intestines are loaded with a saburra of crude humors which are out of the reach of a clysters operation which frequently happens in this case but what is of the most signal benefit in this intention is the use of warm lenient baths which introduce an universal relaxation of the passages this is directed by hippocrates lib de intern affect sect     who always directs judiciously for experience teaches that there is more advantage found from a gentle medicine administered whilst sitting in semicupio than from all the farrago of lithontripticks or the most pompous means whatsoever the present age so fruitful of discoveries has not yet found out a specific of this virtue much less might we expect it from the ancients galen therefore cannot be esteemed the less for frankly declaring that in his time no remedy was discovered which could break a stone but that the whole cure depended on surgery and incision   dly as to the symptoms the first to be attended to is the excessive pain and this is of such consequence that unless it is assuagd there is little to be expected from the most rational process for as long as this is exorbitant the contraction of the vessels will continue which will hinder the stones passing through them this is alleviated in great measure by the remedies adapted to the foregoing intention but what is particularly indicated here is phlebotomy and a cautious use of opiates the first as it empties the blood vessels and thereby takes off the distention the other as they quiet the orgasm of the spirits and elude the force of the stimulus it is therefore with good reason that a shining ornament of our body lays down that no one can more happily go about to assuage nephritick pains than by letting blood mead de imperio sol and lun page      the vomiting that accompanies a fit ceases as soon as the stone has passed into the bladder but as the stomach is sometimes so affected as to throw up whatever is taken we must endeavor to mitigate this symptom by gentle stomachicks blended with opiates which will take off the irritation for a while and give time to the proper medicines to pass into the blood  if these means prove unsuccessful and we have reason to apprehend that the stone is larger than ordinary which is perceived from the fixed heavy pain and the absence of any calculous excretions rather than leave the patient destitute of help we must have recourse to more forcible methods such as vomits purges of the stronger sort and the more powerful diuretics which from the shocks they give the parts may possibly remove the stone and force it through the vreter but these are to be tried only in very bad cases lest by shifting it from a larger space into a smaller they should fix it there irremoveably  as to nephrotomy or the cutting into the kidney in order to extract the stone it has been recommended by rosettus and the philosophical transactions inform us that it was performed once with success by dominicus marchetti a physician of padua upon a countryman of our own no      but if we attend to the parts to be cut through in this operation we shall find it only barely possible to succeed which is not a sufficient inducement to a wary practitioner either for to advise it or undertake it it being much more eligible to alleviate the symptoms and wait the event than to add to the patients torment and render his death more certain  the prophylactick part in this distemper in order to keep off another fit or to lessen the frequency of its returning is partly observed by religiously avoiding any of those errors in the nonnaturals that are reckoned among the distant causes of it but besides this we must endeavor to diminish the salts introduced into the blood with our food by purging medicines and moderate exercise repeated at proper intervals  we must strive to prevent the salts from running into combinations and to attenuate any viscid matter that may unite them together by proper diluters which by their aquosity will dissolve them and by strengthening the instruments of digestion which will occasion the chyle to be sufficiently comminuted and the salts intimately divided but we must chiefly aim at relaxing and widening the capacities of the vrinary passages that they may freely admit all the constituent parts of the urine through them which is partly obtained from the use of balsamic emollient diuretics and from gentle exercise which last by promoting the circulation drives the grosser particles of the fluids through the capillary vessels whilst the first enlarges their dimensions by their relaxing properties  amongst all the variety of purgers none seem so well adapted to answer all these ends as some of the mercurial preparations these not only evacuating the salts but having also a peculiar power of breaking and obtunding their spiculae of removing obstructions and enlarging the vessels  the stomachicks that are of most service are such as by their gentle astringency brace the fibers of the stomach and by their mild grateful warmth attenuate any viscid matter lodged therein for as to the botter and stronger bitters they induce a universal rigidity in the fibers of the whole body and for that reason will do more harm than good galen thought in this way when he laid down that most medicines proper for calculous patients are bitters de composition medicament secund loc lib  0  but then he tempers them before with this hint that by no means it is proper to give such persons very heating remedies de sanitat tuend lib     the diuretics ought to be such only as at the same time they force open any obstruction formed in the kidneys will likewise relax their urinary ducts those of this tribe being carefully to be avoided that are prepared from stony or earthy substances which by attracting one another in the capillary tubes instead of doing service may lay a foundation for another fit  upon all these accounts the bath spaw and other chalybeate waters are of the utmost benefit in the intervals between the fits as they dissolve the salts strengthen the stomach and bowels scour the urinary passages and carry any recrement out of the body by perspiration and urine  sect iii part ii of a stone in the bladder we come now to consider the consequences that will follow when a stone has changed its seat and lodged some time in the bladder that a nucleus generated in the kidney when once received into this organ is the general basis of those large concretions found in it is evident from inspecting these bodies in the center of which for the most part is found a solid substance of a different color and consistence from the rest of the stony integuments over which the adventitious concretions are spread lamellatim and enclose it as a shell does the kernel of a nut not but that a stone may be primarily generated here without the kidneys being first affected which not only appears in children who are frequently troubled with this disease without the least previous complaint of nephritick symptoms but likewise from the reason of the thing for if the solid parts of the urine should be deposited in the bladder in such manner as to be brought near to one another and not be washed away by a following afflux they will unite by means of their attractive powers this will happen if the urine is over viscid and too much loaded with saline and earthy principles for if it stays any considerable time before it is voided these will subside to the bottom by their own gravity where they will consequently be brought into a narrow compass and at the same time may adhere to it by the tenacity of the parts that envellope them accordingly constant observation tallies with it the urine of persons subject to these complaints being generally thick and viscid and dropping a whitish sediment which sticks to the bottom of the vessel it is contained in thus then there may be a stone formed in the bladder without a nucleus previously generated in the kidney but this is not near so frequent for the bladder being a large vessel and so often distended with urine such a deposition of the solid contents will very rarely happen but they will either flow out with the aqueous vehicle or else be washed away by the weight of the urine that so often falls upon them whereas a nucleus already formed being a solid concrete and ponderous it may be so lodged that the urine may pass over it or its surface so pointed as to adhere too closely to be separated and accordingly we find that stones are formed in the bladder when any extraneous solid bodies have accidentally got in there which have been the foundation of the subsequent incrustations of which there are many instances philosoph transact no               the basis of a calculus being laid in this manner it will necessarily increase if it stays any considerable time there for as it consists of a substance which in its nature is very attractive it will draw the solid particles of the urine to it which are of the same nature and will therefore separate from the fluid and adhere to its surface and this attractive power will be greater as the surface of this solid body grows larger so that a basis once formed the stone will become large in a shorter time than is commonly imagined every new incrustation not only adding to the quantity of matter but increasing the surface in a very great proportion the disposition of the several lamellae that compose the calculus shows that it increases in this way for their running parallel to one another can be only owing to this force of attraction by which the solid particles of the urine when brought to a certain distance from the concretion are impelled toward it and unite themselves to it on all sides at equal distances from its center as near as the figure of the place in which it is lodged will allow of  from hence it appears that the stones of the kidneys and bladder are of the same nature and formed in the same manner which i believe will hold good likewise in all stones of the body in whatsoever part they are found and howsoever they differ in figure color or weight though the effects produced by them will vary as they are lodged in one part or another when such a substance is in the bladder it will produce the following  at first little or no disturbance will arise from it because being small and light the mucus that lines the bladder is sufficient to guard it from the hardness and asperity of its surface only the urine is now and then intercepted in its voidance when the stone casually falls upon the orifice of the vrethra but when it grows larger and more weighty it will abrade this mucosity and twitch and vellicate the nervous coat more especially when it moves from one place to another hence the urine will become thick and slimy from the abraded mucus n hippocratis aphorism    sect    which qualities will increase as the stone grows larger the glands separating more mucus as the stimulus grows more forcible this stimulus at the same time will extend farther and create a pain in the neck of the bladder which will increase toward the end of micturition and be propagated toward the end of the glans the one because the calculus falls to its more depending part the neck the other because the nervous coat of the vrethra is no more than the continuation of the same nervous membrane and it is no wonder that when these parts which lie so near endure a pain that the more distant of the procreative organs should enjoy only a pruritus as the bulk of the stone increases it will press more forcibly upon these parts from whence the pain will become more intense and a weight perceived in the region of the os pubis and in perinaeo and the irritation it produces will be extended farther to the sphincter any and intestinum rectum both these being contiguous to this part and receiving branches from the same nerve so that a desire of going to stool will come upon every attempt to make water this must be very frequent by reason of the continual stimulus upon the bladder which will provoke it to discharge its contents but at the same time it will be voided with the greatest difficulty and guttatim from the stones lying upon the orifice of the vrethra and stopping it up so that the patient is obliged sometimes to lie in a supine posture in order to remove it from thence before the urine will pass off hence it is not at all surprising that when this body has accumulated it should occasion a difficulty of moving from place to place since the pressure of it upon the lower parts is so great  these are the natural effects of a lodgment of the stone in the bladder but as it does not create all of them at the same time but seriatim as it grows in magnitude its diagnosis is uncertain so that we are obliged to have recourse to some collateral tokens the better to form a surer judgment of the case thus we must have an eye to the previous disposition of the patient to nephritick symptoms which will guide us a little as also whether the remedies proper for this distemper have a laudable effect but we principally depend upon the introduction of the catheter into the bladder or the finger in anum though i have known the former to fail and a schirrus has imitated the stone so artfully in all symptoms as to disappoint the lithotomist agreeable to which is an observation of baglivi praxis medic lib   cap    sect   lib   cap    the haemorhoides also mimick this affection but then the pain they occasion is not so acute but the most remarkable case of this kind is from dr bamber wherein a great quantity of tophaceous substances that seemed to me so many globules of hardened excrement were lodged in the beginning of the colon where the ileum is ingrafted and created symptoms which aped the stone of the bladder so nicely that only death and dissection thereupon detected the fallacy in this case it was almost impossible but the most skilful surgeon should be deceived for these concreted substances gave the same resistance to the catheter and caused the same sensation to the hand that a stone would when in the cavity of the bladder however it was very lucky for this gentleman considering the censorious humor of the world that the patient died before he underwent the operation sometimes the surface of the stone is so rough and pointed as to adhere to the inward coat of the bladder but then there will be no suppression of urine along with its other diagnosticks as aretaeus has observed de cause and sign diuturnor morb  from the absence of which we may justly suspect an adhesion if the patient labors under the other symptoms this is a desparate case for if you endeavor to extract the stone forcibly you will lacerate the nervous membrane of the bladder upon which will ensue an inflammation and mortification of this vessel with all the direful train of consequential symptoms but i cannot well conceive how the stone can be enclosed in a membranous cystis for if so how can it increase the capsula keeping any adventitious concretions from its surface possibly this may not happen before it is grown large and has adhered some time and so by wounding and dividing the nervous coat whilst the closeness of its adhesion hinders it from reuniting it may occasion this membrane to shoot over it and form a case for it  here i cannot help mentioning an extraordinary case of the stone that fell under the inspection of the famous dr glisson and dr hugh chamberlain sen the daughter of sir hugh middleton who had been before troubled with nephritick symptoms upon riding a journey unfortunately altered the position of the stone and turned it transverse which brought on a suppression of urine which killed her for as one kidney was choked up by a large stone that only officiated in whose vreter the other stone was lodged which occasioned her death upon opening the body by mr holliard surgeon there was found an abscess in the left kidney with abundance of purulent matter and a brown hollow long stone of near two drams weight in the bottom of the vreter at its insertion into the bladder the right kidney was likewise ulcerous containing a thicker pus and at the bottom of it at the ingress of the vreter a larger whitish stone weighing three drams two scruples and a half this case being very uncommon from the hollowness of the stone through which the urine passed being the first instance i have any where met with of such a ones being found in the vreter though they are sometimes but rarely in the bladder i have thought it worth inserting more especially since it has not heretofore been made public the stones together with the case were left for some time in the custody of mr dobyns surgeon but are at present in the hands of dr middleton massey who to give a clearer idea of them has made a very accurate drawing which is here annexed tab iii fig vi   considering the nervous contexture of this organ which renders it of a very acute sense and the important office it bears in the animal economy such a praeternatural substance must necessarily prognosticate very bad events and accordingly not only the physicians of the present time but antiquity too have registered a perfect catalogue of evils it induces a suppression of urine the fever it occasions the convulsions it introduces and the emaciated habit that follows are common effects of this cause aretaei de diuturnor morbor causis etc lib   cap      if it is let stay a long time in the bladder or the patient will not submit to the artificial extraction  the method of cure in this distemper as far as it regards the physician which is only whilst the calculus is small enough to be forced through the vrethra by medicinal process is very much the same with that to be used in the stone of the kidney and if it is grown to any considerable size it is the surgeons
