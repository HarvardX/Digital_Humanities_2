trimmed and lace made up of dancing chatter and grimace as parrots talkative as peacocks vain deceit and follys motleycolourd train such shines the sad majority of france where virtues all comprised in  complaisance can it be strange that such a contrast should still thirst for british wealth and british blood that slaves themselves they with malignant eye behold and languish for our liberty that like the arch fiend to work their subtle ends they wish to stab us in the shape of friends since well they know when open force prevails their levity must kick up in the scales reason might well expect all this and more as the sure product of their serpent shore but for the imperial eagle brave and rude to stain her glory with ingratitude to aim annoyance at the friendly king who had so lately plumed her drooping wing staggers credulity bids honor haste and hide his blushes in some dreary waste since in the face of wondering heaven and men theresa george forgot and dettingen when lawless depredations spread alarms which britain forced unwillingly to arms when forts were raised in unsuspecting climes and harmless villagers in peaceful times like sheep were scattered over a barren plain or by the tribe of scalping butchers slain while wives dead husbands weltring in their view first served the lust of the rapacious crew then gladly sacrificed their final breath so to

faint tapers laboring to illume the skies reversed what are they to the vicious great lights to display the rottenness of state we need not straining panegyric use a licensed freedom of the magic muse to conjure alexander from his grave and mortify his pride with one more brave we need not bid the mighty julius come to see a race of fresher laurels bloom we need not fawning give our theme to sight more stained with blood than scanderbeg in fight whose single arm in one romantic day so story says two thousand swept away is it impossible to grace command without a lightning eye or thundering hand true merit needs no foppington display in peacock plumes of vain hyperbole but like the gems which light indostans mines with native worth and matchless radiance shines to warm the passions and to wound the heart why should we play the scenery of art bring to astonished optics from afar the glittering dreadful pageantry of war why wound the harrowd ear with harsh alarms hoarse drums shrill trumpets and the clink of arms why wake each tender feeling of the mind to weep the selfwrought woes of humankind to swell the sullen streams of widowed eyes to echo childless parents bursting sighs why show the dread effects of ravenous power why flame the city or subvert the tower why should we give a melting reader pain with streams of blood and mountains of the slain why picture what the brave must weep to see those dauntless agents of necessity who while each breast with patriot ardor glows for justice fight  yet weep over dying foes glory  bright spark of an aetherial flame humanity and thou art still the same megrimd ambition vainly strives to ape the beauties of thy soulenchanting shape yet like the painted prostitute can gain some mad admirers to adorn her train like her too

in saunders monckton hawke and granby blessed nor these alone  but should we speak of all who bravely followed at thy arduous call should we at length recite each several name we must monopolize the list of fame a list from whence exposed to gallic eyes dismay in trembling lifeless form must rise chill their proud monarch on his tottering throne and like medusas head convert to stone often have we heard of heroes in the field whose courage forced the conquered foe to yield generals and men adorned in every sense save with the virtuous beam benevolence that beam divine without whose cheering

brunswic on whose glorybeaming brows the crown imperial double radiance shows not such destructive beams as flames inspire and wildly set the groaning world on fire but such mild influence as in temperate skies the sun celestial sheds on human eyes a brunswic steady in his countrys cause firm basis of our liberty and laws well for the world does providence provide such instruments to check ambitions pride as wait the signal of his royal hand ready to guard or to revenge his land and wisely power is lodged in such a heart as cannot even think a tyrants part a heart that owns no merit in
