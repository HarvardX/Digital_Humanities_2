hastened its catastrophe page     the history of the empire of rome julius caesar first emperor caesar has been much celebrated for his fortune and yet his inspire him with fresh resolution to face new dangers he resolved therefore to pursue his last advantage and follow pompey to whatever country he should retire convinced that during his life he might gain new triumphs but could never enjoy security hearing therefore of his being at amphipolis he sent off his troops before him and then embarked on board a little frigate in order to cross the hellespont but in the middle of the straight he fell in with one of pompeys commanders at the head of ten ships of war caesar no way terrified at the superiority of his force bore up to him and commanded him to submit the other instantly obeyed awed by the terror of caesars name and surrendered himself and his fleet at discretion  from thence he continued his voyage to ephesus then to rhodes and being informed that pompey had been there before him he made no doubt but that he was fled to egypt wherefore losing no time he set sail for that kingdom and arrived at alexandria with about four thousand men a very inconsiderable force to keep such a powerful kingdom under subjection but he was now grown so secure in his good fortune that he expected to find obedience wherever he found men upon his landing the first accounts he received were of pompeys miserable end and soon after one of the murderers came with his head and ring as a most grateful present to the conqueror but caesar had too much humanity to be pleased with such an horrid spectacle he turned away from it with horror and after a short pause gave vent to his pity in a flood of tears he shortly after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to his memory on the spot where he was murdered and a temple near the place to nemesis who was the goddess that punished those that were cruel to men in adversity  it should seem that the egyptians by this time had some hopes of breaking off all alliance with the romans which they considered as in fact it was but a specious subjection they first began to take offense at caesars carrying the ensigns of roman power before him as he entered the city photinus the eunuch also treated him with great disrespect and even attempted his life caesar however who knew how to dissemble concealed his resentment till he had a force sufficient to punish his treachery and sending privately for the legions which had been formerly enrolled for pompeys service as being the nearest to egypt he in the mean time pretended to repose an entire confidence in the kings minister making great entertainments and assisting at the conferences of the philosophers who were in great numbers at alexandria however he soon changed his manner when he found himself in no danger from the ministers attempts and declared that as being roman consul it was his duty to settle the succession to the egyptian crown  there were at that time two pretenders to the crown of egypt ptolemy the acknowledged king and the celebrated cleopatra his sister who by the custom of the country was also his wife and by their fathers will shared jointly in the succession however not being contented with a bare participation of power she aimed at governing alone but being opposed in her views by the roman senate who confirmed her brothers title to the crown she was banished into syria with arsinoe her younger sister caesar however gave her new hopes of aspiring to the kingdom and sent to both her and her brother to plead their cause before him photinus the young kings guardian who had long borne the most inveterate hatred as well to caesar as to cleopatra disdained accepting this proposal and backed his refusal by sending an army of twenty thousand men to besiege him in alexandria caesar bravely repulsed the enemy for some time but finding the city of too great extent to be defended by so small an army as he then commanded he retired to the palace which commanded the harbor where he purposed to make his stand achilles who commanded the egyptians attacked him there with great vigor and still aimed at making himself master of the fleet that lay before the palace caesar however too well knew the importance of those ships in the hands of an enemy and therefore burnt them all in spite of every effort to prevent him he next possessed himself of the isle of pharos which was the key to the alexandrian port by which he was enabled to receive the supplies sent him from all sides and in this situation he determined to withstand the united force of all the egyptians  in the mean time cleopatra having heard of the present turn in her favor resolved to depend rather on caesars favor for gaining the government than her own forces she had in fact assembled an army in syria to support her claims but now judged it the wisest way to rely entirely on the decision of her selfelected judge but no arts as she justly conceived were so likely to influence caesar as the charms of her person which though not faultless were yet extremely seducing she was now in the bloom of youth and every feature borrowed grace from the lively turn of her temper to the most enchanting address she joined the most harmonious voice which the historians of her time compare to the best tuned instrument with all these accomplishments she possessed a great share of the learning of the times and could give audience to the ambassadors of seven different nations without an interpreter the difficulty was how to get at caesar as her enemies were in possession of all the avenues that led to the palace for this purpose she went on board a small vessel and in the evening landed near the palace where being wrapped up in a coverlet she was carried by one aspolodorus into the very chamber of caesar her address at first pleased him her wit and understanding still fanned the flame but her caresses which were carried beyond the bounds of innocence entirely brought him over to second her claims  while cleopatra was thus employed in forwarding her own views her sister arsinoe was also strenuously engaged in the camp in pursuing a separate interest she had found means by the assistance of one ganymede her confident to make a large division in the egyptian army in her favor and soon after by one of those sudden revolutions which are common in barbarian camps to this day she caused achillas to be murdered and ganymede to take the command in his stead and to carry on the siege with greater vigor than before ganymedes principal effort was by letting in the sea upon those canals which supplied the palace with fresh water but this inconvenience caesar remedied by digging a great number of wells his next endeavor was to prevent the junction of caesars twentyfourth legion which he twice attempted in vain he soon after made himself master of a bridge which joined the isle of pharos to the continent from which post caesar was resolved to dislodge him in the heat of the action some mariners partly through curiosity and partly ambition came and joined the combatants but being seized with a panic instantly fled and spread a general terror through the army all caesars endeavors to rally his forces were in vain the confusion was past remedy and numbers were drowned or put to the sword in attempting to escape now therefore seeing the irremediable disorder of his troops he retired to a ship in order to get to the palace that was just opposite however he was no sooner on board than great crowds entered at the same time with him upon which apprehensive of the ships sinking he jumped into the sea and swam two hundred paces to the fleet that lay before the palace all the time holding his own commentaries in his left hand above water and his coat of mail in his teeth  the alexandrians finding their efforts to take the palace ineffectual endeavored at least to get their king out of caesars power as he had seized upon his person in the beginning of their disputes for this purpose they made use of their customary arts of dissimulation professing the utmost desire for peace and only wanting the presence of their lawful prince to give a sanction to the treaty caesar who was sensible of their perfidy nevertheless concealed his suspicions and gave them their king as he was under no apprehensions from the abilities of a boy ptolemy however the instant he was set at liberty instead of promoting peace made every effort to give vigor to hostilities  in this manner caesar was hemmed in for some time by this artful and insidious enemy with all manner of difficulties against him but he was at last relieved from this mortifying situation by mithridates pergamenus one of his most faithful partisans who came with an army to his assistance this general collecting a numerous army in syria marched into egypt took the city of pelusium repulsed the egyptian army with loss and at last joining with caesar attacked their camp with a great slaughter of the egyptians ptolemy himself attempting to escape on board a vessel that was sailing down the river was drowned by the ships sinking and caesar thus became master of all egypt without any farther opposition he therefore appointed that cleopatra with her younger brother who was then but an infant should jointly govern according to the intent of their fathers will and drove out arsinoe with ganymede into banishment  having thus given away kingdoms he now for a while seemed to relax from the usual activity of his conduct captivated with the charms of cleopatra instead of quitting egypt to go and quell the remains of pompeys party he abandoned himself to his pleasures passing whole nights in feasts and all the excesses of high wrought luxury with the young queen he even resolved to attend her up the nile into aethiopia but the brave veterans who had long followed his fortune boldly reprehended his conduct and refused to be partners in so infamous an expedition thus at length rouzed from his lethargy he resolved to prefer the call of ambition to that of love and to leave cleopatra by whom he had a son who was afterward named caesario in order to oppose pharnaces the king of bosphorus who had now made some inroads upon the dominions of rome  this prince who was the son of the great mithridates being ambitious of recovering his fathers dominions seized upon armenia and colchis and overcame domitius who had been sent against him upon caesars march to oppose him pharnaces who was as much terrified at the name of the general as at the strength of his army labored by all the arts of negotiation to avert the impending danger caesar exasperated at his crimes and his ingratitude at first dissembled with the ambassadors and using all expedition fell upon the enemy unexpectedly and in a few hours obtained a speedy and a complete victory pharnaces attempting to take refuge in his capital was slain by one of his own commanders  a just punishment for his former parricide this victory was gained with so much ease that caesar could not avoid observing that pompey was very happy in gaining so much glory against this enemy at so easy a rate in writing to a friend at rome he expressed the rapidity of his victory in three words veni vidi vici a man so accustomed to conquest thought a slight battle scarce worth a longer letter  caesar having settled affairs in this part of the empire as well as time would permit having bestowed the government of armenia upon ariobarzanes that of judea upon hyrcanus and antipater and that of bosphorus upon mithridates embarked for italy where he arrived sooner than his enemies could expect but not before his affairs there absolutely required his presence he had been during his absence created consul for five years dictator for one year and tribune of the people for life but anthony who in the mean time governed in rome for him had filled the city with riot and debauchery and many commotions ensued which nothing but the arrival of caesar so opportunely could appease however by his moderation and humanity he soon restored tranquillity to the city scarce making any distinction between those of his own and the opposite party thus having by gentle means restored his authority at home he prepared to march into africa where pompeys party had found time to rally under scipio and cato assisted by juba king of mauritania but the vigor of his proceedings had like to have been retarded by a mutiny in his own army those veteran legions who had hitherto conquered all that came before them began to murmur for not having received the rewards which they had expected for their past services and now insisted upon their discharge the sedition first broke out in the tenth legion which till then had signalized themselves for their valor and attachment to their general caesar at first strove to appease them by promises of future rewards but these instead of appeasing the sedition only served to increase it the whole army marched forward from campania toward rome pillaging and plundering all the way caesar immediately caused the gates of the city to be shut and ordered such troops as were in readiness to defend the walls he then boldly went out alone to meet the mutineers notwithstanding the representations of his friends who were concerned for his safety upon coming into the campus martius where the most tumultuous were assembled he boldly mounted his tribunal and with a stern air demanded of the soldiers what they wanted or who had conducted them there a conduct so resolute seemed to disconcert the whole band they began by complaining that being worn out with fatigue and exhausted by their numberless wounds they were in hopes to obtain a discharge then take your discharge cried caesar and when i shall have gained new conquests with other troops i promise that you shall be partakers in the spoil so much generosity quite confounded the seditious who were agitated between the contending passions of gratitude and jealousy they were grateful for his intended bounty and jealous lest any other army should share the honors of completing the conquest of the world they unanimously entreated his pardon and even offered to be decimated to obtain it caesar for a while seemed to continue inflexible and at last granted as a favor what it was his interest earnestly to desire but the tenth legion continued ever after under his severe displeasure  caesar according to his usual diligence landed with a small party in africa but the rest of his army followed soon after after many movements and several skirmishes between both armies which only served to destroy mankind without determining the cause of quarrel he resolved at last to come to a decisive battle for this purpose he invested the city of tapsus supposing that scipio would attempt its relief which turned out according to his expectations scipio joining with the young king of mauritania advanced his army and encamping near caesar they soon came to a general battle caesars success was as usual the enemy received a complete and final overthrow with little or no loss on his side juba and petreius his general killed each other in despair scipio attempting to escape by sea into spain fell in among the enemy and was slain so that of all the generals of that undone party cato was now alone remaining  this extraordinary man whom no prosperity could elate nor any misfortunes depress having retired into africa after the battle of pharsalia had led the wretched remains of that defeat through burning deserts and tracts infested with serpents of various malignity and was now in the city of utica which he had been left to defend still however in love with even the show of roman government he had formed the principal citizens into a senate and conceived a resolution of holding out the town he accordingly assembled his senators upon this occasion and demanded their advice upon what measures were best to be taken and whether they should defend this last city that owned the cause of freedom if said he you are willing to submit to caesar i must acquiesce but if you are willing to hazard the dangers of defending the last remains of liberty let me be your guide and companion in so great an enterprise rome has often recovered from greater calamities than these and there are many motives to encourage our attempt spain has declared in our cause and rome itself bears the yoke with indignation with respect to the hazards we must encounter why should they terrify us observe our enemy he braves every danger and encounters every fatigue to undo mankind and make his country wretched and shall we scruple to suffer a short interval of pain in a cause so glorious this speech had at first a surprising effect but the enthusiasm for liberty soon subsiding he was resolved no longer to force men to be free who seemed naturally prone to slavery he now therefore desired some of his friends to save themselves by sea and bade others to rely upon caesars clemency observing that as to himself he was at last victorious after this supping cheerfully among his friends he retired to his apartment where he behaved with unusual tenderness to his son and to all his friends when he came into his bedchamber he laid himself down and took up platos dialogue on the immortality of the soul and having read for some time happening to cast his eyes to the head of his bed he was much surprised not to find his sword there which had been taken away by his sons order while they were at supper upon this calling one of his domestics to know what was become of his sword and receiving no answer he resumed his studies but some time after called for his sword again when he had done reading and perceiving nobody obeyed him in bringing his sword he called all his domestics one after the other and with a peremptory air demanded his sword once more his son came in soon after and with tears besought him in the most humble manner to change his resolution but receiving a stern reprimand he desisted from his persuasions his sword being at length brought him he seemed satisfied and cried out now again i am master of myself he then took up the book again which he read twice over and fell into a sound sleep upon awaking he called to one of his freedmen to know if his friends were embarked or if any thing yet remained that could be done to serve them the freedman assuring him that all was quiet was then ordered again to leave the room he was no sooner alone than he stabbed himself with his sword through the breast but not with that force he intended for the wound not dispatching him he fell upon his bed and at the same time overturned a table on which he had been drawing some geometrical figures at the noise he made in his fall his servants gave a shriek and his son and friends immediately entered the room they found him weltring in his blood and his bowels pushed out through the wound the physician who attended his family perceiving that his intestines were yet untouched was for replacing them but when cato had recovered his senses and understood their intention to preserve his life he pushed the physician from him and with a fierce resolution tore out his bowels and expired  in this manner cato died who was one of the most faultless characters we find in the roman history he was severe but not cruel he was ready to pardon much greater faults in others than he could forgive in himself his haughtiness and austerity seemed rather the effect of principle than natural constitution for no man was more humane to his dependents or better loved by those about him the constancy of his opposition to caesar proceeded from a thorough conviction of the injustice of his aims and the last act of his life was but conformable to the tenets of his sect as the stoics maintained that life was a gift which all men might return to the donor when the present was no longer pleasing  caesar upon hearing of catos end could not help observing that as cato had envied him the glory of saving his life so he had reason to envy him the glory of so bravely dying upon his death the war in africa being completed caesar returned in triumph to rome and as if he had abridged all his former triumphs only to increase the splendour of this the citizens were astonished at the magnificence of the procession and the number of the countries he had subdued it lasted four days the first was for gaul the second for egypt the third for his victories in asia and the fourth for that over juba in africa his veteran soldiers all scarred with wounds and now laid up for life followed their triumphant general crowned with laurels and conducted him to the capitol to every one of these he gave a sum equivalent to about an hundred and fifty pounds of our money double that sum to the centurions and four times as much to the superior officers the citizens also shared his bounty to every one of which he distributed ten bushels of corn ten pounds of oil and a sum of money equal to about two pounds sterling of ours he after this entertained the people at above twenty thousand tables treated them with the combat of gladiators and filled rome with a concourse of spectators from every part of italy  the people intoxicated with the allurements of pleasure thought their freedom too small a return for such benefits they seemed eager only to find out new modes of homage and unusual epithets of adulation for their great enslaver he was created by a new title magister morum or master of the morals of the people he received the title of emperor father of his country his person was declared sacred and in short upon him alone were devolved for life all the great dignities of the state it must be owned however that so much power could never have been entrusted to better keeping he immediately began his empire by repressing vice and encouraging virtue he committed the power of judicature to the senators and the knights alone and by many sumptuary laws restrained the scandalous luxuries of the rich he proposed rewards to all such as had many children and took the most prudent methods of repeopling the city that had been exhausted in the late commotions  having thus restored prosperity once more to rome he again found himself under a necessity of going into spain to oppose an army which had been raised there under the two sons of pompey and labienus his former general he proceeded in this expedition with his usual celerity and arrived in spain before the enemy thought him yet departed from rome cneius and sextus pompeys sons profiting by their unhappy fathers example resolved as much as possible to protract the war so that the first operations of the two armies were spent in sieges and fruitless attempts to surprise each other at length caesar after taking many cities from the enemy and pursuing pompey with unwearied perseverance at last compelled him to come to a battle upon the plains of munda pompey drew up his men by break of day upon the declivity of an hill with great exactness and order caesar drew up his men likewise in the plain below and after advancing a little way from his trenches he ordered his men to make an halt expecting the enemy to come down from the hill this delay made caesars soldiers begin to murmur while pompeys with full vigor poured down upon them and a dreadful conflict began hitherto caesar had fought for glory but here he fought for life his soldiers behaved with intrepidity incited by the hopes of making this a final period to their labor pompeys men were not less strenuous expecting no pardon as having their lives formerly given them when overthrown in africa the first shock was so dreadful that caesars men who had hitherto been used to conquer now began to waver caesar was never in so much danger as now he threw himself several times into the very throng of battle what cried he are you going to give up your general who is grown gray in fighting at your head to a parcel of boys upon this his tenth legion willing to recover their generals lost esteem exerted themselves with more than former bravery and a party of horse being detached by labienus from the camp in pursuit of a body of numidian cavalry caesar cried aloud that they were flying this cry instantly spread itself through both armies exciting the one as much as it depressed the other now therefore the tenth legion pressed forward and a total rout soon ensued thirty thousand men were killed on pompeys side amongst whom was labienus whom caesar ordered to be buried with the funeral honors of a general officer cneius pompey escaped with a few horsemen to the sea side but finding his passage intercepted by caesars lieutenant he was obliged to seek for a retreat in an obscure cavern here wounded and destitute of all kinds of succor he patiently awaited the approach of the enemy he was quickly discovered by some of the enemys troops who presently cut off his head and brought it to caesar his brother sextus however concealed himself so well that he escaped all pursuit so that caesar was obliged to return without him after having severely fined the cities of spain for their late imputed rebellion  caesar by this last blow subdued all his avowed enemies and had now conquered the best part of the world in almost as short a time as others would travel through the same extent of country he therefore returned to rome for the last time to receive new dignities and honors and to enjoy in his own person an accumulation of all the great offices of the state still however he pretended to a moderation in the enjoyment of his power he left the consuls to be named by the people but as he possessed all the authority of the office it from this time began to sink into contempt he enlarged the number of senators also but as he had previously destroyed their power their new honors were but empty titles he took care to pardon all who had been in arms against him but not till he had deprived them of the power of resistance he even set up once more the statues of pompey which however as cicero observed he only did to secure his own in short if his clemency his justice and moderation did not proceed from virtue yet they had all the effect of virtues in the state which answered the purpose of the public as well  the rest of this extraordinary mans life was employed for the advantage of the state he adorned the city with magnificent buildings he rebuilt carthage and corinth sending colonies to both cities he undertook to level several mountains in italy to drain the pontine marshes near rome and designed to cut through the isthmus of peloponesus thus with a mind that could never remain inactive he pondered mighty projects and designs beyond the limits of the longest life but the greatest of all was his intended expedition against the parthians by which he designed to revenge the death of crassus then to pass through hyrcania and enter scythia along the banks of the caspian sea from thence to open himself a way through the immeasurable forests of germany into gaul and so return to rome these were the aims of ambition the jealousy of a few individuals put an end to them all  the senate with an adulation which marked the degeneracy of the times continued to load him with fresh honors and he continued with equal vanity to receive them they called one of the months of the year after his name they stamped money with his image they ordered his statue to be set up in all the cities of the empire they instituted public sacrifices on his birthday and talked even in his lifetime of enrolling him among the number of their gods anthony at one of the public festivals foolishly ventured to offer him a diadem but he put it back again refusing it several times and receiving at every refusal loud acclamations from the people one day when the senate ordered him some particular honors he neglected to rise from his seat and from that moment envy began to mark him for destruction mankind are ever most offended at any trespass on ceremony since a violation of decorum is usually an instance of contempt it began therefore to be rumoured that he intended to make himself king which though in fact he was the people who had an utter aversion to the name could not bear his assuming the title whether he really designed to assume that empty honor must now for ever remain a secret but certain it is that the unsuspecting openness of his conduct marked something like a confidence in the innocence of his intentions when informed by those about him of the jealousies of many persons who envied his power he was heard to say that he had rather die once by treason than to live continually in apprehensions of it when advised by some to beware of brutus in whom he had for some time reposed the greatest confidence he opened his breast all scarred with wounds saying can you think brutus cares for such poor pillage as this and being one night at supper as his friends disputed among themselves what death was easiest he replied that which was most sudden and least foreseen but to convince the world how little he had to apprehend from his enemies he disbanded his company of spanish guards which facilitated the enterprise against his life for he should have considered that confidence in an usurper is but rashness  a deeplaid conspiracy was absolutely in agitation against him composed of no less than sixty senators they were still the more formidable as the generality of them were of his own party and being raised above other citizens felt more strongly the weight of a single superior at the head of this conspiracy were brutus whose life caesar had spared after the battle of pharsalia and cassius who was pardoned soon after both praetors for the present year brutus made it his chief glory to have been descended from that brutus who first gave liberty to rome the passion for freedom seemed to have been transmitted with the blood of his ancestors down to him but though he detested tyranny yet he could not forbear loving the tyrant from whom he had received the most signal benefits however the love of his country broke all the ties of private friendship and he entered into a conspiracy which was to destroy his benefactor cassius on the other hand was impetuous and proud and hated caesars person still more than his cause he had often sought an opportunity of gratifying his revenge by assassination which took rise rather from private than from public motives  the conspirators to give a color of justice to their proceedings remitted the execution of this design to the ides of march the day on which caesar was to be offered the crown the augurs had foretold that this day would be fatal to him and the night preceding he heard his wife calpurnia lamenting in her sleep and being awakened she confessed to him that she dreamt of his being assassinated in her arms these omens in some measure began to change his intentions of going to the senate as he had resolved that day but one of the conspirators coming in prevailed upon him to keep his resolution telling him of the reproach which would attend his staying at home till his wife had lucky dreams and of the preparations that were made for his appearance as he went along to the senate a slave who hastened to him with information of the conspiracy attempted to come near him but could not for the crowd artemidorus a greek philosopher who had discovered the whole plot delivered him a memorial containing the heads of his information but caesar gave it with other papers to one of his secretaries without reading as was usual in things of this nature being at length entered the senatehouse where the conspirators were prepared to receive him he met one spurina an augur who had foretold his danger to whom he said smiling well spurina the ides of march are come yes replied the augur but they are not yet over as soon as he had taken his place the conspirators came near him under pretense of saluting him and cimber who was one of them approached in a suppliant posture pretending to sue for his brothers pardon who was banished by his order all the conspirators seconded him with great earnestness and cimber seeming to sue with still greater submission took hold of the bottom of his robe holding him so as to prevent his rising this was the signal agreed on casca who was behind stabbed him though slightly in the shoulder caesar instantly turned round and with the style of his tablet wounded him in the arm however all the conspirators were now alarmed and enclosing him round he received a second stab from an unknown hand in the breast while cassius wounded him in the face he still defended himself with great vigor rushing among them and throwing down such as opposed him till he saw brutus among the conspirators who coming up struck his dagger into his thigh from that moment caesar thought no more of defending himself but looking upon this conspirator cried out and you too my son then covering his head and spreading his robe before him in order to fall with greater decency he sunk down at the base of pompeys statue after receiving three and twenty wounds from hands which he vainly supposed he had disarmed by his benefits  caesar was killed in the fiftysixth year of his age and about fourteen years after he began the conquest of the world if we examine his history we shall be equally at a loss whether most to admire his great abilities or his wonderful fortune to pretend to say that from the beginning he planned the subjection of his native country is doing no great credit to his wellknown penetration as a thousand obstacles lay in his way which fortune rather than conduct was to surmount no man therefore of his sagacity would have begun a scheme in which the chances of succeeding were so many against him it is most probable that like all very successful men he only made the best of every occurrence and his ambition rising with his good fortune from at first being contented with humbler aims he at last began to think of governing the world when he found scarce any obstacle to oppose his designs such is the disposition of man whose cravings after power are always most insatiable when he enjoys the greatest share  chap ii from the death of caesar to the battle of actium and the death of anthony which settled the constitution in augustus   as soon as the conspirators had dispatched caesar they began to address themselves to the senate in order to vindicate the motives of their enterprise and to excite them to join in procuring their countrys freedom but the universal coldness with which their expostulations were received soon taught them to fear their conduct would not meet with many advocates all the senators who were not accomplices fled with such precipitation that the lives of some of them were endangered in the throng the people also being now alarmed left their usual occupations and ran tumultuously through the the city some actuated by their fears and still more by a desire of plunder in this state of confusion the conspirators all retired to the capitol and guarded its accesses by a body of gladiators which brutus had in pay it was in vain they alleged that they only struck for freedom and that they killed a tyrant who had usurped the rights of mankind the people accustomed to luxury and ease little regarded their professions dreading more the dangers of poverty than of subjection  the friends of the late dictator now began to find that this was the time for coming into greater power than before and for satisfying their ambition under the veil of promoting justice of this number was anthony whom we have already seen acting as a lieutenant under caesar and governing rome in his absence with such little justice or decency he was a man of moderate abilities and excessive vices ambitious of power only because it gave his pleasures a wider range to riot in but skilled in war to which he had been trained from his youth he was consul for this year and resolved with lepidus who was fond of commotions like himself to seize this opportunity of gaining that power which caesar had died for usurping lepidus therefore took possession of the forum with a band of soldiers at his devotion and anthony being consul was permitted to command them their first step was to possess themselves of all caesars papers and money and the next to convene the senate never had this august assembly been convened upon so delicate an occasion as it was to determine whether caesar had been a legal magistrate or a tyrannical usurper and whether those who killed him merited rewards or punishments there were many of these who had received all their promotions from caesar and had acquired large fortunes in consequence of his appointments to vote him an usurper therefore would be to endanger their property and yet to vote him innocent might endanger the state in this dilemma they seemed willing to reconcile extremes wherefore they approved all the acts of caesar and yet granted a general pardon to all the conspirators  this decree was very far from giving anthony satisfaction as it granted security to a number of men who were the avowed enemies of tyranny and who would be foremost in opposing his schemes of restoring absolute power as therefore the senate had ratified all caesars acts without distinction he formed a scheme upon this of making him rule when dead as imperiously as he had done when living being as was said possessed of caesars books of accounts he so far gained upon his secretary as to make him insert whatever he thought proper by these means great sums of money which caesar would never have bestowed were here distributed among the people and every man who had any seditious designs against the government was here sure of finding a gratuity things being in this forwardness he demanded that caesars funeral obsequies should be performed which the senate now could not decently forbid as they had never declared him a tyrant accordingly the body was brought forth into the forum with the utmost solemnity and anthony who charged himself with these last duties of friendship began his operations upon the passions of the people by the prevailing motives of private interest he first read them caesars will in which he had left octavius his sisters grandson his heir permitting him to take the name of caesar and three parts of his private fortune brutus was to inherit in case of his death the roman people were left the gardens which he had on the other side of the tyber and every citizen in particular was to receive three hundred sesterces this last bequest not a little contributed to increase the peoples affection for their late dictator they now began to consider caesar as a father who not satisfied with doing them the greatest good while living thought of benefiting them even after death as anthony continued reading the multitude began to be moved and sighs and lamentations were heard from every quarter anthony seeing the audience favorable to his designs now began to address the assembly in a more pathetic strain he presented before them caesars bloody robe and as he unfolded it took care they should observe the number of stabs in it then displaying an image which to them appeared the body of caesar all covered with wounds this cried he this is all that is left of him who was befriended by the gods and loved by mankind even to adoration this is he to whom we vowed eternal fidelity and whose person both the senate and the people concurred to declare was sacred behold now the execution of these vows behold here the proofs of our gratitude the bravest of men destroyed by the most ungrateful of mankind he who showered down his benefits upon the betrayers found his death as the only return is there none to revenge his cause is there none that mindful of former benefits will show himself now deserving of them yes there is one behold me o jupiter thou avenger of the brave ready to offer up my life on this glorious occasion and you ye deities protectors of the roman empire accept my solemn vows and favor the rectitude of my intentions the people could now no longer contain their indignation they unanimously cried out for revenge all the old soldiers who had fought under him burnt with his body their coronets and other marks of conquest with which he had honored them a great number of the first matrons in the city threw in their ornaments also till at length rage succeeding to sorrow the multitude ran with flaming brands from the pile to set fire to the conspirators houses in this rage of resentment meeting with one cinna whom they mistook for another of the same name who was in the conspiracy they tore him in pieces the conspirators themselves however being well guarded repulsed the multitude with no great trouble but perceiving the rage of the people they thought it soon after safest to retire from the city the populace being thus left to themselves set no bounds to their sorrow and gratitude divine honors were granted him an altar was erected on the place where his body was burnt where afterward was erected a column inscribed to the father of his country  in the mean time anthony who had excited this flame resolved to make the best of the occasion having gained the people by his zeal in caesars cause he next endeavored to bring over the senate by a seeming concern for the freedom of the state he therefore proposed to recall sextus pompeys only remaining son who had concealed himself in spain since the death of his father and to grant him the command of all the fleets of the empire his next step to their confidence was the quelling a sedition of the people who rose to revenge the death of caesar and putting their leader amathus to death who pretended to be the son of marius he after this pretended to dread the resentment of the multitude and demanded a guard for the security of his person the senate granted his request and under this pretext he drew round him a body of six thousand resolute men attached to his interest and ready to execute his commands thus he continued every day making rapid strides to absolute power all the authority of government was lodged in his hands and those of his two brothers alone who shared among them the consular tribunitian and praetorian power his vows to revenge caesars death seemed either postponed or totally forgotten and his only aims seemed to be to confirm himself in that power which he had thus artfully acquired but an obstacle to his ambition seemed to arise from a quarter on which he least expected it this was from octavius caesar afterward called augustus as we shall henceforth take leave to call him though he did not receive the title till long after augustus who was the grand nephew and adopted son of caesar was at appollonia when his kinsman was slain he was then but eighteen years old and had been sent to that city to improve himself in the study of grecian literature upon the news of caesars death notwithstanding the earnest dissuasions of all his friends he resolved to return to rome to claim the inheritance and revenge the death of his uncle from the former professions of anthony he expected to find him a warm assistant to his aims and he doubted not by his concurrence to take signal vengeance on all who had a hand in the conspiracy however he was greatly disappointed anthony whose projects were all to aggrandize himself gave him but a very cold reception and instead of granting him the fortune left him by the will delayed the payment of it upon various pretenses hoping to check his ambition by limiting his circumstances but augustus seems to have inherited not only the wealth but the inclinations of his uncle instead therefore of abating his claims he even sold his own patrimonial estate to pay such legacies as caesar had left and particularly that to the people by these means he gained a degree of popularity which his enemies vainly labored to diminish and which in fact he had many other methods to procure his conversation was elegant and insinuating his face comely and graceful and his affection to the late dictator so sincere that every person was charmed either with his piety or his address but what added still more to his interest was the name of caesar which he had assumed and in consequence of which the former followers of his uncle now flocked in great numbers to him all these he managed with such art that while he gained their affections he never lost their esteem so that anthony now began to conceive a violent jealousy for the talents of his young opponent and secretly labored to counteract all his designs in fact he did not want reason for the army near rome that had long wished to see the conspirators punished began to turn from him to his rival whom they saw more sincerely bent on gratifying their desires anthony having also procured the government of hither gaul from the people two of his legions that he had brought home from his former government of macedonia went over to augustus notwithstanding all his remonstrances to detain them this produced as usual interviews complaints recriminations and pretended reconciliations which only tended to widen the difference so that at length both sides prepared for war thus the state was divided into three distinct factions that of augustus who aimed at procuring caesars inheritance and revenging his death that of anthony whose sole view was to obtain absolute power and that of the conspirators who endeavored to restore the senate to its former authority  anthony being raised by the people to his new government of cisalpine gaul contrary to the inclinations of the senate resolved to enter upon his province immediately and oppose brutus who commanded a small body of troops there while his army was yet entire he accordingly left rome and marching thither commanded brutus to depart brutus being unable to oppose him retired with his forces but being pursued by anthony he was at last besieged in the city of mutina of which he sent word to the senate  in the mean while augustus who by this time had raised a body of ten thousand men returned to rome and being resolved before he attempted to take vengeance on the conspirators if possible to diminish the power of anthony began by bringing over the senate to second his designs in this he succeeded by the credit of cicero who long had hated anthony because he thought him the enemy of the state accordingly by means of his great eloquence a decree was passed ordering anthony to raise the siege of mutina to evacuate cisalpine gaul and to await the further orders of the senate upon the banks of the rubicon it may easily be supposed that in the present state of government in rome a commander at the head of a victorious army would pay little attention to an ineffective decree anthony treated the order with contempt and instead of obeying began to profess his displeasure at being hitherto so submissive nothing now therefore remained for the senate but to declare him an enemy to the state and to send augustus with the army he had raised to curb his insolence augustus was very ready to offer his army for this expedition in order to punish his own private injuries before he undertook those of the public the two consuls hirtius and pansa joined also their forces and thus combined they marched at the head of a numerous army against anthony into cisalpine gaul he on his part was not slow in opposing them after one or two ineffectual conflicts both armies came to a general engagement in which anthony was defeated and compelled to fly to lepidus who commanded a body of forces in further gaul this victory however which promised the senate so much success produced effects very different from their expectations the two consuls were mortally wounded but pansa previous to his death calling augustus to his bedside advised him to join with anthony telling him that the senate only desired to depress both by opposing them to each other the advice of the dying consul sunk deep on the spirits of augustus so that from that time he only sought a pretext to break with them their giving the command of a part of his army to decimus brutus and their denying him a triumph soon after served to alienate his mind entirely from them and made him resolve to join anthony and lepidus he was willing however to try the senate thoroughly before he came to an open rupture wherefore he sent to demand the consulship which was refused him he then thought himself obliged to keep no measures with that assembly but privately sent to sound the inclinations of anthony and lepidus concerning a junction of forces and found them as eager to assist as the senate was to oppose him anthony was in fact the general of both armies and lepidus was only nominally so his soldiers refusing to obey him upon the approach of the former wherefore upon being assured of the assistance of augustus upon their arrival in italy they soon crossed the alps with an army of seventeen legions breathing revenge against all who had opposed their designs  the senate now began too late to perceive their error in offering to disoblige augustus they therefore gave him the consulship which they had so lately refused and to prevent his joining with anthony flattered him with new honors and gave him a power superior to all law the first use augustus made of his new authority was to procure a law for the condemnation of brutus and cassius and in short to join his forces with those of anthony and lepidus  the meeting of these three usurpers of their countrys freedom was near mutina upon a little island of the river panarus their mutual suspicions were the cause of their meeting in a place where they could not fear any treachery for even in their union they could not divest themselves of mutual diffidence lepidus first entered and finding all things safe made the signal for the other two to approach they embraced each other upon their first meeting and augustus began the conference by thanking anthony for his zeal in putting decimus brutus to death who being abandoned by his army was taken as he was designing to escape into macedonia and beheaded by anthonys command they then entered upon the business that lay before them without any retrospection of the past their conference lasted for three days and in this period they fixed a division of government and determined upon the sat of thousands one can scarce avoid wondering how that city which gave birth to such men as fabricius and cato could now be a tame spectator of a conference which bartered away the lives and liberties of the people at their pleasure to se these three men seated without attendants on the highest part of a desolate island marking out whole cities and nations for destruction and yet none to oppose their designs shows what changes may quickly be wrought in the bravest people in a very short time the result of their conference was that the supreme authority should be lodged in their hands under the title of the triumvirate for the space of five years that anthony should have gaul lepidus spain and augustus africa and the mediterranean islands as for italy and the eastern provinces they were to remain in common until their general enemy was entirely subdued but the last article of their union was a dreadful one it was agreed that all their enemies should be destroyed of which each presented a list in these were comprised not only the enemies but the friends of the triumvirate since the partisans of the one were often found among the opposers of the other thus lepidus gave up his brother paulus to the vengeance of his colleague anthony permitted the proscription of his uncle lucius and augustus delivered up the great cicero the most sacred rights of nature were violated three hundred senators and above two thousand knights were included in this terrible proscription their fortunes were confiscated and their murderers enriched with the spoil rome soon felt the effects of this infernal union nothing but cries and lamentations were to be heard through all the city scarce an house escaping without a murder no man dared to refuse entrance to the assassins although he had no other hopes of safety and this city that was once the beauty of the world seemed now reduced to desolation without an army and now felt the effects of an invading enemy with all the deliberate malice of coolblooded slaughter  in this horrid carnage cicero was one of those principally sought after who for a while seemed to evade the malice of his pursuers but upon hearing of the slaughters that were committed at rome he set forward from his tusculan villa toward the seaside with an intent to transport himself directly out of the reach of his enemies there finding a vessel ready he presently embarked but the winds being averse and the sea wholly uneasy to him after he had sailed about two leagues along the coast he was obliged to land and spend the night upon shore from thence he was forced by the importunity of his servants on board again but was soon after obliged to land at a country seat of his a mile from the shore weary of life and declaring he was resolved to die in that country which he had so often saved here he slept soundly for some time till his servants once more forced him away in a litter toward the ship having heard that he was pursued by a party of anthonys assassins they were scarce departed when the assassins arrived at his house and perceiving him to be fled pursued him immediately toward the sea and overtook him in a wood that lay near the shore their leader was one popilius lenus a tribune of the army whose life cicero had formerly defended and saved as soon as the soldiers appeared the servants prepared to defend their masters life at the hazard of their own but cicero commanded them to set him down and to make no resistance they soon cut off his head and his hands returning with them to rome as the most agreeable present to their cruel employer anthony who was then at rome received them with extreme joy rewarded the murderer with a large sum of money and placed ciceros head on the rostrum as if there once more to reproach his vile inhumanity cicero was slain in the sixtythird year of his age but not until he had seen his country ruined before him the glory he obtained says julius caesar was as much above all other triumphs as the extent of the roman genius was above that of the bounds of the roman empire  thus the proscription went on to rage for some time with as much violence as when it began as many as could escape its cruelty fled either into macedonia to brutus or found refuge with young pompey who was now in sicily and covered the mediterranean with his numerous navy their cruelties were not aimed at the men alone but the softer sex were in danger of being marked as objects either of avarice or resentment they made out a list of fourteen hundred women of the best quality and the richest in the city who were ordered to give in an account of their fortunes to be taxed in proportion but this seemed so unpopular a measure and was so firmly opposed by hortensia who spoke against it that instead of fourteen hundred women they were content to tax only four hundred however they made up the deficiency by extending the tax upon men near an hundred thousand as well citizens as strangers were compelled to furnish supplies to the subversion of their countrys freedom at last both the avarice and vengeance of the triumviri seemed fully satisfied and they went into the senate to declare that the proscription was at an end and thus having deluged the city with blood augustus and anthony leaving lepidus to defend rome in their absence marched with their army to oppose the conspirators who were now at the head of a formidable army in asia  brutus and cassius the principal of these upon the death of caesar being compelled to quit rome went into greece where they persuaded the roman students at athens to declare in the cause of freedom then parting the former raised a powerful army in macedonia and the adjacent countries while the latter went into syria where he soon became master of twelve legions and reduced his opponent dollabella to such streights as to kill himself both armies soon after joining at smyrna the sight of such a formidable force began to revive the declining spirits of the party and to reunite the two generals still more closely between whom there had been some time before a slight misunderstanding in short having quitted italy like distressed exiles without having one single soldier or one town that owned their command they now found themselves at the head of a flourishing army furnished with all the necessaries for carrying on the war and in a condition to support a contest where the empire of the world depended on the event this success in raising levies was entirely owing to the justice moderation and great humanity of brutus who in every instance seemed studious of the happiness of his country and not his own  it was in this flourishing state of their affairs that the conspirators had formed a resolution of going against cleopatra who on her side had made great preparations to assist their opponents however they were diverted from this purpose by an information that augustus and anthony were now upon their march with forty legions to oppose them brutus now therefore moved to have their army pass over into greece and macedonia and there meet the enemy but cassius so far prevailed as to have the rhodians and lycians first reduced who had refused their usual contributions this expedition was immediately put in execution and extraordinary contributions were raised by that means the rhodians having scarce any thing left them but their lives the lycians suffered still more severely for having shut themselves up in the city of xanthius they defended the place against brutus with such fury that neither his arts nor entreaties could prevail upon them to surrender at length the town being set on fire by their attempting to burn the works of the romans brutus instead of laying hold on this opportunity to storm the place made every effort to preserve it entreating his soldiers to try all means of extinguishing the fire but the desperate phrenzy of the citizens was not to be mollified far from thinking themselves obliged to their generous enemy for the efforts which were made to save them they resolved to perish in the flames wherefore instead of extinguishing they did all in their power to augment the fire by throwing in wood dry reeds and all kinds of fuel nothing could exceed the distress of brutus upon seeing the townsmen thus resolutely bent on destroying themselves he rode about the fortifications stretching out his hands to the xanthians and conjuring them to have pity on themselves and their city but insensible to his expostulations they rushed into the flames with desperate obstinacy and the whole soon became an heap of undistinguishable ruin at this horrid spectacle brutus melted into tears offering a reward to every soldier who should bring him a lycian alive the number of those whom it was possible to save from their own fury amounted to no more than one hundred and fifty  brutus and cassius met once more at sardis where after the usual ceremonies were past between them they resolved to have a private conference together they shut themselves up therefore in the first convenient house with express orders to their servants to give no admission brutus began by reprimanding cassius for having disposed of offices which should ever be the reward of merit and for having overtaxed the tributary states cassius retorted the imputation of avarice with the more bitterness as he knew the charge to be groundless the debate grew warm till from loud speaking they burst into tears their friends who were standing at the door overheard the increasing vehemence of their voices and began to dread for the consequences till favonius who valued himself upon a cynical boldness that knew no restraint entering the room with a jest calmed their mutual animosity cassius was ready enough to forego his anger being a man of great abilities but of uneven disposition not averse to pleasure in private company and upon the whole of morals not quite sincere but the conduct of brutus was always perfectly steady an even gentleness a noble elevation of sentiments a strength of mind over which neither vice nor pleasure could have any influence an inflexible firmness in the defense of justice composed the character of that great man in consequence of these qualities he was beloved by his army doated upon by his friends and admired by all good men after their conference night coming on cassius invited brutus and his friends to an entertainment where freedom and cheerfulness for a while took place of political anxiety and softened the severity of wisdom upon retiring home it was that brutus as plutarch tells the story saw a spectre in his tent he naturally slept but little and he had increased this state of watchfulness by habit and great sobriety he never allowed himself to sleep in the day time as was then common in rome and only gave so much of the night to sleep as could barely renew the natural functions but especially now when oppressed with such various cares he only gave a short time after his nightly repast to rest and waking about midnight generally read or studied till morning it was in the dead of the night when the whole camp was perfectly quiet that brutus was thus employed in reading by a lamp that was just expiring on a sudden he thought he heard a noise as if some body entered and looking toward the door he perceived it open a gigantic figure with a frightful aspect stood before him and continued to gaze upon him with silent severity at last brutus had courage to speak to it art thou a demon or a mortal man and why come thou to me brutus replied the phantom i am thy evil genius thou shall see me again at philippi well then answered brutus without being discomposed we shall meet again upon which the phantom vanished and brutus calling to his servants asked if they had seen any thing to which replying in the negative he again resumed his studies but as he was struck with so strange an occurrence he mentioned it the next day to cassius who being an epicurean ascribed it to the effect of an imagination too much exercised by vigilance and anxiety brutus appeared satisfied with this solution of his late terrors and as anthony and augustus were now advanced into macedonia they soon after passed over into thrace and advanced to the city of philippi near which the forces of the triumviri were posted  all mankind now began to regard the approaching armies with terror and suspense the empire of the world depended upon the fate of a battle as from victory on the one side they had to expect freedom but from the other a sovereign with absolute command brutus was the only man who looked upon these great events before him with calmness and tranquillity indifferent as to success and satisfied with having done his duty he said to one of his friends if i gain the victory i shall restore liberty to my country if i lose it by dying i shall be delivered from slavery myself my condition is fixed and i run no hazards the republican army consisted of fourscore thousand foot and twenty thousand horse the army of the triumviri amounted to an hundred thousand foot and thirteen thousand horse thus complete on both sides they met and encamped near each other upon the plains of philippi a city upon the confines of thrace this city was situated upon a mountain toward the west of which a plain stretched itself by a gentle declivity almost fifteen leagues to the banks of the river strymon in this plain about two miles from the town were two little hills at about a mile distance from each other defended on one side by mountains on the other by a marsh which communicated with the sea it was upon these two hills that brutus and cassius fixed their camps brutus on the hill toward the north cassius on that toward the south and in the intermediate space which separated them they cast up lines and a parapet from one hill to the other thus they kept a firm communication between the two camps which mutually defended each other in this commodious situation they could act as they thought proper and give battle only when it was to their advantage to engage behind them was the sea which furnished them with all kinds of provisions and at twelve miles distance the island of thasos which served them for a general magazine the triumviri on the other hand were encamped on the plain below and were obliged to bring their provisions from fifteen leagues distance so that their scheme and interest was to bring on a battle as soon as they could this they offered several times drawing out their men from their camp and provoking the enemy to engage on the contrary these contented themselves with drawing up their troops at the head of their camps but without descending to the plain this resolution of postponing the battle was all that the republican army had for it and cassius who was aware of his advantage resolved to harrass the enemy rather than engage them but brutus began to suspect the fidelity of some of his officers so that he used all his influence to persuade cassius to change his resolution i am impatient said he to put an end to the miseries of mankind and in that i have hopes of succeeding whether i fall or conquer his wishes were soon gratified for anthonys soldiers having with great labor made a road through the marsh which lay to the left of cassiuss camp by that means opened a communication with the island of thasos which lay behind him both armies in attempting to possess themselves of this road resolved at length to come to a general engagement this however was contrary to the advice of cassius who declared that he was forced as pompey had formerly been to expose the liberty of rome to the hazard of a battle the ensuing morning the two generals gave the signal for engaging and conferred together a little while before the battle began cassius desired to know how brutus intended to act in case they were unsuccessful to which the other replied that he had formerly in his writings condemned the death of cato and maintained that avoiding calamities by suicide was an insolent attempt against heaven that sent them but he had now altered his opinions and having given up his life to his country he thought he had a right to his own way of ending it wherefore he was resolved to change a miserable being here for a better hereafter if fortune proved against him well said my friend cried cassius embracing him now we may venture to face the enemy for either we shall be conquerors ourselves or we shall have no cause to fear those that are so augustus being sick the forces of the triumviri were commanded alone by anthony who began the engagement by a vigorous attack upon the lines of cassius brutus on the other side made a dreadful irruption on the army of augustus and drove forward with so much intrepidity that he broke them upon the very first charge upon this he penetrated as far as the camp and cutting in pieces those who were left for its defense his troops immediately began to plunder but in the mean time the lines of cassius were forced and his cavalry put to flight there was no effort that this unfortunate general did not try to make his infantry stand stopping those that fled and seizing himself the colors to rally them but his own valor alone was not sufficient to inspire his timorous army he saw himself entirely routed his camp taken and himself obliged to retire under a little hill at some distance brutus who had gained a complete victory was just returning at this interval with his triumphant army when he found that all was lost on the part of his associate he sent out a body of cavalry to bring him news of cassius who perceiving them advance toward him sent one titinius to inform himself whether they were friends or enemies titinius soon joined this body who received him with great transport informing him of their success but delaying too long cassius began to mistake them for what his fears had suggested and crying out that he had exposed his dearest friend to be taken prisoner he retired to his tent with one of his freedmen named pindarus who slew him and then was never heard of after titinius arrived in triumph with the body of horsemen but his joy was soon turned into anguish upon seeing his friend dead in the tent before him upon which accusing his own delay as the cause he punished it with falling on his sword brutus was by this time informed of the defeat of cassius and soon after of his death as he drew near the camp he seemed scarce able to restrain the excess of his grief for a man whom he called the last of the romans he bathed the dead body with his tears and telling his friends that he thought cassius very happy in being beyond the reach of those misfortunes which remained for them to suffer he ordered him to be privately removed lest the knowledge of his death should despirit the army it was only this precipitate despair of cassius which gave the enemy the advantage since till then the republicans might be said to have the superiority  the first care of brutus when he became the sole general was to assemble the dispersed troops of cassius and animate them with fresh hopes of victory as they had lost all they possessed by the plundering of their camp he promised them two thousand denarii each man to make up their losses this once more inspired them with new ardour they admired the liberality of their general and with loud shouts proclaimed his former intrepidity still however he had not confidence sufficient to face the adversary who offered him battle the ensuing day his aim was to starve his enemies who were in extreme want of provisions their fleet having been lately defeated but his single opinion was overruled by the rest of his army who now grew every day more confident of their strength and more arrogant to their new general he was therefore at last after a respite of twenty days obliged to comply with their solicitations to try the fate of the battle both armies being drawn out they remained a long while opposite to each other without offering to engage it is said that he himself had lost much of his natural ardour by having seen the spectre the night preceding however he encouraged his men as much as possible and gave the signal for battle within three hours of sunset he had as usual the advantage where he commanded in person he bore down the enemy at the head of his infantry and supported by his cavalry made a very great slaughter but his left wing fearing to be taken in flank stretched itself out in order to enlarge its front by means of which it became too weak to stand the shock of the enemy it was there that the army of brutus began to yield and anthony pushing forward drove the enemy so far back as to be able to turn and attack brutus in the rear the troops which had belonged to cassius communicated their terror to the rest of the forces till at last the whole army gave way brutus surrounded by the most valiant of his officers fought for a long time with amazing valor the son of cato fell fighting by his side as also the brother of cassius so that at last he was obliged to yield to necessity and fled in the mean time the two triumviri now assured of victory expressly ordered by no means to suffer the general to escape for fear he should renew the war thus the whole body of the enemy seemed chiefly intent on brutus alone and his capture seemed inevitable in this deplorable exigence lucilius his friend was resolved by his own death to effect his generals delivery upon perceiving a body of thracian horse closely pursuing brutus and just upon the point of taking him he boldly threw himself in their way telling them that he was brutus the thracians overjoyed with so great a prize immediately dispatched some of their companions with the news of their success to the army upon which the ardour of the pursuit now abating anthony marched out to meet his prisoner and to hasten his death or insult his misfortunes he was followed by a great number of officers and soldiers some silently deploring the fate of so virtuous a man others reproaching that mean desire of life for which he consented to undergo captivity anthony now seeing the thracians approach began to prepare himself for the interview but the faithful lucilius advancing with a cheerful air it is not brutus said he that is taken fortune has not yet had the power of committing so great an outrage upon virtue as for my life it is well spent in preserving his honor take it for i have deceived you anthony struck with so fidelity pardoned him upon the spot and from that time forward loaded him with benefits and honored him with his friendship  in the mean time brutus with a small number of friends passed over a rivulet and night coming on sat down under a rock which concealed him from the pursuit of the enemy after taking breath for a little time he cast his eyes up to heaven that was all spangled with stars he repeated a line from euripides containing a wish to the gods that guilt should not pass in this life without punishment to this he added another from the same poet o virtue thou empty name i have worshipped thee as a real good but thou art only the slave of fortune he then called to mind with great tenderness those whom he had seen perish in battle and sent out one statilius to give him some information of those that remained but he never returned being killed by a party of the enemys horse brutus judging very rightly of his fate now resolved to die likewise and spoke to those who stood round him to lend him their last sad assistance none of them however would render him so melancholy a piece of service upon this raising himself up and stretching out his hands he spoke to them with a serene countenance saying that he was happy in the fidelity of his friends happy in the consciousness of his own rectitude and though he fell yet his death was more glorious than the triumphs of the enemy since they were successful in the cause of usurpation and he overthrown in the defense of virtue he then retired to a little distance with one strato who was his master in oratory and entreated him to do him the last office of friendship strato however expressed his reluctance in taking upon him so shocking an office brutus therefore seeing him so averse called to one of his slaves to perform what he so ardently desired but strato then offered himself crying out that it should never be said that brutus in his last extremity stood in need of a slave for want of a friend thus saying and averting his head he presented the swords point to brutus who threw himself upon it and immediately expired thus died brutus and with him all hopes of liberty in rome by this famous overthrow the triumviri became irresistible and though pompeys younger son was still alive and at the head of a powerful army yet with the united forces of the empire against him little could be expected from his greatest efforts  from the moment of brutuss death the triumviri began to act as sovereigns and to divide the roman dominions between them as theirs by right of conquest however though there were apparently three who thus participated all power yet in fact only two were actually possessed of it since lepidus was at first admitted merely to curb the mutual jealousy of anthony and augustus and was possessed neither of interest in the army nor authority among the people their first care was to punish those whom they had formerly marked for vengeance hortensius drusus and quintilius varus all men of the first rank in the commonwealth either killed themselves or were slain a senator and his son were ordered to cast lots for their lives but both refused it the father voluntarily gave himself up to the executioner and the son stabbed himself before his face another begged to have the rites of burial after his death to which augustus replied that he should find a grave in the vultures that devoured him but chiefly the people lamented to see the head of brutus sent to rome to be thrown at the foot of caesars statue his ashes however were sent to his wife porcia catos daughter who following the example of her husband and father killed herself by swallowing burning coals it is observed that of all those who had a hand in the death of caesar not one died a natural death  the power of the triumviri being thus established upon the ruin of the commonwealth they now began to think of enjoying that homage to which they had aspired anthony went into greece to receive the flattery of that refined people and spent some time at athens conversing among the philosophers and assisting at their disputes in person from thence he past over into asia where all the monarchs of the east who acknowledged the roman power came to pay him their obedience while the fairest princesses strove to gain his favor by the greatness of their presents or the allurements of their beauty in this manner he proceeded from kingdom to kingdom attended by a crowd of sovereigns exacting contributions distributing favors and giving away crowns with capricious insolence he presented the kingdom of cappadocia to sysenes in prejudice of ariarathes only because he found pleasure in the beauty of glaphyra the mother of the former he settled herod in the kingdom of judea and supported him against every opposer but among all the sovereigns of the east who shared his favors none had so large a part as cleopatra the celebrated queen of egypt  it happened that serapion her governor in the island of cyprus had formerly furnished some succors to the conspirators and it was thought proper that she should answer for his conduct on that occasion accordingly having received orders from anthony to come and clear herself of this imputation of infidelity she readily complied equally conscious of the goodness of her cause and the power of her beauty she had already experienced the force of her charms upon caesar and pompeys eldest son and the addition of a few years since that time only served to heighten their luster she was now in her twentyseventh year and consequently improved those allurements by art which in earlier age are seldom attended to her address and wit were still further heightened and though there were some women in rome that were her equals in beauty none could rival her in the charms of seducing conversation anthony was now in tarsus a city of cilicia when cleopatra resolved to attend his court in person she sailed down the river cydnus at the mouth of which the city stood with the most sumptuous pageantry her galley was covered with gold the sails of purple large and floating in the wind the oars of silver kept tune to the sound of flutes and cymbals she herself lay reclined on a couch spangled with stars of gold and with such ornaments as poets and painters had usually ascribed to venus on each side were boys like cupids who fanned her by turns while the most beautiful nymphs dressed like neriads and graces were placed at proper distances around her upon the banks of the river were kept burning the most exquisite perfumes while an infinite number of people gazed upon the sight with a mixture of delight and admiration so soon after relating the death of brutus i fancy it will give the reader but very little pleasure minutely to describe the triumphs of vice and infamy suffice it therefore to say that anthony was captivated with her beauty and leaving all his business to satisfy his passion shortly after followed her into egypt here he continued in all that ease and softness to which his vicious heart was prone and which that luxurious people were able to supply  while he remained thus idle in egypt augustus who took upon him to lead back the veteran troops and settle them in italy was assiduously employed in providing for their subsistence he had promised them lands at home as a recompense for their past services but they could not receive their new grants without turning out the former inhabitants in consequence of this multitudes of women with children in their arms whose tender years and innocence excited universal compassion daily filled the temples and the streets with their distresses numbers of husbandmen and shepherds came to deprecate the conquerors intention or to obtain an habitation in some other part of the world among this number was virgil the poet to whom mankind owe more obligations than to a thousand conquerors who in an humble manner begged permission to retain his patrimonial farm virgil obtained his request but the rest of his countrymen of mantua and cremona were turned out without mercy  italy and rome now felt the most extreme miseries the insolent soldiers plundered at will while sextus pompey being master of the sea cut off all foreign communication and prevented the peoples receiving their usual supplies of corn to these mischiefs were added the commencement of another civil war fulvia the wife of anthony who had been left behind him at rome had felt for some time all the rage of jealousy and resolved to try every method of bringing back her husband from the arms of cleopatra she considered a breach with augustus as the only probable means of rouzing him from his lethargy and accordingly with the assistance of lucius her brotherinlaw who was then consul and entirely devoted to her interest she began to sow the seeds of dissension the pretext was that anthony should have a share in the distribution of lands as well as augustus this produced some negotiations between them augustus offered to make the veterans themselves umpires in the dispute lucius refused to acquiesce and being at the head of more than six legions mostly composed of such as were dispossessed he resolved to compel augustus to accept of whatever terms he should offer thus a new war was excited between augustus and anthony or at least the generals of the latter assumed the sanction of his name augustus however was victorious lucius was hemmed in between two armies and constrained to retreat to perusia a city of etruria where he was closely besieged by the opposite party he made many desperate sallies and fulvia did all in her power to relieve him but without success he was at last therefore reduced to such extremity by famine that he came out in person and delivered himself up to the mercy of the conqueror augustus received him very honorably and generously pardoned him and all his followers thus having concluded the war in a few months he returned in triumph to rome to receive new marks of adulation from the obsequious senate  anthony who during this interval was revelling in all the studied luxuries procured him by his insidious mistress having heard of his brothers overthrow and his wifes being compelled to leave italy was resolved to oppose augustus without delay he accordingly sailed at the head of a considerable fleet from alexandria to tire from thence to cyprus and rhodes and had an interview with fulvia his wife at athens he much blamed her for occasioning the late disorders testified the utmost contempt for her person and leaving her upon her deathbed at sycion hastened into italy to fight augustus they both met at brundusium and it was now thought that the flames of a civilwar were going to blaze out once more the forces of anthony were numerous but mostly newly raised however he was assisted by sextus pompeius who in these oppositions of interest was daily coming into power augustus was at the head of those veterans who had always been irresistible but who seemed no way disposed to fight against anthony their former general a negotiation was therefore proposed and by the activity of cocceius a friend to both a reconciliation was effected all offenses and affronts were mutually forgiven and to cement the union a marriage was concluded between anthony and octavia the sister of augustus a new division of the roman empire was made between them augustus was to have the command of the west anthony of the east while lepidus was obliged to content himself with the provinces in africa as for sextus pompeius he was permitted to retain all the islands he had already possessed together with peloponessus he was also granted the privilege of demanding the consulship in his absence and of discharging that office by any of his friends it was likewise stipulated to leave the sea open and pay the people what corn was due out of sicily thus a general peace was concluded to the great satisfaction of the people who now expected a cesation from all their calamities  this calm seemed to continue for some time anthony led his forces against the parthians over whom his lieutenant ventidius had gained some advantages augustus drew the greatest part of his army into gaul where there were some disturbances and pompey went to secure his newlyceded province to his interest it was on this quarter that fresh motives were given for renewing the war anthony who was obliged by treaty to quit peloponessus refused to evacuate it till pompey had satisfied him for such debts as were due to him from the inhabitants this pompey would by no means comply with but immediately fitted out a new fleet and renewed his former enterprises by cutting off such corn and provisions as were consigned to italy thus the grievances of the poor were again renewed and the people began to complain that instead of three tyrants they were now oppressed by four  in this exigence augustus who had long meditated the best means of diminishing the number resolved to begin by getting rid of pompey who kept the state in continual alarms he was master of two fleets one which he had caused to be built at ravenna and another which menodorus who revolted from pompey brought to his aid his first attempt was to invade sicily but being overpowered in his passage by pompey and afterward shattered in a storm he was obliged to defer his designs to the ensuing year during this interval he was reinforced by a noble fleet of one hundred and twenty ships given him by anthony with which he resolved once more to invade sicily on three several quarters but fortune seemed still determined to oppose him he was a second time disabled and shattered by a storm which so raised the vanity of pompey that he began to style himself the son of neptune however augustus was not to be intimidated by any disgraces for having shortly refitted his navy and recruited his forces he gave the command of both to agrippa his faithful friend and associate in war agrippa proved himself worthy of the trust reposed in him he began his operations by a victory over pompey and though he was shortly after worsted himself he soon after gave his adversary a complete and final overthrow thus undone pompey resolved to fly to anthony from whom he expected refuge as he had formerly obliged that triumvir by giving protection to his mother however a gleam of hope offering he tried once more at the head of a small body of men to make himself independent and even surprised anthonys lieutenants who had been sent to accept of his submissions nevertheless he was at last abandoned by his soldiers and delivered up to titus anthonys lieutenant who shortly after caused him to be slain  the death of this general removed one very powerful obstacle to the ambition of augustus and he resolved to take the earliest opportunity to get rid of the rest of his associates an offense was soon furnished by lepidus that served as a sufficient pretext for depriving him of his share in the triumvirate being now at the head of twentytwo legions with a strong body of cavalry he idly supposed that his present power was more than an equivalent to the popularity of augustus he therefore resolved upon adding sicily where he then was to his province pretending a right as having first invaded it augustus sent to expostulate upon these proceedings but lepidus fiercely replied that he was determined to have his share in the administration and would no longer submit to let one alone possess all the authority augustus was previously informed of the disposition of lepiduss soldiers for he had by his secret intrigues and largesses entirely attached them to himself wherefore without further delay he with great boldness went alone to the camp of lepidus and with no other assistance than his private bounties and the authority he had gained by his former victories he resolved to depose his rival the soldiers thronged round him with the most dutiful alacrity while lepidus hastened to prevent their defection but augustus though he received a wound from one of the centurions flew with great presence of mind to the place where the military ensigns were planted and flourishing one of them in the air all the legionary soldiers ran in crowds and saluted him as their general lepidus being thus abandoned by his men divested himself of all the marks of his authority which he could no longer keep and submissively threw himself at the feet of augustus this general despised his colleague too much to take his life he spared it notwithstanding the remonstrances of the army but deprived him of all his former authority and banished him to circaeum there he continued the rest of his life despised by his friends and to all a melancholy object of blasted ambition  augustus was received upon his return to rome with universal joy the senators met him at the gates and conducted him to the capitol the people followed crowned with garlands of flowers and after having returned thanks to the gods waited upon him to his palace there remained now but one obstacle to his ambition which was anthony whom he resolved to remove and for that purpose began to render his character as contemptible as he possibly could at rome in fact anthonys conduct did not a little contribute to promote the endeavors of his ambitious partner in the state he had marched against the parthians with a prodigious army but was forced to return with the loss of the fourth part of his forces and all his baggage this extremely diminished his reputation but his making a triumphal entry into alexandria soon after entirely disgusted the citizens of rome however anthony seemed quite regardless of their resentment alive only to pleasure and totally disregarding the business of the state he spent whole days and nights in the company of cleopatra who studied every art to increase his passion and vary his entertainments few women have been so much celebrated for the art of giving novelty to pleasure and making trifles important still ingenious in filling up the languid pauses of sensual delight with some new stroke of refinement she was at one time a queen then a bachanal and sometimes an huntress she invented a society called the inimitable and those of the court who made the most sumptuous entertainments carried away the prize not contented with sharing in her company all the delights which egypt could afford anthony was resolved to enlarge his sphere of luxury by granting her many of those kingdoms which belonged to the roman empire he gave her all phaenicia celosyria and cyprus with a great part of cilicia arabia and judea gifts which he had no right to bestow but which he pretended to grant in imitation of hercules this complication of vice and folly at last totally exasperated the romans and augustus willing to take the advantage of their resentment took care to exaggerate all his defects at length when he found the people sufficiently irritated against him he resolved to send octavia who was then at rome to anthony as if with a view of reclaiming her husband but in fact to furnish a sufficient pretext of declaring war against him as he knew she should be dismissed with contempt  anthony was now at the city of leucopolis revelling with his insidious paramour when he heard that octavia was at athens upon her journey to visit him this was very unwelcome news as well to him as to cleopatra who fearing the charms of her rival endeavored to convince anthony of the strength of her passion by her sighs languishing looks and wellfeigned melancholy he frequently caught her in tears which she seemed as if willing to hide and often entreated her to tell him the cause which she seemed willing to suppress these artifices together with the ceaseless flattery and importunity of her creatures prevailed so much upon anthonys weakness that he commanded octavia to return home without seeing her and attached himself still more closely to cleopatra than before his ridiculous passion now began to have no bounds he resolved to own her for his wife and entirely to repudiate octavia he accordingly assembled the people of alexandria in the public theater where was raised an alcove of silver under which were placed two thrones of gold one for himself and the other for cleopatra there he seated himself dressed like bacchus while cleopatra sat beside him clothed in the ornaments and attributes of isis the principal deity of the egyptians on that occasion he declared her queen of all the countries which he had already bestowed upon her while he associated caesario her son by caesar as her partner in the government to the two children which he had by her himself he gave the title of king of kings with very extensive dominions and to crown his absurdities he next sent a minute account of his proceedings to the two consuls at rome one folly is generally the parent of many more as he became a god it was now necessary to act up to his imaginary dignity new luxuries and pageantries were now therefore studied and new modes of profusion found out no less than sixty thousand pounds of our money was lavished upon one single entertainment it is said upon this occasion that cleopatra dissolved a pearl of great value in vinegar and drank it off yet however high wrought their entertainments might be they wanted that delicacy which gives the finest relish to all sensual happiness anthony as we are told was but a coarse and inelegant soldier who mistook obscenity for wit and profusion for magnificence cleopatra who was naturally more refined was yet obliged to comply with his disposition and to bear with his debaucheries rather than share them but we are told of one circumstance that might well repress their delights and teach mankind to relish the beverage of virtue however simple above their most zested enjoyments he was suspicious of being poisoned in every meal he feared cleopatra whom he so much loved and would eat nothing without having it previously tasted by one of his attendants  in the mean time augustus had now a sufficient pretext for declaring war and informed the senate of his intentions however he deferred the execution of his design for a while being then employed in quelling an insurrection of the illyrians the following year was chiefly taken up in preparations against anthony who perceiving his design remonstrated to the senate that he had many causes of complaint against his colleague who had seized upon sicily without affording him a share alleging that he had also dipossest lepidus and kept to himself the province he had commanded and that he had divided all italy among his own soldiers leaving nothing to recompense those in asia to this complaint augustus was contented to make a sarcastic answer implying that it was absurd to complain of his distribution of a few trifling districts in italy when anthony having conquered parthia he might now reward his soldiers with cities and provinces the sarcasm upon anthonys misfortunes in parthia so provoked him that he ordered canidius who commanded his army to march without intermission into europe while he and cleopatra followed to samos in order to prepare for carrying on the war with vigor when arrived there it was ridiculous enough to behold the odd mixture of preparations for pleasure and for war on one side all the kings and princes from egypt to the euxine sea had orders to send him thither supplies both of men provisions and arms on the other side all the comedians dancers buffoons and musicians of greece were ordered to attend him thus frequently when a ship was thought to arrive laden with soldiers arms and ammunition it was found only filled with players and theatrical machinery when news was expected of the approach of an army messengers only arrived with tidings of a fresh quantity of venison in this manner he labored to unite incompatible pursuits the kings who attended him endeavored to gain his favor more by their entertainments than their warlike preparations the provinces strove rather to please him by sacrificing to his divinity than by their alacrity in his defense so that some were heard to say what rejoicings would not this man make for a victory when he thus triumphs at the eve of a dangerous war in short his best friends now began to forsake his interests which is generally the case with all those who first forsake themselves  his delay at samos and afterward at athens where he carried cleopatra to receive new honors was extremely favorable to the arms of augustus this general was at first scarcely in a disposition to oppose him had he gone into italy but he soon found time to put himself in a condition for carrying on the war and shortly after declared it against him in form all anthonys followers were invited over to join him with great promises of rewards but they were not declared enemies partly to prevent their growing desperate and partly to give a show of moderation to his own party at length both found themselves in readiness to begin the war and their armies were answerable to the empire they contended for the one was followed by all the forces of the east the other drew all the strength of the west to support his pretensions anthonys force composed a body of an hundred thousand foot and twelve thousand horse while his fleet amounted to five hundred ships of war the army of augustus mustered but eighty thousand foot but equalled his adversarys in his number of cavalry his fleet was but half as numerous as anthonys however his ships were better built and manned with better soldiers such forces on both sides may excite our wonder but not our interest neither had a good cause to support the contention of both being only like that of two robbers who quarrel in the division of their plunder  the great decisive engagement which was a naval one was fought near actium a city of epirus at the entrance of the gulf of ambracia anthony ranged his ships before the mouth of the gulf and augustus drew up his fleet in opposition neither general assumed any fixed station to command in but went about from ship to ship wherever his presence was necessary in the mean time the two land armies on opposite sides of the gulf were drawn up only as spectators of the engagement and encouraged the fleets by their shouts to engage the battle began on both sides with great ardour and after a manner not practiced upon former occasions the prows of their vessels were armed with brazen points and with these they drove furiously against each other in this conflict the ships of anthony came with greater force but those of augustus avoided the shock with greater dexterity on anthonys side the sterns of the ships were raised in form of a tower from whence they threw arrows from machines for that purpose those of augustus made use of long poles hooked with iron and firepots they fought in this manner for some time with equal animosity nor was there any advantage on either side except a small appearance of disorder in the center of anthonys fleet but all of a sudden cleopatra determined the fortune of the day she was seen flying from the engagement attended by sixty sail struck perhaps with the terrors natural to her sex but what increased the general amazement was to behold anthony himself following soon after and leaving his sleet at the mercy of the conquerors the engagement notwithstanding continued with great obstinacy till five in the evening when anthonys forces partly constrained by the conduct of agrippa and partly persuaded by the promises of augustus submitted to the conqueror the land forces soon after followed the example of the navy and all yielded to augustus without striking a blow the fourth day after the battle  when cleopatra fled anthony pursued her in a fiveoard galley and coming along side of her ship entered it without seeing or being seen by her she was in the stern and he went to the prow where he remained for some time silent holding his head between his hands in this manner he continued three whole days during which either through indignation or shame he neither saw nor spoke to cleopatra at last when they were arrived at the promontory of tenarus the queens female attendants reconciled them and every thing went on as before still however he had the consolation to suppose his army continued faithful to him and accordingly dispatched orders to his lieutenant canidius to conduct it into asia however he was soon undeceived when he arrived in africa where he was informed of their submission to his rival this account so transported him with rage that he was hardly prevented from killing himself but at length at the entreaty of his friends he returned to alexandria in a very different situation from that in which he had left it some time before cleopatra however seemed to retain that fortitude in her misfortunes which had utterly abandoned her admirer having amassed considerable riches by means of confiscations and other acts of violence she formed a very singular and unheard of project this was to convey her whole fleet over the istmus of suez into the red sea and thereby save herself in another region beyond the reach of rome with all her treasures some of her vessels were actually transported thither pursuant to her orders but the arabians having burnt them and anthony dissuading her from the design she abandoned it for the more improbable scheme of defending egypt against the conqueror she omitted nothing in her power to put this advice in practice and made all kinds of preparations for war at least hoping thereby to obtain better terms from augustus in fact she had always loved anthonys fortunes rather than his person and if she could have fallen upon any method of saving herself though even at his expense there is no doubt but she would have embraced it with gladness she even still had some hopes from the power of her charms though she was arrived almost at the age of forty and was desirous of trying upon augustus those arts which had been so successful with the greatest men of rome thus in three embassies which were sent one after another from anthony to augustus in asia the queen had always her secret agents charged with particular proposals in her name anthony desired no more than that his life might be spared and to have the liberty of passing the remainder of his days in obscurity to these proposals augustus made no reply cleopatra sent him also public proposals in favor of her children but at the same time privately resigned him her crown with all the ensigns of royalty to the queens public proposal no answer was given to her private offer he replied by giving her assurances of his favor in case she sent away anthony or put him to death these negotiations were not so private but they came to the knowledge of anthony whose jealousy and rage every occurrence now contributed to heighten he built a small solitary house upon a mole in the sea and there shut himself up a prey to all those passions that are the tormentors of unsuccessful tyranny there he past his time shunning all commerce with mankind and professing to imitate timon the manhater however his furious jealousy drove him even from this retreat into society for hearing that cleopatra had many secret conferences with one thyrsus an emissary from augustus he seized upon him and having ordered him to be cruelly scourged he sent him back to his patron at the same time he sent letters by him importing that he had chastized thyrsus for insulting a man in misfortunes but withal he gave augustus permission to avenge himself by scourging hiparchus anthonys freedman in the same manner the revenge in this case would have been highly pleasing to anthony as hiparchus had left him to join the fortunes of his more successful rival  meanwhile the operations of the war were carried vigorously forward and egypt was once more the theater of the contending armies of rome gallus the lieutenant of augustus took paretonium which opened the whole country to his incursions on the other side anthony who had still considerable forces by sea and land wanted to take that important place from the enemy he therefore marched toward it flattering himself that as soon as he should show himself to the legions which he had once commanded their affection for their ancient general would revive he approached therefore and exhorted them to remember their former vows of fidelity gallus however ordered all the trumpets to sound in order to hinder anthony from being heard so that he was obliged to retire  augustus himself was in the mean time advancing with another army before pelusium which by its strong situation might have retarded his progress for some time but the governor of the city either wanting courage to defend it or previously instructed by cleopatra to give it up permitted him to take possession of the place so that augustus had now no obstacle in his way to alexandria whither he marched with all expedition anthony upon his arrival sallied out to oppose him fighting with great desperation and putting the enemys cavalry to slight this slight advantage once more revived his declining hopes and being naturally vain he reentered alexandria in triumph then going all armed as he was to the palace he embraced cleopatra and presented her a soldier who had distinguished himself in the late engagement the queen rewarded him very magnificently presenting him with an headpiece and breast plate of gold with these however the soldier went off the next night to the other army prudently resolving to secure his riches by keeping on the strongest side anthony however could not bear this defection without fresh indignation he resolved therefore to make a bold expiring effort by sea and land but previously offered to fight his adversary in single combat augustus too well knew the inequality of their situations to comply with this forelorn offer he only therefore coolly replied that anthony had ways enough to die besides single combat  the evening before the day appointed for his last desperate attempt he ordered a grand entertainment to be prepared give me good wine and good cheer cried he to his friends let me live today tomorrow perhaps you may serve another master about midnight as plutarch relates while a melancholy silence reigned throughout the city a noise of voices instruments and dancing was heard as if passing through the town and seeming to go out at the gate which looked toward the enemy at daybreak anthony posted the few troops he had remaining upon a rising ground near the city from whence he sent orders to his galleys to engage the enemy there he waited to be a spectator of the combat and at first he had the satisfaction to see them advance in good order but his approbation was soon turned into rage when he saw his ships only saluting those of augustus and both fleets uniting together and sailing back into the harbor at the very same time his cavalry deserted him he tried however to lead on his infantry which were easily vanquished and he himself compelled to return into the town his anger was now ungovernable he could not help crying out aloud as he past that he was betrayed by cleopatra and delivered by her to those who for her sake alone were his enemies in these suspicions he was not deceived for it was by secret orders from the queen that the fleet had past over to the enemy  cleopatra had for a long while dreaded the effects of anthonys jealousy and had some time before prepared a method of obviating any sudden sallies it might produce near the temple of isis she had erected a building which was seemingly designed for a sepulcher hither she removed all her treasure and most valuable effects covering them over with torches faggots and other combustible matter this sepulcher she designed to answer a double purpose as well to screen her from the sudden resentments of anthony as to make augustus believe that she would burn all her treasures in case he refused her proper terms of capitulation here therefore she retired from anthonys present fury shutting the gates which were fortified with bolts and bars of iron but in the mean time gave orders that a report should be spread of her death this news which soon reached anthony recalled all his former love and tenderness this poor wretch was now a being subject to the gust of every passion and each of them in extreme he now lamented her death with the same violence he had but a few minutes before seemed to desire it wretched man cried he to himself what is there now worth living for since all that could sooth or soften my cares is departed o cleopatra continued he being got to his chamber our separation does not so much afflict me as the disgrace i suffer in permitting a woman to instruct me in the ways of dying he then called one of his freedmen named eros whom he had engaged by oath to kill him whenever fortune should drive him to this last resource eros being now commanded to perform his promise this faithful follower drew the sword as if going to execute his orders but turning his face plunged it into his own bosom and died at his masters feet anthony for a while hung over his faithful servant and commending his fidelity took up the sword with which stabbing himself in the belly he fell backward upon a little couch though the wound was mortal yet the blood stopping he recovered his spirits and earnestly conjured those who were come into the room to put an end to his life but they all fled being seized with fright and horror he therefore continued in this manner for some time still crying out and writhing with pain till he was informed by one of the queens secretaries that his mistress was still alive he then earnestly desired to be carried to the place where she was they accordingly brought him to the gate of the sepulcher but cleopatra who would not permit it to be opened appeared at the window and threw down cords in order to pull him up in this manner assisted by her two female attendants she raised him all bloody from the ground and while yet suspended in the air he continued stretching out his hands to encourage her cleopatra and her maids had only just strength sufficient to raise him and at last with much straining they effected their purpose and carried him to a couch on which they gently laid him here she gave way to her sorrow tearing her clothes beating her breast and kissing the wound of which he was dying she called upon him as her lord her husband her emperor and seemed to have forgot her own distresses in the greatness of his sufferings anthony entreated her to moderate the transports of her grief and asked for some wine either because he was thirsty or thought it would hasten his end after he had drank he entreated cleopatra to endeavor to preserve her life if she could do it with honor and recommended proculus a friend of augustus as one she might rely on to be her intercessor he exhorted her not to lament for his misfortunes but to congratulate him upon his former felicity to consider him as one who had lived the most powerful of men and at last died by the hand of a roman just as he had done speaking he expired and proculus made his appearance by command of augustus who had been informed of anthonys desperate conduct he was sent to try all means of getting cleopatra into his power augustus having a double motive for his solicitude on this occasion one to prevent her destroying the treasures she had taken with her into the tomb the other to preserve her person as an ornament to grace his triumph cleopatra however was upon her guard and would not confer with proculus except through the gate which was very well secured in the mean time while he designedly drew out the conference to some length and had given galus one of his fellow soldiers directions to carry on the conversation in his absence he entered with two more by the window at which anthony had been drawn up as soon as he was entered he ran down to the gate and one of the women crying out that they were taken alive cleopatra perceiving what happened drew a poniard and attempted to stab herself but proculus preventing the blow gently remonstrated that she was cruel in refusing so good a prince as his master was the pleasure of displaying his clemency he then forced the poniard out of her hand and examined her clothes to be certain she had no poison about her thus leaving every thing secured he went to acquaint his master with his proceedings  augustus was extremely pleased at finding her in his power he sent epaphroditus to bring her to his palace and to watch her with the utmost circumspection he was likewise ordered to use her in every respect with that deference and submission which was due to her rank and to do every thing in his power to render her captivity agreeable she was permitted to have the honor of granting anthony the rites of burial and furnished with every thing she desired that was becoming his dignity to receive or her love to offer yet still she languished under her new confinement her excessive sorrow her many losses and the blows she had given her bosom produced a fever which she seemed willing to increase she resolved to abstain from taking any nourishment under the pretense of a regimen necessary for her disorder but augustus being made acquainted with the real motive by her physician began to threaten her with regard to her children in case she persisted this was the only punishment that could now affect her she allowed herself to be treated as they thought proper and received whatever was prescribed for her recovery  in the mean time augustus made his entry into alexandria taking care to mitigate the fears of the inhabitants by conversing familiarly as he went along with areus a philosopher and a native of the place the citizens however trembled at his approach and when he placed himself upon the tribunal they prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground before him like criminals who waited the sentence of their execution augustus presently ordered them to rise telling them that three motives induced him to pardon them his respect for alexander who was the founder of their city his admiration of its beauty and his friendship for areus their fellowcitizen two only of particular note were put to death upon this occasion anthonys eldest son antyllus and caesario the son of julius caesar both betrayed into his hands by their respective tutors who themselves suffered for their perfidy shortly after as for the rest of cleopatras children he treated them with great gentleness leaving them to the care of those who were entrusted with their education who had orders to provide them with every thing suitable to their birth when she was recovered from her late indisposition he came to visit her in person she received him lying upon a couch in a careless manner and upon his entering the appartment rose up to prostrate herself before him she was dressed in nothing but a loose robe her misfortunes had given an air of severity to her features her hair was dishevelled her voice trembling her complexion pale and her eyes red with weeping yet still her natural beauty seemed to gleam through the distresses that surrounded her and the graces of her motion and the alluring softness of her looks still bore testimony to the former power of her charms augustus raised her with his usual complaisance and desiring her to sit placed himself beside her cleopatra had been prepared for this interview and made use of every method she could think of to propitiate the conqueror she tried apologies entreaties and allurements to obtain his favor and soften his resentment she began by attempting to justify her conduct but when her art and skill failed against manifest proofs she turned her defense into supplications she talked of caesars humanity to those in distress she read some of his letters to her full of tenderness and enlarged upon the long intimacy that had past between them but of what service cried she are now all his benefits to me why could i not die with him yet he still lives methinks i see him still before me he revives in you augustus was no stranger to this method of address but he remained firm against all attacks answering always with a cold indifference which obliged her to give her attempts a different turn she now addressed his avarice presenting him with an inventory of her treasure and jewels this gave occasion to a very singular scene which shows that the little decorums of breeding were then by no means so carefully attended to as at present one of her stewards having alleged that the inventory was defective and that she had secreted a part of her effects she fell into a violent passion started from her couch and catching him by the hair gave him several blows on the face augustus smiled at her indignation and leading her to the couch desired her to be pacified to this she replied that she could not bear being insulted in the presence of one whom she so highly esteemed and supposing cried she that i have secreted a few trifles am i to blame when they are reserved not for myself but for livia and octavia whom i hope to make my intercessors with you this excuse which intimated a desire of living was not disagreeable to augustus who politely assured her that she was at liberty to keep whatever she had reserved and that in every thing she should be indulged to the height of her expectations he then took leave and departed imagining he had reconciled her to life and to the indignity of being shown in the intended triumph which he was preparing for his return to rome but in this he was deceived cleopatra all this time had kept a correspondence with dollabella a young roman of high birth in the camp of augustus who perhaps from compassion or stronger motives was interested in the misfortunes of that princess from him she learnt the intentions of augustus and that he was determined to send her off in three days together with her children to rome she now therefore determined upon dying but previously entreated permission to pay her last oblations at anthonys tomb this request being granted her she was carried with her two female attendants to the stately monument where he was laid there she threw herself upon his coffin bewailed her captivity and renewed her protestations not to survive him she then crowned the tomb with garlands of flowers and having kissed the coffin a thousand times she returned home to execute her fatal resolution having bathed and ordered a sumptuous banquet she attired herself in the most splendid manner she then feasted as usual and soon after ordered all but her two attendants charmion and iras to leave the room then having previously ordered an asp to be secretly conveyed to her in a basket of fruit she sent a letter to augustus informing him of her fatal purpose and desiring to be buried in the same tomb with anthony augustus upon receiving this letter instantly dispatched messengers to stop her intentions but they arrived too late upon entering the chamber they beheld cleopatra lying dead upon a gilded couch arrayed in her royal robes near her iras one of her faithful attendants was stretched lifeless at the feet of her mistress and charmion herself almost expiring was settling the diadem upon cleopatras head alas cried one of the messengers was this well done charmion yes replied she it is well done such a death becomes a glorious queen descended from a race of noble ancestors on pronouncing these words she fell down and died with her much loved mistress there are some circumstances in the death of this celebrated woman that interests our affections contrary to the dictates of our reason though with scarce any valuable talent but that of cunning and scarce any other ornament but that of beauty yet we pity her fate and sympathize with her distresses she died at the age of thirtynine after having reigned twentytwo years her death put an end to the monarchy in egypt which had flourished there for immemorial ages  augustus seemed much troubled at cleopatras death as it deprived him of a principal ornament in his intended triumph however the manner of it a good deal exalted her character among the romans with whom suicide was considered as a virtue her dying request was complied with her body being laid by anthonys and a magnificent funeral prepared for her and her two faithful attendants by the death of anthony augustus was now become complete master of the roman empire he soon after returned to rome in triumph where by sumptuous feasts and magnificent shows he began to obliterate the impressions of his former cruelty and from thence forward resolved to secure by his clemency a throne the foundations of which were laid in blood he was now at the head of the most extensive empire that mankind had ever concurred in obeying the former spirit of the romans and those characteristic marks that distinguished them from others was totally lost the city was now inhabited by a concourse from all the countries of the world and being consequently divested of all just patriotic principles perhaps a monarchy was the best form of government that could be found to unite its members however it is very remarkable that during these long contentions among themselves and these horrid devastations by civilwar the state was daily growing more formidable and powerful and completed the destruction of all the kings who presumed to oppose it a modern politician montesquiou  pretends to prove upon principle that this must be the case in every state long harrassed by civilwar in such a season says he the nobility the citizens the artisans the peasants in short the whole body of the people become soldiers and when peace has united all the contending parties this state enjoys great advantages over others whose subjects are generally citizens besides civilwars always produce great men as then is the season when merit is sought for and talents become conspicuous however this may be there never was a time when rome was so magnificent so populous and so refined the empire was now brought very near its utmost extent it contained in europe italy gaul spain greece illyrricum dacia pannonia britain and some part of germany in asia all those provinces which went under the name of asia minor together with armenia syria judaea mesopotamia and media in africa almost all those parts of it which were then supposed habitable namely egypt numidia mauritania and lybia the whole of their empire comprizing an extent of between three and four thousand miles in length and half as much in breadth as to the yearly revenues of the empire they have been computed to about forty millions of our money the number of the citizens amounted to four millions and sixtythree thousand men women and children a number at least four times greater than that of london at present the most populous city in the world as to the improvements in polite learning they exceeded all that preceded them and have never since been equalled besides virgil and horace and ovid poets whose names it is sufficient to mention livy the historian graced this period a writer whose works are as much superior to those of any other historian as the actions he undertook to record were greater without either pedantry or affectation it may be said that none have ever been comparable to him and in whatever point of view his books may be considered whether in point of accuracy eloquence or vigor of imagination he has set mankind a model of the grandest subject treated in the most becoming manner  chap iii from the death of anthony to the death of augustus on which an unlimited authority can be founded is called a regulation however as the greatest number of those that raise their fortunes assume new titles to authorize their power augustus resolved to conceal his new power under usual names and ordinary dignities he caused himself to be styled emperor to preserve authority over the army he made himself to be created tribune to manage the people and prince of the senate to govern there thus uniting in his own person so many different powers he charged himself also with the cares belonging to each separate department and while he did the greatest good to others fully gratified his ambition in the discharge of his duty in this manner the peoples interests and his ambition seemed to cooperate and while he governed all he let them imagine that they were governing themselves  for this purpose as he had gained the kingdom by his army he resolved to govern it by the senate this body though greatly fallen from their ancient splendor he knew to be the best ordered and most capable of wisdom and justice to these therefore he gave the chief power in the administration of his government while he still kept the people and the army steadfast to him by donatives and acts of favor by these means all the odium of justice fell upon the senate and all the populariy of pardon was solely his own thus restoring to the senate their ancient splendor and discountenancing all corruption he pretended to reserve to himself a very moderate share of authority which none could refuse him namely an absolute power to compel all ranks of the state to do their duty this in fact was reserving absolute dominion in his own hands but the misguided people began to look upon his moderation with astonishment they considered themselves as restored to their former freedom except in the capacity of promoting sedition and the senate supposed their power reestablished in all things but their tendency to injustice it was even said that the romans by such a government lost nothing of the happiness that liberty could produce and were exempt from all the misfortunes it could occasion this observation might have some truth under such a monarch as augustus now appeared to be but they were taught to change their sentiments under his successors when they found themselves afflicted with all the punishments that tyranny could inflict or sedition make necessary  after having established this admirable order augustus found himself agitated by different inclinations and considered a long time whether he should keep the empire or restore the people to their ancient liberty the examples of sylla and caesar variously operated upon him he considered that sylla who had voluntarily quitted the dictatorship died peaceably in the midst of his enemies and caesar who had kept it was assassinated by his most intimate friends who gloried in the action struggling with this troublesome uncertainty he discovered the disorder of his mind to his two principal friends agrippa and maecenas agrippa who had gained him the empire by his valor advised him to resign it either impelled by patriotism or a desire to seize upon what should be thus laid down maecenas however was of a contrary opinion this minister so famous for patronizing the men of genius of his time had much merit but was effeminate and tender more an admirer of the useful than the splendid virtues he was better satisfied with what benefited the people than raised their admiration besides he might have been influenced by selfinterested motives in the advice he gave for being more capable of advising than of acting and entirely formed for the cabinet he hoped to obtain those honors from a master which he could not force from the people with whom he must have raised himself by his own proper powers and acted with vigorous independance he therefore entreated augustus to consider rather what was advantageous to his country than alluring to himself he likened the republic to a ship fraught with passengers but totally destitute of a pilot he considered it as now grown almost a wreck though safely brought into harbor and in the utmost danger of sinking if once more pusht off from shore he described the empire as now too great and unwieldy to subsist without the most vigorous master and likely to fall into pieces under a variety of rulers to these he added a dissuasive perhaps still more prevailing namely the safety of the emperor which nothing but his present authority could secure those reasons prevailed upon a mind already too well inclined to preserve that power which it had so hardly labored to obtain from that time augustus adopted the advice of maecenas not only in this instance but on every other occasion by the instructions of that great minister he became gentle affable and humane by his advice it was that he set a resolution of never being concerned at what was said against him however in order to avoid obloquy as much as possible he encouraged men of learning and gave them much of his time and his friendship they in their turn relieved his most anxious hours and circulated his praise through the empire  thus having given peace and happiness to the empire and being convinced of the attachment of all the orders of the state to his person he resolved upon impressing the people with an idea of his magnanimity also this was nothing less than making a show of resigning his authority wherefore having previously instructed his creatures in the senate how to act he addressed them in a studied speech importing the difficulty of governing so extensive an empire a task which he said none but the immortal gods were equal to he modestly urged his own inability though impelled by every motive to undertake it and then with a degree of seeming generosity freely gave up all that power which as he observed his arms had gained and the senate had confirmed this power he repeatedly offered to restore giving them to understand that the true spirit of the romans was not lost in him this speech operated upon the senate variously as they were more or less in the secret many believed the sincerity of his professions and therefore regarded his conduct as an act of unequalled heroism by any thing that had hitherto appeared in rome others equally ignorant of his motives distrusted his designs some there were who having greatly suffered during the late popular commotions were fearful of having them renewed but the majority who were entirely devoted to his interests and instructed by his ministers frequently attempted to interrupt him while speaking and received his proposal with pretended indignation these unanimously besought him not to resign the administration but upon his continuing to decline their request they in a manner compelled him to comply however that his person might be in greater security they immediately decreed the pay of his guard to be doubled on the other hand that he might seem to make some concessions on his side he permitted the senate to govern the weak internal provinces of the empire while the most powerful provinces and those that required the greatest armies for their defense were taken entirely under his own command over these he assumed the government but for ten years leaving the people still in hopes of regaining their ancient freedom but at the same time laying his measures were so well that his government was renewed every ten years to his death  this show of a resignation only served to confirm him in the empire and the hearts of the people new honors were heaped upon him he was then first called augustus a name i have hitherto used as that by which he is best known in history a laurel was ordered to be planted at his gates his house was called the palace to distinguish it from that of ordinary citizens he was confirmed in the title of father of his country and his person declared sacred and inviolable in short flattery seemed on the rack to find out new modes of pleasing him but though he despised the arts of the senate he permitted their homage well knowing that among mankind titles produce a respect which enforces authority  upon entering into his tenth consulship the senate by oath approved of all their acts and set him wholly above the power of the laws they some time after offered to swear to not only all the laws he had made but such as he should make for the future it was then customary with fathers upon their deathbeds to command their children to carry oblations to the capitol with this inscription that at the day of their deaths they left augustus in health it was determined that no man should be put to death on such days as the emperor entered the city upon a dearth of provisions the people in a body entreated him to accept of the dictatorship but though he undertook to be procurator of the provisions yet he would by no means accept of the title of dictator which had been abolished by a law made when anthony was consul  this accumulation of titles and employments however did not in the least diminish his assiduity in filling the duties of each several very wholesome edicts were past by his command tending to suppress corruption in the senate and licentiousness in the people he ordained that none should exhibit a show of gladiators without orders from the senate and then no oftener than twice a year nor with more than a hundred and twenty at a time this law was extremely necessary at so corrupt a period of the empire when whole armies of these unfortunate men were brought at once upon the stage and compelled to fight often till half of them were slain it had been usual also with the knights and some women of the first distinction to exhibit themselves as dancers upon the theater he ordered that not only they but their children and grandchildren should be restrained from such exercises for the future he fined many that had refused to marry at a certain age and rewarded such as had many children he ordained that virgins should not be married till twelve years of age and permitted any person to kill an adulterer taken in the fact he enacted that the senate should be always held with great reverence adding to its authority what he had taken from its power he made a law that no man should have the freedom of the city without a previous examination into his merit and character he appointed new rules and limits to the manumission of slaves and was himself very strict in the observance of them with regard to players of whom he was very fond he severely examined their morals not allowing the least licentiousness in their lives nor indecency in their actions though he encouraged the athletic exercises yet he would not permit women to be present at them holding it unbecoming the modesty of the sex to be spectators of these sports which were performed by naked men in order to prevent bribery in suing for offices he took considerable sums of money from the candidates by way of pledge and if any indirect practices were proved against them they were obliged to forfeit all slaves had been hitherto disallowed to confess any thing against their own masters but he abolished the practice and first sold the slave to another which altering the property his examination became free these and many other laws all tending to reform vice or deter from crimes gave the manners of the people another complexion so that the rough character of the roman was now softened into that of the refined citizen  indeed his own example a good deal tended to humanize his fellow citizens for being placed above all equality he had nothing to fear from condescension wherefore he was familiar with all and suffered himself to be reprimanded with the most patient humility though he was by the single authority of his station capable of condemning or acquitting whomsoever he thought proper yet he gave the laws their proper course and even sometimes pleaded for those he desired to protect thus primus the governor of macedonia having a day assigned him for making war upon the odrisii a neighboring state as he said by the command of augustus the latter denied the charge upon which the advocate for primus desired to know with an insolent air what brought augustus into court or who had sent for him to this the emperor submissively replied the commonwealth an answer which greatly pleased the people upon another occasion one of his veteran soldiers entreated his protection in a certain cause but augustus taking little notice of his request desired him to apply to an advocate ah replied the soldier it was not by proxy i served you at the battle of actium this reply pleased augustus so much that he pleaded his cause in person and gained it for him he was extremely affable and returned the salutations of the meanest persons one day a person presented him a petition but with so much awe that augustus was displeased with his meanness what friend cried he you seem as if you were offering something to an elephant and not to a man be bolder one day as he was sitting on the tribunal in judgment maecenas perceiving by his temper that he was inclined to be severe attempted to speak to him but not being able to get up to the tribunal for the crowd he threw a paper into his lap on which was wrote arise executioner augustus read it without any displeasure and immediately rising pardoned those whom he was disposed to condemn but what most of all showed a total alteration in his disposition was his treatment of cornelius cinna pompeys grandson this nobleman had entered into a very dangerous conspiracy against him but the plot was discovered before it was ripe for execution augustus for some time debated with himself how to act but at last his clemency prevailed he therefore sent for those who were guilty and after reprimanding them dismissed them all but he was resolved to mortify cinna by the greatness of his generosity for addressing him in particular i have twice says he given you your life first as an enemy now as a conspirator i now give you the consulship let us therefore be friends for the future and let us only contend in showing whether my confidence or your fidelity shall be victorious this generosity which the emperor very happily timed had so good an effect that from that instant all conspiracies ceased against him  in the practice of such virtues as these he passed a long reign of above forty years in which the happiness of the people seemed to conspire with his own not but that there were wars in the distant provinces of the empire during almost the whole reign however they were rather the quelling of insurrections than the extending of dominions for he had made it a rule to carry on no operations in which ambition and not the safety of the state was concerned in fact he seemed the first roman who aimed at gaining a character by the arts of peace alone and who obtained the affections of the soldiers without any military talents of his own nevertheless the roman arms under his lieutenants were crowned with success the cantabrians in spain who had revolted were more than once quelled by tiberius his stepson agrippa his soninlaw and aelius lama who followed them to their inaccessible mountains there blocked them up and compelled them by famine to surrender at discretion the germans also gave some uneasiness by their repeated incursions into the territories of gaul but were repressed by lollius the rhetians were conquered by drusus the brother of tiberius the bessi and sialatae barbarous nations making an irruption into thrace were overthrown by piso governor of pamphylia who gained triumphal honors the dacians were repressed with more than one defeat the armenians also were brought into due subjection by caius his grandson the getulians in africa took up arms but were subdued by the consul caius cossus who thence received the surname of getulicus a dangerous war also was carried on against the dalmatians and pannonians who having acquired great strength by the continuance of a long peace gathered an army of two hundred thousand foot and nine thousand horse threatening rome itself with destruction levies were therefore made in italy with the utmost expedition the veteran troops were recalled from all parts and augustus went to arminium for the greater convenience of giving his directions and indeed though personal valor was by no means his most shining ornament yet no man could give wiser orders upon every emergency or go with greater dispatch into all parts of his dominions than he this war continued near three years being principally managed by tiberius and germanicus the latter of which gained great reputation against these fierce and barbarous multitudes upon their reduction bato their leader being summoned before the tribunal of tiberius and being demanded how he could offer to revolt against the power of rome the bold barbarian replied that the romans and not he were the aggressors since they had sent instead of dogs and shepherds to secure their flocks only but the war which was most fatal to the roman interests during this reign was that which was managed by quintillius varus this general invading the territories of the germans was induced to follow the enemy among their forests and marshes with his army in separate bodies there he was attacked by night and entirely cut off with his whole army these were the best and choicest legions of the whole empire either for valor discipline or experience the affliction from this defeat seemed to sink very deep upon the mind of augustus he was often heard to cry out in a tone of anguish quintillius varus restore me my legions and some historians pretend to say that he never after recovered the former serenity of his temper  but he had some uneasinesses of a domestic nature in his own family that contributed to distress him he had married livia the wife of tiberius nero by the consent of her husband at a time she was six months gone with child this was an imperious woman and conscious of being beloved she controlled him ever after at her pleasure she had two sons by her former husband tiberius the elder whom she greatly loved and drusus who was born three months after she had been married to augustus and who was thought to be his own son the eldest of these tiberius whom he afterward adopted and who succeeded him in the empire was a good general but of a suspicious and obstinate temper so that though he was serviceable to augustus in his foreign wars yet he gave him but little quiet at home he was at last obliged to go into exile for five years to the island of rhodes where he chiefly spent his time in a retired manner conversing with the greeks and addicting himself to literature of which however he made afterward but a bad use drusus the other son of livia died in his return from an expedition against the germans leaving augustus inconsolable for his loss but his greatest affliction was the conduct of his daughter julia whom he had by scribonia his former wife this woman whom he married to his general agrippa and after his death to tiberius set no bounds to her lewdness not contented with enjoying her pleasures she seemed also earnest in procuring the infamy of her prostitutions augustus for a long time would not believe the accounts he daily heard of her conduct but at last could not help observing them he found she was arrived at that excess of wantonness and prodigality that she had her nocturnal appointments in the most public parts of the city the very court were her father presided not being exempt from her debaucheries he at first had thoughts of putting her to death but after some consideration he banished her to pandataria forbidding her the use of wine and all such delicacies as could inflame her vicious inclinations he ordered also that no persons should come near her without his own permission and sent her mother scribonia with her to bear her company afterward whenever any attempted to intercede for julia his answer was that fire and water should sooner unite than he with her when some persons one day were more than usually urgent with him in her favor he was driven to such an extremity of passion as to wish that they might have such a daughter however she had two sons by agrippa named caius and lucius from whom great expectations were formed but they died when scarcely arrived at mans estate lucius about five years after his father at marseilles and caius two years after on his return to rome of a wound he had received in armenia thus augustus having in a great measure survived all his nerest relations at length in the seventyfourth year of his age began to think of retiring in good earnest from the fatigues of state and in some measure of constituting tiberius successor in his usual employments he desired the senate to salute him no longer at the palace according to their custom nor to take it amiss if for the future he could not converse with them as formerly from this in the campus martius it is said that an eagle flew round the emperor several times and directing its flight to a neighboring temple perched over the name of agrippa which was by the augurs conceived to portend the death of the emperor shortly after having accompanied tiberius in his march into illyria as far as beneventum he was taken ill at that town of a diarrhoea returning therefore from thence he came to nola near capua and there finding himself dangerously ill he sent for tiberius with the rest of his most intimate friends and acquaintance he did not continue long to indulge vain hopes of a recovery but convinced that his end was at hand patiently awaited its arrival a few hours before his death he ordered a lookingglass to be brought and his hair to be adjusted with more than usual care he then addressed his friends whom he beheld surrounding his bed and desired to know whether he had properly played his part in life to which being answered in the affirmative he cried out with his last breath then give me your applause and thus in the seventysixth year of his age after reigning fortyone he expired in the arms of livia bidding her remember their marriage and farewell  the death of the emperor when known caused inexpressible grief throughout the whole roman empire some thought that his wife livia had some hand in hastening it willing to procure the succession more speedily for her son however this be she took care for some time to keep it concealed having guarded all the passages to the palace sometimes giving out that he was recovered and then pretending a relapse at length having settled the succession to her mind she published the emperors death and at the same time the adoption of tiberius to the empire the emperors funeral was performed with great magnificence the senators being in their places tiberius on whom the care was devolved began a consolatory oration to them but suddenly stopped in the beginning of his speech as unable to restrain the violence of his sorrow and instead of continuing gave his notes to drusus his son who read them to the senate after this one of the late emperors freed men publicly read his will in the senate house wherein he made tiberius and livia his heirs and by that livia was likewise adopted into the julian family and honored with the name of augusta he gave considerable legacies to many private persons to the pretorian guards to the legionary soldiers and to all the citizens of rome but his resentment to his daughter julia continued even to the last he left her a small legacy indeed but would neither restore her to her family nor permit her to be buried in the sepulcher of her ancestors besides his will four other writings of his were produced one in which he had left instructions concerning his funeral another contained an enumeration of his several exploits a third comprised an account of the provinces forces and revenues of the empire and the fourth was a schedule of directions to tiberius for governing the empire among these it was found to be his opinion that no man how great a favorite soever he might be should be entrusted with too much authority lest it should induce him to turn tyrant another maxim was that none should desire to enlarge the empire which was already preserved with difficulty thus he seemed studious of serving his country to the very last and the sorrow of the people seemed equal to his assiduity it was decreed that all the women should mourn for him a whole year temples were erected to him divine honors were allowed him and one numerius atticus a senator willing to convert the adulation of the times to his own benefit received a large sum of money for swearing that he saw him ascending into heaven so that no doubt remained among the people concerning his divinity  such were the honors paid to augustus whose power began in the slaughter and terminated in the happiness of his subjects so that it was said of him that it had been good for mankind if he had never been born or if he never had died it is very probable that the cruelties exercised in his triumvirate were suggested by his colleagues or perhaps he thought in the case of caesars death that revenge was virtue certain it is that these severities were in some measure necessary to restore public tranquillity for until the roman spirit was entirely eradicated no monarchy could be secure he gave the government an air suited to the disposition of the times he indulged his subjects in the pride of seeing the appearance of a republic while he made them really happy in the effects of a most absolute monarchy guided by the most consummate prudence in this last virtue he seems to have excelled most monarchs and indeed could we separate octavius from augustus he would be one of the most faultless princes in history the long peace which his subjects enjoyed during his administration may be entirely ascribed to his moderation alone and about the middle of his reign the greatest part of mankind saw themselves at once professing obedience to one monarch and in perfect harmony with each other this was the time in which our savior christ came into the world to teach new laws and give new sanctions to the practice of every human virtue he was born in judea in the seven hundred and fiftysecond year of rome the twentyfifth of the reign of augustus and in the four thousand and third year of the world according to the common computation  chap iv tiberius the third emperor tiberius is perhaps the strongest  the first object of his suspicion when he came to the empire was agrippa posthumus the third and only remaining son of the general of that name by julia daughter of augustus this youth having rather imitated the licentiousness of his mother than the prudence of his father was banished by augustus into the island of planasium and was now murdered by the order of tiberius who pretended that it was done by the particular appointment of the late emperor who was solicitous for the safety of the succession he even carried his dissimulation so far that when the centurion who had executed his commands came with the account tiberius pretended that he had given no such command and that he should answer for his conduct before the senate however the business was hushed up soon after and no enquiry made after the murderer  as for the people in general they were now ready to suffer every injury without murmuring every order of the state was ambitious of slavery and only desirous of showing the extent of their obedience by the humility of their adulation all suits and petitions were now made to tiberius and he at the same time took care that nothing material should be done without his concurrence the senate was willing enough to give up the reins of government yet he had so much dissimulation in his nature as to wish to make his acceptance of them the greatest favor he began therefore in the senate with great art to descant on the extent of the roman empire and the difficulty of guiding it with proper skill he then alleged his own insufficiency for the task and hinted that no man could be a worthy successor to augustus however as the city was so happily ornamented with great numbers of wise and worthy men it would be more advisable for a number to unite their care and their councils than to lay the whole burden upon him alone the senate however skilled now only in the arts of adulation besought him in the most humble manner to accept of the government and not reject a task to which he alone was equal tiberius upon this pretending to be somewhat softened partly accepted their offers but alleged that he was unable to take the charge of the whole however at their request he declared himself willing to undertake the protection of any one part they assigned him whereupon asinius gallus demanded what part he was willing to take charge of this unexpected question quite confounded the dissembling emperor he for some time remained silent but recovering himself answered with a subtle reserve that it ill became him to choose any one part of that from which he begged a general exemption gallus who now perceived he had gone too far and who perhaps only put the question to flatter his vanity very readily brought himself off by saying that he did not offer that question as though he designed to divide what was in itself indissoluble but from his own confession to convince him that the commonwealth was but one body and was consequently to be actuated only by one soul at length tiberius seemingly overcome by the importunities and clamours of all around him yielded by degrees to their entreaties and at last condescended to take upon him the labor of the government purely to satisfy their wishes rather than his own adding however that he would keep it only till they should think fit to give repose to his old age  the consciousness of having deserved them when the senate offered to swear to obey all the ordinances which had not only been made but those he was about to enact hereafter he checked their vile adulation observing that all sublunary things were mutable and uncertain and the higher he was raised his state would only be the more exposed to danger he dissembled also great patience and moderation upon all occasions and though in the senate there past some things contrary to his will yet he seemed not in the least offended having learnt that some persons had spoken ill both of him and his government he showed no resentment but mildly replied that in a free city the tongues of men ought also to be free when the senate would have proceeded against some who had libelled him he would not consent alleging that he had greater and more useful employments than to embarrass himself with such trifling concerns adding that the best way of punishing such as defamed him was to make the account of his conduct uneasy to them and by retaliating their contempt when some governors had shown him a method of increasing his revenues he with indignation answered that a good shepherd ought to shear but never flea his flock he made many sumptuary edicts against taverns and places of public resort he punished dishonest matrons and even prohibited kissing by way of salutation he was very vigilant in suppressing robberies and seditions and caused justice to be duly and regularly administered in all the towns of italy he also behaved in a very respectful manner to the senate and in the beginning did nothing of moment without their advice and approbation they on their parts continually forced upon him the most extravagant praises so that no prince was ever more flattered than he nor is it an improbable conjecture to suppose that this adulation served greatly to pejorate his mind and to make him more boldly throw aside the mask of dissimulation  the successes of germanicus first brought his natural dispositions to light and discovered the malignity of his mind without disguise he was scarce well settled on his throne when he received intelligence that the legions in pannonia hearing of the death of augustus and desirous of novelty had revolted but these were soon quieted and percennius their leader slain but a commotion in germany was attended with much more important consequences the legions in that part of the empire were conducted by germanicus the son of drusus late brother of tiberius a youth of most admirable qualities and who had been at the late emperors request adopted to succeed to the empire the legions under his command had taken the opportunity of his absence to revolt and now boldly began to affirm that the whole roman empire was in their power and that its principal grandeur was owing to the success of their arms wherefore when germanicus was returned they unanimously resolved to choose him emperor this general was the darling of the soldiers and almost idolized by them so that he might with very little difficulty have raised himself to the highest dignity in the state but his duty prevailed over his ambition he rejected their offers with the utmost indignation and used the most indefatigable endeavors to oppose the sedition this he effected though with extreme hazard by cutting off many of the principal revolters and then by leading the troops against the germans who were considered as the common enemies of the empire  tiberius was as much pleased with the loyalty of germanicus as he was distressed at his superior popularity his success also immediately after against the germans only still more excited the emperors envy and private disgust he overthrew the enemy in several battles subduing many wild and extensive countries the angrivarii the cherusci and the chatti with other fierce nations beyond the rhine among his other conquests it was not considered as the least honorable that of recovering the standards that had been taken from the unfortunate varus and erecting trophies to the memory of his own legions in those very wilds in which the legions of the former were slain upon one of the monuments of his victories he placed a modest inscription mentioning only the people that were conquered and the army which made the conquest entirely omitting his own name either willing to avoid envy or sensible that posterity would supply the defect  all these victories however only served to inflame the emperors jealousy and every virtue in the general now became a new cause of offense this dislike first began to appear by tiberius making use of every pretense to draw germanicus from the legions but he was for a while obliged to postpone his purpose upon account of a domestic insurrection which was made in italy by one clemens who had been a slave to the young agrippa that was slain this adventurer being about the same age and in person very much resembling his late master took upon him his name and caused it to be reported in all parts of italy that claim and now and then appearing in different parts of the country when he could do it with safety tiberius however knew but too well the imposture and was resolved to oppose fraud on his side to that of this young pretender accordingly two soldiers were employed who were to find him out and by pretending an attachment to his person seize him upon the first opportunity this commission they executed with punctuality and success clemens was taken prisoner and brought before tiberius who sternly demanded how he came to be agrippa to which the other as boldly replied by the same arts with which you have become caesar tiberius finding by his resolution that it was vain to expect any discovery from him of his accomplices resolved to put him immediately to death however such were his apprehensions from the people that he would not punish him publicly but ordered him to be conveyed to a secret apartment in the palace and there to be executed in private  being now rid of his domestic enemy he began to consult on the most specious means of bringing home germanicus from the legions in germany for this an invasion of the parthians offered him the fairest opportunity these fierce and unconquerable people having slain two of their own kings and having refused to accept one who had been an hostage at rome and was it seems the lawful successor they broke the peace which had been ratified in the reign of augustus and invaded armenia a kingdom tributary to the empire tiberius was not displeased at this invasion as it gave him a pretext for recalling germanicus from those legions which were too much devoted to his interest he first therefore began by procuring him a triumph for his victory in germany and then by writing to him to return in order to enjoy these honors which the senate had decreed adding that he had reaped enough of glory in a country where he had been sent nine times and had been every time victorious concluding that the number of triumphs was sufficient and that the most signal vengeance that could be inflicted on them was their being permitted to carry on their own intestine commotions to all these specious civilities germanicus made no direct reply but earnestly entreated the continuance of his command for one year longer only to finish the enterprises he had begun tiberius however was too well skilled in dissimulation not to prevail upon him by a repetition of pretended honors he offered him the consulship and desired him to execute the office in person so that germanicus had no longer any pretenses for refusing thus finding the season very far advanced he delayed his return no longer and he was met many miles out of the city by infinite multitudes who received him rather with marks of adoration than respect the gracefulness of his person his triumphal chariot in which were carried his five children and the recovered standards of the army of varus threw the people into a phrenzy of joy and admiration tiberius though inwardly repining seemed to join in the general rapture he gave the people in the name of germanicus three hundred sesterces each man and the succeeding year made him his colleague in the consulship however his aim was to send him to a distance from rome where his popularity was now become odious to him and yet not to give him such command as could at any time be turned against himself wherefore the parthian invasion was now very convenient for his designs and besides there now offered other pretexts for sending him into asia which might be considered as no better than specious banishment antiochus king of comagena and philopater king of cicilia being both dead some differences arose in those nations to the prejudice of the romans at the same time also syria and judaea overburthened with taxes made earnest supplications for redress these therefore appeared to be objects worthy the attention of germanicus and tiberius was not wanting in urging before the senate the necessity there was of his presence in that quarter of the empire in consequence of this all the provinces of asia were readily decreed to germanicus and a greater power given him than had been granted to any governor before but tiberius to restrain this power had sent cneius piso governor into syria having dispossessed silenus of that office this piso was a person of a furious and headstrong temper and in every respect fit to execute those fatal purposes for which he was designed his instructions were to oppose germanicus upon every occasion and to excite all the hatred against him which without suspicion he could and even to procure his death if an opportunity should offer  more employed in executing the business of his commission than in counteracting the private designs of piso in a short time he replaced the king of armenia who was a friend to the romans and reduced cilicia and comagena into roman provinces placing praetors there to collect the taxes due to the empire he soon after obliged the king of parthia to sue for peace which was granted him much to the advantage and honor of rome however piso and his wife plancina who is recorded as one of an implacable and cruel disposition continued to defame him and openly to tax all his proceedings these efforts of ineffective malice were quite disregarded germanicus only opposed patience and condescension to all their invectives and with that gentleness which was peculiar to him repaid their resentment by courtesy he was not ignorant of their motives and was rather willing to evade than oppose their enmity wherefore he took a voyage into egypt under a pretense of viewing the celebrated antiquities of the place but in reality to avoid the machinations of piso and those of his wife which were still more dangerous however upon his return he fell sick and whether from a mind previously alarmed or from more apparent marks of treachery he sent to let piso know that he broke off all further connexions and friendship with him a short interval of convalescence restored the hopes of his friends and the citizens of antioch prepared to offer sacrifices for his recovery however piso with his lictors disturbed their solemnities and drove off their victims from the foot of the altars in the mean time germanicus grew daily worse and his death now began to appear inevitable whereupon finding his end approaching he addressed his friends who stood round his bed to the following effect had my death been natural i might have reason to complain of being thus snatched away from all the endearments of life at so early an age but now my complaints are aggravated in falling the victim of piso and plancinas treachery let the emperor therefore i conjure you know the manner of my death and the tortures i suffer those that loved me when living those even that envied my fortune will feel some regret when they hear of a soldier who had so often escaped the rage of the enemy falling a sacrifice to the treachery of a woman plead then my cause before the people you will be heard with pity and if my murderers should pretend to have acted by command they will either receive no credit or no pardon as he spoke these words he stretched forth his hand which his weeping friends tenderly pressing most earnestly vowed that they would sooner lose their lives than their revenge the dying prince then turning to his wife conjured her by his memory and all the bonds of nuptial love to submit to the necessity of the times and to evade the resentment of her more powerful enemies by not opposing it thus much he said openly something more was uttered in private intimating as was supposed his fears from the empetors cruelty and shortly after he expired nothing could exceed the distress of the whole empire upon hearing of the death of germanicus but the people of rome seemed to put no bounds to their distress a vacation was made in all public and domestic duties the streets were filled with lamentations the people cast stones at their temples and flung down their altars while newborn infants were exposed as objects not worthy parental attention in this universal distress so much was the spirit of the people now changed from its former fortitude and equality they now were so accustomed to place their happiness in paying homage to their masters that they considered the safety of the state as comprised in an individual in fact the community was now composed of persons who had lately received their freedom or of such indolent and idle people as lived at the expense of the public treasure these were therefore sensible of nothing but their own imbecility and afflicted themselves like children for evils which were only suggested by their fears  in this universal distress piso seemed marked for destruction historians in general charge him and his wife with the death of germanicus it is now too remote a period to controvert their testimony however the general accusation of their giving him a slow poison is one of those imputations that seems to have but little foundation the belief of slow poisons is now much disputed it being in general supposed by physicians that it is not in the power of art to regulate the duration of their effect let this be as it will not only piso and his wife but even the emperor himself with his mother livia incurred a share of the general suspicions these were soon after greatly increased by the arrival of agrippina the widow of germanicus a woman in high esteem for her virtue who appeared bearing the ashes of her husband and attended by all her children as she approached the city she was met by the senate and the whole body of the people of rome with a strange mixture of acclamation and distress the veteran soldiers many of whom had served under germanicus gave the sincerest testimonies of their concern the whole multitude while the ashes were depositing in the tomb of augustus at first regarded the ceremony in profound silence but shortly after all of a sudden broke out into loud lamentations crying that the commonwealth was now no more  tiberius whose jealousy had some reason to be alarmed at this effeminate excess of sorrow used all his art to hide his anger and make a show of sharing in the general calamity he even permitted the accusation of piso who was supposed to be merely the instrument of his vengeance this general having returned to rome shortly after presuming on the great favor he was in with the emperor was accused before the senate in behalf of agrippina and her friends of the death of germanicus and several other crimes particularly his cruelty to good men and his corrupting the legions were laid to his charge  piso either conscious of his innocence or seeing the inefficacy of any defense against the tide of popularity vindicated himself but weakly against every part of the charge however the poisoning of germanicus could not be made appear evident enough to satisfy his judges who seemed to take part against him his trial was therefore drawn out to a greater length than was expected but in the mean time he cut it short by putting an end to his life in his own house his wife plancina who was universally believed to be most culpable escaped punishment by the interest of livia so that all disturbances raised upon this account by degrees subsided  about a year after the death of germanicus tiberius took his own son drusus as a colleague with him in the consulship and willing to initiate him into business betimes left him in the government of the city while he himself retired under the pretense of indisposition about this time several nations of the gauls revolted being unable to endure the heavy tributes which the emperor had lately imposed upon them the principal leaders in this revolt were florus and sacrovir who were so successful in the beginning that the fame of their successes spread consternation even as far as rome caius silius however marched with the roman legions to oppose them and gained a great and decisive victory a revolt also happened about this time in numidia under tacfarinas who had rebelled once before but he was now in some measure brought under by blaesus who in consequence had received the honor of being saluted imperator by the permission of tiberius  hitherto tiberius had kept within bounds he was frugal just in the distribution of offices a rigid punisher of injustice in others and an example of temperance to his luxurious court but now from the ninth year of his reign it is that historians begin to trace the bloody effects of his suspicious temper  having now no object of jealousy to keep him in awe he began to pull off the mask and appear more in his natural character than before he no longer adopted that wisest maxim the truth of which has familiarized it into a proverb that honesty is the best policy with him judgment justice and extent of thinking were converted into slyness artifice and expedients adapted to momentary conjunctures he took upon himself the interpretation of all political measures and gave morals whatever color he chose by the finedrawn speculations of his own malicious mind he began daily to diminish the authority of the senate which design was much facilitated by their own aptitude to slavery so that he despised their meanness while he enjoyed its effects a law at that time subsisted which made it treason to form any injurious attempt against the majesty of the people tiberius assumed to himself the interpretation and enforcement of this law and extended it not only to the cases which really affected the safety of the state but to every conjuncture that could possibly be favorable to his hatred or suspicions all freedom was now therefore banished from convivial meetings and diffidence reigned amongst the dearest relations the gloomy disposition and insincerity of the prince were diffused through all ranks of men friendship had the air of an allurement to betray and a fine genius was but a shining indiscretion even virtue itself was only considered as an impertinent intruder that only served to remind the people of their lost happiness  the law of offended majesty being revived the first of note that fell a sacrifice to it was cremutius cordus who in his annals of the roman empire had called brutus the last of the romans it is also thought he had given offense to sejanus the emperors favorite by too great liberty in private conversation this brave man seeing his death resolved upon defended himself in the senate with great force and undaunted resolution then going home he resolved to defeat the malice of the tyrant by a voluntary death and refused taking any manner of sustenance the informers who perceived that he was upon the point of depriving them of their reward presented their complaints to the senate signifying his intententions of escaping justice however while their petitions continued under deliberation cremutius as seneca expresses it pronounced his own absolution by dying  in the beginning of these cruelties tiberius took into his confidence sejanus a roman knight who found out the method of gaining his confidence by the most refined degree of dissimulation being an over match for his master in his own arts this favorite minister by birth a volscian was close and subtle in his designs but bold and aspiring in his attempts modest to outward appearance but concealing an ambition that knew no bounds he was so secure in the affections of the emperor that though ever reserved and secret to others he was entirely open and explicit with him he was made by the emperor captain of the praetorian guards one of the most confidential trusts in the state and extolled in the senate as a worthy associate in his labors the servile senators with ready adulation set up the statues of the favorite beside those of tiberius and seemed eager to pay him similar honors it is not well known whether he was the adviser of all the cruelties that ensued soon after but certain it is that from the beginning of his ministry tiberius seemed to become more fatally suspicious  it was from such humble beginnings that this minister even ventured to aspire at the throne and was resolved to make the emperors foolish confidence one of the first steps to his ruin however he considered that cutting off tiberius alone would rather retard than promote his designs while his son drusus and the children of germanicus were yet remaining he therefore began by corrupting livia the wife of drusus whom after having debauched he prevailed upon to poison her husband this was effected by means of a slow poison as we are told which gave his death the appearance of a casual distemper tiberius in the mean time either naturally phlegmetic or at best not much regarding his son bore his death with great tranquillity he was even heard to jest upon the occasion for when the ambassadors from troy came somewhat late with their compliments of condolence he answered their pretended distresses by condoling with them also upon the loss of hector  sejanus having succeeded in this was resolved to make his next attempt upon the children of germanicus who were undoubted successors to the empire however he was frustrated in his designs both with regard to the fidelity of their governors and the chastity of agrippina their mother whereupon he resolved upon changing his aims and removing tiberius out of the city by which means he expected more frequent opportunities of putting his designs into execution he therefore used all his address to persuade tiberius to retire to some agreeable retreat remote from rome by this he expected many advantages since there could be no access to the emperor but by him thus all letters being conveyed to the prince by soldiers at his own devotion they would pass through his hands by which means he must in time become the sole governor of the empire and at last be in a capacity of removing all obstacles to his ambition he now therefore began to insinuate to tiberius the great and numerous inconveniences of the city the fatigues of attending the senate and the seditious temper of the inferior citizens of rome tiberius either prevailed upon by his persuasions or pursuing the natural turn of his temper which led to indolence and debauchery in the twelfth year of his reign left rome and went into campania under pretense of dedicating temples to jupiter and augustus after this though he removed to several places he never returned to rome but spent the greatest part of his time in the island of caprea a place which was rendered as infamous by his pleasures as detestable by his cruelties which were shocking to human nature for having in pursuance of his intentions dedicated the temples which he had built in campania he published an edict forbidding all persons to disturb his repose and stopped the concourse of his subjects by placing soldiers in the ways which led to his palace but still growing weary of places where mankind might follow him with their complaints and distresses he withdrew himself as was said into that most delightful island of caprea three miles from the continent and opposite naples buried in this retreat he gave himself up to his pleasures quite regardless of the miseries of his subjects thus an insurrection of the jews upon placing his statue in jerusalem under the government of pontius pilate gave him no sort of uneasiness the falling of an amphitheatre at fidenae in which fifty thousand persons were either killed or wounded no way affected his repose he was only employed in studying how to vary his odious pleasures and forcing his feeble frame shattered by age and former debaucheries into the enjoyment of them nothing can present a more horrid picture than the retreat of this impure old man attended in this place by all the ministers of his perverted appetites he was at this time sixtyseven years old his person was most displeasing and some say the disagreeableness of it in a great measure drove him into retirement he was quite bald before his face was all broke out into ulcers and covered over with plasters his body was bowed forward while its extreme height and leanness increased its deformity with such a person and a mind still more hideous being gloomy suspicious and cruel he sat down with a view rather of forcing his appetites than satisfying them he spent whole nights in debaucheries baucheries at the table and he appointed pomponius flaccus and lucius piso to the first posts of the empire for no other merit than that of having sat up with him two days and two nights without interruption these he called his friends of all hours he made one novelius torgnatus a praetor for being able to drink off five bottles of wine at a draught his luxuries of another kind were still more detestable and seemed to increase with his drunkenness and glutonny he made the most eminent women of rome subservient to his lusts and all his inventions only seemed calculated how to make his vices more extravagant and abominable here he invented rooms adapted to his libidinous exercises where he made use of all manner of incentives which nothing but the depraved imagination of a tyrant could delight in the numberless obscene medals dug up in that island at this day bear witness at once to his shame and the veracity of the historians who have described his debaucheries in short in this retreat which was surrounded with rocks on every side he quite gave up the business of the empire or if he was ever active it was only to do mischief  in fact it had been happy for mankind had he given up his suspicions when he declined the fatigues of reigning and resigned the will to do harm when he divested himself of the power of doing good but from the time of his retreat he became more cruel and sejanus always endeavored to increase his distrusts secret spies and informers were placed in all parts of the city who converted the most harmless actions into subjects of offense if any person of merit testified any concern for the glory of the empire it was immediately construed into a design to obtain it if another spoke with regret of former liberty he was supposed to aim at reestablishing the commonwealth every action became liable to forced interpretations joy expressed an hope of the princes death melancholy an envying of his prosperity sejanus found his aims every day succeeding the wretched emperors terrors were an instrument that he wrought upon at his pleasure and by which he levelled every obstacle to his designs but the chief objects of his jealousy were the children of germanicus whom he resolved to put out of the way he therefore sedulously continued to render them obnoxious to the emperor to alarm him with false reports of their ambition and to terrify them with alarms of his intended cruelty by these means he so contrived to widen the breach that he actually produced on both sides those dispositions which he pretended to obviate till at length the two princes nero and drusus were declared enemies to the state and afterward starved to death in prison while agrippina their mother was sent into banishment  in consequence of their pretended crimes many others lost their lives sabinus who was attached to their interests was accused and condemned by a most vile combination of informers against him asinius gallus was sentenced to remain in prison only to increase the rigor of his punishment by a lingering death syriacus was condemned and executed merely for being a friend to the latter in this manner sejanus proceeded removing all who stood between him and the empire and every day increasing in confidence with tiberius and power with the senate the number of his statues exceeded even those of the emperor people swore by his fortune in the same manner as they would have done had he been actually upon the throne and he was more dreaded than even the tyrant who actually enjoyed the empire but the rapidity of his rise seemed only preparatory to the greatness of his downfall all we know of his first disgrace with the emperor is that satrius secundus was the man who had the boldness to accuse him antonia the mother of germanicus seconded the accusation what were the particulars of his crimes we now cannot learn but certain it is that he attempted to usurp the empire by aiming at the life of tiberius he was very near dispatching him when his practices were discovered and his own life was very opportunely substituted to that against which he aimed tiberius sensible of the traitors power proceeded with his usual dissimulation in having him apprehended he granted him new honors at the very time he resolved his death and took him as his colleague in the consulship the emperors letter to the senate began only with slight complaints against his friend but ended with an order for putting him in prison he entreated the senators to protect a poor old man as he was abandoned by all and in the mean time prepared ships for his flight and ordered soldiers for his security the senate who had long been jealous of the favourites power and dreaded his cruelty immediately took this opportunity of going beyond their orders instead of sentencing him to imprisonment they directed his execution a strange revolution now appeared in the city of those numbers that but a moment before were pressing into the presence of sejanus with offers of service and adulation not one was found that would seem to be of his acquaintance he was deserted by all and those who had formerly received the greatest benefits from him seemed now converted into his most inveterate enemies as he was conducting to execution the people loaded him with insult and execration he attempted to hide his face with his hands but even this was denied him and his hands were secured he was pursued with sarcastic reproaches his statues were instantly thrown down and he himself shortly after strangled by the executioner nor did the rage of his enemies subside with his death his body was ignominiously dragged about the streets and his whole family executed with him such was the end of sejanus a striking example of the instability of every favourites power and the precariousness of every tyrants friendship  his death only lighted up the emperors rage for further executions plancina the wife of piso was put to death as little pitied as the former sextus vestilius shared the same fate as it was pretended for having written a satire against caligula the only surviving son of germanicus but his real fault was that his severe virtues were become intolerable to the vicious emperor vescularius atticus and julius marinus formerly the inseparable friends of tiberius and who had been his companions in rhodes were now executed by his command for being attached to sejanus and mamercus scaurus was also obliged to prevent his execution by suicide for having written a tragedy upon the story of atreus the suspicious emperor applied to himself the invective that was alleged against tyrants in general and declared in a rage that if he was become an atreus he would compel the author to become an ajax vitia an aged woman was put to death only for having lamented the execution of her son fufius and his wife publia being accused of treason against the emperor were obliged to prevent their condemnation by suicide confidius proculus as he was cheerfully employed amongst his friends in celebrating his birthday found himself in an instant dragged before the senate accused of conspiring against the emperor condemned and executed the whole family of theophanes was treated with the same cruel expedition sextus marius found his riches and the beauty of his daughter sufficient causes to procure his conviction and death the prisons were crowded with pretended accomplices in the conspiracy of sejanus tiberius began to grow weary of particular executions he therefore gave orders that all the accused should be put to death together without further examination the whole city was filled with slaughter and mourning the place of execution was a deplorable scene where persons of every sex and age were exposed racked and mangled dead bodies putrefying lay heaped on each other while even the friends of the wretched convicts were denied the satisfaction of weeping thus miserable were the romans under the arbitrary rod of this gloomy tyrant no person though ever so virtuous could be safe or rather every virtue was but an approach to new dangers of twenty senators whom he chose for his council he put sixteen to death let them hate me cried he so long as they obey me he even averred that priam was an happy man who outlived all his posterity in this manner there was not a day without some barbarous execution in which the sufferers were obliged to underdergo the most shameful indignities and exquisite torments when one carnulius had killed himself to avoid the torture ah cried tiberius how has that man been able to escape me when a prisoner earnestly entreated that he would not defer his death no cried the tyrant i am not sufficiently your friend to shorten your torment sometimes he was more jocose in his cruelties particularly when a certain man stopping an hearse desired the dead body to tell augustus that his legacies to the people were yet unpaid tiberius sent for him and having paid him his share caused him to be immediately executed bidding him go tell augustus that he at least had been satisfied one would have thought that such cruelties exercised at rome would have satiated his love of vengeance but caprea itself the place secluded for his pleasures and his ease was daily contaminated not less with his cruelties than his debauchery he often satisfied his eyes with the tortures of the wretches who were put to death before him and in the days of suetonius the rock was to be seen from which he ordered such as had displeased him to be thrown headlong as he was one day examining some persons upon the rack he was told that an old friend of his was come from rhodes to see him tiberius supposing him brought for the purposes of information immediately ordered him to the torture and when he was convinced of his mistake he ordered him to be to put to death to prevent farther discovery  in this manner did the tyrant continue to torment others although he was himself still more tortured by his own suspicions in one of his letters to the senate he confessed that the gods and goddesses had so afflicted and confounded him that he knew not what or how to write and in fact he had every reason for such a confession a plotting senate a reviling people his bodily infirmities increased by his luxuries and his nearest friends conscious of being suspected the domestic policy of the empire also was in the hands of miscreants and the frontier provinces were invaded with impunity mesia was seized on by the dacians and sarmatians gaul was wasted by the germans and armenia conquered by the king of parthia these were losses that might excite the vigilance of any other governor but tiberius he however was so much a slave to his brutal appetites that he left his provinces wholly to the care of his lieutenants and they were intent rather on the accumulation of private fortune than the safety of the state such a total disorder in the empire might be naturally supposed to produce a degree of anxiety in him who governed it so that he was heard to wish that heaven and earth might perish with him when he died  in this manner he lived odious to all the world and troublesome to himself an enemy to the lives of others and a tormentor of his own at length however in the twentysecond year of his reign he began to feel the approaches of his dissolution and all his appetites totally to forsake him he now therefore found it was time to think of a successor and hesitated for a long while whether he should choose caligula whose vices were too apparent to escape his observation he had been often heard to say that this youth had all the faults of sylla without his virtues that he was a serpent that would sting the empire and a phaeton that would set the world in a flame however notwithstanding all his wellgrounded apprehensions he named him for his successor willing perhaps by the enormity of caligulas conduct to cover the memory of his own  but though he thought fit to choose a successor he could by no means think of dying though totally forsaken by his appetites and enjoyments his dissimulation never forsook him he therefore concealed his approaching decline with the utmost care as if he was willing at once to hide it from the world and himself he long had a contempt for physic and refused the advice of such as attended him he even seemed to take a pleasure in being present at the sports of the soldiers and ventured himself to throw a javelin at a boar that was let loose before him the effort which he made upon this occasion caused a pain in his side which hastened the approaches of death still however he seemed willing to avoid his end and strove by change of place to put off the inquietude of his own reflections he left his favorite island and went upon the continent he at last fixed at the promontory of misenum in a house that formerly had belonged to lucullus it was here that charicles his physician pretending to kiss his hand felt the failure of his pulse and apprized macro the emperors present favorite that he had not above two days to live tiberius on the contrary who had perceived the art of charicles did all in his power to impress his attendants with an opinion of his health he continued at table till the evening he saluted all his guests as they left the room and read the acts of the senate in which they had absolved some persons he had written against with great indignation he resolved to take signal vengeance of their disobedience and meditated new schemes of cruelty when he fell into such faintings as all believed were fatal it was in this situation that by macros advice caligula prepared to secure the succession he received the congratulations of the whole court he caused himself to be acknowledged by the praetorian soldiers and went forth from the emperors apartment amidst the applauses of the multitude when all of a sudden he was informed that the emperor was recovered that he had begun to speak and desired to eat this unexpected account filled the whole court with terror and alarm every one who had before been earnest in testifying their joy now reassumed their pretended sorrow and left the new emperor through a feigned solicitude for the fate of the old caligula himself seemed thunderstruck he preserved a gloomy silence expecting nothing but death instead of the empire at which he had aspired macro however who was hardened in crime ordered that the dying emperor should be dispatched by smothering him with pillows or as others will have it by poison in this manner tiberius died in the seventyeighth year of his age after reigning twentytwo  estranged from their integrity and honor their whole study seemed to be how to invent new ways of flattering the emperor and various methods of tormenting his supposed enemies the people were still more corrupt they had for some years been accustomed to live in idleness upon the donations of the emperor and being satisfied with subsistence entirely gave up their freedom too effeminate and cowardly to go to war they only railed against their governors so that they were bad soldiers and seditious citizens it is not to be wondered at therefore that such indifferent subjects should be indifferently governed it has been often asked how so many of the emperors were bad princes the answer is easy  because the people they had brought to command were ill disposed to obey good subjects generally make good kings while luxury sedition discontent and murmurs in the populace as usually produce severity cruelty and suspicion in him who is appointed to govern little more need be said of these times but that in the eighteenth year of this monarchs reign christ was crucified as if the universal depravity of mankind wanted no less a sacrifice than that of god himself to reclaim them shortly after his death pilate wrote to tiberius an account of his passion resurrection and miracles upon which the emperor made a report of the whole to the senate desiring that christ might be accounted a god by the romans but the senate being displeased that the proposal had not come first from themselves refused to allow of his apotheosis alleging an ancient law which gave them the superintendance in all matters of religion they even went so far as by an edict to command that all christians should leave the city but tiberius by another edict threatened death to all such as should accuse them by which means they continued unmolested during the rest of his reign  chap v caligula the fourth emperor of rome no monarch ever came to the throne with more advantages than caligula he was the son of germanicus who had been the darling of the army and the people he was bred among the soldiers from whom he received the name of caligula from the short buskin called caliga that was worn by the common sentinels and which was also usually worn by him he succeeded a merciless tyrant after whom even moderate merit would look like excellence wherefore as he approached rome the principal men of the state went out in crowds to meet him he received the congratulations of the people on every side all equally pleased in being free from the cruelties of tiberius and in hoping new advantages from the virtues of his successor  caligula seemed to take every precaution to impress them with the opinion of an happy change amidst the rejoicings of the multitude he advanced mourning with the dead body of tiberius which the soldiers brought to be burnt at rome according to the custom of that time upon his entrance into the city he was received with new titles of honor by the senate whose chief employment seemed now to be the art of increasing their emperors vanity he was left coheir with gemellus grandson to tiberius but they set aside the nomination and declared caligula sole successor to the empire the joy for this election was not confined to the narrow bounds of italy it spread through the whole empire and victims without number were sacrificed upon the occasion some of the people upon his going into the island of campania made vows for his return and shortly after when he fell sick the multitude crowded whole nights round his palace and some even devoted themselves to death in case he recovered setting up bills of their resolutions in the streets in this affection of the citizens strangers themselves seemed ambitious of sharing artabanus king of parthia who took every method of contemning his predecessor sought the present emperors alliance with assiduity he came to a personal conference with one of his legates he passed the euphrates he adored the roman eagles and kissed the emperors images so that the whole world seemed combined to praise him for virtues which their hopes and not their experience had given him  thus all the enormities of this emperor were concealed in the beginning of his reign he at first seemed extremely careful of the public and having performed the funeral solemnities of tiberius he hastened to the islands of pandataria and pontia to remove the ashes of his mother and brothers exposing himself to the danger of tempestuous weather to give a luster to his piety having brought them to rome he ordained annual solemnities in their honor and ordered the month of september to be called germanicus in memory of his father these ceremonies being over he conferred the same honors upon his grandmother antonia which had before been given to livia and ordered all informations to be burnt that any ways exposed the enemies of his family he even refused a paper that was offered him tending to the discovery of a conspiracy against him alleging that he was conscious of nothing to deserve any mans hatred and therefore had no fears from their machinations he caused the institutions of augustus which had been disused in the reign of tiberius to be revived he undertook to reform many abuses in the state and severely punished corrupt governors among others he banished pontius pilate into gaul where this unjust magistrate afterward put an end to his life by suicide he strictly inspected the behavior of the knights whom he publicly degraded upon being found guilty of any infamous crime  he banished without remission the spintriae or inventors of abominable recreations from rome he attempted to restore the ancient manner of electing magistrates by the suffrages of the people and gave them a free jurisdiction without any appeal to himself although the will of tiberius was annulled by the senate and that of livia suppressed by tiberius yet he caused all their legacies to be punctually paid and in order to make gemellus amends for missing the crown he caused him to be elected princeps juventutis or principal of the youth he restored some kings to their dominions who had been unjustly dispossessed by tiberius and gave them the arrears of their revenues and that he might appear an encourager of every virtue he ordered a female slave a large sum of money for enduring the most exquisite torments without discovering the secrets of her master so many concessions and such apparent virtue could not fail of receiving just applause a shield of gold bearing his image was decreed to be carried annually to the capitol attended by the senate and the sons of the nobility singing in praise of the emperors virtues it was likewise ordained that the day on which he was appointed to the empire should be called pubitia implying that when he came to govern the city received a new foundation  but it had been happy for him and the empire had such a beginning been as strenuously maintained in less than eight months all this show of moderation and clemency vanished while furious passions unexampled avarice and capricious cruelty began to take their turn in his mind as most of the cruelties of tiberius arose from suspicion so most of those committed by caligula took rise from prodigality some indeed pretend to assert that a disorder which happened soon after his accession to the empire entirely distorted his reason and discomposed his understanding however this may be madness itself could scarce dictate cruelties more extravagant or inconsistencies more ridiculous than are imputed to him some of them appear almost beyond belief as they seem entirely without any motive to incite such barbarities  the first object of his cruelty and one that will scarcely be regretted by posterity was a person named politus who had devoted himself to death in case the emperor who was then sick should recover when caligulas health was reestablished he was informed of the zeal of politus and actually compelled him to complete his vow this ridiculous devotee was therefore led round the city by children adorned with chaplets and then put to death being thrown headlong from the ramparts another named secundus had vowed to fight in the amphitheatre upon the same occasion to this he was also compelled the emperor himself choosing to be a spectator of the combat however he was more fortunate than the former being so successful as to kill his adversary by which he obtained a release from his vow gemellus was the next who suffered from the tyrants inhumanity the pretense against him was that he had wished the emperor might not recover and that he had taken a counterpoison to secure him from any secret attempts against his life caligula ordered him to kill himself but as the unfortunate youth was ignorant of the manner of doing it the emperors messengers soon instructed him in the fatal lesson silenus the emperors fatherinlaw was the next that was put to death upon slight suspicions and grecinus a senator of noted integrity refusing to witness falsely against him shared his fate after followed a crowd of victims to the emperors avarice or suspicion the pretext against them was their enmity to his family and in proof of his accusations he produced these very memorials which but a while before he pretended to have burnt among the number of those who were sacrificed to his jealousy was macro the late favorite of tiberius and the person to whom caligula owed his empire he was accused of many crimes some of which were common to the emperor as well as to him and his death brought on the ruin of his whole family  these cruelties however only seemed the first fruits of a mind naturally timid and suspicious his vanity and profusion soon gave rise to others which were more attrocious as they sprung from less powerful motives his pride first began by assuming to himself the title of ruler which was usually granted only to kings he would also have taken the crown and diadem had he not been advised that he was already superior to all the monarchs of the world not long after he assumed divine honors and gave himself the names of such divinities as he thought most agreeable to his nature for this purpose he caused the heads of the statues of jupiter and some other gods to be struck off and his own to be put in their places he frequently seated himself between castor and pollux and ordered that all who came to their temple to worship should pay their adorations only to him however such was the extravagant inconstancy of this unaccountable idiot that he changed his divinity as often as he changed his clothes being at one time a male deity at another a female sometimes jupiter or mars and not unfrequently venus or diana he even built and dedicated a temple to his own divinity in which his statue of gold was every day dressed in similar robes to those which he himself wore and was worshipped by crowds of adorers his priests were numerous the sacrifices made to him were of the most exquisite delicacies that could be procured and the dignity of the priesthood was sought by the most oppulent men of the city however he admitted his wife and his horse to that honor and to give a finishing stroke to his absurdities he became a priest to himself his method of assuming the manners of a deity was not less ridiculous he often went out in the full moon and courted it in the style of a lover he often invited it to his bed to taste the pleasure of his embraces he employed many inventions to imitate thunder and would frequently defy jupiter crying out from a speech of homer do you conquer me or i will conquer you he frequently pretended to converse in whispers with the statue of jupiter and usually seemed angry at its replies threatening to send it packing into greece sometimes however he would assume a better temper and seemed contented that they two should dwell together in amity  a person so impious respecting the deity was still more criminal with regard to man he was not less notorious for the depravation of his appetites than for his ridiculous presumptions neither person place nor sex were obstacles to the indulgence of his unnatural lusts there was scarce a lady of any quality in rome that escaped his lewdness and indeed such was the degeneracy of the times that there were few ladies then who did not think this disgrace an honor he committed incest with his three sisters and at public feasts they lay with their heads upon his bosom by turns of these he prostituted livia and agrippina to his vile companions and then banished them as adultresses and conspirators against his person as for drusilla he took her from her husband longinus and kept her as his wife her he loved so affectionately that being sick he appointed her as heiress of his empire and fortune and she happening to die before him he made her a goddess nor did her example when living appear more dangerous to the people than her divinity when dead to mourn for her death was a crime as she was become a goddess and to rejoice for her deity was capital because she was dead nay even silence itself was an unpardonable insensibility either of the emperors loss or his sisters advancement thus he made his sister subservient to his profit as before he had done to his pleasure raising vast sums of money by granting pardons to some and by confiscating the goods of others as to his marriages whether he contracted them with greater levity or dissolved them with greater injustice is not easy to determine being present at the nuptials of livia orestilla with piso as soon as the solemnity was over he commanded her to be brought to him as his own wife and then dismissed her in a few days he soon after went so far as to banish her upon suspicion of cohabiting with her husband after she was parted from him he was enamoured of lollia paulina upon a bare relation of her grandmothers beauty and thereupon took her from her husband who commanded in macedonia notwithstanding which he repudiated her as he had done the former and likewise forbad her future marrying with any other the wife who caught most firmly upon his affections was milonia caesonia whose chief merit lay in her perfect acquaintance with all the alluring arts of her sex for she was otherwise possessed neither of youth nor beauty she continued with him during his reign and he loved her so ridiculously that he sometimes showed her to his soldiers dressed in armor and sometimes to his companions stark naked so that his very regards were a reproach to those whom he wished to oblige  his envy was still more detestable than his lusts we are told that he put caius to death for no other crime than because he wore a purple gown the luster of which called off all the regards of the spectators from himself he ordered several persons in the city to be shaved for having hair more beautiful than ordinary he ordered one proculus who was remarkable for his beauty and the tallness of his stature to descend into the amphitheatre and to fight among the combatants as a gladiator proculus came off victorious having vanquished two men one after the other however the tyrant was not satisfied with this punishment but caused him to be bound and clothed in rags and then to be led round the city and slain being present at the public games where a particular gladiator succeeded with more than ordinary applause he was so highly displeased that he flung himself out of the amphitheatre in a fury crying out with great indignation that the romans gave more honor to a pitiful fencer than to the emperor himself  but of all his vices his prodigality was the most remarkable and that which in some measure gave rise to the rest the luxuries of former emperors were simplicity itself when compared to those which he practiced he contrived new ways of bathing where the richest oils and most precious perfumes were exhausted with the utmost profusion he found out dishes of immense value and had even jewels as we are told dissolved among his sauces he sometimes had services of pure gold presented before his guests instead of meat observing that a man should be an oeconomist or an emperor  the expensive manner in which he maintained his horse will give some idea of his domestic economy he built it a stable of marble and a manger of ivory whenever this animal which he called incitatus was to run he placed sentinels near its stable the night preceding to prevent its slumbers from being broken he appointed it an house furniture and a kitchen in order to treat all its visitors with proper respect the emperor sometimes invited incitatus to his own table presented it with gilt oats and wine in golden cup he often swore by the safety of his horse and it is said he would have named it to the consulship had not death prevented  for several days together he flung considerable sums of money among the people he ordered ships of a prodigious bulk to be built of cedar the sterns of ivory inlaid with gold and jewels the sails and tackling of various silks while the decks were planted with the choicest fruit trees under the shade of which he often dined here attended by all the ministers of his pleasures the most exquisite singers and the most beautiful youths he coasted along the shore of campania with great splendor all his buildings seemed rather calculated to raise astonishment than to answer the purposes of utility he ordered houses to be built in the sea he cut his way through rocks of prodigious bulk he levelled mountains and elevated plains and valleys but the most notorious instance of his fruitless profusion was the vast bridge at puteoli which he undertook in the third year of his reign to satisfy his desire of being master as well of the ocean as the land he caused an insinite number of ships to be fastened to each other so as to make a floating bridge from bai to puteoli across an aim of the sea three miles and an half broad the ships being placed in two rows in form of a crescent were secured to each other with anchors chains and cables over these were laid vast quantities of timber and upon that earth so as to make the whole resemble one of the streets of rome he next caused several houses to be built upon his new bridge for the reception of himself and his attendants into which fresh water was conveyed by pipes from land he then repaired thither with all his court attended by prodigious throngs of people who came from all parts to be spectators of such an expensive pageant it was there that caligula adorned with all the magnificence of eastern royalty sitting on horseback with a civic crown and alexanders breast plate attended by the great officers of the army and all the nobility of rome entered at one end of the bridge and with ridiculous importance rode to the other at night the number of torches and other illuminations with which this expensive structure was adorned cast such a gleam as illuminated the whole bay and all the neighboring mountains this seemed to give the weak emperor new cause for exultation boasting that he had turned night into day as well as sea into land the next morning he again rode over in a triumphant chariot followed by a numerous train of charioteers and all his soldiers in glittering armor he then ascended a rostrum erected for the occasion where he made a solemn oration in praise of the greatness of his enterprise and the assiduity of his workmen and his army he then distributed rewards among his men and a splendid feast succeeded however there was still wanting something to mark the disposition of the mighty projector in the midst of the entertainment many of his attendants were thrown into the sea several ships filled with spectators were attacked and sunk in an hostile manner and although the majority escaped through the calmness of the weather yet many were drowned and some who endeavored to save themselves by climbing to the bridge were struck down again by the emperors command the calmness of the sea during this pageant which continued for two days furnished caligula with fresh opportunities for boasting being heard to say that neptune took care to keep the sea smooth and serene merely out of reverence to himself  expenses like these it may naturally be supposed must have exhausted the most unbounded wealth in fact after reigning about a year caligula found his revenues totally exhausted and a fortune of about eighteen millions of our money which tiberius had amassed together entirely spent in extravagance and folly now therefore his prodigality put him upon new methods of supplying the exchequer and as before his profusion so now his rapacity became boundless he put in practice all kinds of rapine and extortion while his principal study seemed to be the inventing new imposts and illicit consiscations every thing was taxed to the very wages of the meanest tradesman he caused freemen to purchase their freedom a second time and poisoned many who had named him for their heir to have the immediate possession of their fortunes he set up a brothel in his own palace by which he gained considerable sums by all the methods of prostitution he also kept a gaming house in which he himself presided scrupling none of the mean tricks of that reptile race in order to advance his gains on a certain occasion having had a run of ill luck he saw two rich knights passing through his court upon which he suddenly rose up and causing both to be apprehended confiscated their estates and then joining his former companions boasted that he never had a better throw in his life another time wanting money for a stake he went down and caused several noblemen to be put to death and then returning told the company that they sat playing for trifles while he had won sixty thousand sesterces at a cast having had a daughter born he complained openly of his poverty and published an edict that he would receive whatever presents should be sent him and actually stood in the portico of his palace to induce the people to be liberal in their donations  these methods however were but subordinate to the cruelties by which he acquired immense sums he slew many of the senate and afterward cited them to appear as if they had killed themselves he condemned many persons of the highest quality to dig in the mines and to repair the highways for offering to ridicule his profusion he cast great numbers of old and infirm men and poor decrepid housekeepers to wild beasts to free the state from such unserviceable citizens he usually fed his wild beasts with the bodies of those wretches whom he condemned and every tenth day sent off numbers of them to be thus devoured which he jocosely called clearing his accounts one of those who was thus exposed crying out that he was innocent caligula ordered his tongue to be cut out and then thrown into the amphitheatre as before he took delight in killing men with slow tortures that as he expressed it they might feel themselves dying being always present at such executions himself directing the duration of the punishment and mitigating the tortures merely to prolong them in fact he valued himself for no quality more than this unrelenting temper and inflexible severity which he preserved while presiding at an execution  his barbarous attempts at wit in the midst of slaughter sufficiently evince what little pain he felt from compassion an eminent citizen who for an indisposition had got leave to retire into the island anticyra which was a place famous for curing madness by hellebore desiring to have his stay prolonged caligula ordered him to be put to death adding with a smile that bleeding must certainly be useful to one who had so long taken hellebore without success once putting a wrong person to death by mistake upon finding his error he said it was well done for this criminal had doubtless deserved to die as well as the other this horrid disposisition never forsook him even in his most festive hours he frequently had men racked before him while he sat at meat ironically pitying their misfortunes and blaming their executioner he always desired to have the friends and relations of the sufferer to be present at these executions upon a certain occasion one of them excusing himself upon account of sickness the tyrant sent a litter to carry him whenever he kissed his wife or mistress he generally laid his hand on her neck observing that however smooth and lovely it was he could take it off when he pleased demanding of one whom he had recalled from banishment how he employed himself in his exile being told that he had prayed for the death of tiberius caligula immediately concluded that all whom he himself had banished wished for his death likewise commanded that all exiles should be slain without mercy at one time being incensed with the citizens of rome he wished that all the roman people had but one neck that he might dispatch them at a blow  such insupportable and capricious cruelties produced many secret conspiracies against him  but these were for a while deferred upon account of his intended expedition against the germans and britains which he undertook in parts of the empire and talked with so much resolution that it was universally believed he would conquer all before him his march perfectly indicated the inequality of his temper sometimes it was so rapid that the cohorts were obliged to leave their standards behind them at other times it was so slow that it more resembled a pompous procession than a military expedition in this disposition he would cause himself to be carried on eight mens shoulders and order all the neighboring cities to have their streets well swept and watered to defend him from the dust however all these mighty preparations ended in nothing instead of conquering britain he only gave refuge to one of its banished princes and this he described in his letter to the senate as taking possession of the whole island instead of conquering germany he only led his army to the seashore in batavia there disposing his engines and warlike machines with great solemnity and drawing up his men in order of battle he went on board his galley with which coasting along he commanded his trumpets to sound and the signal to be given as if for an engagement upon which his men having had previous orders immediately fell to gathering the shells that lay upon the shore into their helmets terming them the spoils of the conquered ocean worthy of the palace and the capitol after this doughty expedition calling his army together as a general after victory he harangued them in a pompous manner and highly extolled their achievements and then distributing money among them dismissed them with orders to be joyful and congratulated them upon their riches but that such exploits should not pass without a memorial he caused a lofty tower to be erected by the seaside and ordered the galleys in which he had put to sea to be conveyed to rome in a great measure by land  after numberless instances of folly and cruelty in this expedition among which he had intentions of destroying the whole army that had formerly mutinied under his father germanicus he began to think of a triumph the senate who had long been the timid ministers of his pride and cruelty immediately set about consulting how to satisfy his expectations they considered that a triumph would even to himself appear as a burlesque upon his expedition they therefore decreed him only an ovation having come to this resolution they sent him a deputation informing him of the honors granted him and the decree which was drawn up in terms of the most extravagant adulation however their flattery was far from satisfying his pride he considered their conduct rather as a diminution of his power than an addition to his glory he therefore ordered them on pain of death not to concern themselves with his honors and being met by their messengers on the way who invited him to come and partake of the preparations which the senate had decreed he informed them that he would come and then laying his hand upon his sword added that he would bring that also with him in this manner either quite omitting his triumph or deferring it to another time he entered the city only with an ovation while the senate past the whole day in acclamations in his praise and speeches filled with the most excessive flattery this conduct in some measure served to reconcile him and soon after their excessive zeal in his cause entirely gained his favor for it happened that protogenes who was one of the most intimate and the most cruel of his favorites coming into the house was fawned upon by the whole body of the senate and particularly by proculus whereupon protogenes with a fierce look asked how one who was such an enemy to the emperor could be such a friend to him there needed no more to excite the senate against proculus they instantly seized upon him and violently tore him in pieces plainly showing by their conduct that tyranny in the prince produces cruelty in those whom he governs  it was after returning from his extravagant expedition that he was waited on by a deputation from the jews of alexandria who came to deprecate his anger for not worshipping his divinity as other nations had done he was employed in looking over some houses of pleasure and giving directions to the workmen when philo the jew and the rest of the embassy were admitted to an audience upon their approaching him with the most profound humility he began by calling them enemies to the gods and by asking them how they could refuse to acknowledge his divinity upon their replying that they had sacrificed hecatombs both upon his accession to the empire and his recovery from sickness he replied that those sacrifices were offered not to him but for him in the mean time while they continued silently astonished at his impiety he went from room to room giving directions to his workmen concerning new improvements and remarking such parts of the furniture as happened to displease him he would now and then stop to ask some extravagant question what can be the reason cried he that you jews abstain from pork this question seemed so very lively to his attendants that they burst into such loud fits of laughter as obliged an officer who was present to reprimand them philo was willing to give him all the information he was able upon this head and began by saying that different nations had different customs that while the people of one religion abstained from pork those of another never eat lamb nor do i blame them cried caligula for lamb is very bad eating but tell me continued he what pretensions have you to be citizens of alexandria upon this philo began to enter into the business of his embassy but he had scarce commenced when caligula abruptly left him and ran into a large hall the windows of which he ordered to be adorned with transparent stone which was used by the ancients instead of glass he then returned to the deputies and assuming a more moderate air well cried he let me know what you have to say in your defense philo began his harangue where it had been interrupted before but caligula again left him in the midst of it and gave orders for placing some pictures nothing can be a more striking picture than this of the manner in which this monster attended to the complaints of mankind this affair of the jews remained undecided during his reign but it was at last settled by his successor to their satisfaction it was upon this occasion that philo made the following remarkable answer to his associates who were terrified with apprehensions from the emperors indignation fear nothing cried he to them caligula by declaring against us puts god on our side  the continuation of this horrid reign seemed to threaten universal calamity however it was as short as it deserved to be there had already been several conspiracies formed to destroy the tyrant but without success that which at last succeeded in delivering the world of this monster was concerted under the influence of cassius cherea tribune of the praetorian bands this was a man of experienced courage an ardent admirer of freedom and consequently an enemy to tyrants besides the motives which he had in common with other men he had received repeated insults from caligula who took all occasions of turning him into ridicule and impeaching him of cowardice merely because he happened to have an effeminate voice whenever cherea came to demand the watchword from the emperor according to custom he always gave him either venus adonis or some such implying effeminacy and softness he therefore secretly imparted his designs to several senators and knights whom he knew to have received personal injuries from caligula or to be apprehensive of those to come among these to valerius asiaticus whose wife the emperor had debauched annius vinicianus who was suspected of having been in a former conspiracy was now desirous of really engaging in the first design that offered besides these were clemens the prefect and calistus whose riches made him obnoxious to the tyrants resentment  while these were deliberating upon the most certain and speedy method of destroying the tyrant an unexpected incident gave new strength to the conspiracy pompedius a senator of distinction having been accused before the emperor of having spoken of him with disrespect the informer cited one quintilia an actress to confirm his accusation quintilia however was possessed of a degree of fortitude not easily found even in the other sex she denied the fact with obstinacy and being put to the torture at the informers request she bore the severest torments of the rack with unshaken constancy but what is most remarkable of her resolution is that she was acquainted with all the particulars of the conspiracy and although cherea was the person appointed to preside at her torture she revealed nothing on the contrary when she was led to the rack she trod upon the toe of one of the conspirators intimating at once her knowledge of the confederacy and her own resolution not to divulge it in this manner she suffered until all her limbs were dislocated and in that deplorable state was presented to the emperor who ordered her a gratuity for what she had suffered cherea could now no longer contain his indignation at being thus made the instrument of a tyrants cruelty he therefore proposed to the conspirators to attack him as he went to offer sacrifices in the capitol or while he was employed in the secret pleasures of his palace the rest however were of opinion that it was best to fall upon him when he should be unattended by which means they would be more certain of their success after several deliberations it was at last resolved to attack him during the continuance of the palatine games which lasted four days and to strike the blow when his guards should have the least opportunity to defend him in consequence of this the three first days of the games passed without affording that opportunity which was so ardently desired cherea now therefore began to apprehend that deferring the time of the conspiracy might be a means to divulge it he even began to dread that the honor of killing the tyrant might fall to the lot of some other person more bold than himself wherefore he at last resolved to defer the execution of his plot only to the day following when caligula should pass through a private gallery to some baths not far distant from the palace  the last day of the games was more splendid than the rest and caligula seemed more sprightly and condescending than usual he took great amusement in seeing the people scramble for the fruits and other rarities thrown by his order among them and seemed no way apprehensive of the plot formed for his destruction in the mean time the conspiracy began to transpire and had he possessed any friends it could not fail of being disccovered a senator who was present asking one of his acquaintance if he had heard any thing new the other replying in the negative then you must know says he that this day will be represented the death of a tyrant the other immediately understood him but desired him to be more cautious how he divulged a secret of so much importance the conspirators waited a great part of the day with the most extreme anxiety and at one time caligula seemed resolved to spend the whole day without any refreshment this unexpected delay entirely exasperated cherea and had he not been restrained he would have gone and perpetrated his design in the midst of all the people just at that instant while he was yet hesitating what he should do asprenas one of the conspirators persuaded caligula to go to the bath and take some slight refreshment in order to enjoy the rest of the entertainment with greater relish the emperor therefore rising up the conspirators used every precaution to keep off the throng and to surround him under pretense of greater assiduity upon entering into the little vaulted gallery that led to the bath he was met by a band of grecian children who had been instructed in singing and were come to perform in his presence he was once more therefore going to return into the theater with them had not the leader of the band excused himself as having a cold this was the moment which cherea seized to strike him to the ground crying out tyrant think upon this immediately after the other conspirators rushed in and while the emperor continued to resist crying out that he was not yet dead they dispatched him with thirty wounds  such was the merited death of caius caligula in the twentyninth year of his age after a short reign of three years ten months and eight days it will be unnecessary to add any thing more to his character than what seneca says of him namely that nature seemed to have brought him forth to show what was possible to be produced from the greatest vice supported by the greatest authority his wit and eloquence are applauded by some but what could be his taste in either who condemned virgil as a bad poet and livy as a wretched historian with him his wife and infant daughter also perished the one being stabbed by a centurion the other having its brains dashed out against the wall his money also was melted down by a decree of the senate and such precautions were taken that all seemed willing that neither his features nor his name might be transmitted to posterity  chap vi claudius the fifth emperor of rome berate upon what was necessary to be done in the present emergency  in this deliberation saturninus who was then consul insisted much upon the benefits of liberty and talked in raptures of chereas fortitude alleging that it deserved the highest reward this was a language highly pleasing to the senate who being long harrassed by the cruelty of tyrants panted once more for the restoration of their former freedom liberty now became the favorite topic and they even ventured to talk of extinguishing the very name of caesar impressed with this generous resolution they brought over some cohorts of the city to their side and boldly seized upon the capitol but it was now too late for rome to regain her pristine freedom the populace and the army opposed their endeavors the former were still mindful of their ancient hatred to the senate and remembered the donations and public spectacles of the emperors with regret the latter were sensible they could have no power but in a monarchy and had some hopes that the election of the emperor would fall to their determination in this opposition of interest and variety of opinions chance seemed at last to decide the fate of the empire some soldiers happening to run about the palace discovered claudius caligulas uncle lurking in a secret place where he had hid himself through fear of this personage who had hitherto been despised for his imbecility they resolved to make an emperor and accordingly carried him upon their shoulders to the camp where they proclaimed him at a time he expected nothing but death  the senate now therefore perceiving that force alone was likely to settle the succession were resolved to submit since they had no power to oppose claudius was the person most nearly allied to the late emperor then living being the nephew of tiberius and the uncle of caligula the senate therefore passed a decree confirming him in the empire and went soon after in a body to render him their compulsive homage cherea was the first who fell a sacrifice to the jealousy of this new monarch he met death with all the fortitude of an ancient roman desiring to die by the same sword with which he had killed caligula lupus his friend was put to death with him and sabinus one of the conspirators laid violent hands on himself  claudius was now fifty years old when he began to reign the complicated diseases of his infancy had in some measure affected all the faculties both of his body and mind he was continued in a state of pupilage much longer than was usual at that time and seemed in every part of life incapable of conducting himself not that he was entirely destitute of understanding since he had made a tolerable proficiency in the greek and latin languages and even wrote an history of his own time which however destitute of other merit was not contemptible in point of style nevertheless with this share of erudition he was unable to advance himself in the state and seemed utterly neglected till he was placed all at once at the head of affairs  the commencement of his reign as it was with all the other bad emperors gave the most promising hopes of an happy continuance he begun by passing an act of oblivion for all former words and actions and disannulled all the cruel edicts of caligula he showed himself more moderate than his predecessors with regard to titles and honors he forbade all persons upon severe penalties to sacrifice to him as they had done to caligula he was assiduous in hearing and examining complaints and frequently administered justice in person tempering by his mildness the severity of strict justice we are told of his bringing a woman to acknowledge her son by adjudging her to marry him the tribunes of the people coming one day to attend him when he was on his tribunal he courteously excused himself for not having room for them to sit down by this deportment he so much gained the affections of the people that upon a vague report of his being slain by surprise they ran about the streets in the utmost rage and consternation with horrid imprecations against all such as were accessory to his death nor could they be appeased till they were assured with certainty of his safety he took a more than ordinary care that rome should be continually supplied with corn and provisions securing the merchants against pirates he was not less assiduous in his buildings in which he excelled almost all that went before him he constructed a wonderful aquaeduct called after his own name much surpassing any other in rome either for workmanship or plentiful supply it brought water from forty miles distance through great mountains and over deep valleys being built on stately arches and furnishing the highest parts of the city he made also an haven at ostia a work of such immense expense that his successors were unable to maintain it but his greatest work of all was the draining the lake fucinus which was the largest in italy and bringing its water into the tyber in order to strengthen the current of that river for effecting this among other vast difficulties he mined through a mountain of stone three miles broad and kept thirty thousand men employed for eleven years together  to this solicitude for the internal advantages of the state he added that of a watchful guardianship over the provinces he restored judea to herod agrippa which caligula had taken from herod antipas his uncle the man who had put john the baptist to death and who was banished by order of the present emperor claudius also restored such princes to their kingdoms as had been unjustly dispossessed by his predecessors but deprived the lycians and rhodians of their liberty for having promoted insurrections and crucified some citizens of rome  he even undertook to gratify the people by foreign conquest the britons who had for near an hundred years been left in sole possession of their own island began to seek the mediation of rome to quell their intestine commotions the principal man who desired to subject his native country to the roman dominion was one bericus who by many arguments persuaded the emperor to make a descent upon the island magnifying the advantages that would attend the conquest of it in pursuance of his advice therefore plautius the praetor was ordered to pass over into gaul and make preparations for this great expedition at first indeed his soldiers seemed backward to embark declaring that they were unwilling to make war beyond the limits of the world for so they judged britain to be however they were at last persuaded to go and the britons under the conduct of their king cynobelinus were several times overthrown  made a powerful resistance though they were at length overcome but the silures or inhabitants of south wales under their king caractacus were the most formidable opponents the roman generals had ever yet encountered this brave barbarian not only made a gallant defense but often seemed to claim a doubtful victory he with great conduct removed the seat of war into the most inaccessible parts of the country and for nine years kept the romans in continual alarm  this general however upon the approach of ostorius finding himself obliged to come to a decisive engagement addressed his countrymen with calm resolution telling them that this battle would either establish their liberty or confirm their servitude that they ought to remember the bravery of their ancestors by whose valor they were delivered from taxes and tributes and that this was the time to show themselves equal to their progenitors nothing however that undisciplined valor could perform could avail against the conduct of the roman legions after an obstinate fight the britons were entirely routed the wife and daughter of caractacus were taken prisoners and he himself seeking refuge from cartismandua queen of the brigantes was treacherously delivered up to the conquerors when he was brought to rome nothing could exceed the curiosity of the people to behold a man who had for so many years braved the power of the empire on his part he testified no marks of base dejection but as he was leading through the streets happening to observe the splendor of every object around him alas cried he how is it possible that people possessed of such magnificence at home could think of envying caractacus an humble cottage in britain when he was brought before the emperor while the other captives sued for pity with the most abject lamentations caractacus stood before the tribunal with an intrepid air and seemed rather willing to accept of pardon than meanly solicitous of suing for it if cried he toward the end of his speech i had yielded immediately and without opposition neither my fortune would have been remarkable nor your glory memorable you would have ceased to be victorious and i had been forgotten if now therefore you spare my life i shall continue a perpetual example of your clemency claudius had the generosity to pardon him and ostorius was decreed a triumph which however he did not live to enjoy though the britons were thus humbled they were by no means entirely subdued several new revolts ensued but the natives being weakened by dissensions amongst each other were many times overthrown and more easily kept under these transactions in britain continued during the whole reign of claudius his first expedition into britain was in the second year of his reign and the victory over caractacus in the tenth i have thrown them however into one point of view to avoid interrupting the narrative  claudius as i have said gave in the beginning of his reign the highest hopes of an happy continuance but he soon began to lessen his care for the public and to commit to his favorites all the concerns of the empire this weak prince had from his infancy been in a state of pupilage and now when called to govern he was unable to act but under the direction of others men of narrow capacities and feeble minds are only good or evil as they happen to fall into the hands of virtuous or vicious guides and unhappily for him his directors were to the last degree abandoned and infamous the chief of these was his wife messalina whose name is almost become a common appellation to women of abandoned characters however she was not less remarkable for her cruelties than her lusts as by her intrigues she destroyed many of the most illustrious families of rome subordinate to her were the emperors freedmen pallas the treasurer narcissus the secretary of state and callistus the master of the requests these entirely governed claudius so that he was only left the fatigues of ceremony while they were possessed of all the power of the state  it would be tedious to enumerate the various cruelties which these insidious advisers obliged the feeble emperor to commit those against his own family will suffice appius silanus a person of great merit who had been married to the emperors motherinlaw was put to death upon the suggestions of messalina after him he slew both his sonsinlaw silanus and pompey and his two nieces the livias one the daughter of drusus the other of germanicus and all without permitting them to plead in their defense or even without assigning any cause for his displeasure great numbers of others fell a sacrifice to the jealousy of messalina and her minions who bore so great a sway in the state that all offices dignities and governments were entirely at their disposal every thing was put to sale they took money for pardons and penalties and accumulated by these means such vast sums that the wealth of crassus was considered as nothing in comparison one day the emperor complaining that his exchequer was exhausted he was ludicrously told that it might be sufficiently replenished if his two freedmen would take him into partnership still however during such immense strides of corruption he regarded his favorites with the highest esteem and even solicited the senate to grant them peculiar marks of their approbation these disorders in the ministers of government did not fail to produce conspiracies against the emperor statius corvinus and gallus assinius formed a conspiracy against him two knights whose names are not told us privately combined to assassinate him but the revolt which gave him the greatest uneasiness and which was punished with the most unrelenting severity was that of camillus his lieutenantgovernor in dalmatia this general incited by many of the principal men of rome openly rebelled against him and assumed the title of emperor nothing could exceed the terrors of claudius upon being informed of this revolt his nature and his crimes had disposed him to be more cowardly than the rest of mankind so that when camillus commanded him by his letters to relinquish the empire and retire to a private station he seemed inclined to obey however his fears upon this account were soon removed for the legions which had declared for camillus being terrified by some remarkable prodigies shortly after abandoned him so that the man whom but five days before they had acknowledged as emperor they now thought it no insamy to destroy the cruelty of messalina and her minions upon this occasion seemed to have no bounds they so wrought upon the emperors fears and suspicions that numbers were executed without trial or proof and scarce any even of those who were but suspected escaped unless by ransoming their lives with their fortunes  among the numbers who were put to death on this occasion i cannot omit mentioning the pathetic catastrophe of petus and his faithful wife arria cecina petus was one of those unfortunate men who joined with camillus against the emperor and who when his associate was slain by the army had endeavored to escape into dalmatia however he was there apprehended and put on board a ship in order to be conveyed to rome arria who had been long the partner of his affection and misfortunes entreated his keepers to be taken in the same vessel with her husband it is usual she said to grant a man of his quality a few slaves to dress undress and attend him i myself will perform all these offices and save you the trouble of a more numerous retinue her fidelity however could not prevail she therefore hired a fishermans bark and thus kept company with the ship in which her husband was conveyed through the voyage they had an only son equally remarkable for the beauty of his person and the rectitude of his disposition this youth died at the time his father was confined to his bed by a dangerous disorder however the affectionate arria concealed her sons death and in her visits to her husband testified no marks of sadness being asked how her son did she replied that he was at rest and only left her husbands chamber to give a vent to her tears when petus was condemned to die and the orders were that he should put an end to his own life arria used every art to inspire him with resolution and at length finding him continue timid and wavering she took the poniard and stabbing herself in his presence presented it to him saying it gives me no pain my petus  by such cruelties as these the favorites of the emperor endeavored to establish his and their own authority but in order to increase the necessity of their assistance they labored to augment the greatness of his terrors he now became a prey to jealousy and disquietude being one day in the temple and finding a sword that was left there by accident he convened the senate in a fright and informed them of his danger after this he never ventured to go to any feast without being surrounded by his guards nor would he suffer any man to approach him without a previous search thus wholly employed by his anxiety for selfpreservation he entirely left the care of the state to his favorites who by degrees gave him a relish for slaughter from this time he seemed delighted with inflicting tortures and on a certain occasion continued a whole day at the city tibur waiting for an hangman from rome that he might feast his eyes with an execution in the manner of the ancients nor was he less regardless of the persons he condemned than cruel in the infliction of their punishment such was his extreme stupidity that he would frequently invite those to supper whom he had put to death but the day before and often denied the having given orders for an execution but a few hours after pronouncing sentence suetonius assures us that there were no less than thirtyfive senators and above three hundred knights executed in his reign and that such was his unconcern in the midst of slaughter that one of his tribunes bringing him an account of a certain senator who was executed he quite forgot his offense but calmly acquiesced in his punishment  in this manner was claudius urged on by messalina to commit cruelties which he considered only as wholesome severities while in the mean time she put no bounds to her enormities the impunity of her past vices only increasing her confidence to commit new her debaucheries now became every day more notorious and her lewdness exceeded what had ever been seen in rome she chose her paramours through wantonness and then sacrificed them through caprice she caused some women of the first quality to commit adultery in the presence of their husbands and destroyed such as refused to comply after appearing for some years insatiable in her desires she at length fixed her affections upon caius silius the most beautiful youth in rome as all her passions were in extreme her love for this young roman seemed to amount even to madness she obliged him to divorce his wife junia syllana that she might entirely possess him to herself she obliged him to accept of immense treasures and valuable presents cohabiting with him in the most open manner and treating him with the most shameless familiarity the very imperial ornaments were transferred to his house and the emperors slaves and attendants had orders to wait upon the adulterer nothing was wanting to complete the insolence of their conduct but their being married together and that was soon after effected they relied upon the emperors imbecility for security and only waited till he retired to ostia to put their illjudged project into execution in his absence they celebrated their nuptials with all the ceremonies and splendor which attend the most confident security messalina giving a loose to her passion appeared as a bacchanalian with a thyrsus in her hand while silius assumed the character of bacchus his body being adorned with robes imitating ivy and his legs covered with buskins a troop of singers and dancers attended who heightened the revel with the most lascivious songs and the most indecent attitudes in the midst of this riot one valens a buffoon is said to have climbed a tree and being demanded what he saw answered that he perceived a dreadful storm coming from ostia what this fellow spoke at random was actually at that time in preparation it seems that some time before as the friendships of the vicious are always of short duration there had been a quarrel between messalina and narcissus the emperors first freedman this subtle minister therefore desired nothing more than an opportunity of ruining the empress and he judged this to be a most favorable occasion he first made the discovery by means of two concubines who attended the emperor who were instructed to inform him of messalinas marriage as the news of the day while narcissus himself stepped in to confirm their information finding that it operated upon the emperors fears as he could wish he resolved to alarm him still more by a discovery of all messalinas projects and attempts he aggravated the danger and urged the expediency of speedily punishing the delinquents claudius quite terrified at so unexpected a relation supposed that the enemy was already at his gates and frequently interrupted his freedmen by asking if he was still master of the empire being assured that he yet had it in his power to continue so he resolved to go and punish the affront offered to his dignity without delay nothing could exceed the consternation of messalina and her thoughtless companions upon being informed that the emperor was coming to disturb their festivity every one retired in the utmost confusion silius was taken messalina took shelter in some gardens formerly belonging to lucullus but which she had lately seized upon having expelled asiaticus the true owner and put him to death from thence she sent britannicus her only son by the emperor with octavia her daughter to intercede for her and implore his mercy she soon after followed them herself but narcissus had so fortified the emperor against her arts and contrived such methods of diverting his attention from her defense that she was obliged to retire in despair narcissus being thus far successful led claudius to the house of the adulterer there showed him the apartments adorned with the spoils of his own palace and then conducting him to the praetorian camp revived his courage by giving him assurances of the readiness of the soldiers to defend him having thus artfully wrought upon his fears and resentment the wretched silius was commanded to appear who making no defense was instantly put to death in the emperors presence several others shared the same fate but messalina still flattered herself with hopes of pardon she resolved to leave neither prayers nor tears unattempted to appease the emperor she sometimes even gave a loose to her resentment and threatened her accusers with vengeance nor did she want ground for entertaining the most favorable expectations claudius having returned from the execution of her paramours and having allayed his resentment in a banquet began to relent he now therefore commanded his attendants to apprize that miserable creature meaning messalina of his resolution to hear her accusation the next day and ordered her to be in readiness with her defense the permission to defend herself would have been fatal to narcissus wherefore he rushed out and ordered the tribunes and centurions who were in readiness to execute her immediately by the emperors command upon their arrival at the gardens where she still continued they found her stretched upon the ground attended by her mother lepida who exhorted her to prevent her punishment by a voluntary death but this unfortunate woman was too much softened by luxury to be able to face death without terror instead of fortifying her resolution to meet the blow she only gave way to tears and unpitied distress at length taking a sword from one of the soldiers she put it to her breast but her fears still prolonging the blow the tribune ran her through the body and so dispatched her claudius was immediately informed of her death in the midst of his banquet but this insensible idiot showed not the least appearance of emotion he continued at table with his usual tranquillity while neither the love he bore her the joy of her accusers nor the sorrow of his children had the least effect upon his temper as a proof however that this proceeded rather from stupidity than fortitude the day following while he was sitting at table he asked why messalina was absent as if he had totally forgotten her crimes and her punishment  claudius being now a widower declared publicly that as he had been hitherto unfortunate in his marriages he would remain single for the future and that he would be contented to forfeit his life in case he broke his resolution however the resolutions of claudius were but of short continuance having been accustomed to live under the control of women his present freedom was become irksome to him and he was entirely unable to live without a director his freedmen therefore perceiving his inclinations resolved to procure him another wife and after some deliberation they fixed upon agrippina the daughter of his brother germanicus this woman was more practiced in vice than even the former empress her cruelties were more dangerous as they were directed with greater caution she had poisoned her former husband to be at liberty to attend the calls of ambition and perfectly acquainted with all the infirmities of claudius only made use of his power to advance her own however as the late declaration of claudius seemed to be an obstacle to his marrying again persons were suborned to move in the senate that he should be compelled to take a wife as a matter of great importance to the commonwealth and some more determined flatterers than the rest left the house as with a thorough resolution that instant to constrain him when this decree by which also incestuous marriages were made lawful past in the senate claudius had scarce patience to contain himself a day before the celebration of his nuptials however such was the detestation in which the people in general held these incestuous matches that though they were made lawful yet only one of his tribunes and one of his freedmen were found base enough to follow his example  claudius having now received a new director submitted with more implicit obedience than in any former part of his reign agrippinas chief aims were to gain the succession in favor of her own son nero and to set aside the claims of young britannicus son to the emperor and messalina for this purpose she married nero to the emperors daughter octavia a few days after her own marriage not long after this she urged the emperor to strengthen the succession in imitation of his predecessors by making a new adoption and advised him to take in her son nero in some measure to divide the fatigues of government the feeble prince who had no discernment nor malice but what were infused into him immediately yielded to her persuasions and adopted nero in preference of his only son britannicus her next care was to increase her sons popularity by giving him seneca for a tutor this excellent man by birth a spaniard had been banished into the island of corsica by claudius upon the false testimony of messalina who had accused him of adultery with julia the emperors niece the people loved and admired him for his genius but still more for his strict morality and a part of his reputation therefore necessarily devolved to his pupil this subtle woman was not less assiduous in pretending the utmost affection for britannicus whom however she resolved at a proper time to destroy but her jealousy was not confined to this child only she shortly after her accession procured the deaths of several ladies who had been her rivals in the emperors affections she displaced the captains of the guard and appointed burrhus to that command a person of great military knowledge  in the twelfth year of this monarchs reign she persuaded him to restore liberty to the rhodians of which he had deprived them some years before and to remit the taxes of the city ilium as having been the progenitors of rome her design in this was to increase the popularity of nero who pleaded the cause of both cities with great approbation thus did this ambitious woman take every step to aggrandize her son and was even contented to become hateful herself to the public merely to increase his popularity being one day told by an astrologer that he would be emperor and yet the cause of her death let him kill me answered she provided he but reigns occidet dum imperat  such a very immoderate abuse of her power served at last to awaken the emperors suspicions agrippinas imperious temper began to grow insupportable to him and he was heard to declare when heated with wine that it was his fate to suffer the disorders of his wives and to be their executioner this expression sunk deep on her mind and engaged all her faculties to prevent the blow her first care was to remove narcissus whom she hated upon many accounts but particularly for his attachment to claudius this minister for some time opposed her designs but at length thought fit to retire by a voluntary exile into campania the unhappy emperor thus exposed to all the machinations of his insidious consort seemed entirely regardless of the dangers that threatened his destruction his affections for britannicus were perceived every day to increase and served also to increase the vigilance of agrippina and add stings to her jealousy she now therefore resolved not to defer a crime which she had meditated a long while before namely that of poisoning her husband she for some time however debated with herself in what manner she should administer the poison as she feared too strong a dose would discover her treachery and one too weak might fail of its effect at length she determined upon a poison of singular efficacy to destroy his intellects and yet not suddenly to terminate his life as she had been long conversant in this horrid practice she applied to a woman called locusta notorious for assisting on such occasions the poison was given the emperor among mushrooms a dish he was particularly fond of shortly after having eaten he dropped down insensible but this caused no alarm as it was usual with him to sit eating till he had stupefied all his faculties and was obliged to be carried off to his bed from the table however his constitution seemed to overcome the effects of the potion when agrippina resolved to make sure of him wherefore she directed a wretched physician who was her creature to thrust a poisoned feather down his throat under pretense of making him vomit and this dispatched him  the reign of this emperor feeble and impotent as he was produced no great calamities in the state since his cruelties were chiefly levelled at those about his person the list of the inhabitants of rome at this time amounted to six million eighthundred and fortyfour thousand souls a number equal perhaps to all the people of england at this day in such a concourse it is not to be doubted but every virtue and every vice must come to their highest pitch of refinement and in fact the conduct of seneca seems an instance of the former and that of messalina of the latter however the general character of the times was that of corruption and luxury for wherever there is a great superfluity of wealth there will also be seen a thousand vicious modes of exhausting it the military spirit of rome though much relaxed from its former severity still continued to awe mankind and though during this reign the world might be justly said to be without a head yet the terror of the roman name alone kept mankind in their obedience  chap vii nero the sixth emperor of rome him with the loudest acclamations though not without making some enquiries after britannicus he was carried in a chariot to the rest of the army where having made a speech proper to the occasion and promising them a donation in the manner of his predecessors he was declared emperor by the army the senate and the people  neros first care was to show all possible respect to the deceased emperor in order to cover the guilt of his death his obsequies were performed with a pomp equal to that of augustus the young emperor pronounced his funeral oration and he was canonized among the gods who scarce deserved the name of man the funeral oration though spoken by nero was drawn up by seneca and it was remarked that this was the first time a roman emperor needed the assistance of anothers eloquence  nero though but seventeen years of age began his reign with the general approbation of mankind as he owed the empire to agrippina so in the beginning he submitted to her directions with the most implicit obedience on her part she seemed resolved on governing with her natural ferocity and considered her private animosities as the only rule to guide her in public justice immediately after the death of claudius she caused silanus the proconsul of asia to be assassinated upon very slight suspicions and without ever acquainting the emperor with her design the next object of her resentment was narcissus the late emperors favorite a man equally notorious for the greatness of his wealth and the number of his crimes he was obliged to put an end to his life by agrippinas order although nero refused his consent  this bloody outset would have been followed by many severities of the same nature had not seneca and burrhus the emperors tutor and general opposed these worthy men although they owed their rise to the empress were above being the instruments of her cruelty they therefore combined together in an opposition and gaining the young emperor on their side formed a plan of power at once the most merciful and wise the beginning of this monarchs reign while he continued to act by their counsels has always been considered as a model for succeeding princes to govern by the famous emperor trajan used to say that for the first five years of this prince all other governments came short of his in fact the young monarch knew so well how to conceal his innate depravity that his nearest friends could scarce perceive his virtues to be but assumed he appeared just liberal and humane when a warrant for the execution of a crimina was brought him to be signed he was heard to cry out with seeming concern would to heaven that i had never learned to write the senate upon a certain occasion giving him their applause for the regularity and justice of his administration he replied with singular modesty that they should defer their thanks till he had deserved them his condescension and affability were not less than his other virtues so that the romans began to think that heaven had sent them a prince whose clemency would compensate for the tyranny of his predecessors  in the mean time agrippina who was excluded from any share in government attempted by every possible method to maintain her declining power perceiving that her son had fallen in love with a freedwoman named act and dreading the influence of a concubine she tried every art to prevent his growing passion however in so corrupt a court it was no difficult matter for the emperor to find other confidants ready to assist him in his wishes the gratification of his passion therefore in this instance only served to increase his hatred for the empress nor was it long before he gave evident marks of his disobedience by displacing pallas her chief favorite it was upon this occasion that she first perceived the total declension of her authority which threw her into the most ungovernable fury in order to give terror to her rage she proclaimed that britannicus the real heir to the throne was still living and in a condition to receive his fathers empire which was now possessed by an usurper she threatened to go to the camp and there expose his baseness and her own invoking all the furies to her assistance these menaces served to alarm the suspicions of nero who though apparently guided by his governors yet already began to give way to his natural depravity he therefore determined upon the death of britannicus and contrived to have him poisoned at a public banquet agrippina however still retained her natural ferocity she took every opportunity of obliging and flattering the tribunes and centurions she heaped up treasures with a rapacity beyond her natural avarice all her actions seemed calculated to raise a faction and make herself formidable to the emperor whereupon nero commanded her german guard to be taken from her and obliged her to lodge out of the palace he also forbid particular persons to visit her and went himself but rarely and ceremoniously to pay her his respects she now therefore began to find that with the emperors favor she had lost the assiduity of her friends she was even accused by sillana of conspiring against her son and of designing to marry plautius a person descended from augustus and of making him emperor a short time after pallas her favorite together with burrhus were arraigned for a similar offense and intending to set up cornelius sylla these informations being proved void of any foundation the informers were banished a punishment which was considered as very inadequate to the greatness of the offense  as nero increased in years his crimes seemed to increase in equal proportion he now began to find a pleasure in running about the city by night disguised like a slave in this vile habit he entered taverns and brothels attended by the lewd ministers of his pleasures attempting the lives of such as opposed him and frequently endangering his own in imitation of the emperors example numbers of profligate young men infested the streets likewise so that every night the city was filled with tumult and disorder however the people bore all these levities which they ascribed to the emperors youth with patience having occasion every day to experience his liberality and having also been gratified by the abolition of many of their taxes the provinces also were no way affected by these riots for except some disturbances on the side of the parthians which were soon suppressed they enjoyed the most perfect tranquillity  but those sensualties which for the four first years of his reign produced but few disorders in the fifth became alarming he first began to transgress the bounds of decency by publicly abandoning octavia his present wife and then by taking poppea the wife of his favorite otho a woman more celebrated for her beauty than her virtues this was another grating circumstance to agrippina who vainly used all her interest to disgrace poppea and reinstate herself in her sons lost favor historians assert that she even offered to satisfy his passions herself by an incestuous compliance and that had not seneca interposed the son would have joined in the mothers crime this however does not seem probable since we find poppea victorious soon after in the contention of interests and at last impelling nero to parricide to satisfy her revenge she began her arts by urging him to divorce his present wife and marry her she reproached him as a pupil who wanted not only power over others but liberty to direct himself she insinuated the dangerous designs of agrippina and by degrees accustomed his mind to reflect upon parricide without horror his cruelties against his mother began rather by several circumstances of petty malice than by any downright injury he encouraged several persons to teize her with litigious suits he employed some of the meanest of the people to sing satirical songs against her under her windows at last finding these ineffectual in breaking her spirit he resolved on putting her to death his first attempt was by poison but this though twice repeated proved ineffectual as she had fortified her constitution against it by antidotes this failing a ship was contrived in so artificial a manner as to fall to pieces in the water on board of which she was invited to sail to the coasts of calabria however this plot was as ineffectual as the former the mariners not being all apprized of the secret disturbed each others operations so that the ship not sinking as readily as was expected agrippina found means to continue swimming till she was taken up by some trading vessels passing that way nero now finding that all his machinations were discovered resolved to throw off the mask and put her openly to death without further delay he therefore caused a report to be spread that she had conspired against him and a poignard was dropped at his feet by one who pretended a command from agrippina to assassinate him in consequence of this he applied to his governors seneca and burrhus for their advice how to act and their assistance in ridding him of the object of his fears things were now come to such a crisis that no middle way could be taken and either nero or agrippina was to fall seneca therefore kept a profound silence while burrhus with more resolution refused to be the perpetrator of so great a crime alleging that the army was entirely devoted to all the descendants of caesar and would never be brought to imbrue their hands in the blood of any of his family in this embarrassment anicetus the contriver of the ship abovementioned offered his services which nero accepted with the greatest joy crying out that then was the first moment he ever found himself an emperor this freedman therefore taking with him a body of soldiers surrounded the house of agrippina and then forced open her doors he next seized upon every slave that he met until he came near the chamber where agrippina lay in the mean time agrippina who strove to conceal her consciousness of neros designs continued anxiously expecting the return of a messenger whom she had sent with an account of her escape however perceiving a sudden stillness without among the crowds that had but a few moments before been loud in their congratulations she asked the cause and demanded of the slave who attended her if her emissary were returned while she yet continued speaking the slave disappeared and anicetus entered the apartment accompanied by two soldiers in whose looks she read her fate she still however preserved presence of mind sufficient to ask the cause of their coming if cried she you come to enquire after my health you may inform the emperor that i am better but if you come with any worse intention you alone and not my son must be guilty to this the executioners made no reply but one of them dashed his club at her head which however did not dispatch her now therefore finding that she was to expect no mercy and seeing anicetus draw his sword to stab her she presented her bosom crying out strike here for this place gave birth to a monster the executioners having dispatched her with several wounds left her dead on the couch and went to inform nero of what they had done some historians say that nero came immediately to view the body that he continued to gaze upon it with pleasure commending some parts and dispraising others and ending his horrid survey by cooly observing that he never thought his mother had been so handsome however this be he vindicated his conduct next day to the senate who not only excused but applauded his impiety  all the bounds of virtue being thus broken down nero now gave a loose to his appetites that were not only sordid but inhuman there seemed an odd contrast in his disposition for while he practiced cruelties which were sufficient to make the mind shudder with horror he was fond of those amusing arts that soften and refine the heart he was particularly addicted even from childhood to music and not totally ignorant of poetry but chariot driving was his favorite pursuit he never missed the circus when chariot races were to be exhibited there appearing at first privately and soon after publicly till at last his passion increasing by indulgence he was not content with being merely a spectator but resolved to become one of the principal performers his governors however did all in their power to restrain this perverted ambition but finding him resolute they enclosed a space of ground in the valley of the vatican where he first exhibited only to some chosen spectators but shortly after invited the whole town the praises of his flattering subjects only stimulated him still more to these unbecoming pursuits so that he now resolved to assume a new character and to appear as a singer upon the stage  his passion for music as was observed was no less natural to him than the former but as it was less manly so he endeavored to defend it by the example of some of the most celebrated men who practiced it with the same fondness he had been instructed in the principles of this art from his childhood and upon his advancement to the empire he had put himself under the most celebrated masters he patiently submitted to their instructions and used all those methods which singers practice either to mend the voice or improve its volubility yet notwithstanding all his assiduity his voice was but a wretched one being both feeble and unpleasant however he was resolved to produce it to the public such as it was for flattery he knew would supply every deficiency his first public appearance was at games of his own institution called juveniles where he advanced upon the stage tuning his instrument to his voice with great appearance of skill a groupe of tribunes and centurions attended behind him while his old governor burrhus stood by his hopeful pupil with indignation in his countenance and praises on his lips  he was desirous also of becoming a poet but he was unwilling to undergo the pain of study which a proficiency in that art requires he was desirous of being a poet readymade for this purpose he got together several persons who were considered as great wits at court though but very little known as such to the public these attended him with verses which they had composed at home or which they blabbed out extemporaneously and the whole of their compositions being tacked together by his direction was called a poem nor was he without his philosophers also he took a pleasure in hearing their debates after supper but he heard them merely for his amusement  furnished with such talents as these for giving pleasure he was resolved to make the tour of his empire and give the most public display of his abilities wherever he came the place of his first exhibition upon leaving rome was at naples the crowds there were so great and the curiosity of the people so earnest in hearing him that they did not perceive an earthquake that happened while he was finging his desire of gaining the superiority over the other actors was truly ridiculous he made interest with his judges reviled his competitors formed private factions to support him all in imitation of those who got their livelihood upon the stage while he continued to perform no man was permitted to depart from the theater upon any pretense whatsoever some were so fatigued with hearing him that they leaped privately from the walls or pretended to fall into fainting fits in order to be carried out nay it is said that several women were delivered in the theater soldiers were placed in several parts to observe the looks and gestures of the spectators either to direct them where to point their applause or restrain their displeasure an old senator named vespasian happening to fall asleep upon one of these occasions very narrowly escaped with his life  after being fatigued with the praises of his countrymen nero resolved upon going over into greece to receive new theatrical honors the occasion was this the cities of greece had made a law to send him the musical crowns from all the games and deputies were accordingly dispatched with this to him important embassy as he one day entertained them at his table in the most sumptuous manner and conversed with them with the utmost familiarity they entreated to hear him sing upon his complying the artful greeks knew how to satisfy his vanity by the exaggeration of their praise they testified all the marks of ecstasy and rapture applauses so warm were peculiarly pleasing nero he could not refrain from crying out that the greeks alone were worthy to hear him and accordingly prepared without delay to go into greece where he spent the whole year ensuing in this journey his retinue resembled an army in number but it was only composed of singers dancers tailors and other attendants upon the theater he passed over all greece and exhibited at all their games which he ordered to be celebrated in one year at the olympic games he resolved to show the people something extraordinary wherefore he drove a chariot with ten horses but he succeeded most wretchedly for being unable to sustain the violence of the motion he was thrown from his seat the spectators however gave him their unanimous applause and he was crowned as conqueror in this manner he obtained the prize at the isthmian pythian and nemean games the greeks were not sparing of their crowns he obtained eighteen hundred of them an unfortunate singer happened to oppose him on one of these occasions and exerted all the powers of his art which it appears was prodigious but he seems to have been a better singer than a politician for nero ordered him to be killed on the spot upon his return from greece he entered naples through a breach in the walls of the city as was customary with those who were conquerors in the olympic games but all the splendor of his return was reserved for his entry into rome there he appeared seated in the chariot of augustus dressed in robes of purple and crowned with wild olive which was the olympic garland he bore in his hand the pythian crown and had eighteen hundred more carried before him beside him sat one diodorus a musician and behind him followed a band of singers as numerous as a legion who sung in honor of his victories the senate the knights and the people attended this puerile pageant filling the air with their acclamations the whole city was illuminated every street smoked with incense wherever he passed victims were slain the pavement was strewed with saffron while garlands of flowers ribbons fowls and pasties for so we are told were showered down upon him from the windows as he past along so many honors only enflamed his desire of acquiring new he at last began to take lessons in wrestling willing to immitate hercules in strength as he had rivalled apollo in activity he also caused a lion of pasteboard to be made with great art against which he undauntedly appeared in the theater and struck it down with a blow of his club  but it had been happy for mankind had he confined himself to these puerilities and contented with being contemptible had not sought to become formidable also his cruelties even outdid all his other extravagancies a complete list of those would exceed the limits of the present work and would present the reader with an hideous repetition of suspicions without cause and punishments without mercy soon after the death of agrippina he ordered domitia his aunt to be poisoned some say that burrhus who died shortly after was served in the same manner rebellius plancus together likewise put to death and poppaea made empress in her place sylla and torquatus syllanus with many others either fell by the executioner or gave themselves a voluntary death  he seemed even studious of finding out pleasures as well as crimes against nature being attired in the habit of a woman and covered with a yellow veil like a bride he was wedded to one of his abominable companions called pythagoras and again to his freedman doriphorus on the other hand that he might be every way detestable he became the husband of a youth named sporus whom he had previously deprived of the marks of virility with this preposterous bride decked out in all the ornaments of an empress he went to all public places they always rode together in his chariot and he scrupled not to treat him as a woman in the sight of the wondering multitude however though he escaped their anger he did not fail to incur their ridicule it was observed upon one of these occasions that the world had been happy if the emperors father had been married only to such a spouse but he little regarded what the wiser part of mankind thought of him he was often heard to observe that he had rather be hated than loved when one happened to say in his presence that the world might be burnt when he was dead nay replied nero let it be burnt while i am alive in fact a great part of the city of rome was consumed by fire shortly after and most historians ascribe the conflagration to him it is said that he stood upon an high tower during the continuance of the flames enjoying the sight and repeating in a players habit and in a theatrical manner some verses upon the destruction of troy as a proof of his guilt upon this occasion none were permitted to lend any assistance toward extinguishing the flames and several persons were seen setting fire to the houses alleging that they had orders for so doing however this be the emperor used every art to throw the odium of so detestable an action from himself and to fix it upon the christians who were at that time gaining ground in rome nothing could be more dreadful than the persecution raised against them upon this false accusation some were covered with the skins of wild beasts and in that figure devoured by dogs some were crucified and others burnt alive when the day was not sufficient for their tortures the flames in which they perished says tacitus served to illuminate the night while nero dressed in the habit of a charioteer regaled himself with their tortures from his gardens and entertained the people at one time with their sufferings at another with the games of the circus in this persecution st paul was beheaded and st peter was crucified with his head downwards which death he chose as being more dishonorable than that of his divine master the inhuman monster conscious of being suspected of burning the city in order to free himself from the scandal took great care to reedify it with even greater beauty than before but he set no bounds to the magnificence with which his own palace which had shared in the conflagration was rebuilt it now received the name of the golden palace from the rich materials of which it was composed as all the apartments were adorned with the richest metals and the most precious jewels the principal hall was circular and the cieling moveable and went round in imitation of the heavenly motions the extent of the palace was not less amazing than its beauty it was so large as to contain within its walls lakes parks and vineyards the entrance was spacious enough to receive a colossal statue of the emperor an hundred and twenty feet high in short nothing either before or since ever equalled the magnificence or richness of this structure nero however when it was finished only said coolly that he was now lodged like a man but he did not seem to regard the extortions and exactions in all the provinces which were made to support this style of expense the oppression and the misery of mankind seemed to be his pleasure and he was every day contented to feast upon the desolation of a province at a single meal  hitherto however the citizens of rome seemed comparatively exempted from his cruelties which chiefly fell upon strangers and his nearest connections a conspiracy formed against him by piso a man of great power and integrity which was prematurely discovered opened a new train of suspicions that destroyed many of the principal families in rome this conspiracy in which several of the chief men of the city were concerned was first discovered by the indiscreet zeal of a woman named epicharis who by some means now unknown had been let into the plot which she revealed to volusius a tribune in order to prevail upon him to be an accomplice volusius instead of coming into her design went and discovered what he had learnt to nero who immediately put epicharis in prison soon after a freedman belonging to scaenius one of the accomplices made a farther discovery the conspirators were examined apart and as their testimonies differed they were put to the torture natalis was the first who made a confession of his own guilt and that of many others scaevinus gave a list of the conspirators still more ample lucan the poet was amongst the number and he like the rest in order to save himself still farther enlarged the catalogue naming among others attilia his own mother epicharis was now therefore again called upon and put to the torture but her fortitude was proof against all the tyrants cruelty neither scourging nor burning nor all the malicious methods used by the executioners could extort the smallest confession she was therefore remanded to prison with orders to have her tortures renewed the day following in the mean time she found an opportunity of strangling herself with her handkerchief by hanging it against the back of her chair it need scarcely be asked whether the rest of the conspirators were put to death under such a prince as nero whose daily custom was to condemn even the innocent piso lateranus fennius rufus subrius flavius sulpicius asper vestinus the consul and numberless others were all executed without mercy but the two most remarkable personages who fell on this occasion were seneca the philosopher and lucan the poet who was his nephew it is not certainly known whether seneca was really concerned in this conspiracy or not this great man had for some time perceived the outrageous conduct of his pupil and finding himself incapable of controlling his savage disposition had retire d from court into solitude and privacy however his retreat did not now protect him for nero either having real testimony against him or else hating him for his virtues sent a tribune informing him that he was suspected as an accomplice the tribune found the philosopher at table with paulina his wife and informing him of his business seneca replied without any emotion that his welfare depended upon no man that he had never been accustomed to indulge the errors of the emperor and would not do it now when this answer was brought back to nero he demanded whether seneca seemed afraid to die the tribune replying that he did not appear in the least terrified then go to him again cried the emperor and give him my orders to die this tribune was himself one of the conspirators so that instead of immediately returning he went to ask the opinion of fennius rufus his commander whether he should obey upon fenniuss advising him to it he sent a centurion to seneca signifying that it was the emperors pleasure that he should die upon receiving this fatal command seneca seemed no way discomposed but called for his will in order to make some additions to it in favor of some friends that were then with him this your however the centurion refused to grant him upon which seneca turning to his friends since then cried he i am not permitted to leave you any other marks of my affection at least i leave you one legacy more precious than all the rest my example then comforting their distress and embracing his wife the memory of her past affection seemed to melt him into tears however no way unmindful of his constancy he endeavored to console her for his loss and exhort her to a life of persevering virtue but she seemed resolved on not surviving him and pressed her request to die with him so earnestly that seneca who had long looked upon death as a benefit at last gave his consent and the veins of both their arms were opened at the same time as seneca was old and much enfeebled by the austerities of his life the blood flowed but slowly so that he caused the veins of his legs and thighs to be opened also his pains were long and violent but they were not capable of repressing his fortitude or his eloquence he dictated a discourse to two secretaries which was read with great avidity after his death by the people but which has since perished in the wreck of time his agonies being now drawn out to a great length he at last demanded poison from his physician but this also failed of its effect his body being already exhausted and incapable of exciting its operation he was from this carried into a warm bath which only served to prolong his end at length therefore he was put into a dry stove the vapor of which quickly dispatched him in the mean time his wife paulina having fallen into a swoon with the loss of blood had her arms bound up by her domestics and by this means survived her husband for some years but by her conduct during the rest of her life she seemed always mindful of her own love and his example  the death of lucan was not less remarkable the veins of his arms being opened after he had lost a great quantity of blood perceiving his hands and legs already dead while the vital parts still continued warm and vigorous he called to mind a description in his own poem of the pharsalia of a person dying in similar circumstances and expired while he was repeating that beautiful passage nec sicut vulnere sanguis emicuit lentus ruptis cadit undique venis  pars ultima trunci tradidit in cetum vacuos vitalibus artus at tumidos qua pulmo jacet qua viscera servent haeserunt ibi fata diu luctataque multum hac cum part viri vix omnia membra tulerunt    in this manner was the whole city filled with slaughter and frightful instances of treachery no master was secure from the vengeance of his slaves nor even parents from the baser attempts of their children not only throughout rome but the whole country round bodies of soldiers were seen in pursuit of the suspected and the guilty whole crowds of wretches loaded with chains were led every day to the gates of the palace to wait their sentence from the tyrants own lips he always presided at the torture in person attended by tigelinus captain of the guard who from being the most abandoned man in rome was now become his principal minister and favorite  nor were the roman provinces in a better situation than the capital city the example of the tyrant seemed to influence his governors who gave instances not only of their rapacity but their cruelty in every part of the empire in the seventh year of his reign the britons revolted under the conduct of their queen boadicia paulinus the roman general being at that time employed with part of the legions in expelling the druids from the isle of anglesey his lieutenants in his absence committed such barbarities as were intolerable to the inhabitants boadicia queen of the iceni was treated with peculiar indignity being condemned to be scourged and her daughters deflowered by the soldiery in revenge therefore at the head of a numerous army she fell upon the romans wherever they were unprovided took their castles destroyed the chief seats of their power at london and verulam and so great was her fury that seventy thousand romans perished in this revolt but the roman general soon after revenged his countrymen by a great and decisive battle in which eighty thousand britons are said to have perished and boadicia herself rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor put an end to her life by poison by this remarkable defeat the britons ever after during the continuance of the romans among them lost not only all hopes but even all desire of freedom  a war also was carried on against the parthians for the greatest part of this reign conducted by corbuto who after many successes had dispossessed tiridates and settled tigranes in armenia in his room tiridates however was soon after restored by an invasion of the parthiana into that country but being once more opposed by corbulo the romans and parthians came to an agreement that tiridates should continue to govern armenia upon condition that he should lay down his crown at the feet of the emperors statue and receive it as coming from him all which he shortly after performed a ceremony however which nero desired to have repeated to his person wherefore by letters and promises he invited tiridates to rome granting him the most magnificent supplies for his journey nero attended his arrival with very sumptuous preparations he received him seated on a throne accompanied by the senate standing round him and the whole army drawn out with all imaginable splendor tiridates ascended the throne with great reverence and approaching the emperor fell down at his feet and in the most abject terms acknowledged himself his slave nero raised him up telling him with equal arrogance that he did well and that by his submission he had gained a kingdom which his ancestors could never acquire by their arms he then placed the crown on his head and after the most costly ceremonies and entertainments he was sent back to armenia with incredible sums of money to defray the expenses of his return  in the twelfth year of this emperors reign the jews also revolted having been severely oppressed by the roman governors it is said that florus in particular was arrived at that degree of tyranny that by public proclamation he gave permission to plunder the country provided he received half the spoil these oppressions drew such a train of calamities after them that the sufferings of all other nations were slight in comparison to what this devoted people afterward endured i shall mention them more at length in the reign of vespasian in which as christ had prophesied they came to a completion  in the mean time nero proceeded in his cruelties at rome with unabated severity rufius crispinus and annaeus mella the brother of seneca were destroyed upon slight suspicions the death of petronius about this the utmost cheerfulness and tranquillity he conversed with his friends not upon maxims of philosophy or grave subjects but upon such topics as had amused his gayest revels he listened while they recited the lightest poems and by no action no word nor circumstance showed the perplexity of a dying person shortly after him numicius thermus was put to death as likewise barea soranus and petus thrasea the destroying the two last tacitus calls an attack upon virtue itself thrasea died in the midst of his friends and philosophers conversing and reasoning on the nature of the soul his wife who was the daughter of the celebrated arria was desirous of following her mothers example but he dissuaded her from it the death of the valiant corbulo who had gained nero so many victories over the parthians followed next nor did the empress poppea herself escape whom in a fit of anger he kicked when she was pregnant by which she miscarried and died at length human nature grew weary of bearing her persecutor and the whole world seemed to rouse as if by common consent to rid the earth of a monster  the inbred distempers of the empire which had been contracted under the detestable government of four succeeding princes now began to discover themselves in their furious effects and there appeared a general revolution in all the provinces  the first appeared in gaul under julius vindex who commanded the legions there and publicly protested against the tyrannical government of nero he appeared to have no other motive for this revolt than that of freeing the world from an oppressor for when it was told him that nero had set a reward upon his head of ten millions of sesterces he made this gallant answer whoever brings me neros head shall if he pleases have mine but still more to show he was not actuated by motives of private ambition he proclaimed sergius galba emperor and invited him to join in the revolt sergius galba who was at that time governor of spain was equally remarkable for his wisdom in peace and his courage in war but as all talents under corrupt princes are dangerous he for some years had seemed willing to court obscurity giving himself up to an inactive life and avoiding all opportunities of signalizing his valor he now therefore either through the caution attending old age or from a total want of ambition appeared little inclined to join with vindex and continued for some time to deliberate with his friends on the part he should take  in the mean time nero who had been apprized of the proceedings against him in gaul appeared totally regardless of the danger privately flattering himself that the suppression of this revolt would give him an opportunity of fresh confiscations he appeared therefore at the theater as usual and seemed to interest himself as warmly in the contests there as if he had totally forgot that there was a contention for his empire being then at naples he excused himself in his letters to the senate for not immediately coming to rome as he was detained by an hoarseness which he was afraid to increase the care of his voice was still uppermost in his mind and nothing seemed to give him greater uneasiness than that vindex in his manifestoes should call him a miserable musician he frequently asked those about him whether it was possible one who had studied the art so long and carefully as he had done should be the bungler he was represented by vindex  the circumstances of the revolt growing more formidable every hour nero returned to rome with a mixture of hope exultation and revenge observing an ancient monument by the way side on which were the statues of a roman knight overcoming a gaulish soldier he looked upon this as a favorable omen and was transported with pleasure at the adventure upon entering the city he convened a few of his creatures among the senate and entertained them not by deliberations upon the state of his affairs but by showing them some musical instruments that were to be played upon by water he explained to them their mechanism their advantages and defects adding with an ironical air that he hoped with vindexs permission to exhibit this instrument upon the theater  the actual revolt of galba the news of which arrived soon after affected him in a very different manner the reputation of that general was such that from the moment he declared against him nero considered himself as undone he received the account as he was at supper and instantly struck with terror overturned the table with his foot breaking two crystal vases of immense value he then fell into a swoon from which when he recovered he tore his clothes and struck his head crying out that he was utterly undone it was then that he began to meditate slaughters more extensive than he yet had committed and tortures yet untried he was resolved to massacre all the governors of provinces to destroy all exiles and to murder all the gauls in rome as a punishment for the treachery of their countrymen in short in the wildness of his rage he thought of poisoning the whole senate of burning the city and turning the lions kept for the purposes of the theater out upon the people these designs being impracticable he resolved at last to face the danger in person but his very preparations served to mark the infatuation of his mind his principal care was to provide wagons for the convenient carriage of his musical instruments and to dress out his concubines like amazons with whom he intended to face the enemy he also made a resolution that if he came off with safety and empire he would appear again upon the theater with the lute and the watermusic and would equip himself as a pantomime  while nero was thus frivolously employed the revolt became general not only the armies in spain and gaul but also the legions in germany africa and lusitania declared against him virginius rufus alone who commanded an army on the upper rhine for a while continued in suspense during which his forces without his permission falling upon the gauls routed them with great slaughter and vindex slew himself but this ill success no way advanced the interests of nero he was so detested by the whole empire that he could find none of the armies faithful to him however they might disagree with each other he therefore called for locusta to furnish him with poison and thus prepared for the worst he retired to the servelian gardens with a resolution of flying into egypt he accordingly dispatched the freedmen in whom he had the most confidence to prepare a fleet at ostia and in the mean while sounded in person the tribunes and centurions of the guard to know if they were willing to share his fortunes but they all excused themselves under diverse pretexts one of them had the boldness to answer him by part of a line from virgil  usque adeone miserum est mori is death then such a misfortune thus destitute of every resource all the expedients that cowardice revenge or terror could produce took place in his mind by turns he at one time resolved to take refuge among the parthians at another to deliver himself up to the mercy of the insurgents one while he determined to mount the rostrum to ask pardon for what was past and to conclude with promise of amendment for the future with these gloomy deliberations he went to bed but waking about midnight he was surprised to find his guards had left him the praetorian soldiers in fact having been corrupted by their commander had retired to their camp and proclaimed galba emperor nero immediately sent for his friends to deliberate upon his present exigence but his friends also forsook him even tigelinus himself the creature of his benefits and the partaker of his guilt had gone over to galba he went in person from house to house but all the doors were shut against him and none were found to answer his enquiries while he was pursuing this enquiry his very domestics followed the general defection and having plundered his apartment escaped different ways being now reduced to a state of desperation he desired that one of his favorite gladiators might come and dispatch him but even in this request there was none found to obey alas cried he have i neither friend nor enemy and then running desperately forth seemed resolved to plunge headlong into the tyber but just then his courage beginning to fail him he made a sudden stop as if willing to recollect his reason and asked for some secret place where he might re assume his courage and meet death with becoming fortitude in this distress phaon one of his freedmen offered him his country house about four miles distant where he might for some time remain concealed nero accepted his offer and half dressed as he was with his head covered and hiding his face with an handkerchief he mounted on horseback attended by four of his domestics of whom the wretched sporus was one his journey though short was crowded with adventures an earthquake gave him the first alarm the lightning from heaven next flashed in his face round him he heard nothing but confused noises from the camp and the cries of the soldiers imprecating a thousand evils upon his head a passenger meeting him on the way cried there go men in pursuit of nero another asked him if there were any news of nero in the city his horse taking fright at a dead body that lay near the road he dropped his handkerchief and a soldier who was near addressed him by name he now therefore quitted his horse and forsaking the highway entered a thicket that led toward the back part of phaons house through which he crept making the best of his way among the reeds and brambles with which the place was overgrown when he was arrived at the back part of the house while he was waiting till there should be a breach made in the wall he took up some water in the hollow of his hands from a pool to drink saying these are the delicacies of nero when the hole was made large enough to admit him he crept in upon all fours and took a short repose upon a wretched pallet that had been prepared for his reception being pressed by hunger he demanded somewhat to eat they brought him a piece of brown bread which he refused but drank a little water during this interval the senate finding the praetorian guards had taken part with galba declared him emperor and condemned nero to die more majorum that is according to the rigor of the ancient laws these dreadful tidings were quickly brought by one of phaons slaves from the city while nero yet continued lingering between his hopes and his fears at one time this most wretched of all mankind was employed in providing stones for his tomb at another in preparing wood and water for his funeral now repeating verses expressive of the horrors of his mind again giving vent to his tears and crying out what an artist is the world likely to loose when he was told of the resolution of the senate against him he asked the messenger what was meant by being punished according to the rigor of the ancient laws to this he was answered that the criminal was to be stripped naked his head was to be fixed in a pillory and in that posture he was to be scourged to death nero was so terrified at this that he seized two poniards which he had brought with him and examining their points returned them to their sheaths pretending that the fatal moment was not yet arrived he then desired sporus to begin the lamentations which were used at funerals he next entreated that some one of his attendants would die to give him courage by his example and afterward began to reproach his own cowardice crying out does this become nero is this trifling well timed no no let me be courageous in fact he had no time to spare for the soldiers who had been sent in pursuit of him were just then approaching the house wherefore hearing the sound of the horses feet he set a dagger to his throat with which by the assistance of epaphroditus his freedman and secretary he gave himself a mortal wound however he was not yet quite dead when one of the centurions entering the room and pretending he came to his relief attempted to stop the blood with his cloak but nero regarding him with a stern countenance said it is now too late is this your fidelity upon which with his eyes fixed and frightfully staring he expired even in death a ghastly spectacle of innoxious tyranny  little need be said concerning the character of a monarch whose very name is become a term of reproach to all bad princes his natural disposition was extremely bad but it was rendered still more detestable by flattery all orders of men were at this time so depraved that each seemed eager to contend which should be most instrumental in pushing him on to his excesses and applauding him when he had committed them it must be a strong mind that being assaulted thus on every side can stand unshaken and trace out for itself the track of undeviating virtue thus much i think we may say of this most wretched man notwithstanding the concurrent reproach of all historians that through the greatest part of his reign he himself seemed ignorant of his being a tyrant  he reigned thirteen years seven months and twentyeight days and died in the thirtysecond year of his reign  chap viii sergius galba the seventh emperor of rome the rejoicings at rome upon neros  galba was seventytwo years old when he was declared emperor and was then in spain with his legions however he soon found that his being raised to the throne was but an inlet to new disquietudes his first embarrassment arose from a disorder in his own army for upon his approaching the camp one of the wings of his horse repenting of their choice prepared to revolt and he found it no easy matter to reconcile them to their duty he also narrowly escaped assassination from some slaves who were presented to him by one of neros freedmen with that intent the death of vindex also served not a little to add to his disquietudes so that upon his very entrance into empire he had some thoughts of putting an end to his own life but hearing from rome that nero was dead and the empire transferred to him he immediately assumed the title and ensigns of command in his journey toward rome he was met by rufus virginius who finding the senate had decreed him the government came to yield him obedience this general had more than once refused the empire himself which was offered him by his soldiers alleging that the senate alone had the disposal of it and from them only he would accept the honor shortly after this many of those who were most notorious during the last reign and who attempted to disturb the present were cut off among these were nymphidius sabinus prefect of the praetorian guards at rome fonteius capito lieutenant in germany and clodius macer proconsul in africa  galba having been brought to the empire by means of his army was at the same time willing to suppress their power to commit any future disturbance his first approach to rome was attended with one of those rigorous strokes of justice which ought rather to be defended than immitated a body of mariners whom nero had taken from the oar and enlisted among the legions went to meet galba three miles from the city and with loud importunities demanded a confirmation of what his predecessor had done in their favor galba who was rigidly attached to the ancient discipline deferred their request to another time but they considering this delay as equivalent to an absolute denial insisted upon their request in a very disrepectful manner and even some of them had recourse to arms whereupon galba ordered a body of horse attending him to ride in among them and thus killed seven thousand of them but not content with this punishment he afterward ordered them to be decimated their insolence demanded correction but such extensive punishments deviated into cruelty his next step to curb the insolence of the soldiers was his discharging the german cohort which had been established by the former emperors as a guard to their persons those he sent home to their own country unrewarded pretending they were disaffected to his person  he seemed to have two other objects also in view namely to punish those vices which had come to an enormous height in the last reign with the strictest severity and to replenish the exchequer which had been quite drained by the prodigality of his predecessors these attempts only brought on him the imputation of severity and avarice the state was too much corrupted to admit of such an immediate transition from vice to virtue as this worthy but weak politician attempted to effect the people had long been maintained in sloth and luxury by the prodigality of the former emperors and could not think of being obliged to seek for new means of subsistence or retrench their superfluities they began therefore to satirize the old man and turn the simplicity of his manners into ridicule among the marks of avarice recorded of him he is said to have groaned upon having an expensive soup served up to his table he is said to have presented to his steward for his fidelity a plate of beans a famous player upon the flute named canus having greatly delighted him it is reported that he drew out his purse and gave him five pence telling him that it was private and not public money by such illjudgd frugalities at such a time galba began to lose his popularity and he who before his accession was esteemed by all now being become emperor was considered with ridicule and contempt  but there are some circumstances of avarice alleged against him less equivocal than those trifling ones already mentioned shortly after his coming to rome the people were presented with a most grateful spectacle which was that of locusta elius polycletus patronius and petinus all the bloody ministers of neros cruelty drawn in fetters through the city and publicly executed but tigelinus the most notorious offender of all was not there this crafty villain had taken care for his own safety by the largeness of his bribes and though the people cried cut for vengeance against him at the theater and the circus yet the emperor granted him his life and pardon helotus the eunuch also who had been the instrument of poisoning claudius escaped and owed his safety to the proper application of his wealth  this collusion however was owing rather to the avarice of galbas favorites than to his for whether from the infirmity of age or the multiplicity of business he now suffered himself to be entirely governed by three favorites who being continually in his presence were commonly styled his masters these were titus venius who had been his lieutenant in spain a man of insatiable avarice caius laco whom he had made prefect of the praetorian bands and icelus his freedman who aspired at the highest command in the equestrian order these three very different in their dispositions influenced the emperor to opposite pursuits and only agreed in one point that of abusing his confidence thus by the inequality of his conduct he became despicable to his subjects at one time showing himself severe and frugal at another remiss and prodigal condemning some illustrious persons without any hearing and pardoning others though guilty in short nothing was done but by the mediation of these favorites all offices were venal and all punishments redeemable by money  affairs were in this unsettled posture at rome while the provinces were yet in a worse condition the success of the army in spain in choosing an emperor induced the legions in other parts to wish for a similar opportunity accordingly many seditions were kindled and several factions promoted in different parts of the empire but particularly in germany there were then in that province two roman armies the one which had lately attempted to make rufus virginius emperor as has been already mentioned and which was commanded by his lieutenant the other commanded by vitellius who long had an ambition to obtain the empire for himself the former of these armies despising their present general and considering themselves as suspected by the emperor for having been the last to acknowledge his title resolved now to be foremost in denying it accordingly when they were summoned to take the oaths of homage and fidelity they refused to acknowledge any other commands but those of the senate this refusal they backed by a message to the praetorian bands importing that they were resolved not to acquiesce in the election of an emperor created in spain and desiring that the senate should proceed to a new choice  galba being informed of these commotions was sensible that beside his age he was less respected for want of an heir he resolved therefore to put what he had formerly designed in execution and to adopt some person whose virtues might deserve such advancement and protect his declining age from danger his favorites understanding his determination instantly resolved on giving him an heir of their own choosing so that there arose a great contention among them upon this occasion otho made warm application for himself alleging the great services he had done the emperor as being the first man of note who came to his assistance when he had declared against nero however galba being fully resolved to consult the public good alone rejected his suit and on a day appointed ordered piso lucinianus to attend him the character given by historians of piso is that he was every way worthy of the honor designed him he was no way related to galba and had no other interest but merit to recommend him to his favor taking this youth therefore by the hand in the presence of his friends he adopted him to succeed in the empire giving him the most wholesome lessons for guiding his future conduct pisos conduct showed that he was highly deserving this distinction in all his deportment there appeared such modesty firmness and equality of mind as bespoke him rather capable of discharging than ambitious of obtaining his present dignity but the army and the senate did not seem equally disinterested upon this occasion they had been so long used to bribery and corruption that they could now bear no emperor who was not in a capacity of satisfying their avarice the adoption therefore of piso was but coldly received for his virtues were no recommendation in a nation of universal depravity  otho now finding his hopes of adoption wholly frustrated and still further stimulated by the immense load of debt which he had contracted by his riotous way of living resolved upon obtaining the empire by force since he could not by peaceable succession in fact his circumstances were so very desperate that he was heard to say that it was equal to him whether he fell by his enemies in the field or by his creditors in the city he therefore raised a moderate sum of money by selling his interest to a person who wanted a place and with this bribed two subaltern officers in the praetorian bands supplying the deficiency of his largesses by promises and plausible pretenses having in this manner in less than eight days corrupted the fidelity of the soldiers he stole secretly from the emperor while he was sacrificing and assembling the soldiers in a short speech urged the cruelties and the avarice of galba finding these his invectives received with universal shouts by the whole army he entirely threw off the mask and avowed his intentions of dethroning him the soldiers being ripe for sedition immediately seconded his views and taking otho upon their shoulders immediately declared him emperor and to strike the citizens with terror carried him with their swords drawn into the camp  galba in the mean time being informed of the revolt of the army seemed utterly confounded and in want of sufficient resolution to face an event which he should have long foreseen in this manner the poor old man continued wavering and doubtful till at last being deluded by a false report of othos being slain he rode into the forum in complete armor and attended by many of his followers just at the same instant a body of horse sent from the camp to destroy him entered on the opposite side and each party prepared for the encounter for some time hostilities were suspended on each side galba confused and irresolute and his antagonists struck with horror at the baseness of their enterprise at length however finding the emperor in some measure deserted by his adherents they rushed in upon him trampling the crowds of people that then filled the forum under foot galba seeing them approach seemed to recollect all his former fortitude and bending his head forward bid the assassins strike it off if it were for the good of the people this was quickly performed and his head being set upon the point of a lance was presented to otho who ordered it to be contemptuously carried round the camp his body remaining unburied in the streets till it was buried by one of his  chap xi otho the eighth emperor of rome no sooner was galba thus murdered than the senate and people ran in crowds to the camp contending who should be foremost in extolling the virtues of the new emperor and depressing the character of him they had so unjustly destroyed each labored to excel the rest in his instances of homage and the less his affections were for him the more did he indulge all the vehemece of exaggerated praise otho finding himself surrounded by congratulating multitudes immediately repaired to the senate where he received the titles usually given to the emperors and from thence returned to the palace seemingly resolved to reform his life and assume manners becoming the greatness of his station  he began his reign by a signal instance of clemency in pardoning marius celsus who had been highly favored by galba and not contented with barely forgiving he advanced him to the highest honors asserting that fidelity deserved every reward this act of clemency was followed by another of justice equally agreeable to the people tigellinus neros favorite he who had been the promoter of all his cruelties was now put to death and all such as had been unjustly banished or stripped at his instigation during neros reign were restored to their country and fortunes  in the mean time the legions in lower germany having been purchased by the large gifts and specious promises of vitellius their general were at length induced to proclaim him emperor and regardless of the senate declared that they had an equal right to appoint to that high station with the cohorts at rome the news of this conduct in the army soon spread consternation throughout rome but otho was particularly struck with the account as being apprehensive that nothing but the blood of his countrymen could decide a contest of which his own ambition only was the cause of all characters in history othos seems that alone which was mended by advancement for we now find otho the emperor very different from himself when in a private station he was at that time weak vicious and debauched but upon the present occasion he appears courageous benevolent and humane he now therefore sought to come to an agreement with vitellius but this not succeeding both sides began their preparations sor war however all things seemed to be unfavourable to otho the chief of the senate were grown old and impotent the rich men of rome were indolent and slothful the knights had long been dissolved in ease and luxury and the cohorts themselves were relaxed from the military discipline of their ancestors news being received that vitellius was upon his march to italy otho departed from rome with a vast army to oppose him but though he was very powerful with regard to numbers his men being but little used to war could not be relied on he seemed by his behavior sensible of the disproportion of his forces and he is said to have been tortured with frightful dreams and the most boding apprehensions it is also reported by some that one night fetching many profound sighs in his sleep his servants ran hastily to his bedside and found him stretched on the ground he alleged he had seen the ghost of galba which had in a threatening manner beat and pushed him rudely from the bed and he afterward used many expiations to appease it however this be he proceeded with a great show of courage till he arrived at the city of brixellum on the river po where he remained sending his forces before him under the conduct of his generals suetonius and celsus who made what haste they could to give the enemy battle the army of vitellius which consisted of seventy thousand men was commanded by his generals valens and cecina he himself remaining in gaul in order to bring up the rest of his forces thus both sides hastened to meet each other with so much animosity and precipitation that three considerable battles were fought in the space of three days one near placentia another near cremona and a third at a place called castor in all which otho and the romans had the advantage but these successes were but of shortlived continuance for valens and cecinnia who had hitherto acted separately joining their forces and reinforcing their armies with fresh supplies resolved to come to a general engagement otho who by this time had joined his army at a little village called bebriacum finding the enemy notwithstanding their late losses inclined to come to a battle resolved to call a council of war to determine upon the proper measures to be taken his generals were of opinion to protract the war but others whose inexperience had given them causeless confidence declared that nothing but a battle could relieve the miseries of the state protesting that fortune and all the gods with the divinity of the emperor himself favored the design and would undoubtedly prosper the enterprise in this advice otho acquiesced he had been for some time so uneasy under the war that he seemed willing to exchange suspense for danger however he was so surrounded by flatterers that he was prohibited from being personally present in the engagement but prevailed upon to reserve himserve himself for the fortune of the empire and wait the event at brixellum the affairs of both armies being thus adjusted they came to an engagement at bebriacum where in the beginning those on the side of otho seemed to have the advantage and at the first onset slew all the first rank and won the eagle which was considered as a certain presage of victory both armies were extremely encumbered with trees and hedges so that they were obliged to fight with very little regularity and the engagement seemed a tumultuary opposition of forces without a plan and without a commander at length however the superior discipline of the legions of vitellius turned the scale of victory they after some time formed themselves from a state of apparent confusion and attacking the enemy in flank gained a signal and decisive victory othos army fled in great confusion toward bebriacum being pursued with a miserable slaughter all the way  in the mean time otho waited for the news of the battle with great impatience and seemed to tax his messengers with delay the first account of his defeat was brought him by a common soldier who had escaped from the field of battle however otho who was still surrounded by flatterers was desired to give no credit to a base fugitive who was guilty of falsehood only to cover his own cowardice the soldier however still persisted in the veracity of his report and finding none inclined to believe him immediately fell upon his sword and expired at the emperors feet otho was so much struck with the death of this faithful sentinel that he cried out that he would cause the ruin of no more such valiant and worthy soldiers but would end the contest by the shortest way it was in vain therefore that his followers gathered round him endeavoring to revive his hopes and inspire him with fresh ambition in vain did those who were too distant to be heard lift up their hands to beseech him he was deaf to all their entreaties he had formed a resolution to die as the only means of ridding himself of his cares and his country of its calamities having therefore given the signal for speaking he addressed the shattered remains of his army with great intrepidity i esteem cried he this day as far more glorious than that of my election since it has convinced me of your fidelity and affection i must however entreat for one favor more which is to die in order to procure your safety i can never so much advance the interests of my country by war and blood as by sacrificing myself for its peace others have purchased fame by governing well let it be my boast to leave an empire rather than by my ambition to weaken or destroy it after speaking to this effect he entreated his followers to yield themselves to vitellius and not provoke him by obstinacy or delay then rebuking the unreasonable fears of those about him without any signs of fear either in his looks or words he retired to his chamber there he wrote two consolatory letters to his sister and a third to messalina whom he had designed for his wife he next burnt such letters and papers as might be prejudicial to his friends and distributed some money and jewels among his friends and domestics he then prepared to die but perceiving a tumult among the soldiers who prepared to punish some that were going privately away he cried out let me then add one day more to my life upon which he ordered his chamber door to be thrown open and employed the remaining part of the day in hindering the violence of his soldiers and giving advice to all such as desired admittance having thus performed the duties of his station and having quenched his thirst with a draught of cold water he ordered the doors to be secured he then took two daggers and having tried and chosen the sharpest he laid it under his pillow and fell into a profound sleep awaking by break of day he perceived one of his servants remaining in the room whom he commanded to retire then taking the dagger he gave himself a mortal blow on the left side and with a single groan ended his life after a short reign of three months and five days there is something in the conclusion of this princes reign that seems to atone for the vile methods by which he acquired dominion his clemency and justice while he continued on the throne and the calm manner in which he resigned it make us almost regret his wanting an opportunity to display his newly acquired virtues with more permanent luster  chap x vitellius the ninth emperor of rome   vitellius was immediately after declared emperor by the senate and received the marks of distinction which were now accustomed to follow the appointment of the strongest side at the same time italy was severely embarrassed by the soldiers who committed such outrages as exceeded all the oppressions of the most calamitous war vitellius who was yet in gaul resolved before he set out for rome to punish the praetorian cohorts who had been the instruments of all the late disturbances in the state he therefore caused them to be disarmed and deprived of the name and honor of soldiers he ordered also an hundred and fifty of those who were most guilty to be put to death  these bright beginnings however were soon shaded by his vices and extravagance as he approached toward rome he passed through the towns with all imaginable splendor his passage by water was in painted galleys adorned with garlands of flowers and profusely furnished with the greatest delicacies in his journey there neither was order nor discipline among his soldiers they plundered wherever they came with impunity and he seemed no way displeased at the licentiousness of their behavior upon his arrival on the field where the battle was fought which put him in possession of the empire observing the great number of dead bodies scattered over the plain men and horses confusedly intermixed putrefying and tainting the air with their stench he seemed no way shocked at the spectacle but observed to those about him that a dead enemy smelt well and then calling for wine he drank upon the field and ordered large quantities to be distributed among his soldiers  upon his arrival at rome he entered the city not as a place he came to govern with justice but as a town that was become his own by the laws of conquest he marched through the streets mounted on horseback all in armor the senate and people going before him as if the captives of his late victory he the next day made the senate a speech in which he magnified his own actions and promised them extraordinary advantages from his administration he next harangued the people who being now long accustomed to flatter all in authority highly applauded and blessed their new emperor  in the mean time his soldiers being permitted to satiate themselves in the debaucheries of the city grew totally unfit for war the principal affairs of the state were managed by the lowest wretches whom fortune in her capricious moments seemed pleased with exalting asiaticus his freedman attended by a groupe of players and charioteers governed all things and brought virtue into disrepute by their example vitellius more abandoned than they gave himself up to all kinds of luxury and profuseness but gluttony was his favorite vice so that he brought himself to an habit of vomiting in order to be able to renew his meals at pleasure his entertainments though seldom at his own cost were prodigiously expensive he frequently invited himself to the tables of his subjects breakfasting with one dining with another and supping with a third all in the same day the most memorable of these entertainments was that made for him by his brother on his arrival at rome in this were served up two thousand several dishes of fish and seven thousand fowl of the most valuable kinds but in one particular dish he seemed to have outdone all the former profusion of the most luxurious romans this dish which was of such magnitude as to be called the shield of minerva was filled with an olio made from the sounds of the fish called scarri the brains of pheasants and woodcocks the tongues of the most costly birds and the spawn of lampreys brought from the carpathian sea in order to cook this dish properly a furnace was built in the fields as it was too large for any kitchen to contain it  in this manner did this beasly creature proceed spending his time in the most gross sensualities so that josephus tells us that if he had reigned long the whole empire would not have been sufficient to have maintained his gluttony all the attendants of his court sought to raise themselves not by their virtue and abilities but the sumptuousness of their entertainments this prodigality produced its attendant want and that in turn gave rise to cruelty  those who had formerly been his associates were now destroyed without mercy going to visit one of them in a violent fever he mingled poison with his water and delivered it to him with his own hands he never pardoned those money lenders who came to demand payment of his former debts one of the number coming to salute him he immediately ordered him to be carried off to execution but shortly after commanding him to be brought back when all his attendants thought it was to pardon the unhappy creditor vitellius gave them soon to understand that it was merely to have the pleasure of feeding his eyes with his torments having condemned another to death he executed his two sons with him only for their presuming to intercede for their father a roman knight being dragged away to execution and crying out that he had made the emperor his heir vitellius demanded to see the will where finding himself joint heir with another he ordered both to be executed that he might enjoy the legacy without a partner  by the continuance of such vices and cruelties as these he became not only a burden to himself but odious to all mankind the astrologers a set of people who seldom fail to foretell the ruin of one whose whole study it is to become inimical to the world began by prognosticating his downfall a writing was set up in the forum to this effect we in the name of the ancient chaldaeans give vitellius warning to depart this life by the calends of october vitellius on his part received their information with terror and ordered all the astrologers to be banished from rome an old woman having foretold that if he survived his mother he should reign many years in happiness and security this gave him a desire of putting her to death which he did by refusing her sustenance under pretense of its being prejudicial to her health but he soon saw the futility of relying upon such vain prognostications for his soldiers by their cruelty and rapine having become insupportable to the inhabitants of rome the legions of the east who had at first acquiesced in his dominion began to revolt and shortly after unanimously resolved to make vespasian emperor  vespasian who was appointed commander against the rebellious jews had reduced most of their country except jerusalem to subjection the death of nero however had at first interrupted the progress of his arms and the succession of galba gave a temporary check to his conquests as he was obliged to send his son titus to rome to receive that emperors commands titus however was so long detained by contrary winds that he received news of galbas death before he set sail he then resolved to continue neuter during the civil wars between otho and vitellius and when the latter prevailed he gave him his homage with reluctance but being desirous of acquiring reputation though he disliked the government he determined to lay siege to jerusalem and actually made preparations for that great undertaking when he was given to understand that vitellius was detested by all ranks in the empire these murmurings increased every day while vespasian secretly endeavored to advance the discontents of his army by these means they began at length to fix their eyes upon him as a person the most capable and willing to terminate the miseries of his country and put a period to the injuries it suffered not only the legions under his command but those in maesia and pannonia came to the same resolution so that they declared themselves for vespasian he was also without his own consent proclaimed emperor at alexandria the army there confirming it with extraordinary applause and paying their accustomed homage still however vespasian seemed to decline the honors done him till at length his soldiers compelled him with their threats of immediate death to accept a title which in all probability he wished to enjoy he now therefore called a council of war where it was resolved that his son titus should carry on the war against the jews and that mutianus one of his generals should with the greatest part of his legions enter italy while vespasian himself should levy forces in all parts of the east in order to reinforce them in case of necessity  during these preparations vitellius though buried in sloth and luxury was resolved to make an effort to defend the empire wherefore his chief commanders valens and cecinna were ordered to make all possible preparations to resist the invaders the first army that entered italy with an hostile intention was under the command of antonius primus who was met by cecinna near cremona a battle was expected to ensue but a negotiation taking place cecinna was prevailed upon to change sides and declare for vespasian his army however quickly repented of what they had done and imprisoning their general attacked antonius though without a leader the engagement continued during the whole night and in the morning after a short repast both armies engaged a second time when the soldiers of antonius saluting the rising sun according to custom the vitellians supposing that they had received new reinforcements betook themselves to flight with the loss of thirty thousand men shortly after freeing their general cecinna from prison they prevailed upon him to intercede with the conquerors for pardon which they obtained though not without the most horrid barbarities committed upon cremona the city to which they had retired for shelter  in the mean time vitellius was wallowing in all kinds of luxury and excess however when informed of the defeat of his army his former insolence was converted into an extreme of timidity and irresolution at length rousing from his lethargy of protracted vice he commanded julius priscus and alphenus varus with some forces that were in readiness to guard the passes of the appenines to prevent the enemys march to rome reserving the principal body of his army to secure the city under the command of his brother lucius at length being persuaded to repair to his army in person his presence only served to increase the contempt of his soldiers he there appeared irresolute and still luxurious without counsel or conduct ignorant of war and demanding from others those instructions which it was his duty to give after a short continuance in the camp and understanding the revolt of his fleet he returned once more to rome ever fearful of the last blow and always careless as to the principal object of his concern every day however only served to render his affairs still more desperate till at last he made offers to vespasian of resigning the empire provided his life were granted and a sufficient revenue for his support in order to enforce this request he issued from his palace in deep mourning with all his domestics weeping round him he then went to offer the sword of justice to cecilius the consul which he refusing the abject emperor prepared to lay down the ensigns of empire in the temple of concord but being interrupted by some who cried out that he himself was concord he resolved upon so weak an encouragement still to maintain his power and immediately prepared for his defense  during this fluctuation of counsels one sabinus who had advised vitellius to resign perceiving his desperate situation resolved by a bold step to oblige vespasian and accordingly seized upon the capitol but he was premature in his attempt for the soldiers of vitellius attacked him with great fury and prevailing by their numbers soon laid that beautiful building in ashes during this dreadful conflagration vitellius was feasting in the palace of tiberius and beholding all the horrors of the assault with great satisfaction sabinus was taken prisoner and shortly after executed by the emperors command young domitian his nephew who was afterward emperor escaped by flight in the habit of a priest and all the rest who survived the fire were put to the sword  but this transient gleam of success served little to improve the affairs of vitellius he vainly sent messenger after messenger to bring vespasians general antonius to a composition this commander however gave no answer to his requests but still continued his march toward rome being arrived before the walls of the city the forces of vitellius were resolved upon defending it to the utmost extremity it was attacked on three sides with the utmost fury while the army within sallying upon the besiegers defended it with equal obstinacy the battle lasted a whole day till at last the besieged were driven into the city and a dreadful slaughter made of them in all the streets which they vainly attempted to defend in the mean time the citizens stood by looking on as both sides fought and as if they had been in a theater clapped their hands at one time encouraging one party and again the other as either turned their backs the citizens would then fall upon them in their places of refuge and so kill and plunder them without mercy but what was still more remarkable during these dreadful slaughters both within and without the city the people would not be prevented from celebrating one of their most riotous feasts called the saturnalia so that at one te might have been seen a strange mixture of mirth and misery of cruelty and lewdness in one place buryings and slaughters in another drunkenness and feasting here streams of blood and heaps of mangled bodies there lewd debaucheries and shameless strumpets in a word all the horrors of a civil war and all the licentiousness of the most abandoned security  during this complicated scene of misery vitellius who had been the cause of it all retired privately to his wifes house upon mount aventine designing that night to fly to the army commanded by his brother at tarracina but quite incapable through fear of forming any resolution he changed his mind and returned again to his palace now void and desolate all his slaves now forsaking him in his distress and purposely avoiding his presence there after wandering for some time quite disconsolate and fearing the face of every creature he met he hid himself in an obscure corner from whence he was soon taken by a party of the conquering soldiers still however willing to add a few hours more to his miserable life he begged to be kept in prison till the arrival of vespasian at rome pretending that he had secrets of importance to discover but his entreaties were vain the soldiers binding his hands behind him and throwing an halter round his neck led him along half naked into the public forum upbraiding him as they proceeded with all those bitter reproaches their malice could suggest or his own cruelty could deserve they also tied his hair backwards as was usual with the most infamous malefactors and held the point of a sword under his chin to prevent his hiding his face from the public some cast dirt and filth upon him as he passed others struck him with their hands some ridiculed the defects of his person his red fiery face and the enormous greatness of his belly at length being come to the place of punishment they killed him with many blows and then dragging the dead body through the streets with an hook they threw it with all possible ignominy into the river tyber such was the merited end of this brutal emperor in the fiftyseventh year of his age after a short reign of eight months and five days so that plutarch compares this emperor and his two predecessors to the kings in tragedies who just appear upon the stage and then are destroyed vitellius seemed the only tyrant who entered upon his command with cruelty nero and caligula gave the beginnings of their reign to mercy and justice but this monster was first advanced for his vices began his gvernment with cruelty continued it with universal detestation and died to the satisfaction of all mankind  chap xi vespasian the tenth emperor of rome   at length however upon the arrival of mutianus general to vespasian these slaughters ceased and the state began to wear an appearance of former tranquillity vespasian was declared emperor by the unanimous consent both of the senate and the army and dignified with all those titles which now followed rather the power than the merit of those who were appointed to govern messengers were dispatched to him into egypt desiring his return and testifying the utmost desire for his government however the winter being dangerous for sailing he deferred his voyage to a more convenient season perhaps also the dissensions in other parts of the empire retarded his return to rome for claudius civilis in lower germany excited his countrymen to revolt and destroyed the roman garrisons which were placed in different parts of that province however to give his rebellion an air of justice he caused his army to swear allegiance to vespasian until he found himself in a condition to throw off the mask when he thought himself sufficiently powerful he disclaimed all submission to the roman government and having overcome one or two of the lieutenants of the empire and being joined by such of the romans as refused obedience to the new empeperor he boldly advanced to give cerealis vespasians general battle in the beginning of this engagement he seemed successful breaking the roman legions and putting their cavalry to flight but at length cerealis by his conduct turned the fate of the day and not only routed the enemy but took and destroyed their camp this engagement however was not decisive several others ensued with doubtful success an accommodation at length determined what arms could not effect civilis obtained peace for his countrymen and pardon for himself for the roman empire was at this time so torn by its own divisions that the barbarous nations around made incursions with impunity and were sure of obtaining peace whenever they thought proper to demand it  during the time of these commotions in germany the sarmatians a barbarous nation to the northeast of the empire suddenly passed the river ister and marched into the roman dominions with such celerity and fury as to destroy several garrisons and an army under the command of fonteius agrippa however they were driven back with some slaughter by rubrius gallus vespasians lieutenant into their native forests where several attempts were made to confine them by garrisons and forts placed along the confines of their country but these hardy nations having once found the way into the empire never after desisted from invading it upon every opportunity till at length they overran and destroyed the glory of rome  vespasian continued some months at alexandria in egypt where it is said he cured a blind and alame man by touching them before he set out for rome he gave his son titus the command of the army that was to lay siege to jerusalem while he himself went forward and was met many miles from rome by all the senate and near half the inhabitants who gave the sincerest testimonies of their joy in having an emperor of such great and experienced virtues nor did he in the least disappoint their expectations being equally assiduous in rewarding merit and pardoning his adversaries in reforming the manners of the citizens and setting them the best example in his own  in the mean time titus carried on the war against the jews with vigor this obstinate and infatuated people had long resolved to resist the roman power vainly hoping to find protection from heaven which their impieties had utterly offended their own historian represents them as arrived at the highest pitch of iniquity while famines earthquakes and prodigies all conspired to forewarn their approaching ruin nor was it sufficient that heaven and earth seemed combined against them they had the most bitter dissensions among themselves and were split into two parties that robbed and destroyed each other with impunity still pillaging and at the same time boasting their zeal for the religion of their an cestors  at the head of one of these parties was an incendiary whose name was john this fanatic affected sovereign power and filled the whole city of jerusalem and all the towns around with tumult and pillage in a short time a new faction arose headed by one simon who gathering together multitudes of robbers and murderers who had fled to the mountains attacked many cities and towns and reduced all idumea into his power jerusalem at length became the theater in which these two demagogues began to exercise their mutual animosity john was possessed of the temple while simon was admitted into the city both equally enraged against each other while slaughter and devastation followed their pretensions thus did a city formerly celebrated for peace an unity become the seat of tumult and confusion  i was in this miserable situation that titus came to sit down before it with his conquering army and began his operations within about six furlongs of the place it was at the feast of the passover when the place was filled with an infinite multitude of people who had come from all parts to celebrate that great solemnity that titus undertook to besiege it his presence produced a temporary reconciliation between the contending factions within so that they unanimously resolved to oppose the common enemy first and then decide their domestic quarrels at a more convenient season their first sally which was made with much fury and resolution put the romans in great disorder and obliged them to abandon their camp and fly to the mountains however rallying immediately after the jews were forced back into the city while titus in person showed surprising instances of valor and conduct  these advantages over the romans only renewed in the besieged their desires of private vengeance a tumult ensued in the temple in which several of both parties were slain and in this manner upon every remission from without the factions of john and simon violently raging against each other agreed only in their resolution to defend the city against the romans  jerusalem was strongly fortified by three walls on every side except where it was fenced by deep valleys titus began by battering down the outward wall which after much fatigue and danger he effected all the time showing the greatest clemency to the jews and offering them repeated assurances of pardon but this infatuated people refused his proferred kindness with contempt and imputed his humanity to his fears five days after titus broke through the second wall and though driven back by the besieged he recovered his ground and made preparations for battering the third wall which was their last defense but first he sent in josephus their countryman to exhort them to yield who using all his eloquence to persuade them was only reviled with scoffs and reproaches the siege was now therefore carried on with greater vigor than before several batteries for engines were raised which were no sooner built than destroyed by the enemy at length it was resolved in council to surround the whole city with a trench and thus prevent all relief and succors from abroad this which was quickly executed seemed no way to intimidate the jews though famine and pestilence its necessary attendant began now to make the most horrid ravages within the walls yet this desperate people still resolved to hold out though obliged to live upon the most scanty and unwholesome food though a bushel of corn was sold for six hundred crowns and the holes and sewers were ransacked for carcases that had long since grown putrid yet they were not to be moved the famine raged at last to such an excess that a woman of distinction in the city boiled her own child to eat it which horrid account when it came to the ears of titus he declared that he would bury so abominable a crime in the ruins of their state he now therefore cut down all the woods within a considerable distance of the city and causing more batteries to be raised he at length battered down the wall and in five days entered the citadel by force thus reduced to the very verge of ruin they still deceived themselves with absurd and false expectations while many false prophets deluded the multitude declaring they should soon have assistance from god the heat of the battle was now therefore gathered round the inner wall of the temple while the defendants desperately resisted from the top titus was willing to save this beautiful structur ebut a soldier casting a brand into some adjacent buildings the fire communicated to the temple and notwithstanding the utmost endeavors on both sides the whole edifice was quickly consumed the sight of this in ruins effectually served to damp the ardour of the jews they now began to perceive that heaven had forsaken them while their cries and lamentations ecchoed from the adjacent mountains even those who were almost expiring lifted up their dying eyes to bewail the loss of their temple which they valued more than life itself the most resolute however still endeavored to defend the upper and stronger part of the city named sion but titus with his batrering engines soon made himself entire master of the place john and simon were taken from the vaults where they had concealed themselves the former was condemned to perpetual imprisonment and the latter reserved to grace the conquerors triumph the greatest part of the populace were put to the sword and the city was entirely razed by the plough so that according to our saviors prophecy not one stone remained upon another thus after a siege of six months this noble city was totally destroyed having flourished under the peculiar protection of heaven above two thousand years the numbers who perished in this siege according to josephus amounted to above a million of souls and the captives to almost an hundred thousand the temporal state of the jews ended with their city while the wretched survivors were banished sold and dispersed into all parts of the world  his soldiers would have crowned titus as conqueror but he modestly refused the honor alleging that he was only an instrument in the hand of heaven that manifestly declared its wrath against the jews at rome however all mens mouths were filled with the praises of the conqueror who had not only showed himself an excellent general but a courageous combatant his return therefore in triumph which he did with his father was marked by all the magnificence and joy that was in the power of men to express all things that were esteemed valuable or beautiful among men were brought to adorn this great occasion among the rich spoils were exposed vast quantities of gold taken out of the temple but the book of their law was not the least remarkable among the magnificent profusion this was the first time that ever rome saw the father and the son triumph together a triumphal arch was erected upon this occasion on which were described all the victories of titus over the jews which remains almost entire to this very day vespasian likewise built a temple to peace wherein were deposited most of the jewish spoils and having now calmed all the commotions in every part of the empire he shut up the temple of janus which had been open about five or six years  vespasian having thus given security and peace to the empire resolved to correct numberless abuses which had grown up under the tyranny of his predecessors to effect this with greater ease he joined titus with him in the consulship and tribunitial power and in some measure admitted him a partner in all the highest offices of the state he began with restraining the licentiousness of the army and forcing them back to their pristine discipline he ordered a young officer to be broke for being perfumed declaring he had rather he had stunk of garlic some military messengers desiring money to buy shoes he ordered them for the future to perform their journies barefoot he was not less strict with regard to the senators and the knights he turned out such as were a disgrace to their station and supplied their places with the most worthy men he could find he abridged the processes that had been carried to an unreasonable length in the courts of justice he took care to reedify such parts of the city as had suffered in the late commotions particularly the capitol which had been lately burnt and which he now restored to more than former magnificence he likewise built a famous amphitheatre the ruins of which are to this day an evidence of its ancient grandeur the other ruinous cities in the empire also shared his paternal care he improved such as were declining adorned others and built many anew in such acts as these he past a long reign of clemency and moderation so that it is said no man suffered by an unjust or a severe decree during his administration  julius sabinus seems to be the only person who was treated with greater rigor than was usual with this emperor sabinus as was just mentioned before was commander of a small army in gaul and had declared himself emperor upon the death of vitellius however his army was shortly after overcome by vespasians general and he himself compelled to seek safety by flight he for some time wandered through the roman provinces without being discovered but finding the pursuit every day become closer he was obliged to hide himself in a cave in which he remained concealed for no less than nine years attended all the time by his faithful wife epponina who provided provisions for his support by day and repaired to him in the night however she was at length discovered in the performance of this pious office and sabinus was taken prisoner and carried to rome several intercessions were made to the emperor in his behalf epponina herself appearing with her two children and imploring her husbands pardon however neither her tears nor entreaties could prevail sabinus had been too dangerous a rival for mercy so that though she and her children were spared her husband suffered by the executioner  but this seems to be the only instance in which he resented past offenses he caused the daughter of vitellius his avowed enemy to be married into a noble family and he himself provided her a suitable fortune one of neros servants coming to beg for pardon for having once rudely thrust him out of the palace and insulting him when in office vespasian only took his revenge by serving him just in the same manner when any plot or conspiracies were formed against him he disdained to punish the guilty saying that they deserved rather his contempt for their ignorance than his resentment as they seemed to envy him a dignity of which he daily experienced the uneasiness when he was seriously advised to beware of metius pomposianus against whom there was strong cause of suspicion he raised him to the dignity of consul adding that the time would come when he must be sensible of so great a benefit  his liberality toward the encouragement of arts and learning was not less than his clemency he settled a constant salary of an hundred thousand sesterces upon the teachers of rhetoric he was particularly favorable to josephus the jewish historian quinctilian the orator and pliny the naturalist flourished in his reign and were highly esteemed by the emperor he was no less an encourager of all other excellencies in art and invited the greatest masters and artificers from all parts of the world making them considerable presents as he found occasion  yet all his numerous acts of generosity and magnificence could not preserve his character from the imputation of rapacity and avarice he revived many obsolete methods of taxation and even bought and sold commodities himself in order to increase his fortune he is charged with advancing the most avaricious governors to the provinces in order to share their plunder on their return to rome he descended to some very unusual and dishonorable imposts even to the laying a tax upon urine when his son titus remonstrated the meanness of such a tax vespasian taking a piece of money demanded if the smell offended him and then added that this very money was produced by urine but the avarice of princes is generally a virtue when their own expenses are but few the exchequer when vespasian came to the throne was so much exhausted that he informed the senate that it would require a supply of three hundred millions of our money to reestablish the commonwealth this necessity must naturally produce more numerous and heavy taxations than the empire had hitherto experienced but while the provinces were thus obliged to contribute to the support of his power he took every precaution to provide for their safety so that we find but two insurrections in this reign  in the fourth year of his reign antiochus king of comagena holding a private correspondence with the parthians the declared enemies of rome was taken prisoner in cilicia by poetus the governor and sent bound to rome but vespasian generously prevented all ill treatment toward him by giving him a residence at lacedaemon and allowing him a revenue suitable to his dignity    these incursions however were but as a transient storm the effects of which were soon repaired by the emperors moderation and assiduity we are told that he new formed and established a thousand nations which had scarcely before amounted to two hundred no provinces in the empire lay out of his view and protection he had during his whole reign a particular regard to britain his generals petilius cerealis and julius frontinus brought the greatest part of the island into subjection and agricola who succeeded soon after completed what they had begun  such long and uninterrupted success no way increased this emperors vanity he ever seemed averse to those swelling titles which the senate and people were constantly offering him when the king of parthia in one of his letters styled himself king of kings vespasian in his answer only called himself simply flavius vespasian he was so far from attempting to hide the meanness of his original that he frequently mentioned it in company and when some flatterers were for deriving his pedigree from hercules he despised and derided the meanness of their adulation in this manner having reigned ten years loved by his subjects and deserving their affection he was surprised by an indisposition at campania which he at once declared would be fatal crying out in the spirit of paganism methinks i am going to be a god removing from thence to the city and afterward to a country seat near reate he was there taken with a flux which brought him to the last extremity however perceiving his end approach and just going to expire he cried out that an emperor ought to die standing wherefore raising himself upon his feet he expired in the hands of those that sustained him  he was a man says pliny in whom power made no alteration except in giving him the opportunity of doing good equal to his will he was the second roman emperor that died a natural death and he was peaceably succeeded by titus his son  chap xii titus the eleventh emperor of rome their mutual passion and the many arts she used to induce him to change his resolutions he next discarded all those who had been the former ministers of his pleasures and forbore to countenance the companions of his looser recreations though he had formerly taken great pains in the selection this moderation added to his justice and generosity procured him the love of all good men and the appellation of the delight of mankind which all his actions seem calculated to ensure  as he came to the throne with all the advantage of his fathers popularity he was resolved to use every method to increase it he therefore took particular care to punish all informers false witnesses and promoters of dissension those wretches who had their rise in the licentiousness and impunity of former reigns were now become so numerous that their crimes called loudly for punishment of these therefore he daily made public examples condemning them to be scourged in the most public streets next to be dragged through the theater and then to be banished to the uninhabited parts of the empire or sold as slaves he exhibited also many shows which were very sumptuous and magnificent he in one day caused five thousand wild beasts to be bated in the amphitheatre for the entertainment of the people these public rejoicings were continued for an hundred days together during which he permitted the people to dictate the manner in which they should choose to be entertained his courtesy and readiness to do good have been celebrated even by christian writers his principal rule being never to send any petitioner dissatisfied away one night recollecting that he had done nothing beneficial to mankind the day preceding he cried out among his friends i have lost a day a sentence too remarkable not to be universally known  he was so tender of the lives of his subjects that he took upon him the office of pontifex maximus or high priest to keep his hands undefiled with blood he so little regarded such as censured or abused him that he was heard to say when i do nothing worthy of censure why should i be displeased at it he was even heard to affirm that he had rather die himself than put another to death learning that two noblemen had conspired against him he readily forgave them and the next day placing them next himself in the theater he put the swords with which the gladiators fought into their hands demanding their judgment and approbation whether they were of sufficient shortness he pardoned his brother domitian in the same manner who had actually prepared all things for an open rebellion  in this reign an irruption of mount vesuvius did considerable damage overwhelming many towns and sending its ashes into countries more than an hundred miles distance upon this memorable occasion pliny the naturalist lost his life for being impelled by too eager a curiosity to observe the eruption he was suffocated in the flames there happened also about this time a fire at rome which continued three days and nights successively which was followed by a plague in which ten thousand men were buried in a day the emperor however did all that lay in his power to repair the damage sustained by the public and with respect to the city declared that he would take the whole loss of that upon himself  these disasters were in some measure counterbalanced by the successes in britain under agricola this excellent general having been sent into that country toward the latter end of vespasians reign showed himself equally expert in quelling the refractory and civilizing those who had formerly submitted to the roman power the ordovices or inhabitants of north wales were the first that were subdued he then made a descent upon mona or the island of anglesey which surrendered at discretion having thus rendered himself master of the whole country he took every method to restore discipline to his own army and to introduce some share of politeness among those whom he had conquered he exhorted them both by advice and example to build temples theaters and stately houses he caused the sons of their nobility to be instructed in the liberal arts he had them taught the latin language and induced them to immitate the roman modes of dressing and living thus by degrees this barbarous people began to assume the luxurious manners of their conquerors and in some time even to outdo them in all the refinements of sensual pleasure for the success in britain titus was saluted emperor the fifteenth time but he did not long survive his honors being surprised by a violent fever at a little distance from rome perceiving his death approach he declared that during the whole course of his life he knew but of one action which he repented of but that action he did not think proper to express shortly after he died not without suspicion of treachery from his brother domitian who had long wished to govern in the fortyfirst year of his age having reigned two years two months and twenty days  chap xiii domitian the twelfth emperor of rome   the beginning of his reign was universally acceptable to the people as he appeared equally remarkable for his clemency liberality and justice he carried his abhorrence of cruelty so far as at one time to forbid the sacrificing of oxen his liberality was such that he would not accept of the legacies that were left him by such as had children of their own his justice was such that he would sit whole days and reverse the partial sentences of the ordinary judges he appeared very careful and liberal in repairing the libraries which had been burnt and recovering copies of such books as had been lost sending purposely to alexandria to transcribe and correct them  but he soon began to show the natural deformity of his mind instead of cultivating literature as his father and brother had done he neglected all kinds of study addicting himself wholly to meaner pursuits particularly archery and gaming he was so very expert an archer that he would frequently cause one of his slaves to stand at a great distance with his hand spread as a mark and would shoot his arrows with such exactness as to stick them all between his fingers he instituted three sorts of contests to be observed every five years in music horsemanship and wrestling but at the same time he banished all philosophers and mathematicians from rome no emperor before him entertained the people with such various and expensive shows during these diversions he distributed great rewards sitting as president himself adorned with a purple robe and crown with the priests of jupiter and the college of flavian priests about him the meanness of his occupations in solitude were a just contrast to his exhibitions of public ostentation he usually spent his hours of retirement in catching flies and sticking them through with a bodkin so that one of his servants being asked if the emperor were alone he answered that he had not so much as a fly to bear him company  his vices seemed every day to increase with the duration of his reign and as he thus became more odious to his people all their murmurs only served to add strength to his suspicions and malice to his cruelty his ungrateful treatment of agricola seemed the first symptom of his natural malevolence domitian was always particularly fond of obtaining a military reputation and therefore jealous of it in others he had marched some time before into gaul upon a pretended expedition against the catti a people of germany and without ever seeing the enemy resolved to have the honor of a triumph upon his return to rome for that purpose he purchased a number of slaves whom he dressed in german habits and at the head of this miserable procession entered the city amidst the apparent acclamations and concealed contempt of all his subjects the successes therefore of agricola in britain affected him with an extreme degree of envy this admirable general who is scarce mentioned by any other writer except tacitus pursued the advantages which he had already obtained he subdued the caledonians and overcame galgacus the british chief at the head of thirty thousand men and afterward sending out a fleet to scour the coast first discovered great britain to be an island he likewise discovered and subdued the orkneys and thus reduced the whole into a civilized province of the roman empire when the account of these successes was brought to domitian he received it with a seeming pleasure but real uneasiness he thought agricolas rising reputation a reproach upon his own inactivity and instead of attempting to emulate he resolved to suppress the merit of his services he ordered him therefore the external marks of his approbation and took care that triumphant ornaments statues and other honors should be decreed him but at the same time he removed him from his command under a pretense of appointing him to the government of syria by these means agricola surrendered up his province to salustius lucullus but soon found that syria was otherwise disposed of upon his return to rome which was privately and by night he was cooly received by the emperor and dying some time after in retirement it was supposed by some that his end was hastened by domitians direction  domitian soon after found the want of so experienced a commander in the many irruptions of the barbarous nations that surrounded the empire the sarmatians in europe joined with those of asia made a formidable invasion at once destroying a whole legion and a general of the romans the dacians under the conduct of decebalus their king made an irruption and overthrew the romans in several engagements the contests now were not for the limits of the empire and the banks of the danube but the provinces themselves were in danger losses were followed by losses so that every season became memorable for some remarkable overthrow at last however the state making a vigorous exertion of its internal power the barbarians were repelled partly by force and partly by the assistance of money which only served to enable them to make future invasions to greater advantage but in whatever manner the enemy might have been repelled domitian was resolved not to lose the honor of a triumph he returned in great splendour to rome and not contented with thus triumphing twice without a victory he resolved to take the surname of germanicus for his conquest over a people with whom he never contended  in proportion as the ridicule increased against him his pride seemed every day to demand greater homage he would permit his statues to be made only of gold and silver he assumed to himself divine honors and ordered that all men should treat him with the same appellations which they gave to the divinity his cruelty was not behind his arrogance he caused numbers of the most illustrious senators and others to be put to death upon the most trifling pretenses one aelius lama was condemned and executed only for jesting though there was neither novelty nor poignancy in his humor cocceanus was murdered only for celebrating the nativity of otho pomposianus shared the same fate because it was foretold by an astrologer that he should be emperor salustius lucullus his lieutenant in britain was destroyed only for having given his own name to a new sort of lances of his own invention junius rusticus died for publishing a book in which he commended thrasea and priscus two philosophers who opposed vespasians coming to the throne  such cruelties as these that seem almost without a motive must have consequently produced rebellion lucius antonius governor in upper germany knowing how much the emperor was detested at home resolved upon striking for the throne and accordingly assumed the ensigns of imperial dignity as he was at the head of a formidable army his success remained long doubtful but a sudden overflowing of the rhine dividing his army he was set upon at that juncture by normandus the emperors general and totally routed the news of this victory we are told was brought to rome by supernatural means on the same day that the battle was fought domitians severity was greatly increased by this success of short duration in order to discover those who were accomplices with the adverse party he invented new tortures sometimes cutting off the hands at other times thrusting fire into the privities of the people whom he suspected of being his enemies during these severities he aggravated their guilt by hypocrisy never pronouncing sentence without a preamble full of gentleness and mercy the night before he crucified the comptroller of his household he treated him with the most seeming friendship and ordered him a dish of meat from his own table he carried aretinus clemens with him in his own litter the day he had concluded upon his death he was particularly terrible to the senate and nobility the whole body of whom he frequently threatened to extirpate entirely at one time he surrounded the senate house with his troops to the great consternation of the senators at another he resolved to amuse himself with their terrors in a different manner having invited them to a public entertainment he received them all very formally at the entrance of his palace and conducted them into a spacious hall hung round with black and illuminated by a few melancholy lamps that diffused light only sufficient to show the horrors of the place all around were to be seen nothing but coffins with the names of each of the senators written upon them together with other objects of terror and instruments of execution while the company beheld all these preparations with silent agony several men having their bodies blackened each with a drawn sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other entered the hall and danced round them after some time when the guests expected nothing less than the most instant death well knowing domitians capricious cruelty the doors were set open and one of the servants came to inform them that the emperor gave all the company leave to withdraw  these cruelties were rendered still more odious by his lust and avarice frequently after presiding at an execution he would retire with the lewdest prostitutes and use the same baths which they did his avarice which was the consequence of his profusion had no bounds he seized upon the estates of all against whom he could find the smallest pretensions the most trifling action or word against the majesty of the prince was sufficient to ruin the possessor he particularly exacted large sums from the rich jews who even then began to practice the arts of peculation for which they are at present so remarkable he was excited against them not only by avarice but by jealousy a prophecy had been long current in the east that a person from the line of david should rule the world whereupon this suspicious tyrant willing to evade the prediction commanded all the jews of the lineage of david to be diligently sought out and put to death two christians grandsons of st jude the apostle of that line were brought before him but finding them poor and no way ambitious of temporal power he dismissed them considering them as objects too mean for his jealousy however his persecution of the christians was more severe than that of any of his predecessors by his letters and edicts they were banished in several parts of the empire and put to death with all the tortures of ingenious cruelty the predictions of the chaldeans and astrologers also concerning his death gave him violent apprehensions and kept him in the most tormenting disquietude as he approached toward the end of his reign he would permit no criminal or prisoner to be brought into his presence till they were bound in such a manner as to be incapable of injuring him and he generally secured their chains in his own hands his jealousies increased to that degree that he ordered the gallery in which he walked to be set round with a pellucid stone which served as a mirror to reflect the persons of all such as approached him from behind every omen and prodigy gave him fresh anxiety ascleterion the astrologer was brought before him for publishing predictions of his death as he did not attempt to deny the charge the emperor demanded if he knew his own fortune to which the astrologer replied that he should be devoured by dogs upon which domitian immediately ordered him to be slain and to frustrate his prediction to be burnt immediately after but we are told that while he was executing a furious tempest arose which blew down the body and dispersed the executioners and in the mean time the body was devoured by dogs as the astrologer had foretold an accident like this was a sufficient pretext for the death of hundreds the last part of the tyrants reign was more insupportable than any of the preceding nero exercised his cruelties without being a spectator but a principal part of the roman miseries during this reign was to see and be seen to behold the stern air and fiery visage of the tyrant which he had armed against blushing by continued intemperance directing the tortures and maliciously pleased with adding poignance to every agony  but a period was soon to be put to this monsters cruelty rome had now by horrid experience learned the art of ridding herself of her tyrants among the number of those whom he at once caressed and suspected was his wife domitia whom he had taken from aelius lama her former husband this woman however was become obnoxious to him for having placed her affections upon one paris a player and he resolved to dispatch her with several others that he either hated or suspected it was the tyrants method to put down the names of all such as he intended to destroy in his tablets which he kept about him with great circumspection domitia fortunately happening to get a sight of them was struck at finding her own name in the catalogue of those fated to destruction she showed the fatal list to norbanus and petronius praefects of the praetorian bands who found themselves set down as likewise to stephanus the comptroller of the household who came into the conspiracy with alacrity parthenius also the chief chamberlain was of the number and these after many consultations determined on the first opportunity to put their design into execution and at length fixed upon the eighteenth day of september for the completion of their great attempt domitian whose death was every day foretold by the astrologers who of consequence must at last be right in their predictions was in some measure apprehensive of that particular day and as he had been ever timorous so was he now more particularly upon his guard he had for some time before secluded himself in the most secret recesses of his palace and at midnight was so affrighted as to leap out of his bed enquiring of his attendants what hour of the night it was upon their falsely assuring him that it was an hour later than that which he was taught to apprehend quite transported as if all danger were past he prepared to go to the bath just then petronius his chamberlain came to inform him that stephanus the comptroller of the household desired to speak to him upon an affair of the utmost importance the emperor having given orders that his attendants should retire stephanus entered with his hand in a scarf which he had worn thus for some days the better to conceal a dagger as none were permitted to approach the emperor except unarmed he began by giving information of a pretended conspiracy and exhibited a paper in which the particulars were specified while domitian was reading the contents with an eager curiosity stephanus drew his dagger and struck him in the groin the wound not being mortal domitian caught hold of the assassin and threw him upon the ground calling out for assistance he demanded also his sword that was usually placed under his pillow and a boy who attended in the apartment running to fetch it found only the scabbard for parthenius had previously removed the blade the struggle with stephanus still continued domitian still kept him under and at one time attempted to wrest the dagger from his hand at another to tear out his eyes with his fingers but parthenius with his freedman a gladiator and two subaltern officers now coming in ran all furiously upon the emperor and dispatched him with seven wounds in the mean time some of the officers of the guard being alarmed came to his assistance but too late to save him however they slew stephanus on the spot  it is almost incredible what some writers relate concerning appollonius tyaneus who was then at ephesus this person whom some call a magician and some a philosopher but who more probably was nothing more than an impostor was just at the minute in which domitian was slain lecturing in one of the public gardens of the city but stopping short all of a sudden he cried out courage stephanus strike the tyrant and then after a pause rejoice my friends the tyrant dies this day this day do i say the very moment in which i kept silence he suffered for his crimes  however the death of such a monster seemed to produce more preternatural disturbances and more predictions than it deserved the truth seems to be that a belief in omens and prodigies were again becoming prevalent the people were again relapsing into pristine barbarity an age of ignorance is ever the proper soil for an harvest of imposture  chap xiv nerva the thirteenth emperor of rome   the senate therefore resolved to provide a successor before the army could have an opportunity of taking the appointment upon themselves and cocceius nerva was chosen to the empire the very day on which the tyrant was slain  nerva was of an illustrious family as most say by birth a spaniard and above sixtyfive years old when he was called to the throne he was at that time the most remarkable man in rome for his virtues moderation and his respect to the laws and he owed his exaltation to the blameless conduct of his former life when the senate went to pay him their submissions he received them with his accustomed humility while arius antonius his most intimate friend having embraced him with great familiarity addressed him in a language very different from what former emperors were accustomed to hear i come cried he with others to congratulate not your good fortune but that of the roman empire you have long escaped the malice of your enemies and the cruelty of tyrants now at the decline of life to be plunged into new troubles and surrounding dangers to be exposed not only to the hatred of enemies but to the dangerous requests of friendship is not a state to be wished for your enemies will naturally envy and your friends presuming upon your former favor if their suits be denied will become enemies so that you must either injure the public or lose their favor such candid advice was received with proper gratitude and indeed no emperor seemed to want such advice more than he as the easy indulgence of his disposition made him the prey of his insidious courtiers  however an excess of indulgence and humanity were faults that rome could easily pardon after the cruelties of such an emperor as domitian being long accustomed to tyranny they regarded nervas gentle reign with rapture and even gave his imbecility the name of benevolence upon coming to the throne he solemnly swore that no senator of rome should be put to death by his command during his reign though they gave never so just a cause this oath he so religiously observed that when two senators had conspired his death he used no kind of severity against them but sending for them to let them see he was not ignorant of their designs he carried them with him to the public theater there presenting each with a dagger he desired them to strike as he was determined not to ward off the blow such acts of clemency appeared to the multitude as virtues but others saw them in a different light and considered them as encouragements to dissolution one of the principal men in rome was heard to declare that it was indeed a misfortune to live under a prince who considered innocence as a crime but a greater still under one who regarded crimes as innocent having one night invited veiento one of domitians most vicious favorites to supper the conversation ran upon the vices of catullus messalinus whose memory was detested for his cruelties during the former reign as each of the guests mentioned him with horror nerva was induced to ask one mauricus who sat at table what do you think mauricus would become of such a man now i think replied mauricus pointing to veiento that he would have been invited with us to supper  however true such sarcasms might have been nerva bore them with the utmost good humor ever desirous of being rather loved than feared by his subjects he conferred great favors and bestowed large gifts upon his particular friends his liberality was so extensive that upon his first promotion to the empire he was constrained to sell his gold and silver plate with his other rich movables to enable him to continue his liberalities he released the cities of the empire from many severe impositions which had been laid upon them by vespasian he took off a rigorous tribute which had been laid upon carriages and restored those to their property who had been unjustly dispossessed by domitian  during his short reign he made several good laws he particularly prohibited the castration of male children which had been likewise condemned by his predecessor but not wholly removed he put all those slaves to death who had during the last reign informed against their masters he permitted no statues to be erected to honor him and converted such of domitians as had been spared by the senate into money he sold many rich robes and much of the splendid furniture of the palace and retrenched several unreasonable expenses at court at the same time he had so little regard for money that when one of his subjects had found a large treasure and wrote to the emperor how to dispose of it he received for answer that he might use it but the finder still informing the emperor that it was a fortune too large for a private person nerva admiring his honesty wrote him word that then he might abuse it  a life of such generosity and mildness was not however without its enemies vigilius rufus who had opposed him was not only pardoned but made his colleague in the consulship calpurnius crassus also with some others formed a dangerous conspiracy to destroy him but nerva would use no severity he rested satisfied with banishing those who were culpable though the senate were for inflicting more rigorous punishments but the most dangerous insurrection against his interests was from the praetorian bands who headed by casparius olianus insisted upon revenging the late emperors death whose memory was still dear to them from his frequent liberalities nerva whose kindness to good men rendered him more obnoxious to the vicious did all in his power to stop the progress of this insurrection he presented himself to the mutinous soldiers and opening his bosom desired them to strike there rather than be guilty of so much injustice the soldiers however paid no regard to his remonstrances but seizing upon petronius and parthenius slew them in the most ignominious manner not content with this they even compelled the emperor to approve of their sedition and to make a speech to the people in which he thanked the cohorts for their fidelity  so disagreeable a constraint upon the emperors inclinations was in the end attended with the most happy effects as it caused the adoption of trajan to succeed him in the empire nerva perceived that in the present turbulent disposition of the times he stood in need of an assistant in the empire who might share the fatigues of government and contribute to keep the licentious in awe for this purpose setting aside all his own relations he fixed upon ulpius trajan an utter stranger to his family who was then governor in upper germany to succeed him having put his determination in execution and performed the accustomed solemnities he instantly sent off ambassadors to cologne where trajan then resided entreating his assistance in punishing those from whom he had received such an insult  the adoption of this admirable man proved so great a curb to the licentiousness of the soldiery that they continued in perfect obedience during the rest of this reign and casperius being sent to him was by his command either banished or put to death  the adopting trajan was the last public act of nerva in about three months after having put himself in a violent passion with one regulus a senator he was seized with a fever of which he shortly after died after a short reign of one year four months and nine days  he was the first foreign emperor who reigned in rome and justly reputed a prince of great generosity and moderation he is also celebrated for his wisdom though with less reason the greatest instance he gave of it during his reign being in the choice of his successor  chap xv trajan the fourteenth emperor of rome who was a general of the romans in his expeditions along the euphrates and the rhine and while yet very young acquired a considerable reputation for military accomplishments he enured his body to fatigue he made long marches on foot and labored to acquire all that skill in war which was necessary for a commander when he was made general of the army in lower germany which was one of the most considerable employments in the empire it made no alteration in his manners or way of living and the commander was seen no way differing from the private tribune except in his superior wisdom and virtues the great qualities of his mind were accompanied with all the advantages of person his body was majestic and vigorous he was at that middle time of life which is happily tempered with the warmth of youth and the caution of age being fortytwo years old to these qualities were added a modesty that seemed peculiar to himself alone so that mankind found a pleasure in praising those accomplishments of which the possessor seemed no way conscious upon the whole trajan is distinguished as the greatest and the best emperor of rome others might have equalled him in war and some might have been his rivals in clemency and goodness but he seems the only prince who united these talents in the greatest perfection and who appears equally to engage our admiration and our regard  upon being informed of the death of nerva he prepared to return to rome whither he was invited by the united entreaties of the state he therefore began his march with a discipline that was for a long time unknown in the armies of the empire the countries through which he past were neither ravaged nor taxed and he entered the city not in a triumphant manner though he had deserved many but on foot attended with the civil officers of the state and followed by his soldiers who marched silently forward with modesty and respect  one of the first lectures he received respecting his conduct in governing the empire was from plutarch the philosopher who had the honor of being his master upon his arrival at rome he is said to have written him a letter to the following purpose since your merits and not your importunities have advanced you to the empire permit me to congratulate your virtues and my own good fortune if your future government proves answerable to your former worth i shall be happy but if you become worse for power yours will be the danger and mine the ignominy of your conduct the errors of the pupil will be charged upon his instructor seneca is reproached for the enormities of nero and socrates and quintillian have not escaped censure for the misconduct of their respective scholars but you have it in your power to make me the most honored of men by continuing what you are continue the command of your passions and make virtue the scope of all your actions if you follow these instructions then will i glory in my having presumed to give them if you neglect what i offer then will this letter be my testimony that you have not erred through the council and authority of plutarch i have inserted this letter whether genuine or not because it seems to me well written and a striking picture of this greatest philosophers manner of addressing that best of princes  it would be tedious and unnecessary to enter into a detail of this good monarchs labors for the state his application to business his moderation to his enemies his modesty in exaltation his liberality to the deserving and his frugality in his own expenses these have all been the subject of panegyric among his cotemporaries and they continue to be the admiration of posterity  upon giving the perfect of the praetorian bands the sword according to custom he made use of this remarkable expression take this sword and use it if i have merit for me if otherwise against me after which he added that he who gave laws was the first who was bound to observe them  if he had any failings they were his love of women which however never hurried him beyond the bounds of decency and his immoderate passion for war to which he had been bred up from his childhood the first war he was engaged in after his coming to the throne was with the dacians who during the reign of domitian had committed numberless ravages upon the provinces of the empire he therefore raised a powerful army and with great expedition marched into those barbarous countries where he was vigorously opposed by decebalus the dacian king who for a long time withstood his boldest efforts at length however being constrained to come to a general battle and no longer able to protract the war he was routed with great slaughter though not without great loss to the conqueror the roman soldiers upon this occasion wanting linen to bind up their wounds the emperor tore his own robes to supply them this victory compelled the enemy to sue for peace which they obtained upon very disadvantageous terms their king coming into the roman camp and acknowledging himself a vassal of the roman empire  upon trajans return after the usual triumphs and rejoicings upon such an occasion he was surprised with an account that the dacians had renewed hostilities decebalus their king was now therefore a second time adjudged an enemy to the roman state and trajan invaded his dominions with an army equal to that with which he had before subdued him but decebalus now grown more cautious by his former defeat used every art to avoid coming to an engagement he also put various stratagems in practice to distress the enemy and at one time trajan himself was in danger of being slain or taken he also took longinus one of the roman generals prisoner and threatened to kill him in case trajan refused granting him terms of peace but the emperor replied that peace and war had not their dependence upon the safety of one subject only wherefore longinus some time after destroyed himself by a voluntary death the fate of this general seemed to give new vigor to trajans operations in order to be better enabled to invade the enemys territories at pleasure he undertook a most stupendous work which was no less than building a bridge across the danube this amazing structure which was built over a deep broad and rapid river consisted of more than twentytwo arches an hundred and fifty feet high and an hundred and seventy broad the ruins of this structure which remain to this day show modern architects how far they were surpassed by the ancients both in the greatness and the boldness of their designs upon finishing this work trajan continued the war with great vigor sharing with the meanest of his soldiers the fatigues of the campaign and continually encouraging them to their duty by his own example by these means notwithstanding the country was spacious and uncultivated and the inhabitants brave and hardy he subdued the whole and added the kingdom of dacia as a province to the roman empire decebalus made some attempts to escape but being surrounded on every side he at last slew himself and his head was sent immediately to rome to certify his misfortune there these successes seemed to advance the empire to a greater degree of splendor than it had hitherto acquired ambassadors were seen to come from the interior parts of india to congratulate trajans success and bespeak his friendship at his return to rome he entered the city in triumph and the rejoicings for his victories lasted for the space of an hundred and twenty days  having thus given peace and prosperity to the empire trajan continued his reign loved honored and almost adored by his subjects he adorned the city with public buildings he freed it from such men as lived by their vices he entertained persons of merit with the utmost familiarity and so little feared his enemies that he could scarcely be induced to suppose that he had any being one day told by some that his friend and favorite sura was false to him trajan to show how much he relied upon his fidelity went in his ordinary manner to sup with him there he commanded suras surgeon to be brought whom he ordered to take off the hair about his eye brows he then made the barber shave his beard and after went unconcerned into the bath as usual the next day when suras accusers were renewing their obloquy trajan informing them how he had spent the night if cried he sura had any designs against my life he then had the fairest opportunity  it had been happy for this great princes memory if he had shown equal clemency to all his subjects but about the ninth year of his law the christians were persecuted in all parts of the empire great numbers of them were put to death as well by popular tumults as by edicts and judicial proceedings in this persecution st clemens bishop of rome was condemned to be thrown into the sea with an anchor about his neck st simeon bishop of jerusalem at the age of a hundred and twenty was scourged and crucified and st ignatius who had a particular dispute with trajan at antioch was condemned to be thrown to wild beasts in the amphitheatre at rome however the persecution ceased after some time for the emperor having advice from pliny the proconsul in bithynia of the innocence and simplicity of the christians and of their inoffensive and moral way of living he suspended their punishments but a total stop was put to them upon tiberianus the governor of palestines sending him word that he was wearied out with executing the laws against the galileans who crowded to execution in such multitudes that he was at a loss how to proceed upon this information the emperor gave orders that the christians should not be sought after but if any offered themselves that they should suffer in this manner the rage of persecution ceased and the emperor found leisure to turn the force of his arms against the armenians and parthians who now began to throw off all submission to rome  while he was employed in these wars there was a dreadful insurrection of the jews in all parts of the empire this wretched people still infatuated and ever expecting some signal deliverer took the advantage of trajans absence in the east to massacre all the greeks and romans which they got into their power without reluctance or mercy this rebellion first began in cyrene a roman province in africa from thence the flame extended to egypt and next to the island of cyprus these places they in a manner dispeopled with ungovernable fury their barbarities were such that they ate the flesh of their enemies wore their skins sawed them asunder cast them to wild beasts made them kill each other and studied new torments by which to destroy them however these cruelties were of no long duration the governors of the respective provinces making head against their tumultuous fury soon treated them with a retaliation of cruelty and put them to death not as human beings but as outrageous pests to society as the jews had practiced their cruelties in cyprus particularly a law was publicly enacted by which it was made capital for any jew to set foot on the island  during these bloody transactions trajan was prosecuting his successes in the east his first march was into armenia the king of which country had disclaimed all alliance with rome and received the ensigns of royalty and dominion from the monarch of parthia however upon the news of trajans expedition his fears were so great that he abandoned his country to the invader while the greatest part of his governors and nobility came submissively to the emperor acknowledging themselves his subjects and making him the most costly presents having in this manner taken possession of the whole country and gotten the king into his power he marched into the dominions of the king of parthia there entering the opulent kingdom of messopotamia he reduced it into the form of a roman province from thence he went against the parthians marching on foot at the head of his army in this manner crossing rivers and conforming to all the severities of discipline which were imposed upon the meanest soldier his successes against the parthians were great and numerous he conquered syria and chaldea and took the famous city of babylon here attempting to cross the euphrates he was opposed by the enemy who were resolved to stop his passage but he secretly caused boats to be made upon the adjoining mountains and bringing them to the water side passed his army with great expedition not however without great slaughter on both sides from thence he traversed large tracts of country which had never before been invaded by a roman army and seemed to take a pleasure in pursuing the same march which alexander the great had formerly marked out before him having passed the rapid stream of the tigris he advanced to the city ctesiphon which he took and opened himself a passage into persia where he made many conquests that were rather splendid than serviceable after subduing all the country bordering on the tigris he marched southward to the persian gulf where he subdued a monarch who possessed a considerable island made by the divided streams of that river here winter coming on he was in danger of losing the greatest part of his army by the inclemency of the climate and the inundations of the river he therefore with indefatigable pains fitted out a fleet and sailing down the persian gulf entered the indian ocean conquering even to the indies and subduing a part of them to the roman empire he was prevented from pursuing further conquests in this distant country both by the revolt of many of the provinces he had already subdued and by the scarcity of provisions which seemed to contradict the reports of the fertility of the countries he was induced to invade the inconveniences of increasing age also contributed to damp the ardour of this enterprise which at one time he intended to pursue to the confines of the earth returning therefore along the persian gulf and sending the senate a particular account of all the nations he had conquered the names of which alone composed a long catalogue he prepared to punish those countries which had revolted from him he began by laying the famous city of edessa in mesopotamia in ashes and in a short space of time not only retook all those places which had before acknowledged subjection but conquered many other provinces so as to make himself master of the most fertile kingdoms of all asia in this train of successes he scarce met with a repulse except before the city atra in the deserts of arabia wherefore judging that this was a proper time for bounding his conquests he resolved to give a master to the countries he had subdued with this resolution he repaired to the city ctesiphon in persia and there with great ceremony crowned parthenaspates king of parthia to the great joy of all his subjects he established another king also over the kingdom of albania near the caspian sea then placing governors and lieutenants in other ptovinces he resolved to return to his capital in a more magnificent manner than any of his predecessors had done before him he accordingly left adrian general of all his forces in the east and continued his journey toward rome where the most magnificent preparations were made for his arrival however he had not got farther than the province of cilicia when he found himself too weak to proceed in his usual manner he therefore ordered himself to be carried on ship board to the city of saleucia where he died of the apoplexy having been attacked by that disorder once before during the time of his indisposition his wife plotina constantly attended near him and knowing the emperors dislike to adrian it is thought forged the  trajan died in the sixtythird year of his age after a reign of nineteen years six months and fifteen days how highly he was esteemed by his subjects appears from their manner of blessing his successors always wishing them the fortune of augustus and the goodness of trajan his military virtues however upon which he chiefly valued himself produced no real advantage to his country and all his conquests disappeared when the power was withdrawn that enforced them  but still it may be asserted that the roman empire was never so large as when he left it nor so formidable to the rest of the world its strength however was much impaired for being spread over so great an extent of territory it wanted that invigorating principle of patriotism to inspire its subjects in its defense its bulk seemed rather a symptom of its disease than its vigor  chap xvi adrian the fifteenth emperor of rome adrian was by descent a spaniard and of the same city where trajan was born he was nephew to trajan and married to sabina his grand niece when trajan was adopted to the empire adrian was a tribune of the army in maesia and was sent by the troops to congratulate the emperor on his advancement however his brotherinlaw who desired to have an opportunity of congratulating trajan himself supplied adrian with a carriage that broke down on the way adrian however was resolved to lose no time and performed the rest of the journey on foot this assiduity was very pleasing to the emperor but he disliked adrian from several more prevailing motives his kinsman was expensive and involved in debt he was besides inconstant capricious and apt to envy anothers reputation these were faults that in trajans opinion could not be compensated either by his learning or his talents his great skill in the greek and latin languages his intimate acquaintance with the laws of his country and the philosophy of the times were no inducements to trajan who being bred himself a soldier desired to have a military man to succeed him for this reason it was that the dying emperor would by no means appoint a successor fearful perhaps of injuring his great reputation by adopting a person that was unworthy his death therefore was concealed for some time by plotina his wife till adrian had sounded the inclinations of the army and found them firm in his interests they then produced a forged instrument importing that adrian was adopted to succeed in the empire by this artifice he was elected by all orders of the state though then absent from rome being left at antioch as general of the forces in the east  upon adrians election his first care was to write to the senate excusing himself for assuming the empire without their previous approbation imputing it to the hasty zeal of the army who rightly judged that the senate ought not long to remain without an head he then began to pursue a course quite opposite to that of his predecessor taking every method of declining war and promoting the arts of peace he was quite satisfied with preserving the ancient limits of the empire and seemed no way ambitious of extensive conquest for this reason he abandoned all the conquests which trajan had made judging them to be rather an inconvenience than an advantage to the empire he therefore made the river euphrates the boundary of the empire and placed the legions along its banks to prevent the incursions of the enemy  having thus settled the affairs of the east and leaving severus governor of syria he took his journey by land to rome sending the ashes of trajan thither by sea upon his approach to the city he was informed that a magnificent triumph was preparing for him but this he modestly declined desiring that these honors might be paid to trajans memory which they had designed for him in consequence of this command a most superb triumph was decreed in which trajans statue was carried as the principal figure in the procession it being remarked that he was the only man that ever triumphed after he was dead not content with paying him these extraordinary honors his ashes were placed in a golden urn upon the top of a column an hundred and forty feet high on this were engraven the particulars of all his exploits in basso relievo a work of great labor and which is still remaining  it was not an easy task to appear with any luster after an emperor so loved and admired as trajan notwithstanding the merits of his successor seemed in some measure to console the people for their loss adrian was one of the most remarkable of the roman emperors for the variety of his endowments he was highly skilful in all the exercises both of body and mind he composed with great beauty both in prose and verse he pleaded at the bar and was one of the best orators of his time he was deeply versed in the mathematics and no less skilful in physic in drawing and painting he was equal to the greatest masters an excellent musician and sung to admiration besides these qualifications he had an astonishing memory he knew the names of all his soldiers though never so long absent he could dictate to one confer with another and write himself all at the same time he was remarkably expert in military discipline he was strong and very skilful in arms both on horseback and on foot and frequently with his own hand killed wildboars and even lions in hunting  his moral virtues were not less than his accomplishments upon his first exaltation he forgave an infinite number of debts due to the exchequer remitting the large arrears to which the provinces were liable and burning the bonds and registers of them in the public forum he refused to take the confiscated estates of condemned persons into his private coffers but ordered them to be placed in the public treasury his moderation and clemency appeared by pardoning the injuries which he had received when he was yet but a private man one day meeting a person who had formerly been his most inveterate enemy my good friend cried he you have escaped for i am made emperor he had so great a veneration for the senate and was so careful of not introducing unworthy persons into it that he told the captain of his guard when he made him a senator that he had no honors in his gift equal to what he then bestowed he was affable to his friends and gentle to persons of meaner stations he relieved their wants and visited them in sickness it being his constant maxim that he was an emperor not for his own good but for the benefit of mankind  these were his virtues which were contrasted by a strange mixture of vices or to say the truth he wanted strength of mind to preserve his general rectitude of character without deviation thus he is represented as proud and vainglorious envious and detractive hasty and revengeful inquisitive into other mens affairs and often induced by sycophants and informers to acts of cruelty and injustice he permitted the revival of the persecution against the christians and showed many instances of a bad disposition which it was the whole study of his life to correct or to conceal  but however adrian might have been as to his private character his conduct as an emperor appears most admirable as all his public transactions appear dictated by the soundest policy and the most disinterested wisdom he was scarce settled on the throne when several of the northern barbarians the alani the sarmatians and the dacians began to make devastations on the empire these hardy nations who now found the way to conquer by issuing from their forests and then retiring upon the approach of a superior force to oppose them began to be truly formidable at rome adrian had thoughts of contracting the limits of the empire by giving up some of the most remote and least defensible provinces but in this he was overruled by his friends who wrongly imagined that an extensive frontier would intimidate an invading enemy but though he complied with their remonstrances he broke down the bridge over danube which his predecessor had built sensible that the same passage which was open to him was equally convenient for the incursions of his barbarous neighbors  while he was employed in compelling these nations to submission a conspiracy was discovered carried on among four persons of consular dignity at home these had agreed to kill him either while he was offering sacrifice or while he was hunting their designs however were timely discovered and the conspirators put to death by order of the senate adrian took great pains to clear himself from the imputation of having had any hand in their execution he had sworn upon his advancement to put no senator to death and he now declared that the delinquents died without his permission but in order entirely to suppress the murmurs of the people upon this head he distributed large sums of money among them and called off their attention from this act of severity to magnificent shows and the various diversions of the amphiteatre  having stayed a short time at rome so as to see that all things were regulated and established for the safety of the public he prepared to visit and take a view of his whole empire it was one of his maxims that an emperor ought to immitate the sun which diffuses warmth and vigor over all parts of the earth he therefore took with him a splendid court and a considerable force and entered the province of gaul where he made an enumeration of all the inhabitants from gaul he went into germany from thence to holland and next passed over into britain there reforming many abuses and reconciling the natives to the romans for the better security of the southern parts of the kingdom he built a wall of wood and earth extending from the river eden in cumberland to the tine in northumberland to prevent the incursions of the picts and other barbarous nations in the north from britain returning through gaul he directed his journey to spain where he was received with great joy as being a native of that country here wintering in the city of tarragona he called a meeting of the deputies from all the provinces and ordained many things for the benefit of the nation happening while he was in spain to walk in his garden one of the servants of the house ran furiously at him with a drawn sword to kill him but the emperor warding off the blow and closing with him quickly disarmed him then delivering him to his guards he ordered that he might have a physician to bleed him considering the poor creature as in fact he was a madman from spain returning to rome he continued there for some time in order to prepare for his journey into the east which was hastened by a new invasion of the parthians his approach compelling the enemy to peace he pursued his travels without molestation arriving in asia minor he turned out of his way to visit the famous city of athens there he made a considerable stay was innitiated into the eleusinian mysteries which were accounted the most sacred in the pagan mythology and took upon him the office of archon or chief magistrate of the place in this place also he remitted the severity of the christian persecution at the representation of granianus the proconsul of asia who represented the people of that persuasion as no way culpable he was even so far reconciled to them as to think of receiving christ into the number of the gods after a winters continuance at athens he went over into sicily and visited aetna and the other curiosities of the place returning from thence once more to rome after a short stay he prepared ships and crossed over into africa there he spent much time in regulating abuses and reforming the government in deciding controversies and erecting magnificent buildings among the rest he ordered carthage to be rebuilt calling it after his own name adrianople again returning to rome where he stayed but a very little time he traveled a second time into greece past over into asia minor from thence went into syria gave laws and instructions to all the neighboring kings whom he invited to come and consult with him then entered palestine arabia and egypt where he caused pompeys tomb that had been long neglected and almost covered with sand to be renewed and beautified he also gave orders for the rebuilding of jerusalem which was performed with great expedition by the assistance of the jews who now began to conceive hopes of being restored to their long lost kingdom but these expectations only served to aggravate their calamities for being incensed at the privileges which were granted the pagan worshippers in their new city they fell upon all the romans and christians that were dispersed throughout judea and unmercifully put them all to the sword in this cruel and desperate undertaking they were chiefly incited by one barcocab an impostor who willing to be thought the messiah or perhaps believing himself to be so declared that he himself was the star foretold by balaam and that he was come down as a light from heaven to rescue them from bondage adrian was at athens when this dangerous insurrection began wherefore sending a powerful body of men under the command of julius severus this general obtained many signal though bloody victories over the insurgents the war was concluded in two years by the demolition of above a thousand of their best towns and the destruction of near six hundred thousand men in battle  he then banished all those who remained out of judea and by a public decree forbade any to come within view of their native soil this insurrection was soon after followed by a dangerous irruption of the barbarous nations to the northward of the empire who entering media with great fury and passing through armenia carried their devastations as far as cappadocia adrian preferring peace upon any terms to an unprofitable war bought them off by large sums of money so that they returned peaceably into their native wilds to enjoy their plunder and meditate fresh invasions  adrian having now spent thirteen years in traveling through his dominions and reforming the abuses of the empire resolved at length to return and end all his fatigues at rome nothing could be more grateful to the people than his present resolution of coming to reside for the rest of his days among them they received him with the loudest demonstrations of joy and though he now began to grow old and unwieldy he remitted not the least of his former assiduity and application to the public welfare his chief amusement was in conversing with the most celebrated men in every art and science frequently boasting that he thought no kind of knowledge inconsiderable or to be neglected either in his private or public capacity this desire of knowing was laudable if kept within bounds but he seemed to affect universal excellence and even envied all who aspired at an equal reputation in any of the arts with himself it is said that he ordered apollodorus the architect to be put to death only for too freely remarking upon the errors of some structure erected from the emperors designs however this be he took great delight in disputing among the learned men and the philosophers who attended him nor were they less careful in granting him that superiority he seemed so eagerly to affect favorinus a man of great reputation in his court for philosophy happening one day to dispute with him upon some philosophical subject acknowledged himself to be overcome his friends blamed him for thus giving up the argument when he might easily have pursued it with success how replied favorinus who was probably a better courtier than philosopher would you have me contend with a man who is master of thirty legions adrian was so fond of literary fame that we are told he wrote his own life and afterward gave it to his servants to publish under their names but whatever might have been his weakness in aiming at universal reputation he was in no part of his reign remiss in attending the duties of his exalted station he ordered the knights and senators never to appear in public but in the proper habits of their orders he forbade masters to kill their slaves as had been before allowed but ordained that they should be tried by the laws enacted against capital offenses a law so just had he done nothing more deserved to have ensured his reputation with posterity and to have made him dear to mankind he still further extended the lenity of the laws to those unhappy men who had been long thought too mean for justice if a master was found killed in his house he would not allow all his slaves to be put to the torture as formerly but only such as might have perceived or prevented the murder  in such cares he consumed the greatest part of his time but at last finding the duties of his station daily increasing and his own strength proportionably upon the decline he resolved upon adopting a successor whose merits might deserve and whose courage secure his exaltation after many deliberations he made choice of lucius commodus whose bodily infirmities rendered him unfit for a trust of such importance of this after some time adrian seemed sensible declaring that he repented of having chosen so feeble a successor and saying that he had leaned against a mouldering wall however commodus soon after dying the emperor immediately adopted marcus antoninus afterward surnamed the pious but previously obliged him to adopt two others namely marcus aurelius and lucius verus who afterward succeeded to the empire  while he was thus careful in appointing a successor his bodily infirmities daily increased and at length his pains becoming insupportable he vehemently desired that some of his attendants would dispatch him antoninus however would by no means permit any of his domestics to be guilty of so great an impiety but used all the arts in his power to reconcile the emperor to sustain life at one time he produced a woman who pretended that she was warned in a dream that he should recover his health at another a man was brought from pannonia who gave him the same assurances nevertheless adrians pains increased every day he frequently cried out how miserable a thing it was to seek death and not to find it he engaged one mastor partly by threats and partly by entreaties to promise to dispatch him but mastor instead of obeying consulted his own safety by flight so that he who was master of the lives of millions was not able to dispose of his own in this deplorable exigence he resolved on going to baiae where the tortures of his diseases increasing they affected his underdanding so that he gave orders for several persons to be put to death which antoninus according to his usual wisdom never meant to obey continuing for some time in these excruciating circumstances the emperor was at last resolved to observe no regimen often saying that kings died merely by the multitude of their physicians this conduct served to hasten that death he seemed so ardently to desire and it was probably joy upon its approach which dictated the celebrated stanzas which are so well known upon the repetition of which he expired animula vagula blandula hospes comesque corporis quae nunc abibis in loca pallidula rigida nudula nec ut soles dabis jocos thus translated by mr pope  oh fleeting spirit wandering fire that long have warmed my tender breast will thou no more my frame inspire no more a pleasing cheerful guest whither ah whither art thou flying to what dark undiscovered shore thou seem all trembling shivering dying and wit and humor are no more    in this manner died adrian in the sixtysecond year of his age after a prosperous reign of twentyone years and eleven months his private character seems to be a mixture of virtues and vices but as a prince perhaps none of his predecessors showed more wisdom or such laudable assiduity he was the first emperor who reduced the laws of the empire into one standing code government received the greatest stability from his councils and a tranquillity more lasting than could be expected from such fierce neighbors abroad and such a degenerate race of citizens at home  chap xvii antoninus pius the sixteenth emperor of rome life were no way impaired by exaltation as he showed himself one of the most excellent princes for justice clemency and moderation his morals were so pure that he was usually compared to numa and was surnamed the pious both for his tenderness to his predecessor adrian when dying and his particular attachment to the religion of his country  in the beginning of his reign he made it his particular study to promote only the most deserving to employments he moderated many imposts and tributes and commanded that all should be levied without partiality or oppression his liberality was such that he even parted with all his own private fortune in relieving the distresses of the necessitous against which when faustina the empress seemed to remonstrate he reprehended her folly alleging that as soon as he was possessed of the empire he quitted all private interests and having nothing of his own all properly belonged to the public he acted differently from his predecessors with regard to traveling and seldom left rome saying that he was unwilling to burden his subjects with ostentations and unnecessary expenses by this frugal conduct he was the better enabled to suppress all the insurrections that happened during his reign either in britain in dacia or in germany thus he was at once reverenced and loved by mankind being accounted rather a patron and father of his subjects than a master and commander ambassadors were sent to him from the remotest parts of hyrcania bactria and india all offering him their alliance and friendship some desiring him to appoint them a king whom they seemed proud to obey he showed not less paternal care toward the oppressed christians in whose favor he declared that if any should proceed to disturb them merely upon the account of their religion that such should undergo the same punishment which was intended against the accused  this clemency was attended with no less affability and freedom but at the same time he was upon his guard that his indulgence to his friends should not tempt them into insolence or oppression he therefore took care that his courtiers should not sell their favors nor take any gratuity from their suitors in the time of a great famine in rome he provided for the wants of the people and maintained vast numbers with bread and wine all the time of its continuance when any of his subjects attempted to inflame him with a passion for military glory he would answer that he more desired the preservation of one subject than the destruction of a thousand enemies  he was an eminent rewarder of learned men to whom he gave large pensions and great honors drawing them from all parts of the world among the rest he sent for apollonius the famous stoic philosopher to instruct his adopted son marcus aurelius whom he had previously married to his daughter apollonius being arrived at rome the emperor desired his attendance but the other arrogantly answered that it was the scholars duty to wait upon the master and not the masters upon the scholar to this reply antoninus only returned with a smile that it was surprising how apollonius who made no difficulty of coming from greece to rome should think it so hard to walk from one part of rome to another and immediately sent marcus aurelius to him while the good emperor was thus employed in making mankind happy in directing their conduct by his own example or reproving their follies with the keeness of rebuke he was seized with a violent fever at lorium a pleasurehouse at some distance from rome where finding himself sensibly decaying he ordered his friends and principal officers to attend him in their presence he confirmed the adoption of marcus aurelius without once naming lucius verus who had been joined by adrian with him in the succession then commanding the golden statue of fortune which was always in the chamber of the emperors to be removed to that of his successor he expired in the seventyfifth year of his age after a prosperous reign of twentytwo years and almost eight months  chap xviii marcus aurelius otherwise called antoninus the philosopher the seventeenth emperor of rome one was an example of the greatest goodness and wisdom the other of ignorance sloth and extravagance  the two emperors had been scarce settled on the throne when the empire seemed attacked on every side from the barbarous nations by which it was surrounded the catti invaded germany and rhaetia ravaging all with fire and sword but were after some time repelled by victorinus the britains likewise revolted but were suppressed by califurnius but the parthians under their king vologesus made an irruption still more dreadful than either of the former destroying the roman legions in armenia then entering syria and driving out the roman governor and filling the whole country with terror and confusion in order to stop the progress of this barbarous irruption verus himself went in person being accompanied by aurelius part of the way who did all in his power both by giving him advice and proper attendants to correct or restrain his vices  however these precautions were fruitless verus soon grew weary of all restraint he neglected every admonition and thoughtless of the urgency of his expedition plunged himself into every kind of debauchery these excesses brought on a violent fever on his journey which his constitution was sufficiently strong to get over but nothing could correct his vicious inclinations upon his entering antioch he resolved to give an indulgence to every appetite without attending to the fatigues of war here in one of its suburbs which was called daphne which from the sweetness of the air the beauty of its groves the richness of its gardens and the freshness of its fountains seemed formed for pleasure he rioted in excesses unknown even to the voluptuous greeks leaving all the glory of the field to his lieutenants who were sent to repress the enemy these however fought with great success statius priscus took artazata martius put vologesus to flight took seleucia plundered and burnt babylon and ctesiphon and demolished the magnificent palace of the kings of parthia in a course of four years during which the war continued the romans entered far into the parthian country and entirely subdued it but upon their return their army was wasted to less than half its former number by pestilence and famine however this was no impediment to the vanity of verus who resolved to enjoy the honors of a triumph so hardly earned by others wherefore having appointed a king over the armenians and finding the parthians entirely subdued he assumed the titles of armenicus and parthicus and then returned to rome to partake of a triumph with aurelius which he accordingly solemnized with great pomp and splendour  during the course of this expedition which continued for some years aurelius was sedulously intent upon distributing justice and happiness to his subjects at home he first applied himself to the regulation of public affairs and to the correcting such faults as he found in the laws and policy of the state in this endeavor he showed a singular respect for the senate often permitting them to determine without appeal so that the commonwealth seemed in a manner once more revived under his equitable administration besides such was his application to business that he often employed ten days together upon the same subject maturely considering it on all sides and seldom departing from the senate house till night coming on the assembly was dismissed by the consul but while thus gloriously occupied he was daily mortified with accounts of the enormities of his colleague being repeatedly assured of his vanity lewdness and extravagance however feigning himself ignorant of these excesses he judged marriage to be the best method of reclaiming him and therefore sent him his daughter lucilla a woman of great beauty whom verus married at antioch but even this was found ineffectual lucilla proved of a disposition very unlike her father and instead of correcting her husbands extravagancies only contributed to inflame them still however aurelius hoped that upon his return his presence would keep him in awe and that happiness would at length be restored to the state but in this also he was disappointed his return only seemed fatal to the empire for his army carried back the plague from parthia and disseminated the infection into all the provinces through which it passed  nothing could exceed the miserable state of the empire shortly after the return of verus in this horrid picture was represented an emperor unawed by example or the calamities surrounding him giving way to unheard of debaucheries a raging pestilence spreading terror and desolation through all parts of the western world earthquakes famines and inundations such as had never before happened the products of the earth throughout all italy devoured by locusts all the barbarous nations surrounding the empire the germans the sarmatians the quadi and marcomanni taking advantage of its various calamities and making their irruptions even into italy itself the priests doing all they could to put a stop to the miseries of the state by attempting to appease the gods vowing and offering numberless sacrifices celebrating all the sacred rites that had ever been known in rome and exhibiting the solemnity called lectisternia seven days together to crown the whole these enthusiasts not satisfied with the impending calamities making new by ascribing the distresses of the state to the impieties of the christians alone so that a violent persecution was seen reigning in all parts of the empire in which justin martyr st polycarp bishop of smyrna and an infinite number of others suffered martyrdom  in this scene of universal tumult desolation and distress there was nothing left but the virtues and the wisdom of one man alone to restore tranquillity and bring back happiness to the empire aurelius began his endeavors by marching against the marcomanni and quadi taking verus with him who reluctantly left the sensual delights of rome for the fatigues of a camp they came up to the marcomanni near the city of aquileia and after a furious engagement routed their whole army then pursuing them across the alps overcame them in several contests and at last entirely defeating them returned into italy without any considerable loss as the winter was far advanced causes some say that he was poisoned by the empress faustina some by his own wife lucilla who was jealous of him for the passion he bore his sister fabia and others still were found to say that aurelius had a hand in it but the number of these reports ought to destroy their credibility  aurelius who had hitherto the fatigues of governing not only an empire but an emperor being now left to himself began to act with greater diligence and more vigor than ever his first care was to marry his daughter lucilla once more to claudius pompeianus a man of moderate fortune and humble station but eminent for his honesty courage and wisdom he then left rome to finish the war against the marcomanni who joining with the quadi the sarmatians the vandals and other barbarous nations renewed hostilities with unusual rage and devastation they had some time before attacked vindex prefect of the praetorian bands and in a general battle near the danube destroyed no less than twenty thousand of his men they even pursued the romans as far as aquileia and would have taken the city had not the emperor led his troops in person to oppose them aurelius having repulsed the enemy continued his endeavors to repress them from future inroads he spent in this laborious undertaking no less than five years harrassing these barbarous nations supporting the most dreadful fatigues and supplying by the excess of his courage the defects of a delicate constitution the stoic philosophy in which he was bred had taught him a simplicity of living which served as an example to the whole army the common soldier could not murmur at any hardships he was put upon when he saw the emperor himself every hour undergoing greater austerities with cheerful resignation by this conduct aurelius so wearied out the enemy with repeated attacks that he at last constrained them to accept of such terms of peace as he thought fit to impose and thus returned in triumph to rome  upon the emperors return to rome he began his usual endeavors to benefit mankind by a farther reformation of the internal policy of the state he ordered that no enquiry should be made after the fortune of deceased persons who had been dead five years he moderated the public expenses and lessened the number of shows and sports which were exhibited on the amphitheatre he particularly took the poor under his protection he found such pleasure in relieving their wants that he considered his ability to supply the dictates of his compassion as one of the greatest happinesses of his life he labored incessantly to restrain the luxuries of the great he prohibited the use of chariots and litters to persons of inferior station and endeavored by all means to correct the lewdness and disorders of women  but his good endeavors were soon interrupted by a renewal of the former war the barbarians no sooner perceived his army withdrawn than they took up arms once more and renewed their ravages with greater fury than before they had now drawn over to their side all the nations from illyricum to the furthest parts of gaul aurelius therefore again saw himself surrounded with difficulties his army had been wasted by plague and frequent engagements and his treasures entirely exhausted in order to remedy these inconveniences he increased his army by inlisting slaves gladiators and the banditti of dalmatia to raise money he sold all the movables belonging to the empire and all the rich furniture which had been deposited in the cabinets of adrian this sale which continued for two months produced so considerable a sum as to defray all the expenses of the war his next effort was to march forward and cross the danube by a bridge of boats he then attacked the enemy gained several advantages burnt their houses and magazines of corn and received the submissions of such as had inconsiderately joined in the invasion the detail of his campaigns is but confusedly related by historians one battle in particular is mentioned which might have proved fatal had not some most surprising accidents interposed this engagement was begun by the enemys slingers across a river which induced the romans to cross it and make a great slaughter of those who attempted to defend its banks on the opposite side the enemy judging they should be pursued retired previously leaving some bodies of archers covered by a squadron of horse to skirmish with the romans as though they designed to stop their progress the romans with inconsiderate valor attacking this forlorn hope pursued them among a chain of barren mountains where they found themselves unexpectedly blocked up on every side however they continued fighting notwithstanding the disadvantage of the place but the enemy prudently declined engaging not willing to leave that victory to chance which they expected from delay at length the excessive heat of the enclosed situation the fatigues of long employment together with a violent thirst totally disheartened the legions they now found that they could neither fight nor retreat and that they must run upon certain danger or become a prey to their barbarous enemies in this deplorable exigence while sorrow and despair were their only companions aurelius ran through their ranks and in vain endeavored to rekindle their hopes and their courage nothing was heard but groans and lamentations nothing seen but marks of terror and desolation at this dreadful juncture and just as the barbarians were ready to fall upon them we are assured by some writers that the solemn prayers of a christian legion which was among them produced such a fall of rain as instantly refreshed the fainting army the soldiers were seen holding their mouths and their helmets up to heaven and receiving the showers which came so wonderfully to their relief the same clouds also which served for their rescue at the same time discharged such a terrible storm of hail accompanied with thunder against the enemy as astonished and confounded them by this unlooked for aid the romans recovering strength and courage once more turned upon their pursuers and cut them in pieces  such are the circumstances of an engagement acknowledged by pagan as well as christian writers only with this difference that the latter ascribe the victory to their own the former to the prayers of their emperor however this be aurelius seemed so sensible of miraculous assistance that he immediately relaxed the persecution against the christians and wrote to the senate in favor of their religion notwithstanding this victory the war continued for some months longer but after many violent conflicts the barbarians sent to sue for peace the emperor imposed conditions upon them more or less severe as he found them more or less disposed to revolt being actually resolved to divide their territories into provinces and subject them to the roman empire however a fresh rebellion called him to the defense of his dominions at home  avidius cassius was one of the emperors most favorite generals and had been chiefly instrumental in obtaining the roman successes in parthia his principal merit seemed to consist in his restoring the old discipline and in pretending a violent regard for the commonwealth in its ancient form however all his seeming regard for freedom was only to seize upon the liberties of his country for his own aggrandisement wherefore finding his soldiers for he was left with an army in the east willing to support his pretensions he proclaimed himself emperor in syria one of his chief artifices to procure popularity was his giving out that he was descended from the famous cassius who had conspired against caesar and like him he pretended that his aims were for the reestablishment of the commonwealth of rome he also caused it to be rumoured that aurelius was dead and affected to show the greatest respect for his memory by these pretenses he united a large body of men under his command and in a short time brought all the countries from syria to mount taurus under his subjection these prosperous beginnings served to increase the emperors activity but not his apprehensions he prepared to oppose him without any marks of uneasiness for the event telling his soldiers that he could freely yield up his empire to avidius if it should be judged conducive to the public good for as to his own part the only fruits he had from exaltation were incessant labor and fatigue i am ready cried he to meet avidius before the senate and before you and to yield him up the empire without the effusion of blood or striking a blow if it shall be thought good for the people but avidius will never submit to such a tribunal he who has been faithless to his benefactor can never rely upon any mans professions he will not even in case of being worsted rely upon me and yet my fellow soldiers my only fear is and i speak it with the greatest sincerity lest he should put an end to his own life or lest some thinking to do me a service should hasten his death the greatest hope that i have is to prove that i can pardon the most outrageous offenses to make him my friend even in spite of his reluctance and to show the world that civil wars themselves can come to an happy issue in the mean time he who well knew that desperate undertakings must have a speedy execution endeavored to draw over greece to his assistance but the love which all mankind bore the good emperor frustrated his expectations he was unable to bring over a single city to espouse his interests this repulse seemed to turn the scale of his former fortunes his officers and soldiers began now to regard him with contempt and at last slew him in less than four months after having first revolted his head was brought to the emperor who received it with regret and ordered it an honorable interment the rest of the conspirators were treated with great lenity some few or them were banished but recalled soon after this clemency was admired by some and condemned by others but the emperor little regarded the murmurs or the applause of the multitude guided only by the goodness of his own disposition he did what to him seemed right content and happy in selfapprobation when some took the liberty of blaming his conduct telling him that avidius would not have been so generous had he been conqueror the emperor replied in this sublime manner i never served the gods so ill or reigned so irregularly as to fear avidius could ever be conqueror  though avidius was no more yet aurelius was sensible that he had still some friends remaining whom he was willing to win over he therefore took a journey into the east where in all places he at once charmed them with his affability raised their admiration by his clemency instructed them by precept and improved them by his example the better to prevent such revolts for the future he ordained that as avidus was a native of the country in which he rebelled no person for the future should command in the place where he was born in this journey the empress faustina was unexpectedly seized with a violent distemper and died she was a woman whose wanton life gave great scandal to the dignity of her station however her passive husband either could not or at least affected not to see her enormities and willingly admitted the ill deserved honors which the senate importunately decreed to her memory  in his way to rome he visited athens were he conferred many honors on the inhabitants and established professors in all the sciences with munificent salaries for their ease upon landing in italy he quitted his soldiers habit as also did all his army and made his entry into rome in the gown which was worn in peace as he had been absent almost eight years he distributed to each citizen eight pieces of gold and remitted all the debts due to the treasury for sixty years past at the same time he nominated his son commodus to succeed him in the empire and made him a partner in his triumphal entry he then retired for some time to a country seat into the arms of philosophy which delighted his mind and guided his conduct he usually called it his mother in opposition to the court which he considered as his stepmother he also was frequently heard to say that the people were happy whose philosophers were kings or whose kings were philosophers he in fact was one of the most considerable men then in being and though he had been born in the meanest station his merits as a writer would have insured him immortality but it was not with him mere speculation his practice was entirely guided by the principles of stoicism so that his tranquillity was such that he was never observed to feel any emotion or to change countenance either in joy or sorrow his chief masters were appollonius of chalcis and sextus cheronensis grandson to the famous plutarch these shared his bounty as likewise did all the learned men of his time he had learned the art of so blending liberality with the most frugal economy that he seemed rather the equitable guardian of anothers wealth than the possessor of his own he was so sensible that few understood the art of giving that he built a temple to the goddess who presided over benefits  in this manner having restored prosperity to his subjects and peace to mankind he expected in the decline of life to rest from future toil but it was his fortune to be ever employed news was brought him that the scythians and barbarous nations of the north were again up in arms and invading the empire with furious impetuosity he now therefore once more resolved to expose his aged person in the defense of his country and made speedy preparations to oppose them he went to the senate for the first time and desired to have money out of the public treasury though it was in his power to take what sums he thought proper without their consent yet he openly declared that emperors had no private property not so much as the palace in which they dwelt the people whose love to the emperor daily increased finding him making preparations to leave them and resolving to expose himself in a dangerous war assembled themselves before his palace beseeching him not to depart till he had given them instructions for their future conduct so that if the gods should take him to themselves they might by his assistance continue in the same paths of virtue into which he had led them by his example this was a request which the good emperor was highly pleased in obeying he spent three whole days in giving them short maxims by which they might regulate their lives and having finished his lectures departed upon his expedition amidst the prayers and lamentations of all his subjects the particulars of these campaigns are not related by historians we can only say that he fought several bloody battles where the victory was always owing to his prudence courage and example he was constantly at the head of his men and always in places the most exposed to danger he built several forts and so disposed his garrisons as to keep all his barbarous neighbors in awe it was upon going to open his third campaign that he was seized with the plague at vienna which stopped the progress of his success nothing however could abate his desire of being beneficial to mankind for though his submission to the will of providence made him meet the approaches of death with tranquillity his fears for the youth and unpromising disposition of commodus his son and successor seemed to give him great uneasiness and aggravated the pains of nature struggling with this apprehension and fluctuating between hope and fear he addressed his friends and the principal officers that were gathered round his bed telling them that as his son was now going to lose a father he hoped he should find many fathers in them that they would direct his youth and give him such instructions as would be to the public benefit as well as his own make him more particularly sensible continued the dying emperor that not all the riches and honors of this world are sufficient to satisfy the luxury and ambition of a tyrant nor are the strongest guards and armies able to defend them from the just reward of their crimes assure him that cruel princes never enjoy a long and peaceful reign and that all the real delights of power are reserved only for those whose clemency and mildness have gained the hearts of their people it must be yours to inform him that obedience by constraint is never sincere and that he who would expect fidelity among mankind must gain it from their affections not their fears lay before him the difficulty and yet the necessity of setting bounds to his passions as there are none set to his power these are the truths to which he ought ever to attend by steadily inculcating these you will have the satisfaction of forming a good prince and the pleasure of paying my memory the noblest of all services since you will thus render it immortal as he was speaking these last words he was seized with a weakness which stopped his utterance and brought him to his end the day following he died in the fiftyninth year of his age having reigned nineteen years and some days  it seemed as if the whole glory and prosperity of the roman empire died with aurelius from hence forward we are to behold a train of emperors either vicious or impotent either wilfully guilty or unable to assert the dignity of their station we are to behold an empire grown too great sinking by its own weight surrounded by barbarous and successful enemies without and torn by ambitious and cruel factions within the principles of the times wholly corrupted philosophy attempting to regulate the minds of men without the aid of religion and the warmth of patriotism entirely evaporated by being diffused in too wide a circle we shall still farther find the people becoming dull as they grow impotent their historians cool and spiritless in the most interesting narrations and the convulsions of the greatest empire upon earth described in childish points or languid prolixity  chap xix commodus the eighteenth emperor of rome in the air with unerring aim and cut off the heads of an hundred ostriches in their most rapid motion with his arrows headed in the shape of an half moon  but it had been happy for himself and mankind if he had cultivated the mental exercises with as much attention as those of the body his whole reign is but a tissue of wantonness and folly cruelty and injustice rapacity and corruption there is so strong a similitude between his conduct and that of domitian that a reader might be apt to imagine he was going over the same reign  he was received upon his entrance into rome with a transport of applause from the people and for some time he showed himself worthy of their affection but soon the levity of his temper and the corrupt example of his favorite companions turned him to the basest meanest pursuits he went with his associates to taverns and brothels spent the day in feasting and the night in the most abominable luxuries having no less than three hundred females and as many males for detestable purposes he committed incest as caligula did with all his sisters he sometimes went about the markets in a frolic with small wares as a petty chapman sometimes he immitated an horsecourser and at other times drove his own chariot in a slaves habit  those he chiefly promoted resembled himself being the companions of his pleasures or the ministers of his cruelty he took little care of the government devolving all the conduct of it upon one perennius a person chiefly remarkable for his avarice and cruelty in consequence of the enormities of this minister a conspiracy was formed against commodus in the beginning of his reign in which his sister lucilla with her husband pompeianus were principally concerned the person employed to kill the emperor was one quintianus who coming up to him in a dauntless manner and holding up his dagger cried out the senate sends thee this but this unguarded manner of proceeding frustrated his aim for one of the guards just then seizing his arm prevented the fatal blow and he soon after made a discovery of all his accomplices lucilla pompeianus and quintianus were executed many other persons wholly innocent shared the same fate and perennius proceeded sacrificing numbers of the senate as pretended accomplices but in reality with a view of seizing upon their estates and fortunes being thus grown extremely rich he began to think of gaining the empire for himself and made some progress in the attempt but his design becoming apparent commodus seemed to rouse from his lethargy and ordered both him and his sons who had been sent to draw the legions to revolt for immediate execution  two conspiracies thus discovered and punished only served to render the emperor still more cruel and suspicious and these cruelties begot new revolts one maternus at the head of a numerous banditti wasted spain and gaul and resolved to attempt the empire itself in order to effect this upon a certain festival he ordered some of his soldiers to mix with the emperors guards and then assassinate him but his own party in hopes of advantage betrayed their employer and he was executed with many others soon after it was about this time also that cleander the emperors chief favorite fell a sacrifice to the indignation of the populace for his haughty carriage toward them another favorite whose name was julian was put to death by the emperors command and shortly after a third for this vicious prince could not reign without a favorite who was called regillius was executed in the same manner to these succeeded the murder of his wife crispina and his fathers cousin german faustina and numberless others whose virtues or fortunes rendered them obnoxious to his capricious cruelty if any person desired to be revenged on an enemy by bargaining with commodus for a sum of money he was permitted to destroy him in such manner as he thought proper he commanded a person to be cast to the wild beasts for reading the life of caligula in suetonius he commanded another to be thrown into a burning furnace for accidentally overheating his bath he would sometimes in a good humor cut off mens noses under a pretense of shaving their beards and was himself so jealous of all mankind that he was obliged to be his own barber  in the midst of these cruelties his vanity never forsook him instead of being content with numberless titles which his flattering senate were daily offering he was rather willing to assume such as were most agreeable to himself he at one time commanded himself to be styled hercules the son of jupiter and the better to immitate that hero he carried a club and dressed himself in a lions skin but to drive the immitation as far as possible and that he might appear to destroy giants and monsters as the former had done he dressed up several poor men and cripples which were found begging in the streets like monsters giving them sponges to throw at him instead of stones and falling furiously among them with his club he destroyed them all when tired of the herculean habit he assumed that of an amazon he at last became so abandoned as to forsake his palace and live in a fencingschool and satiated with all his former titles he assumed the name of a famous gladiator  during these deplorable irregularities the barbarians on the frontiers of the empire were daily gaining ground and though his lieutenants were successful against the britains the moors the dacians the germans and pannonians yet the empire was daily declining since their numbers seemed to increase by defeat so that neither treaties could bind nor victories repel them in the mean time the emperors actions were become so odious to all mankind and so contemptible to the citizens of rome that his death was ardently desired by all at length upon the feast of janus resolving to fence naked before the people as a common gladiator three of his friends remonstrated to him upon the indecency of such a behavior these were laetius his general electus his chamberlain and marcia a concubine of whom he always appeared excessively fond their advice was attended with no other effect than that of incensing him against them and inciting him to resolve upon their destruction it was his method as well as domitians to put down the names of all such as he intended to put to death in a roll which he carefully kept by him however at this time happening to place it upon his bed while he was bathing in another room it was taken up by a little boy whom he passionately loved who playing with it for some time brought it to marcia who was instantly alarmed at the contents she immediately discovered it to laetus and electus who perceiving their dangerous situation instantly resolved the tyrants death after some deliberation it was agreed upon to dispatch him by poison in consequence of this a draught probably opium was administered to him by the hands of marcia which beginning to operate cast him into a heavy slumber in order to conceal the fact she immediately caused the company to retire under pretense of allowing him rest but finding him awake soon after and taken with a violent vomiting she was greatly alarmed with fears of his recovery in this exigence consulting with the rest of the conspirators she hastily introduced a young man called narcissus and showing him his own name among the number of those whom commodus had destined to destruction she prevailed upon him to assist in dispatching him he boldly undertook the dangerous task so that the emperor was soon strangled by their united efforts in this manner died commodus in the thirtyfirst year of his age after an impious reign of twelve years and nine months and as if the example was given by him few of his successors escaped a violent death  chap xx pertinax the nineteenth emperor of rome   but previous to their assassination the conspirators had fixed upon a successor this was helvius pertinax whose virtues and courage rendered him worthy of the most exalted station this extraordinary personage had passed through many changes of fortune he was originally the son of an enfranchised slave called aelius who only gave him so much learning as to qualify him for keeping a little shop in the city he then became a schoolmaster afterward studied the law and after that became a soldier in which station his behavior was such as to be soon made captain of a cohort against the parthians being thus introduced to arms he went through the usual gradations of military preferment in britain and mesia until he became the commander of a legion under aurelius in this station he performed such excellent services against the barbarians that he was made consul and successively governor of dacia syria and asia minor in the reign of commodus he was banished soon after recalled and sent into britain to reform the abuses of the army in this employment his usual extraordinary fortune attended him he was opposed by a sedition among the legions and left for dead among many others that were slain however he got over this danger severely punished the mutineers and established regularity and discipline among the troops he was sent to command from thence he was removed into africa where the sedition of the soldiers had like to have been as fatal to him as in his former government removing from africa and fatigued with an active life he betook himself to retirement but commodus willing to keep him still in view made him prefect of the city which employment he filled when the conspirators fixed upon him as the properest person to succeed to the empire  his being advanced by commodus only served to increase his fears of falling as an object of his suspicions when therefore the conspirators repaired to his house by night he considered their arrival as a command from the emperor for his death upon laetus entering his apartment pertinax without any show of fear cried out that for many days he had expected to end his life in that manner wondering that the emperor had deferred it so long however he was not a little surprised when informed of the real cause of their visit and being strongly urged to accept of the empire he at last complied with their offer  being carried to the camp pertinax was proclaimed emperor soon after the citizens and senate consented their joy for the election of their new sovereign being scarce equal to that for the death of the former they pronounced commodus a parricide an enemy to the gods his country and all mankind and commanded that his coarse should rot upon a dunghill in the mean time they saluted pertinax as emperor and caesar with numerous acclamations and cheerfully took the oaths of obedience the provinces soon after followed the example of rome so that he began his reign with universal satisfaction to the whole empire being in the sixtyeighth year of his age  nothing could exceed the justice and wisdom of this monarchs reign the short time it continued he punished all those who had served to corrupt the late emperor and disposed of his ill got possessions to public uses he attempted to restrain the licentiousness of the praetorian bands and put a stop to the injuries and insolences they committed against the people he sold most of the buffoons and jesters of commodus as slaves particularly such as had obscene names he continually frequented the senate as often as it sat and never refused an audience even to the meanest of the people his success in foreign affairs was equal to his internal policy when the barbarous nations abroad had certain intelligence that he was emperor they immediately laid down their arms well knowing the opposition they were to expect from so experienced a commander his great error was avarice and that in some measure served to hasten his ruin  the praetorian soldiers whose manners he had attempted to reform having been long corrupted by the indulgence and profusion of their former monarch began to hate him for the parsimony and discipline he had introduced among them they therefore resolved to dethrone him and for that purpose declared maternus an ancient senator emperor and endeavored to carry him to the camp to proclaim him maternus however was too just to the merits of pertinax and too faithful a subject to concur in their seditious designs wherefore escaping out of their hands he fled first to the emperor and then out of the city they then nominated one falco another senator whom the senate would have ordered for execution had not pertinax interposed who declared that during his reign no senator should suffer death  the praetorian soldiers then resolved unanimously not to use any secret conspiracies or private contrivances but boldly to seize upon the emperor and empire at once they accordingly in a tumultuous manner marched through the streets of rome and entered the palace without opposition such was the terror of their approach that the greatest part of the emperors attendants forsook him while those who remained earnestly entreated him to fly to the body of the people and interest them in his defense however he rejected their advice declaring that it was unworthy his imperial dignity and all his past actions to save himself by flight having thus resolved to face the rebels he had some hopes that his presence alone would terrify and confound them but what could his former virtues or the dignity of command avail against a tumultuous rabble nursed up in vice and ministers of former tyranny one thausias a tungrian struck him with his lance on the breast crying out the soldiers send you this pertinax finding all was over covered his head with his robe and sunk down mangled with a multitude of wounds which he received from various assassins electus and some more of his attendants who attempted to defend him were also slain his son and daughter only escaped who happened to be lodged out of the palace thus after a reign of three months pertinax fell a sacrifice to the licentious fury of the praetorian army from the number of his adventures he was called the tennisball of fortune and certainly no man ever experienced such a variety of situation with so blameless a character  chap xxi didius julian the twentieth emperor of rome unjust only two bidders were found namely sulpician and didius the former a consular person prefect of the city and soninlaw to the late emperor pertinax the latter a consular person likewise a great lawyer and the wealthiest man in the city he was sitting with some friends at dinner when the proclamation was published and being charmed with the prospect of unbounded power immediately rose from the table and hastened to the camp sulpician was got there before him but as he had rather promises than treasure to bestow the offers of didius who produced immense sums of ready money prevailed he was received into the camp by a ladder and they instantly swore to obey him as emperor from the camp he was attended by his new electors into the city the whole body of his guards which consisted of ten thousand men ranged around him in such order as if they had prepared for battle and not for a peaceable ceremony the citizens however refused to confirm his election but rather cursed him as he passed upon being conducted to the senate house he addressed the few senators that were present in a very laconic speech fathers you want an emperor and i am the fittest person you can choose but even this short as it seems was unnecessary since the senate had it not in their power to refuse their approbation his speech being backed by the army to whom he had given about a million of our money succeeded the choice of the soldiers was confirmed by the senate and didius was acknowledged emperor now in the fiftyseventh year of his age  it should seem by this weak monarchs conduct when seated on the throne that he thought the government of an empire rather a pleasure than a toil instead of attempting to gain the hearts of his subjects he gave himself up to ease and inactivity utterly regardless of the duties of his station he was mild and gentle indeed neither injuring any nor expecting to be injured but that avarice by which he became oppulent still followed him in his exaltation so that the very soldiers who elected him soon began to detest him for those qualities so very opposite to a military character the people also against whose consent he was chosen were not less inimical whenever he issued from his palace they openly poured forth their imprecations against him crying out that he was a thief and had stolen the empire didius however in the true spirit of a trader patiently bore it all sometimes beckoning them with smiles to approach him and testifying his regard by every kind of submission  while didius was thus contemptuously treated at home two valiant generals in different parts of the empire disclaimed his authority and boldly resolved to strike at the throne for themselves these were pescennius niger governor of syria and septimius severus commander of the german legions niger was beloved by the people for his clemency and valor and the report of his proposing pertinax for his model and resolving to revenge his death gained him universal esteem among the people being thus apprized of their inclinations he easily induced his army in syria to proclaim him emperor and his title was shortly after acknowledged by all the kings and potentates in asia who sent their ambassadors to him as their lawful prince the pleasure of thus being treated as a monarch in some measure retarded his endeavors to secure his title entirely satisfied with the homage of those about him he neglected the opportunities of suppressing his rivals and gave himself up to feasting and luxury at antioch the conduct of severus an african by birth was very different being proclaimed by his army he began by promising to revenge the death of pertinax and took upon him his name he next secured the fidelity of all the strong places in his province and then resolved with the utmost expedition to march with his whole force directly to rome  in the mean time didius who disregarded the attempts of niger was greatly alarmed at those of severus he first with many solicitations procured the senate to proclaim him a traitor he then applied himself to make the necessary provisions to oppose him in which he found nothing but disappointment the cohorts that elected him were enervated by vice and luxury the people detested his cause and the cities of italy had long been disused to the arts of war some advised him to march forward and meet severus as he was crossing the alps others were for sending the generals upon that expedition the unfortunate didius unequal to the task of empire and quite confounded with the multiplicity of counsels could take no other resolution but that of awaiting his rivals coming at rome accordingly soon after being informed of his approach he obtained the consent of the senate to send him ambassadors offering to make him a partner in the empire but severus rejected this offer conscious of his own strength and of the weakness of the proposer the senate soon appeared of the same sentiments and perceiving the timidity and weakness of their present master began to abandon him they now began to allege that he who could not defend the empire was unworthy to govern it didius vainly endeavored to reduce them to their duty first by entreaties and then by threats but these only served to hasten his destruction the senate being called together as was formerly practiced in the times of the commonwealth by the consuls they unanimously decreed that didius should be deprived of the empire and that severus should be proclaimed in his stead they then commanded didius to be slain and sent messengers for this purpose to the palace where they found him disarmed and weeping among a few friends that still adhered to his interest when the executioners began to prepare for their fatal errand he expostulated with them demanding what crime he had committed he could not be persuaded to think that paying his money and receiving an empire in exchange deserved so severe a punishment the executioners however were neither able nor willing to enter into the merits of the cause they presently led him into the secret baths of the palace and obliging him to stretch his neck forward after the manner of condemned criminals struck off his head and placed it up in those courts where he had formerly pleaded with great success  chap xxii septimius severus the twentyfirst emperor of rome banished an hundred miles from rome he then entered the city in a military manner took possession of the palace and promised the senate to conduct himself with clemency and justice however though he united great vigor with the most refined policy yet his african cunning was considered as a particular defect in him he is celebrated for his wit learning and prudence but equally blamed for infidelity and cruelty in short he seemed equally disposed to the performance of the greatest acts of virtue and the most bloody severities he began his command by seizing all the children of such as had employments or authority in the east and detained them as pledges for their fathers loyalty he next supplied the city with corn and then with all possible expedition marched against niger who was still considered and honored as emperor of the east  one of the chief obstacles to his march was the leaving behind him clodius albinus commander of the legions in britain whom he by all means endeavored to secure in his interests for this end he endeavored to prevail upon him by giving him hopes of succeeding to the empire insinuating that he himself was declining and his children as yet but infants to deceive him still further he wrote in the same style to the senate gave him the title of caesar and ordered money to be coined with his image these artifices serving to lull albinus into false security severus marched against niger with all his forces after some undecisive conflicts the last great battle that was fought between these two extraordinary men was upon the plains of issus on the very spot where alexander had formerly conquered darius beside the two great armies drawn upon the plain the neighboring mountains were covered with infinite numbers of people who were merely led by curiosity to become spectators of an engagement that was to determine the empire of the world the fate of the battle was what we have almost ever found between european and asiatic troops of nearly equal numbers severus was conqueror and nigers head being struck off by some soldiers of the conquering army was insultingly carried through the camp on the point of a lance  this victory secured severus in the possession of the throne however the parthians persians and some other neighboring nations took up arms under a pretense of vindicating nigers cause the emperor marched against them in person had many engagements with them and obtained such signal victories over them as enlarged the empire and established peace in the east  niger being no more severus now turned his views against albinus whom he resolved by every means to destroy for this purpose he sent some assassins into britain under a pretense of bringing him letters but in reality to dispatch him albinus being apprized of their designs prevented their attempt by recurring to open force and proclaiming himself emperor nor was he without a powerful army to support his pretensions of which severus being sensible bent his whole force to oppose him from the east he continued his course across the streights of byzantium into the most western parts of europe without intermission equally regardless of the most parching heats and the most rigorous colds he led his soldiers bareheaded over mountains covered with snow albinus being informed of his approach went over to meet him with his forces into gaul so that the campaign on both sides was carried on with great vigor fortune seemed for a while variable but at last a decisive engagement came on which was one of the most desperate recorded in the roman story it lasted from morning till night without any seeming advantage on either side at length the troops of severus began to fly and he himself happening to fall from his horse the army of albinus cried out victory but the engagement was soon renewed with vigor by laetus one of severuss commanders who came up with a body of reserve designing to destroy both parties and make himself emperor this attempt though designed against both turned out entirely to the advantage of severus he therefore again charged with such fury and exactness that he soon plucked the victory from those who but a short time before seemed conquerors and pursuing them into the city of lions took albinus prisoner and cut off his head treating his dead body with insults that could only flow from a mean and revengeful temper all the senators who were slain in battle he ordered to be quartered and such as were taken alive were immediately executed  having thus by means of his army secured himself in possession of the empire upon his return to rome he loaded his soldiers with rewards and honors giving them such privileges as strengthened his own power while they destroyed that of the state for the soldiers who had hitherto showed the strongest inclinations to an abuse of power were now made arbiters of the fate of emperors and we shall henceforward behold them setting them up and dethroning them at pleasure  being thus secure of his army he resolved to give way to his natural turn for conquest and to oppose his arms against the parthians who were then invading the frontiers of the empire having therefore previously given the government of domestic policy to one plautian a particular favorite of his to whose daughter he married his son caracalla he set out for the east and prosecuted the war with his usual expedition and success he forced submission from the king of armenia destroyed several cities in arabia felix landed on the parthian coasts took and plundered the famous city ctesiphon marched back through palestine and egypt and at length returned to rome in triumph  during this interval plautian who was left to direct the affairs of rome began to think of aspiring to the empire himself he had before been remarkably cruel to the christians and now he resolved to increase the number of his crimes by ingratitude and treason upon the emperors return he employed a tribune of the praetorian cohorts of which he was the commander to assassinate him as likewise his son caracalla the tribune seemed cheerfully to undertake this dangerous office but instead of going through with it informed severus of his favourites treachery he at first received it as an improbable story and as the artifice of some one who envied his favourites fortune however he was at last persuaded to permit the tribune to conduct plautian to the emperors apartments with this intent the tribune went and amused him with a pretended account of his killing the emperor and his son desiring him if he thought it fit to see them dead to come with him to the palace as plautian ardently desired their deaths he readily gave credit to this relation and following the tribune he was conducted at midnight into the innermost recesses of the palace but what must have been his disappointment when instead of finding the emperor lying dead as he expected he beheld the room lighted up with torches and severus surrounded by his friends prepared in array to receive him being asked by the emperor with a stern countenance what had brought him there at that unseasonable time he was at first utterly confounded wherefore not knowing what excuse to make he ingenuously confessed the whole entreating forgiveness for what he had intended the emperor seemed in the beginning inclined to pardon but caracalla his son who from the earliest age showed a disposition to cruelty spurned him away in the midst of his supplications and with his sword ran him through the body  severus having escaped this danger spent a considerable time in visiting some cities in italy permitting none of his officers to sell places of trust or dignity and distributing justice with the strictest impartiality he took such an exact order in managing his exchequer that notwithstanding his great expenses he left more money behind him than any of his predecessors his armies also were kept upon the same respectable footing so that he feared no invasion being equally attentive to the preservation of all parts of the empire he resolved to make his last expedition into britain where the romans were in danger of being destroyed or compelled to fly the province wherefore after appointing his two sons caracalla and geta joint successors in the empire and taking them with him he landed in britain to the great terror of such as had drawn down his resentment upon his progress into the country he left his son geta in the southern part of the province which had continued in obedience and marched with his son caracalla against the caledonians in this expedition his army suffered prodigious hardships in pursuing the enemy they were obliged to hew their way through intricate forests to drain extensive marshes and form bridges over rapid rivers so that he lost fifty thousand men by fatigue and sickness however he supported all these inconveniences with unrelenting bravery and prosecuted his successes with such vigor that he compelled the enemy to beg for peace which they obtained not without the surrender of a considerable part of their country together with all their arms and military preparations thus giving peace to britain for its better security he built that famous wall which still goes by his name extending from solway frith on the west to the german ocean on the east it was eight feet broad and twelve feet high planted with towers at a miles distance from each other and communicating by pipes of brass in the wall which conveyed instructions from one garrison to another with incredible dispatch severus having thus punished his enemies retired to york where partly through age and fatigue and partly through grief for the irreclaimable life of caracalla he found himself daily declining to add to the distress of his situation he was informed that the soldiers had revolted and declared his son emperor in this exigence he seemed once more to recall his natural vigor he got himself immediately into his litter and commanded the new emperor with the tribunes and centurions to be brought before him though all were willing to court the favor of the young emperor such was the authority of severus that none dared to disobey they appeared before him confounded and trembling and implored pardon upon their knees upon which putting his hand to his head he cried out know that it is the head that governs and not the feet however soon perceiving his disorder to increase and knowing that he could not outlive it he could not help observing in his agony that though he had been all that a man could be it was of no service to him at that painful hour then ordering his urn to be brought wherein his ashes were to be enclosed little urn said he thou shall now contain what the world could not contain then addressing his friends that stood near him when i took the empire upon me said he i found it declining and exhausted i now leave it strong and lasting to my sons if they prove virtuous but feeble and desperate if otherwise his pains now increasing especially in his feet he called for poison which being refused him he loaded his stomach with food which not being able to digest it soon brought him to his end in the sixtysixth year of his age after an active though cruel reign of about eighteen years  chap xxiii caracalla and geta the twentysecond emperors of rome caracalla and geta being acknowledged as emperors by the army began to show a mutual hatred to each other even before their arrival at rome their only agreement was in resolving to deify severus their father but soon after each sought to attach the senate and army to his own particular interest they were of very opposite dispositions caracalla was fierce and cruel to an extreme degree geta was mild and merciful so that the city soon found the dangerous effects of being governed by two princes of equal power and contrary inclinations  but this opposition was of no long continuance for caracalla being resolved to govern alone furiously entered getas apartment and followed by ruffians slew him in his mothers arms having committed this detestable murder he issued with great haste from the palace crying out that his brother would have slain him and that he was obliged in selfdefence to retaliate the intended injury he then took refuge among the praetorian cohorts and in a pathetic tone began to implore their assistance still making the same excuse for his conduct to this he added a much more prevailing argument promising to bestow upon them the largesses usually given upon the election of new emperors and distributing among them almost all the treasures which had been amassed by his father by such persuasives the soldiers did not hesitate to proclaim him sole emperor and to stigmatize the memory of his brother geta as a traitor and an enemy to the commonwealth the senators were soon after induced either through favor or fear to approve what had been done by the army caracalla began to reign alone wept for the death of his brother whom he had slain and to carry his hypocrisy to the utmost extreme ordered him to be adored as a god  being now emperor he went on to mark his course with blood whatever was done by domitian or nero fell short of this monsters barbarities laetus who first advised him to murder his brother was the first who fell a sacrifice to his jealousy his own wife plautina followed papinian the renowned civilian was beheaded for refusing to write in vindication of his cruelty answering the emperors request by observing that it was much easier to commit a parricide than to defend it he commanded all governors to be slain that his brother had appointed and destroyed not less than two thousand persons that had adhered to his party whole nights were spent in the execution of his bloody decrees and the dead bodies of people of all ranks were carried out of the city in carts where they were burnt in heaps without any of the ceremonies of a funeral upon a certain occasion he ordered his soldiers to set upon a crowded audience in the theater only for discountenancing a charioteer whom he happened to savor perceiving himself hated by the people he publicly said that he could insure his own safety though not their love so that he neither valued their reproaches nor feared their hatred  this safety which he so much built upon was placed in the protection of his soldiers he had exhausted the treasury drained the provinces and committed a thousand acts of rapacity merely to keep them steadfast in his interests and being disposed to trust himself with them particularly he resolved to lead them upon a visit through all the provinces of the empire he first went into germany where to oblige the natives he dressed himself in the habit of their country from thence he traveled into macedonia where he pretended to be a great admirer of alexander the great and among other extravagancies caused a statue of that monarch to be made with two faces one of which resembled alexander and the other himself he was so corrupted by flattery that he called himself alexander walked as he was told that monarch had walked and like him bent his head to one shoulder shortly after arriving at lesser asia and the ruins of troy as he was viewing the tomb of achilles he took it into his head to resemble that hero and one of his freedmen happening to die at that time he used the same ceremonies that were performed at the tomb of patroclus passing from thence into egypt he cut off numbers at once in the amphitheatre at alexandria only for having passed some jests upon his person and vices the slaughter was so great that the streams of blood flowing down discolored the mouth of the river nile  going from thence into syria he invited artabanus king of parthia to a conference desiring his daughter in marriage and promising him the most honorable protection in consequence of this that king met him on a spacious plain unarmed and only attended with a vast concourse of his nobles this was what caracalla desired regardless of his promise or the law of nations he instantly surrounded him with armed troops let in wild beasts among his attendants and made a most terrible slaughter among them artabanus himself escaping with the utmost difficulty for this vile treachery he obtained from the senate the surname of parthicus  upon his return toward rome it would seem as if his vices were inexhaustible for having been guilty of parricide he now resolved to marry the mother of geta whom he had slain it happened that one day seeing her drop her veil which disclosed her naked bosom which was extremely beautiful he told her that he would possess those charms he beheld if it were lawful to this unnatural request she hesitated not to answer that he might enjoy all things who possessed all whereupon setting aside all duty and respect for his deceased father he celebrated his nuptials with her in public totally disregarding the censures and the sarcasms of mankind  however though he disregarded shame he was not insensible to fear he was ever uneasy in the consciousness of being universally hated and was continually consulting astrologers concerning what death he should die among others he sent one of his confidants named maternianus with orders to consult all the astrologers in the city concerning his end maternianus considered this as a proper time to get rid of macrinus the emperors principal commander in messopotamia a man who was daily supplanting him in his masters favor he therefore informed him by letter as if from the astrologers that macrinus had a design against his life and they consequently advised him to put the conspirator to death this letter was sent sealed and made up amongst many others to be conveyed with the greater secrecy and delivered to the emperor as he was preparing for a chariot race however as it never was his custom to interrupt his pleasures for his business he gave the packet to macrinus to read over and to inform him of the contents when more at leisure in perusing these letters when macrinus came to that which regarded himself he was unable to contain his surprise and terror his first care was to reserve the letter in question to himself and to acquaint the emperor only with the substance of the rest he then set about the most probable means of compassing his death by which alone he could expect any safety at length he determined to apply to one martial a man of great strength and a centurion of the guards who hated the emperor from various motives particularly for the death of a brother whom caracalla had ordered to be slain him therefore macrinus exhorted to revenge his brothers death by killing the tyrant which he might easily effect as being always so near his person martial readily undertook the dangerous task being willing to meet death himself so he might obtain his desire of seeing the tyrant expire before him accordingly as the emperor was riding out one day near a little city called carrae he happened to withdraw himself privately upon a natural occasion with only one page to hold his horse this was the opportunity martial had so long and ardently desired wherefore running to him hastily as if he had been called he stabbed the emperor in the back so that he died immediately having performed this hardy attempt martial unconcernedly returned to his troop but retiring by insensible degrees he endeavored to secure himself by flight but his companions soon missing him and the page giving information of what had been done he was pursued by the german horse and cut in pieces  during the reign of this execrable tyrant which continued six years the empire was every day declining the soldiers were entirely masters of every election and as there were various armies in different parts so there were as many interests all opposite to each other caracalla by satisfying their most unreasonable appetites destroyed all discipline among them and all subordination in the state however the constitution of rome at present pretty much resembled that of ancient rome kings or governors were chosen at both times by the people but in ancient rome those people were but occasionally soldiers in the latter empire they were soldiers by profession  chap xxiv oppillius macrinus the twentythird emperor of rome discipline for to such a pitch of licentiousness was the roman army now arrived that the most severe punishments were unable to restrain the soldiers and yet the most gentle inflictions were looked upon as severity it was this rigorous discipline together with the artifices of mosa grandmother to heliogabalus the natural son of caracalla that caused the emperors ruin heliogabalus was priest of a temple dedicated to the sun in emesa a city of phaenicia and though but fourteen years old was greatly loved by the army for the beauty of his person and the memory of his father whom they still considered as their greatest benefactor this was soon perceived by the grandmother who being very rich in gold and jewels gave liberal presents among them while they frequently repaired to her temple both from the garrison in the city and the camp of macrinus this intercourse growing every day more frequent and the soldiers being disgusted with the severities of their present emperor macrinus began to think of placing heliogabalus in his stead accordingly sending for him to their camp he was immediately proclaimed and such were the hopes of his virtues that all men began to affect his interests  macrinus who at this time was pursuing his pleasures at antioch gave but little attention to the first report only sending his lieutenant julian with some legions to quell the insurrection however these like the rest soon declared for heliogabalus and slew their general it was then that macrinus found he had treated the rebellion too slightly he therefore resolved with his son to march directly against the seditious legions and force them to their duty both parties met on the confines of syria the battle was for some time furious and obstinate but at last macrinus was overthrown and obliged to seek safety by flight his principal aim was to get to rome where he knew his presence was desired wherefore he traveled through the provinces of asia minor with the utmost expedition and privacy but unfortunately fell sick at the city of chalcedon there those who were sent in pursuit overtook and put him to death together with his son diadumenus after a short reign of one year and two months  chap xxv heliogabalus the twentyfourth emperor of rome which he suffered with great patience saying that a wife was obliged to submit to her husband he built a temple to the sun and willing that his god should have a wife as well as himself he married him to pallas and shortly after to the moon his palace was a place of rendezvous for all the prostitutes of rome whom he frequently met naked calling them his fellow soldiers and companions in the field he was so fond of the sex that he carried his mother with him to the senate house and demanded that she should always be present when matters of importance were debated he even went so far as to build a senate house for women with suitable orders habits and distinctions of which his mother was made president they met several times all their debates turning upon the fashions of the day and the different formalities to be used at giving and receiving visits to these follies he added great cruelty and boundless prodigality so that he was heard to say that such dishes as were cheaply obtained were scarce worth eating his suppers therefore generally cost six thousand crowns and often sixty thousand he always dressed in cloth of gold and purple enriched with precious stones and yet never wore the same habit twice his palace his chambers and his beds were all furnished of the richest stuffs covered with gold and jewels whenever he took horse all the way between his apartment and the place of mounting was covered with gold and silver dust strewn at his approach in short all his government actions dress and furniture testified the extravagant folly of a vicious boy thus he was seen at one time driving elephants yoaked to his chariot at another mastiff dogs at one time he was drawn by lions at another by four naked women he was so extravagantly whimsical that he caused a collection to be made of ten thousand pound weight of spiders to be a testimony of the magnitude of the city he would invite guests to supper in the same spirit of absurdity thus he gave a feast to eight old men eight bald men eight blind of one eye eight lame with the gout eight deaf men eight blacks and eight so fat that they could scarce sit at the same table these were the tricks of a child and might pass for harmless follies had he not united malevolence with every entertainment he was often seen to smother his guests in rooms filled with roses and terrify them by letting loose wild beasts among them previously deprived of their teeth and claws it is even said he strove to foretell what was to happen by inspecting the entrails of young men sacrificed and that he chose the most beautiful youths throughout italy to be slain for that horrid purpose  these excesses were soon perceived by his grandmother maesa whose intrigues had first raised him to the throne so that she thought to lessen his power by dividing it for this purpose under a pretense of freeing him from the cares of public business she persuaded him to adopt his cousingerman alexander as his successor and likewise to make him his partner in the consulship heliogabalus having thus raised his cousin had scarce given him his power when he wished again to take it away but the virtues of this young prince had so greatly endeared the people and the army to him that the attempt had like to have been fatal to the tyrant himself the praetorian soldiers mutinying attempted to kill him as he was walking in his gardens but he escaped by hiding himself from their fury however upon returning to their camp they continued the sedition requiring that the emperor should remove such persons from about him as oppressed the subject and contributed to contaminate him they required also the being permitted to guard the young prince themselves and that none of the emperors favorites or familiars should ever be permitted to converse with him heliogabalus was reluctantly obliged to comply and conscious of the danger he was in made preparations for death when it should arrive in a manner truly whimsical and peculiar he built a lofty tower with steps of gold and pearl from whence to throw himself headlong in case of necessity he also prepared cords of purple silk and gold to strangle himself with he provided golden swords and daggers to stab himself with and poison to be kept in boxes of emerald in order to obtain what death he chose best thus fearing all things but particularly suspicious of the designs of the senate he banished them all out of the city he next attempted to poison alexander and spread a report of his death but perceiving the soldiers begin to mutiny he immediately took him in his chariot to the camp where he only experienced a fresh mortification by finding all the acclamations of the army directed only to his successor this not a little raised his indignation and excited his desire of revenge he returned toward the city threatening the most severe punishments against those who had displeased him and meditating fresh cruelties however the soldiers were unwilling to give him time to put his designs in execution they followed him directly to his palace pursued him from apartment to apartment till at last he was found concealed in a privy a situation very different from that in which he expected to die having dragged him from thence through the streets with the most bitter invectives and having dispatched him they attempted once more to squeeze his pampered body into a privy but not easily affecting this they threw it into the tyber with heavy weights that none might afterward find or give it burial this was the miserable and ignominious death of heliogabalus in the eighteenth year of his age after a detestable reign of four years his mother also was slain at the same time by the soldiers as also many of the opprobious associates of his criminal pleasures having stakes drove up their bodies that their deaths might be conformable to their lives  chap xxvi alexander the twentyfifth emperor of rome the lewd and infamous his accomplishments were equal to his virtues he was an excellent mathematician geometrician and musician he was equally skilful in painting and sculpture and in poetry few of his time could equal him in short such were his talents and such the solidity of his judgment that though but sixteen years of age he was considered as a wise old man  the first part of his reign was spent in a reformation of the abuses of his predecessor he restored the senators to their rank nothing being undertaken without the most sage advisers and most mature deliberation among the number of his advisers was his mother mammaea a woman eminent for her virtues and accomplishments and who made use of her power as well to secure her son the affections of his subjects as to procure them the most just administration among his ministers of state the principal were ulpian the celebrated lawyer and sabinus the senator who was called the cato of his time merit only was the passport to his protection he would never permit offices or places to be purchased for money it being a frequent maxim with him that he who bought an office must consequently be a seller of justice i cannot he would say bear to see merchants in authority if i first allow them to be such i cannot after condemn their conduct for how could i punish the person who bought when i permitted him to be a buyer he was therefore a rigid punisher of such magistrates as took bribes saying that it was not enough to deprive such of their places for their trusts being great their lives in most cases ought to pay for a breach of them on the contrary he thought he could never sufficiently reward such as had been remarkable for their justice and integrity keeping a register of their names and sometimes asking such of them as appeared modest and unwilling to approach him why they were so backward in demanding their reward and why they suffered him to be in their debt in short he was observed every day to have done some good in which he had the advantage of titus by having a longer reign his clemency extended even to the christians who had been punished in the former reigns with unrelenting barbarity upon a contest between them and a company of cooks and vintners about a piece of public ground which the one claimed as a place for public worship and the other for exercising their respective trades he decided the point by his rescript in these words it is better that god be worshipped there in any manner than that the place should be put to uses of drunkenness or debauchery  his abilities in war were not inferior to his assiduity in peace the empire which from the remissness and debauchery of the preceding reigns now began to be attacked on every side wanted a person of vigor and conduct to defend it alexander faced the enemy wherever the invasion was most formidable and for a short time deferred its ruin his first expedion in the tenth year of his reign was against the parthians and persians whom he opposed with a powerful army his regularity and discipline were things almost unknown among the debauched soldiery his camp resembled a well regulated city his soldiers were well clothed and armed and his cavalry properly mounted so that his army now gave an idea of rome in its splendor his manner of living was like that of the meanest sentinel whenever he dined or supped he sat with his tent open that all men might be witnesses of the frugality of his table success against the enemy was the reward of so much military virtue the persians were routed in a decisive engagement with great slaughter the cities of ctesiphon and babylon were once more taken and the roman empire restored to its former limits upon his return to antioch his mother mammaea sent for the famous origin to be instructed by him in the principles of christianity and after discoursing with him for some time upon the subject dismissed him with a proper safeguard to his native city of alexandria about the same time that alexander was victorious in the east furius celsus his general obtained a signal victory over the mauritanians in africa varius macrinus was successful in germany and junius palmatus returned with conquest from armenia however the number of these victories only hastened the decline of the empire which was wasted by the exertion of its own strength and was now becoming little more than a splendid ruin  about the thirteenth year of his reign the upper germans and other northern nations began to pour down immense swarms of people upon the more southern parts of the empire they passed the rhine and the danube with such fury that all italy was thrown into the most extreme consternation the emperor ever ready to expose his person for the safety of his people made what levies he could and went in person to stem the torrent which he speedily effected it was in the course of his successes against the enemy that he was cut off by a mutiny among his own soldiers the legions encamped about moguntia having been abominably corrupted during the reign of heliogabalus and trained up in all kinds of rapine and disobedience required the most strict command alexander could neither endure their tumultuary obedience nor they his regular discipline his own faults and those of his mother mammaea were objected against him they openly exclaimed that they were governed by an avaricious woman and a meanspirited boy and resolved upon electing an emperor capable of ruling alone in this general revolt maximin an old and experienced commander held frequent conferences with the soldiers and enflamed the sedition at length being determined to dispatch their present emperor they sent an executioner into his tent who immediately struck off his head and shortly after that of his mother he died in the twentyninth year of his age after a prosperous reign of thirteen years and nine days his death proving that no virtue or justice can guard us against the misfortunes of this life and that good men are to expect their reward in a place of more equitable distribution  chap xxvii maximin the twentysixth emperor of rome which two oxen could not move he could strike out an horses teeth with a blow of his fist and break its thigh with a kick his diet was as extraordinary as the rest of his endowments he generally eat forty pounds weight of flesh every day and drank six gallons of wine without committing any debauch in either with a frame so athletic he was possessed of a mind undaunted in danger and neither fearing nor regarding any man the first time he was made known to the emperor severus was upon his celebrating games on the birthday of his son geta maximin was then a rude countryman and requested the emperor to be permitted to contend for the prizes which were distributed to the best runners wrestlers and boxers of the army severus unwilling to infringe the military discipline would not permit him at first to combat except with slaves against whom his strength appeared astonishing he overcame sixteen in running one after the other he then kept up with the emperor on horseback and having fatigued him in the course he was opposed to seven of the most active soldiers and overcame them with the greatest ease from that time he was particularly noticed and taken into the emperors body guard in which his assiduity and prompt obedience were particularly remarkable in the reign of caracalla he was made a centurion and distinguished himself in this station by his strict attention to the morals and discipline of those he commanded when made a tribune he still retained the hardy simplicity of his life eat as the meanest sentinel spent whole days in exercising the troops and would now and then himself wrestle with eight or ten of the strongest men in the army whom he threw with scarce any effort being thus become one of the most remarkable men in the empire both for courage discipline and personal activity he gave shortly after a very high instance of his unshaken fidelity for when macrinus was made emperor he refused to serve under a prince that had betrayed his sovereign and retired to thrace his native country where he followed commerce and purchased some lands content with privacy rather than a guilty dependence upon the accession of heliogabalus to the throne this bold veteran once more returned to the army but was in the very beginning disgusted at the base effeminacy of the emperor who hearing amazing instances of his strength asked him if he were equally capable in combats of another nature this lewd demand was so little suitable to the temper of maximin that he instantly left the court upon the death of heliogabalus he again returned to rome and was received with great kindness by alexander who particularly recommended him to the senate and made him commander of the fourth legion which consisted of new raised soldiers maximin gladly accepted of this charge and performed his duty with great exactness and success setting an example of virtue and discipline to all the commanders of the army nor was his valor less apparent against the germans whither he was sent with his legion so that he was unanimously considered as the boldest bravest most valiant and most virtuous soldier in the whole empire he soon however forseited all these justly merited titles when he was raised to the throne and from being the most loved commander in the army he became the most cruel tyrant upon earth the change in his disposition may readily serve to show how dangerous a thing is power that could transform a person with so many rigid virtues into such a monster of iniquity yet in fact his former virtues were all of the severe and rigid kind which without any education might very easily degenerate into tyranny so that he might have mistaken his succeeding cruelty for discipline and his severity for justice however this be maximin is considered as one of the greatest monsters of cruelty that ever disgraced power and fearful of nothing himself he seemed to sport with the terrors of all mankind  maximin seeing himself advanced to so high a station as the empire began immediately by endeavoring to force obedience from every rank of people and by vindicating his authority by violence the senate and people of rome were the first that incurred his resentment they utterly refusing to confirm the election of the army he was the first emperor who reigned without their concurrence or approbation however he seemed regardless of their opposition proceeding to secure his election by putting all such to death as had been raised by his predecessor the christians also having found favors in the former reign felt the weight of his resentment and were persecuted in several parts of the empire particularly in those where he himself resided his cruelty likewise extended to the rich whose lives and estates became a frequent sacrifice to avarice and suspicion but what appears still a more extraordinary instance of his cruelty being ashamed of the meanness of his extraction he commanded all such as were best acquainted with him and his parentage to be slain although there were some among the number that had relieved him in his low condition  however his cruelties did not retard his military operations which were carried on with a spirit becoming a better monarch he overthrew the germans in several battles wasted all their country with fire and sword for four hundred miles together and set a resolution of subduing all the northern nations as far as the ocean in these expeditions in order to attach the soldiers more firmly to him he increased their pay and in every duty of the camp he himself took as much pains as the meanest sentinel in his army showing incredible courage and assiduity in every engagement wherever the conflict was hottest maximin was always seen fighting there in person and destroying all before him for being bred a barbarian he considered it as his duty to combat as a common soldier while he commanded as a general  in the mean time his cruelties had so alienated the minds of his subjects that several conspiracies were secretly aimed against him magnus a consular person and some others had plotted to break down a wooden bridge as soon as the emperor had past it and thus to abandon him to the enemy but this being discovered gave maximin an opportunity of indulging his natural severity upon this pretext alone causing above four thousand to be slain shortly after some of alexanders old soldiers withdrawing themselves from the camp proclaimed one quarcianus as emperor who had been lately disgusted at maximin for being dismissed from employment the soldiers in fact constrained him to accept of the dangerous superiority to which he was exposed and shortly after in the spirit of the times the person who had been the promoter of his advancement murdered him in his bed and carried his head to maximin who received him kindly at first but soon put him to a cruel death for his complicated guilt of treason and treachery  these partial insurrections were soon after followed by a spirit of general discontent throughout all the empire the provinces of africa were the first that showed their detestation of the tyrant whose extortions and cruelties among them were become insupportable they first slew his procurator and afterward considering how dangerous a crime they had committed they resolved to throw off all expectations of pardon and create a new emperor gordian was then proconsul of africa a person of great fame for his virtues and greatly reverenced for a blameless life of near eighty him therefore they determined to elect and accordingly the soldiers and natives assembling together tumultuously entered his house resolved to put their design in execution gordian who at first supposed they were come to kill him being made sensible of their intentions utterly refused their offer alleging his extreme age and maximins power but all his opposition was vain they constrained him to accept of the profferred dignity and he with his son gordian who was fortysix years of age were declared emperors being thus raised contrary to his inclinations the old man immediately wrote to the senate declaring that he had unwillingly accepted of the empire and would only keep his authority till he had freed it from the tyranny of its present oppressor the senate very joyfully confirmed his election adjudging maximin as an enemy and a traitor to the state the citizens also showed an equal zeal in the cause they flew upon such as were the reputed friends of maximin and tore them in pieces even some who were innocent falling a sacrifice to the multitudes blind rage so great an alteration being made in the city against the interests of maximin the senate were resolved to drive their opposition to the extreme and accordingly made all necessary preparations for their security ordering maximins governors to be displaced and commanding all the provinces to acknowledge gordian for emperor this order was differently received in different parts as people were affected to one or the other party in some provinces the governors were slain in others the messengers of the senate so that all parts of the empire felt the consequences of the civil war  in the mean time when maximin was informed of these charges against him his rage appeared ungovernable he roared like a savage beast and violently struck his head against the wall showing every instance of ungovernable distraction at length his fury being somewhat subsided he called his whole army together and in a set speech exhorted them to revenge his cause giving them the strongest assurances that they should possess the estates of all such as had offended the soldiers unanimously promised to be faithful they received his harangue with their usual acclamations and thus encouraged he led them toward rome breathing nothing but slaughter and revenge however he found many obstacles to his impetuosity and though he desired nothing so much as dispatch his marches were incommodious and slow the tumultuous and disobedient armies of the empire were at present very different from the legions that were led on by a sylla or a caesar they were loaded with baggage and followed by slaves and women rather resembling an eastern caravan than a military batallion to these inconveniences also was added the hatred of the cities through which he passed the inhabitants all abandoning their hopes upon his approach and securing their provisions in proper hiding places however in this complication of inconveniences and misfortunes his affairs began to wear a favorable appearance in africa for capelianus the governor of numidia raised a body of troops in his favor and marched against gordian toward carthage where he fought the younger gordian slew him and destroyed his army his father hearing of the death of his son together with the loss of the battle strangled himself in his own girdle capelianus pursuing his victory entered carthage where he gave a loose to pillage and slaughter under a pretense of revenging the cause of maximin the news of these successes was soon brought to the emperor who now increased his diligence and flattered himself with a speedy opportunity of revenge he led on his large army by hasty journeys into italy threatening destruction to all his opposers and ardently wishing for fresh opportunities of slaughter  nothing could exceed the consternation of the senate upon the news of this defeat they now saw themselves not only deprived of the assistance of gordian and his son on whom they greatly relied but also opposed by two formidable tyrants each commanding a victorious army directly marching toward rome and meditating nothing but vengeance in this afflicting exigence they with great solemnity met at the temple of jupiter and after the most mature deliberation chose pupienus and balbinus emperors conjointly these were men who had acquired the esteem of the public both in war and peace having commanded armies and governed provinces with great reputation and being now appointed to oppose maximin they made what levies they could both in rome and the country with these pupienus marched to stop the progress of the invaders leaving the city to a fresh and unlooked for calamity this was occasioned by two of maximins soldiers who entering the senate house were slain by two senators this quickly gave offense to the body of the praetorian soldiers who instantly resolved to take revenge but were opposed by the citizens so that nothing was seen throughout rome but tumult slaughter and cruelty in this universal confusion the calamity was increased by the soldiers setting the city on fire while the wretched inhabitants were combating each other in the midst of the flames  nevertheless maximin himself in whose favor these seditions were promoted did not seem to be more fortunate upon being informed of the new election of emperors his fury was again renewed and he passed the alps entering italy expecting to refresh his fatigued and famished army in that fertile part of the country but in this he was entirely disappointed the senate had taken such care to remove all kinds of sustenance to fortified places that he still found himself reduced to his former necessities while his army began to murmur for want to this another disappointment was added shortly after for approaching the city of aquileia which he expected to enter without any difficulty he was astonished to find it prepared for the most obstinate resistance and resolved to hold out a regular siege this city was well fortified and populous and the inhabitants greatly averse to maximins government but what added still more to its strength it was commanded by two excellent generals crispinus and menophilus who had so well furnished it with men and ammunition that maximin found no small resistance even in investing the place his first attempt was to take the city by storm but the besieged threw down such quantities of scalding pitch and sulphur upon his soldiers that they were unable to continue the assault he then determined upon a blockade but the inhabitants were so resolute that even the old men and children were seen combating upon the walls while the women cut off their hair to furnish the soldiers with bow strings maximins rage at this unexpected opposition was now ungovernable having no enemy to wreck his resentment upon he turned it against his own commanders he put many of his generals to death as if the city had held out through their neglect or incapacity while famine made great depredations upon the rest of his army nothing now appeared on either side to terminate the contest except the total destruction of either but a mutiny in maximins own army a while rescued the declining empire from destruction and saved the lives of thousands the soldiers being long harrassed by famine and fatigue and hearing of revolts on every side resolved to terminate their calamities by the tyrants death his great strength and his being always armed were at first the principal motives to deter any from assassinating him but at length having made his guards accomplices in their design they set upon him while he slept at noon in his tent and slew both him and his son whom he had made his partner in the empire without any opposition thus died this most remarkable man after an usurpation of about three years and in the sixtyfifth year of his age his assiduity when in humble station and his cruelty when in power serve very well to evince that there are some men whose virtues are fitted for obscurity and others who only show themselves great when placed in an exalted station  chap xxviii pupienus and balbinus making together the twentyseventh emperor of rome   in this ill judged contest the praetorian soldiers who were enemies to both set upon them in their palace at a time their guards were amused with seeing the capitoline games pupienus perceiving their tumultuous approach sent with the utmost speed for assistance from his colleague but he out of a culpable suspicion that something was designed only against himself refused to send such of the german guards as were next his person thus the seditious soldiers found an easy access to both the emperors apartments and dragging them from the palace toward the camp slew them both leaving their dead bodies in the streets as a dreadful instance of their sedition  chap xxix gordian the twentyeighth emperor of rome and to reconcile the soldiers and citizens to each other his learning is said to have been equal to his virtues and we are assured that he had sixtytwo thousand books in his library his respect for misithaeus his governor and instructor was such that he married his daughter and profited by his counsels in all the critical circumstances of his reign  the four first years of this emperors reign were attended with the utmost prosperity but in the fifth he was alarmed with accounts from the east that sapor king of persia had furiously invaded the confines of the roman empire and having taken antioch had pillaged syria and all the adjacent provinces besides the persians the goths also invaded the empire on their side pouring down like an inundation from the north and attempting to fix their residence in the kingdom of thrace to oppose both these invasions gordian prepared an army and having gained some victories over the goths whom he obliged to retire he turned his arms against the persians whom he defeated upon several occasions and forced to return home with disgrace in gaining these advantages misithaeus whom he had made praetorian prefect had the principal share his wisdom directed to success and his courage insured it but he dying soon after as it is supposed being poisoned by philip an arabian who was appointed his successor the fortunes of gordian seemed to die with him the army began to be no longer supplied with provision as usual murmurs were heard to prevail and these were artfully fomented by philip things thus proceeding from bad to worse philip was at first made equal to the command of the empire shortly after invested with the sole power and at length finding himself capable of perpetrating his long meditated cruelty gordian was by his order slain in the twentysecond year of his age after a successful reign of near six years  chap xxx philip the twentyninth emperor of rome son a boy of six years of age as his partner in the empire and in order to secure his power at home made peace with the persians and marched his army toward rome on his way having conceived a desire to visit his native country of arabia he built there a city called philopolis and from thence returning to rome he was received as emperor and treated with all the marks of submission though not of joy perhaps it was to put the people into good humor that he caused the secular games to be celebrated with a magnificence superior to any of his predecessors it being just a thousand years after the building of the city upon occasion of these games we are told that both philip and his son were converted to christianity however this be a murderer and an ungrateful usurper does no great honor to whatever opinion he may happen to embrace we have little account of the latter part of his reign in the wretched and mutilated histories of the times we only learn that the goths renewing their invasions marinus philips lieutenant who was sent against them revolted and caused himself to be declared emperor this revolt however was but of short duration for the army which had raised him repenting of their rashness deposed him with equal levity and put him to death decius was the person whom philip appointed to command in the room of the revolting general the chief merit of decius with the emperor was that when marinus had rebelled he averred in the senate that the traitors presumption would be very shortly his ruin which when it happened accordingly philip appointed him to succeed in the command of the rebellious army decius who was a man of great subtlety being thus entrusted with so much power upon arriving at the army found that the soldiers were resolved on investing him with the supreme authority he therefore seemed to suffer their importunities as if through constraint and in the mean time sent philip word that he had unwillingly assumed the title of emperor the better to secure it for the rightful possessor adding that he only looked for a convenient opportunity of giving up his pretensions and title together philip however knew mankind too well to rely upon such professions he therefore got together what forces he could from the several provinces and led them forward toward the confines of italy however the army was scarce arrived at verona when it revolted in favor of decius and setting violently upon philip a sentinel with one blow cut off his head or rather cleaved it asunder separating the under jaw from the upper  such was the deserved death of philip in the fortyfifth year of his age after a reign of about five years decius being universally acknowledged as his successor  chap xxxi decius the thirtieth emperor of rome   but no virtues could now prevent the approaching downfall of the state the obstinate disputes between the pagans and the christians within the empire and the unceasing irruptions of barbarous nations from without enfeebled it beyond the power of a remedy to stop these a persecution of the christians who were now grown the most numerous body of the people was impolitickly not to say unjustly begun in which thousands were put to death and all the arts of cruelty tried in vain to lessen their growing numbers  this persecution was succeeded by dreadful devastations from the goths particularly in thrace and mesia where they had been most successful these irruptions decius went to oppose in person and coming to an engagement with them slew thirty thousand of these barbarians in one battle however being resolved to pursue his victory he was by the treachery of gallus his own general led into a defile where the king of the goths had secret information to attack him in this disadvantageous situation decius first saw his son killed with an arrow and soon after his whole army totally put to the route wherefore resolving not to survive his loss he put spurs to his horse and instantly plunging into a quagmire was swallowed up and his body could never be found after he died in the fiftieth year of his age after a short reign of two years and six months leaving the character of an exellent prince and one capable of averting the destruction of the empire if human means could affect it  chap xxxii gallus the thirtyfirst emperor of rome   nothing can be more deplorable than the state of the roman provinces at this time the goths and other barbarous nations not satisfied with their late bribes to continue in peace broke down like a torrent upon the eastern parts of europe on the other side the persians and scythians committed unheard of ravages in messopotamia and syria the emperor regardless of every national calamity was lost in debauch and sensuality at home and the pagans were allowed a power of persecuting the christians through all parts of the state these calamities were succeeded by a pestilence from heaven that seemed to have in general spread over every part of the earth and which continued raging for several years in an unheard of manner and all these by a civil war which followed shortly after between gallus and his general aemilianus who having gained a victory over the goths was proclaimed emperor by his conquering army gallus hearing this soon roused from the intoxications of pleasure and prepared to oppose his dangerous rival both armies met in mesia and a battle ensued in which aemilianus was victorious and gallus with his son were slain his death was merited and his vices were such as to deserve the detestation of posterity he died in the fortyseventh year of his age after an unhappy reign of two years and four months in which the empire suffered inexpressible calamities  chap xxxiii valerian the thirtysecond emperor of rome   valerian being thus universally acknowledged as emperor although arrived at the age of seventy set about reforming the state with a spirit that seemed to mark a good mind and unabated vigor but reformation was then grown almost impracticable the disputes between the pagans and christians divided the empires as before and a dreadful persecution of the latter ensued the northern nations overrun the roman dominions in a more formidable manner than ever and the empire began to be usurped by a multitude of petty leaders each of whom neglecting the general interests of the state set up for himself to add to these calamities the persians under their king sapor invaded syria and coming into mesopotamia took the unfortunate valerian prisoner as he was making preparations to oppose them nothing can exceed the indignities as well as the cruelties which were practiced upon this unhappy monarch thus fallen into the hands of his enemies sapor we are told always used him as a footstool for mounting his horse he added the bitterness of ridicule to his insults and usually observed that an attitude like that to which valerian was reduced was the best statue that could be erected in honor of his victory this horrid life of insult and sufferance continued for seven years and was at length terminated by the cruel persians commanding his prisoners eyes to be plucked out and afterward causing him to be flead alive  chap xxxiv galienus the thirtythird emperor of rome provinces or the calamities of the state he usually answered with a jest so that his total inattention gave rise to a number of rebellions that divided the empire into a multitude of independent sovereignties  it was at this time that no less than thirty pretenders were seen contending with each other for the dominion of the state and adding the calamities of civilwar to the rest of the misfortunes of this devoted empire these are generally known in history by the name of the thirty tyrants historians are divided as to their number names and pretensions it only appears in the ill digested accounts of these times that they were not at all cotemporary but succeeded each other whenever they found an opportunity of asserting their pretensions it will be needless to dilate upon accounts and characters that have nothing very remarkable to keep them from oblivion the names of these short lived pretenders will suffice in the east macrianus and his two sons iii valens iv piso v in illyricum aureolus vi in palmyra oedenatus vii balista ix maeonias x zenobia and her two sons xiii in egypt aemilian xiv in africa celsus xv in pannonia regillianus xvi ingenuus xvii censorinus xviii trebellianus xix in gaul posthumus xx victorinus xxi posthumus junior xxii lollianus xxiii victoria xxiv victorinus junior xxv tetrius xxvi tetrius junior xxvii cyriades xxviii saturninus xxix marius xxx  it may be easily supposed that a state harrassed by such a number of opposing interests and inimical armies was in the most dreadful situation and accordingly we find through all parts of the empire nothing but rapine murder and desolation the government like a mighty ruin dropping by piecemeal on the heads of those it was originally raised to protect and threatening every moment universal destruction in this general calamity galienus though at first seemingly insensible was at length obliged for his own private secucurity to take the field and led an army to besiege the city of milan which had been taken by one of the thirty usurping tyrants it was there he was slain by his own soldiers martian one of his generals having conspired against him  chap xxxv claudius the thirtysecond emperor of rome   we are not sufficiently assured of this emperors lineage and country some affirm that he was born in dalmatia and descended from an ancient family there others assert that he was a trojan and others still that he was son to the emperor gordian but whatever might have been his descent his merits were by no means doubtful he was a man of great valor and conduct having performed the most excellent services against the goths who had long continued to make their irruptions into the empire he was now about fiftyfive years old equally remarkable for the strength of his body and the vigor of his mind he was chaste and temperate a rewarder of the good and a severe punisher of such as transgressed the laws thus endowed therefore he in some measure put a stop to the precipitate decline of the empire and once more seemed to restore the glory of rome  his first success upon being made emperor was against aureolus an usurper of the empire whom he defeated near milan his next expedition was to oppose the goths against whom he had a very numerous army these barbarians had made their principal and most successful irruptions into thrace and macedonia swarmed over all greece and had pillaged the famous city of athens which had long been the school of all the polite arts to the romans the goths however had no veneration for these embellishments that tend to soften and humanize the mind but destroyed all monuments of taste and learning with the most savage alacrity it was upon one of these occasions that having heaped together a large pile of books in order to burn them one of their commanders disuaded them from the design alleging that the time which the grecians should waste on books would only render them more unqualified for war but the empire seemed to tremble not only on that side but almost on every quarter at the same time above three hundred thousand of these barbarians the herulies the trutangi the virturgi and many nameless and uncivilizd nations came down the river danube with two thousand ships fraught with men and ammunition spreading terror and devastation on every side  in this state of universal dismay claudius alone seemed to continue unshaken he marched his disproportioned army against the savage invaders and though but ill prepared for such an engagement as the forces of the empire were then employed in different parts of the world he came off victorious and made an incredible slaughter of the enemy the whole of their great army was either cut to pieces or taken prisoners houses were filled with their arms and scarce a province of the empire that was not furnished with slaves from those that survived the defeat  these successes were followed by many others in different parts of the empire so that the goths for a considerable time after made but a feeble opposition  he some time after marched against the revolted germans and overthrew them with considerable slaughter his last expedition was to oppose tetricus and zenobia his two puissant rivals in the empire but on his march as he approached near the city sirmium in dannonia he was seized with a pestilential fever of which he died in a few days to the great regret of his subjects and the irreparable loss of the roman empire his reign which was not quite two years continuance was active and succesful and such is the character given of him by historians that he is said to have united in himself the moderation of augustus the valor of trajan and the piety of antoninus  chap xxxvi aurelian the thirtyfifth emperor of rome instigated him to declare for the throne he chose to prevent the severity of his rival by a voluntary death and causing his veins to be opened expired after having reigned but seventeen days  aurelian being thus universally acknowleged by all the states of the empire assumed the command with a greater share of power than his predecessors had enjoyed for some time before this active monarch was born of mean and obscure parentage in dacia and was about fiftyfive years old at the time of his coming to the throne he had spent the early part of his life in the army and had risen through all the gradations of military duty he was of unshaken courage and amazing strength he in one single engagement killed forty of the enemy with his own hand and above nine hundred at several different times in short his valor and expedition were such that he was compared to julius caesar and in fact only wanted mildness and clemency to be every way his equal  the whole of this enterprizing monarchs reign was spent in repressing the irruptions of the northern nations in humbling every other pretender to the empire and punishing the monstrous irregularities of his own subjects he defeated the morcomanni a fierce and terrible nation of germany that had invaded italy in three several engagements and at length totally destroyed their whole army he was not less successful against zenobia the queen of the east a woman of the most heroic qualifications who had long disclaimed the roman power and established an empire of her own to oppose this extraordinary woman aurelian passed his army over into asia and suppressing all the obstructions that were opposed against him he at length sat down before tyana a city of capadocia which seemed resolved to hold out against him and actually for some time stopped his progress the unexpected obstinacy of the besieged served not a little to enrage the emperor who was naturally precipitate and furious he vowed that upon taking the city he would so punish the inhabitants as not to leave a dog alive among them after some time the city was taken and when his whole army expected the plunder of so wealthy a place and put him in mind of his former protestations he restrained their impetuosity and only ordered all the dogs in the place to be destroyed he afterward pretended that he was restrained from satiating his resentment on the inhabitants by an apparition of the famous appollonius that warned him not to destroy his birthplace this excuse was no doubt fictitious but we can easily pardon falsehood when it is brought to the assistance of humanity  from tyana he marched to meet the enemy who waited his approach near the city of emesa in syria both armies were very powerful and numerous the one trained up under the most valiant leader of his time the other led on by a woman that seemed born to control the pride of man the battle was long and obstinate victory at one time leaned to the side of the asiatics but the perseverance of aurelians generals at last carried the day the enemy were defeated and zenobia was obliged to fly to palmyra for safety but she was soon pursued thither by the conqueror who did all in his power to induce her to submission but the haughty queen refused his proferred terms of life and security with scorn relying on the succors which she expected from the persians the saracens and the armenians however aurelians diligence surmounted every obstacle he intercepted the persian auxiliaries and dispersed them the saracens shared the same fate and the armenians were by plausible promises led over to espouse his interest thus zenobia deceived in her succor and despairing of relief attempted to fly into persia but was taken by a chosen body of horse sent to pursue her the city of palmyra likewise submitted to the conqueror and longinus the celebrated critic and secretary to the queen was by aurelians order put to death zenobia was reserved to grace his triumph and was afterward allotted such lands and such an income as served to maintain her in almost her former splendour  aurelian having thus brought back peace to the empire endeavored by the rigours of justice to bring back virtue also he was very strict in punishing the crimes of the soldiery and in his orders to his lieutenants insisted that the peasants should not be plundered upon any pretenses that not even a grape a grain of salt or a drop of oil should be exacted unjustly  he caused a soldier who had committed adultery with his hostess to have his feet tied to the tops of two trees forcibly bent at top to meet each other which being let loose and suddenly recoiling tore the criminal in two this was a severity that might take the name of cruelty but the vices of the time in some measure required it in these punishments inflicted on the guilty the christians who had all along been growing more numerous were sharers against these he drew up several letters and edicts which showed that he intended a very severe persecution but if we may believe the credulous historians of the times he was deterred just as he was going to sign them by a thunderbolt which fell so near his person that all people judged him to be destroyed  but however heaven might have interposed on this occasion it is certain that his severities at last were the cause of his destruction menesthus his principal secretary having been threatened by him for some fault which he had committed began to consider how he might prevent the meditated blow for this purpose he forged a roll of the names of several persons whom he pretended the emperor had marked out for death adding his own to strengthen him in the confidence of the party the scrole thus contrived was shown with an air of the utmost secresy to some of the persons concerned and they to procure their safety immediately agreed with him to destroy the emperor this resolution was soon put into execution for as the emperor passed with a small guard from uraclea in thrace toward byrantum the conspirators set upon him at once and slew him with very small resistance he was slain in the sixtieth or as some say the sixtythird year of his age after a very active reign of almost five years  chap xxxvii tacitus the thirtysixth emperor of rome   one of the first acts of his government was in the punishment of those who had conspired against the late emperor particularly menstheus who was impailed alive his body being thrown to be devoured by wild beasts his estate also was confiscated to the exchequer and his readymoney which was considerable applied toward paying the army during this short reign the senate seemed to have a large share of authority and the historians of the times are one and all liberal of their praises to such emperors as were thus willing to divide their power upon endeavoring to obtain the consulship for his brother probus he was refused it by the senate at which he seemed no way moved but calmly remarked that the senate best knew whom to choose this moderation prevailed in all the rest of his conduct he was extremely temperate his table was plain and furnished with nothing expensive he even prohibited his empress from wearing jewels and forbade the use of gold and embroidery he was fond of learning and the memory of such men as had deserved well of their country particularly the works of his namesake tacitus the historian were greatly honored by him commanding that they should be placed in every public library throughout the empire and many copies of them should be transcribed at the public charge  a reign begun with such moderation and justice only wanted continuance to have made the empire happy but after enjoying the empire about six months he died of a fever in his march to oppose the persians and scythians who had invaded the eastern parts of the empire  chap xxxviii probus the thirtyseventh emperor of rome upon the death of tacitus the army seemed divided in the choice of an emperor one part of it chose florian brother to the deceased but the majority were for some time undetermined they alleged amongst each other the necessity of choosing one eminent for valor honesty piety clemency and probity but the last virtue being that chiefly insisted upon the whole army as if by common consent cried out that probus should be emperor he was accordingly confirmed in this dignity with all the usual solemnities and florian his opponent finding himself deserted even by those legions who had promised to stand up in his support opened his arteries and bled himself to death  probus was fortyfour years old when he ascended the throne being born of noble parentage at sirmium in pannonia and bred up a soldier from his youth he began early to distinguish himself for his discipline and valor being frequently the first man that in besieging towns scaled the walls or that burst into the enemys camp nor was he less remarkable for single combats and saving the lives of many eminent citizens nor were his activity and courage when elected to the empire less apparent than in his private station every year now produced only new calamities to the empire and fresh irruptions on every side threatened universal desolation perhaps no other abilities but those of probus were capable of opposing these united invasions he flew with an army to repress the germans in gaul of whom he slew four hundred thousand he then marched into dalmatia to oppose and subdue the sarmatians from thence he led his forces into thrace and forced the goths to sue for peace he after that turned his arms toward asia subdued the province of isauria and marching onward conquered a people called the blemii who leaving their native forests of aethiopia had possessed themselves of arabia and judea narsius also the king of persia submitted at his approach and upon his return into europe he divided the depopulated parts of thrace among its barbarous invaders a circumstance that afterward produced great calamities to the empire  his diligence was not less conspicuous in suppressing intestine commotions saturnius being compelled by the egyptains to declare himself emperor was defeated and slain proculus also a person remarkable only for his great attachment to women and who boasted in a letter that having taken an hundred sarmatian virgins prisoners he deprived ten of that name in one night and all the rest within a fortnight set up against the emperor but was compelled to fly and at length delivered up by the germans at the same time bonolus who was as remarkable a votary to bacchus being able to drink as much wine as ten could do without being disordered rebelled and being overcome hanged himself in despair probus when he saw him immediately after his death could not avoid pointing to him and saying there hangs not a man but a bottle still however notwithstanding every effort to give quiet to the empire the barbarians who surrounded it kept it in continual alarms they were frequently repulsed into their native wilds but they as certainly returned with fresh rage and increased ferocity the goths and vandals finding him engaged in quelling domestic disputes renewed their accustomed inroads and once more felt the punishment of their presumption they were conquered in several engagements and probus returned in triumph to rome his active temper however would not suffer him to continue at rest while any of the enemy were left to conquer in his last expedition he led his soldiers against the persians and going through sirmium the place of his nativity he there set several thousands of his soldiers upon draining a fen that was incommodious to the inhabitants the fatigues of this undertaking and the great restraint that was laid upon the soldiers licentious manners produced a conspiracy which ended in his ruin for taking the opportunity as he was marching into greece they set upon and slew him after he had reigned six years and four months with general approbation as an instance of the esteem which even his rebellious army had for him they erected him a sumptuous monument with this epitaph here lies the emperor probus truly deserving the name a subduer of barbarians and a conqueror of usurpers  chap xxxix carus and his two sons carinus and numerian making together the thirtyeighth emperor of rome the very walls of ctesiphon and a dreadful battle ensuing he once more gained a complete victory what the result of this success might have been is not known for he was shortly after struck dead by lightning in his tent with many others that were round him  numerian the youngest son who accompanied his father in this expedition was inconsoleable for his death and brought such a disorder upon his eyes with weeping that he was obliged to be carried along with the army shut up in a close litter the peculiarity of his situation after some time excited the ambition of asper his fatherinlaw who supposed that he could now without any great danger aim at the empire himself he therefore hired a mercinary villian to murder the emperor in his litter and the better to conceal the fact gave out that he was still alive but unable to endure the light in this manner was the dead body carried about for some days asper continuing to attend it with the utmost apperance of respect and to take orders as usual the offensiveness however of its smell at length discovered the treachery and excited an universal uproar throughout the whole army in the midst of this tumult dioclesian one of the most noted commanders of his time was chosen emperor and with his own hand slew asper having thus as it is said fulfilled a prophecy which had said that dioclesian should be emperor after he had slain a boor  carinus the remaining son did not long survive his father and brother for giving himself up to his vices and yet at the same time opposing the newmade emperor the competitors led their forces into maesia where dioclesian being victorious carinus was slain by a tribune of his own army whose wife he had formerly abused  chap xl dioclesian the thirtyninth emperor of rome had formed in his favor he pardoned all his enemies that had joined with corinus without injuring either their fortunes or honors conscious also that the weight of empire was too heavy for one alone to sustain he took in maximian his general as a partner in the fatigues of duty making him his equal and companion on the throne thus mutually assisting each other these two continued to live in strict friendship and though somewhat differing in temper as maximian was rather a man of vicious inclinations yet they concurred in promoting the general good and humbling their enemies and it must be observed that there never was a period in which there were more numerous or formidable enemies to oppose  the peasants and laborers in gaul made a dangerous insurrection under the conduct of amandus and helianus but were subdued by maximian achilleus who commanded in egypt proclaimed himself emperor and it was not without many bloody engagements that he was overcome and condemned by dioclesian to be devoured by lions in africa the roman legions in like manner joined with many of the natives seized upon the public revenues and plundered those who continued in their duty these were also subdued by maximian and after a long dubious war constrained to sue for peace about the same time a principal commander in britain named carausius proclaimed himself emperor and possessed himself of the island to oppose this generals claims maximian made choice of constantius chlorus whom he created caesar and married to theodora his daughterinlaw he upon his arrival in britain finding carausius extremely polite and continually reinforced from germany thought proper to come to an accommodation so that this usurper continued for seven years in quiet possession of the whole island till he was slain by alectus his friend and intimate about this time also narseus king of persia and parthia began a dangerous war upon the empire and invaded mesopotamia to stop the progress of the enemy upon this quarter dioclesian made choice of galerius surnamed armentarius from the report of his being born of a cowherd in dacia and he likewise was created caesar his success also though very doubtful in the beginning was in the end terminated according to his wishes the persians were overcome in a decisive engagement their camp plundered and taken and the kings wives and children made prisoners of war there only remained of all the enemies of the roman empire those that lay to the northward unsubdued these were utterly unconquerable as well upon the account of their savage fierceness as the inhospitable severity of the climate and soil from whence they issued ever at war with the romans they issued forth when the armies that were to repress their invasions were called away and upon their return they as suddenly withdrew into cold barren and inaccessible places which only themselves could endure in this manner the scythians goths sarmatians alani carsii and quadi poured down in incredible numbers while every defeat seemed but to increase their strength and perseverance of these multitudes were taken prisoners and sent to people the more southern parts of the empire still greater numbers were destroyed and though the rest were driven back to their native forests yet they continued ever mindful of their inveterate enmity and like a savage beast only continued inactive till they had licked their wounds for a new encounter  during this interval as if the external miseries of the empire were not sufficient the tenth and last great persecution was renewed against the christians this is said to have exceeded all the former in severity and such was the zeal with which it was pursued that in an ancient inscription we are informed that they had effaced the name and superstition of the christians and had restored and propagated the worship of the gods their attempts however were but the malicious efforts of an expiring party for christianity shortly after was established by law and triumphed over the malice of all it is enemies in the midst of the troubles raised by this persecution and of the contests that struck at the external parts of the state dioclesian and maximian surprised the world by resigning their dignities on the same day and both retiring into private stations historians are much divided concerning the motives that thus induced them to give up those honors which they had purchased with so much danger some ascribe it to the philosophical turn of dioclesian and others to his being disgusted with the obstinacy of his christian subjects but lactantius asserts that he was compelled to it together with his partner by galerius who coming to nicomedia upon the emperors recovery from a great sickness threatened him with a civil war in case he refused to resign however this we are well assured that he still preserved a dignity of sentiment in his retirement that might induce us to believe he had no other motive for resignation having retired to his birthplace he spent his time in cultivating his garden assuring his visitors that then only he began to enjoy the world when he was thought by the rest of mankind to sorsake it when also some attempted to persuade him to resume the empire he replied that if they knew his present happiness they would rather endeavor to imitate than disturb it in this contented manner he lived some time and at last died either by poison or madness it is uncertain which his reign which continued twenty years was active and useful and his authority tinctured with severity was well adapted to the depraved state of morals at that time  maximian his partner in the empire and in resignation was by no means so contented with his situation he longed once more for power and disturbed the two succeeding reigns with various efforts to resume it attempting to engage dioclesian in the same design being obliged to leave rome where he had bred great confusion he went over into gaul where he was kindly received by constantine the then acknowledged emperor of the west but here also continuing his intrigues and endeavoring to force his own daughter and destroy her husband he was detected and condemned to die by whatever death he should think proper and lactantius tells us that he chose hanging  chap xli constantius and galerius making together the fortieth emperor of rome the conducting of affairs so that the empire now was under the guidance of four persons all invested with supreme authority  we are informed of but few particulars of the reign of constantius except a detail of his character which appears in every light most amiable he was frugal chaste and temperate being one day reproached by dioclesians ambassadors for his poverty he only intimated his wants to the people and in a few hours the sums presented him amazed the beholders and exceeded their highest expectations learn from hence said he then to the ambassadors that the love of the people is the richest treasure and that a princes wealth is never so safe as when his people are the guardians of it his mercy and justice were equally conspicuous in his treatment of the christians whom he would not suffer to be injured and when at length persuaded to displace all the christian officers of his household that would not change their religion when some of them complied he sent them away in disgrace alleging that those who were not true to their god would never be faithful to their prince  in the second year of his reign he went over into britain and leaving his son constantine as a kind of hostage in the court of his partner in the empire took up his residence at york he there continued in the practice of his usual virtues till falling sick he began to think of appointing his son for his successor he accordingly sent for him with all speed but he was past recovery before his arrival notwithstanding he received him with marks of the utmost affection and raising himself in his bed gave him several useful instructions particularly recommending the christians to his care he then bequeathed the empire to his care and crying out that none but the pious constantine should succeed him he expired in his arms  in the mean time galerius his partner in the empire being informed of constantines advancement testified the most ungovernable rage and was even going to condemn the messenger who brought him the account but being dissuaded he seemed to acquiesce in what he could not prevent and sent him the marks of royalty but at the same time declared severus emperor in opposition to his interests  just about this time also another pretender to the empire started up this was maxentius a person of mean extraction but very much favored by the soldiers whom he permitted to pillage at discretion thus there were several interests at the same time in opposition to each other and all conspiring each others downfall  in order to oppose maxentius severus led a numerous army toward the gates of rome but his soldiers considering against whom they were to fight immediately abandoned him and shortly after he put an end to his own life by opening his veins  to revenge his death galerius marched into italy resolving to ruin the inhabitants and to destroy the whole senate his soldiers however upon their approaching the capital began to waver in their resolutions wherefore he was obliged to have recourse to entreaties imploring them not to abandon him and retiring by the same route by which he had advanced made licinius who was originally the son of a poor labourer in dacia caesar in the room of severus who was slain this seemed to be the last act of his power for shortly after he was seized with a very extraordinary disorder in his privities which baffled all the skill of his physicians and carried him off after he had languished in torments for near the space of a year  his cruelty to the christians was one of the many crimes alleged against him and their historians have not failed to aggravate the circumstances of his death as a judgment from heaven for his former impiety however this be he abated much of his severities against them on his deathbed and revoked those edicts which he had formerly published tending to their persecution a little before his death  chap xlii constantine the great the fortyfirst emperor of rome   whether the empire was by this time sick of it is intestine divisions or whether each of it is commanders was content with his share is not material to enquire but for a time all things seemed to wear a peaceful appearance till at length either ambition or the tyrannical conduct of maxentius induced constantine to engage in an expedition to expel that commander from rome and to make the proper preparations for marching into italy it was upon this occasion that he formed a resolution which produced a mighty change in the politics as well as the morals of mankind and gave a new turn to the councils of the wise and the pursuits of ambition one evening as we are told by eusebius the army being upon it is march toward rome constantine was taken up with various considerations upon the fate of sublunary things and the dangers of his approaching expedition sensible of his own incapacity to succeed without divine assistance he employed his meditations upon the opinions that then were chiefly agitated among mankind and sent up his ejaculations to heaven to inspire him with wisdom to choose the path to pursue it was then as the sun was declining that there suddenly appeared a pillar of light in the heavens in the fashion of a cross with this inscription toyto nika in this overcome so extraordinary an appearance did not fail to create astonishment both in the emperor and his whole army who considered it as their various dispositions led them to believe those who were attached to paganism prompted by their auspices pronounced it to be a most inauspicious omen portending the most unfortunate events but it made a different impression on the emperors mind who as the account goes was further encouraged by visions the same night he therefore the day following caused a royal standard to be made like that which he had seen in the heavens and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars as an ensign of victory and celestial protection after this he consulted with several of the principal teachers of christianity and made a public avowal of that sacred persuasion  constantine having thus attached his soldiers to his interest who were mostly of the christian persuasion lost no time in entering italy with ninety thousand foot and eight thousand horse and soon advanced almost to the very gates of rome the unfortunate maxentius who had long given himself up to ease and debauchery now began to make preparations when it was too late he first put in practice all the superstitious rites which paganism taught to be necessary and then consulted the sybiline books from whence he was informed that on that great day the enemy of rome should perish this prediction which was equivocal he applied to constantine wherefore leaving all things in the best posture he advanced from the city with an army of an hundred and seventy thousand foot and eighteen thousand horse the engagement was for some time fierce and bloody till his cavalry being routed victory declared upon the side of his opponent and he himself was drowned in his flight by the breaking down of a bridge as he attempted to cross the river tyber  constantine in consequence of this victory entering the city disclaimed all praises which the senate and people were ready to offer ascribing his success to a superior power he even caused the cross which he was said to have seen in the heavens to be placed at the right of all his statues with this inscription that under the influence of that victorious cross constantine had delivered the city from the yoke of tyrannical power and had restored the senate and people of rome to their ancient authority he afterward ordained that no criminal should for the future suffer death by the cross which had formerly been the most usual way of punishing slaves convicted of capital offenses edicts were soon after issued declaring that the christians should be eased from all their grievances and received into places of trust and authority thus the new religion was seen at once to prevail over the whole roman empire and as that enormous fabric had been built and guided upon pagan principles it lost a great deal of its strength and coherence when those principles were thus at once subverted  things continued in this state for some time constantine all the while contributing what was in his power to the interest of religion and the revival of learning which had long been upon the decline and was almost wholly extinct in the empire but in the midst of these assiduities the peace of the empire was again disturbed by the preparations of maximin who governed in the east and who desirous of a full participation of power marched against licomius with a very numerous army in consequence of this step after many conflicts a general engagement ensued in which maximin suffered a total defeat many of his troops were cut to pieces and those that survived submitted to the conqueror maximin however having escaped the general carnage once more put himself at the head of another army resolving to try the fortune of the field but his death prevented the design as he died by a very extraordinary kind of madness the christians of whom he was the declared enemy did not fail to ascribe his end to a judgment from heaven but this was the age in which false judgments and false miracles made up the bulk of their uninstructive history  constantine and licinius thus remaining undisputed possessors and partners in the empire all things promised a peaceable continuance of friendship and power however it was soon found that the same ambition that aimed after a part would be content with nothing less than the whole pagan writers ascribe the rupture between these two potentates to constantine while the christians on the other hand impute it wholly to licinius both perhaps might have concurred for licinius is convicted of having persecuted christianity which was so highly favored by his rival and constantine is known to have been the first to begin the preparations for an open rupture both sides exerted all their power to make opposition and at the head of very formidable armies came to an engagement near cybalis in panonia constantine previous to the battle in the midst of his christian bishops begged the assistance of heaven while licinius with equal zeal called upon the pagan priest to intercede with the gods in his favor the success was on the side of truth constantine after an obstinate resistance from the enemy became victorious took their camp and after some time compelled licinius to sue for a truce which was agreed upon but this was of no long continuance for soon after the war breaking out afresh and the rivals coming once more to a general engagement it proved decisive licinius was entirely defeated and pursued by constantine into nicomedia where he surrendered himself up to the victor having first obtained an oath that his life should be spared and that he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his days in retirement this however constantine shortly after broke for either fearing his designs or finding him actually engaged in fresh conspiracies he commanded him to be put to death together with martian his general who some time before had been created caesar  constantine being now sole monarch of the empire without a rival to divide his power or any person from whose claims he could have the least apprehensions resolved to establish christianity on so sure a basis that no new resolutions should shake it he commanded that in all the provinces of the empire the orders of the bishops should be exactly obeyed a privilege of which in succeeding times these fathers made but a very indifferent use he called also a general council of these in order to repress the heresies that had already crept into the church particularly that of arius to this place repaired about three hundred and eighteen bishops besides a multitude of presbyters and deacons together with the emperor himself who all to about seventeen concurred in condemning the tenets of arius who with his associates was banished into a remote part of the empire  having thus restored universal tranquillity to the empire he was not able to ward off the calamities of a more domestic nature as the wretched histories of this period are entirely at variance with each other it is not easy to tell the motives which induced him to put his wife fausta and his son crispus to death the most plausible account is this fausta the empress who was a woman of great beauty but of extravagant desires had long though secretly loved crispus constantines son by a former wife she had tried every art to inspire this youth with a mutual passion and finding her more distant efforts ineffectual had even the confidence to make him an open confession of her desires this produced an explanation which was fatal to both crispus received her addresses with detestation and she to be revenged accused him to the emperor constantine fired at once with jealousy and rage ordered him to die without an hearing nor did his innocence appear till it was too late for redress the only reparation therefore that remained was the putting fausta the wicked instrument of his former cruelty to death which was accordingly executed upon her together with some others who had been accomplices in her falsehood and treachery  but the private misfortunes of a few were not to be weighed against evils of a more general nature which the roman empire shortly after experienced these arose from a measure which this emperor conceived and executed of transferring the seat of the empire from rome to byzantium or constantinople as it was afterward called whatever might have been the reasons which induced him to this undertaking whether it was because he was offended at some affronts he had received at rome or that he supposed constantinople more in the center of the empire or that he thought the eastern parts more required his presence experience has shown that they were weak and groundless the empire had long before been in a most declining state but this in a great measure gave precipitation to its downfall after this it never resumed its former splendour but like a flower transplanted into a foreign clime languished by degrees and at length sunk into nothing  his first design was to build a city which he might make the capital of the world and for this purpose he made choice of a situation at chaledon in asia minor but we are told that in laying out the ground plan an eagle caught up the line and flew with it over to byzantium a city which lay upon the opposite side of the bosphorus here therefore it was thought expedient to fix the seat of the empire and indeed nature seemed to have formed it with all the conveniences and all the beauties which might induce power to make it the seat of residence it was situated on a plain that rose gently from the water it commanded that straight which unites the mediterranean with the euxine sea and was furnished with all the advantages which the most indulgent climate could bestow this city therefore he beautified with the most magnificent edifices he divided it into fourteen regions built a capitol an amphitheatre many churches and other public works and having thus rendered it equal to the magnificence of his idea he dedicated it in a very solemn manner to the god of martyrs in about two years after repairing thither with his whole court  this removal produced no immediate alteration in the government of the empire the inhabitants of rome though with reluctance submitted to the change nor was there for two or three years any disturbance in the state until at length the goths finding that the romans had withdrawn all their garrisons along the danube renewed their inroads and ravaged the country with unheard of cruelty constantine however soon represt their incursions and so straitened them that near an hundred thousand of their number perished by cold and hunger these and some other insurrections being happily suppressed the government of the empire was divided as follows constantine the emperors eldest son commanded in gaul and the western provinces constantius governed afric and illyricum and constans ruled in italy dalmatius the emperors brother was sent to defend those parts that bordered upon the goths and annibalianus his nephew had the charge of cappadocia and armenia minor this division of the empire still farther contributed to its downfall for the united strength of the state being no longer brought to repress invasion the barbarians fought with superior numbers and conquered at last though often defeated constantine however did not live to feel these calamities the latter part of his reign was peaceful and splendid ambassadors from the remotest indies came to acknowledge his authority the persians who were ready for fresh inroads upon finding him prepared to oppose sent humbly to desire his friendship and forgiveness he was above sixty years old and had reigned above thirty when he found his health began to decline to obviate the effects of his disorder which was an intermitting fever he made use of the warm baths of the city but receiving no benefit from thence he removed for change of air to helenopolis a city which he had built to the memory of his mother his disorder increasing he changed again to nicomedia where finding himself without hopes of a recovery he caused himself to be baptized and having soon after received the sacrament he expired after a memorable and active reign of almost thirtytwo years this monarchs character is represented to us in very different lights the christian writers of that time adorning it with every strain of panegyric the heathens on the contrary loading it with all the virulence of invective in fact it seems to be composed of a mixture of virtues and vices of piety and credulity of courage and cruelty of justice and ambition he established a religion that continues the blessing of mankind but pursued a scheme of politics that destroyed the empire  chap xliii of the destruction of the roman empire after the death of constantine and the events which hastened its catastrophe hitherto the characters of the roman emperors have been intimately connected with the history of the state and its rise or decline might have been said to depend on the virtues and vices the wisdom or the indolence of those who governed it but from this dreary period its recovery was become desperate no wisdom could obviate its decadence no courage oppose the evils that surrounded it on every side instead therefore of entering into a minute account of the characters of its succeeding emperors it will at present suffice to take a general survey of this part of the history and rather describe the causes by which the state was brought down to nothing than the persons who neither could hasten nor prevent its decline indeed if we were to enter into a detail concerning the characters of the princes of those times it should be those of the conquerors not the conquered of those gothic chiefs who led a more virtuous and more courageous people to the conquest of nations corrupted by vice and enervated by luxury  these barbarians were at first unknown to the romans and for some time after had been only incommodious to them but they were now become formidable and arose in such numbers that the earth seemed to produce a new race of mankind to complete the empires destruction they had been increasing in their hideous deserts and amidst regions frightful with eternal snews and had long only waited the opportunity of coming down into a more favorable climate against such an enemy no courage could avail nor abilities be successful a victory only cut off numbers without an habitation and a name soon to be succeeded by others equally desperate and obscure  the emperors who had to contend with this people were most of them furnished neither with courage nor conduct to oppose their residence in asia seemed to enervate their manners and produced a desire in them to be adored like the monarchs of the east sunk in softness they showed themselves with less frequency to the soldiers they became more indolent fonder of domestic pleasures and more abstracted from the empire constantius who reigned thirtyeight years was weak timid and unsuccessful governed by his eunuchs and his wives and unfit to prop the falling empire julian his successor surnamed the apostate upon account of his relapsing into paganism was notwithstanding a very good and a very valiant prince he by his wisdom conduct and economy chased the barbarians that had taken fifty towns upon the rhine out of their new settlements and his name was a terror to them during his reign which lasted but two years jovian and valentinian had virtue and strength sufficient to preserve the empire from immediately falling under its enemies no prince saw the necessity of restoring the ancient plan of the empire more than valentinian the former emperors had drained away all the frontier garrisons merely to strengthen their own power at home but his whole life was employed in fortifying the banks of the rhine making levies raising castles placing troops in proper stations and furnishing them with subsistence for their support but an event that no human prudence could forsee brought up a new enemy to assist in the universal destruction  that tract of land which lies between the palus maeotis the mountains of caucasus and the caspian sea was inhabited by a numerous savage people that went by the name of the huns and allanes their soil was fertile and the inhabitants fond of robbery and plunder as they imagined it impracticable to cross the palus maeotis they were altogether unacquainted with the romans so that they remained confined within the limits their ignorance had assigned them while other nations plundered with security it has been the opinion of some that the slime which was rolled down by the current of the tanais had by degrees formed a kind of incrustation on the surface of the cimmaerian bosphorus over which those people are supposed to have passed others relate that two young scythians being in full pursuit of an heifer the terrified creature swam over an arm of the sea and the youths immediately following her found themselves in a new world upon the opposite shore upon their return they did not fail to relate the wonders of strange lands and countries which they had discovered upon this information an innumerable body of huns passed those streights and meeting first with the goths made that people fly before them the goths in consternation presented themselves on the banks of the danube and with a suppliant air entreated the romans to allow them a place of refuge this they easily obtained from valens who assigned them several portions of land in thrace but left them destitute of all needful supplies stimmulated therefore by hunger and resentment they soon after rose against their protectors and in a dreadful engagement fought near adrianople destroyed valens himself and the greatest part of his army  it was in this manner the roman armies grew weaker so that the emperors finding it difficult at last to raise levies in the provinces were obliged to hire one body of barbarians to oppose another this expedient had its use in circumstances of immediate danger but when that was over the romans found it was as difficult to rid themselves of their new allies as of their former enemies thus the empire was not ruined by any particular invasion but sunk gradually under the weight of several attacks made upon it when the barbarians had wasted one province those who succeeded the first spoilers proceeded on to another their devastations were at first limited to thrace mysia and panonia but when these countries were ruined they destroyed macedonia thessaly and greece and from thence they expatiated to noricum the empire was in this manner continually shrinking and italy at last became the frontier  the valor and conduct of theodosius in some measure retarded the destruction that had begun in the times of valens but upon his death the enemy became irresistible a large body of goths had been called in to assist the regular forces of the empire under the command of alaric their king but what was brought in to stop the universal decline proved the most mortal stab to its security this gothic prince who is represented as brave impetuous and enterprizing perceiving the weakness of the state and how little arcadius and honorius the successors of theodosius were able to secure it being instigated also still further by the artifices of one pufinus who had designs upon the throne himself this warlike prince i say putting himself at the head of his barbarous forces declared war against his employers and fought the armies of the empire for some years with various success however in proportion as his troops were cut off he received new supplies from his native forests and at length putting his mighty designs in execution passed the alps and poured down like a torrent among the fruitful valleys of italy this charming region had long been the seat of indolence and sensual delight its fields were now turned into gardens of pleasure that only served to enervate the possessors from having once been a nursery of military strength that furnished soldiers for the conquest of mankind the timid inhabitants therefore beheld with terror a dreadful enemy ravaging in the midst of their country while their wretched emperor honorius who was then in ravenna still only seemed resolved to keep up his dignity and to refuse any accommodation but the inhabitants of rome felt the calamities of the times with double aggravation this great city that had long sat as mistress of the world now saw herself besieged by an army of fierce and terrible barbarians and being crowded with inhabitants it was reduced by the extremities of pestilence and famine to a most deplorable situation in this extremity the senate dispatched their ambassadors to alarick desiring him either to grant them peace upon reasonable terms or to give them leave to fight it with him in the open field to this message however the gothic monarch only replied with a burst of laughter that thick grass was easier cut than thin implying that their troops when cooped up within the narrow compass of the city would be more easily overcome than when drawn out in order of battle when they came to debate about a peace he demanded all their riches and all their slaves when he was asked what then he would leave them he sternly replied their lives these were hard conditions for such a celebrated city to accept but compelled by the necessity of the times they raised an immense treasure both by taxation and by stripping the heathen temples and thus at length bought off their fierce invader but this was but a temporary removal of the calamity for alarick now finding that he might become master of rome whenever he thought proper returned with his army a short time after pressed it more closely than he had done before and at last took it but whether by force or stratagem is not agreed among  but the gothic conquerors of the west though they had suffered rome to survive its first capture now found how easy it was to become masters of it upon any other occasion the extent of its walls had in fact made it almost impracticable for the inhabitants to defend them and as it was situated in a plain it might be stormed without much difficulty besides this no succors were to be expected from without for the number of the people was so extremely diminished that the emperors were obliged to retire to ravenna a place so fortified by nature that they could be safe without the assistance of an army what alaric therefore spared gesneric king of the vandals not long after contributed to destroy his merciless soldiers for fourteen days together raged with implacable fury in the midst of that venerable place neither private dwellings nor public buildings neither sex nor age nor religion were the least protection against their lust or avarice  the capital of the empire being thus ransacked several times and italy overrun by barbarous invaders under various denominations from the remotest skirts of europe the western emperors for some time continued to hold the title without the power of royalty honorius lived till he saw himself stripped of the greatest part of his dominions his capital taken by the goths the huns seized of panonia the alans suevi and vandals established in spain and the burgundians settled in gaul where the goths also fixed themselves at last after some time the inhabitants of rome also being abandoned by the princes feebly attempted to take the supreme power into their own hands armorica and britain seeing themselves forsaken began to regulate themselves by their own laws thus the power was entirely broken and those who assumed the title only encountered certain destruction at length even the very name of emperor of the west expired upon the abdication of augustus and odoacer general of the heruli assumed the title of king of all italy such was the end of this great empire that had conquered the world with its arms and instructed them with its wisdom that had risen by temperance and fell by luxury that had been established by a spirit of patriotism and that fell into ruin when the empire was become so extensive that a roman citizen was but an empty name its final
