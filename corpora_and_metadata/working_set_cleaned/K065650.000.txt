a week at a cottage a pastoral tale  gent antiq    london printed for hawes clarke and collins in paternoster row  mdcclxxv  sunday opens the scene for ever sacred to tranquillity  sweet rural scenes where contemplation sits and meditates on gods benevolence  retirement plaud the poets peaceful seat with hands of grave humility forbidding ostentations steps prides arrogance or fickle taste to tread her hallowed bounds  hither  o hither come sweet social science leading on contentment with countenance serene  here hand in hand let meditation walk with grave morality  whilst ignorance with contumelious look averts her rustic foot and tells an awkward tale to envy and her sister fiends who minister in her unlettered reign  the varied scene of human life at once displays on this hand all the anxious grandeur of the great on that sad indigences tears from whence reflection turns with a sigh and by her just comparisons disposes all my mind to gratitude    hail mediocrity thou blessed estate depart not from thy happy votary  seated on the center of pleasures wheel safe from ambitions giddy flights and povertys depression thou ensures me peace  for this retreat i leave the busy town where traffic with a brow beset with cares and shoulders bending to the burden walks adventures restless mazes and her labyrinths of hope  on whose hard indefatigable heel full often sullen disappointment treads whilst from her meagre visage she rubs the sickly sweat with rags disconsolate  or if attended by some better fate perchance comes sportive luck in steps fantastic and with prosperity rewards the toils of trade relieves industrys soul of doubtfulness yet teints the jaundicd eye with avarice and gives another countenance to care  away away attention hither haste to rove the sylvan scene the plain the valley and the grove leave the dull haunts of mercenary men and gains insatiable gaze to court the smiles of rural innocence and catch the living virtues as they rise  peruse the flowery page of natures book and reaping wisdom with the arms of scientific pleasure soar aloft and breath thy adoration to the god of all  there stands the cott where fancy strays a week and gathers up the beauties of the scene  on elevated ground erected it commands extensive prospects stretching every way placed on the skirts of a small village where lofty sycamores with spreading boughs dispense their shade around its tenements  beneath the leafy covert often at ease the peasant fits sagacious musing on the evening clouds as weatherwise  there the rustic damsel loitring in the dayfall gloom communes with telltale intimates describing love so natural and naked that each fond confidant with sympathetic sighs salutes the well discovered passion whilst each stands wishing panting and on fire  there too at seasons sits the matron of the village whose wrinkled brow confesses age but yet denies severity for as she bends her weakened sight upon the polished needles whilst she knits she courts facetious prattle from the babes who pull the pansies on the green and smiles to hear them lisp their grannys tale and imitate her prayer  surrounded with a shadowy grove the ruins of an abbey lift their solemn fronts and show their bending arches  in the distracted pomp of wasting columns totring walls and gasping windows all the havoc of infatuated zeal stands uncharacterized whilst in widowweeds of mantling ivy sage religion sits and mourns the desolation of her house and the sad sins of her degenerate sons  there the groves of r  k  by stretching round her park oertop the wall  sweet scenes of rural ease and elegance  where g  a flying from the heathy mountains precipitates her streams from rock to rock till in the bosom of exulting t  s the river nymph resigns her auburn tresses and nutbrown charms in murmurs o soft extacy and love  high hanging woods repeat the sounds mixed with the plaintive voice of amorous doves who coo their tale of jealousy for every absent mate    here nature with dignity sublime excells the works of art and forms a solemn walk where massive rocks with august columns prop the oaken grove that hangs upon their towering cliffs  the far projecting trees spread wide their boughs and give a leafy canopy umbriferous forming a scene when where wisdom would delight to contemplate where meditation met with piety would hold their holy converse and sage philosophy would sit unseen to study nature  once made the haunt of sad dissatisfactions gloomy steps where melancholy measured out her pensively reiterated walk  there unredeeming r  k  by often strayed to meditate on the forlorn fate of his paternal lands  there too projecting r  b  n has sat to see his sweet demesnes from his unfeeling genius transformed to stone to plan the proud devouring edifice which swallowed up these fertile fields and all this paradise  now m  tt is thy lord whose elegance of taste is with the zone of prudence girt and whose provident sagacity engrafts descretion on his pleasures  near to thy streams o g  a once the prefect lay of famed solences and the plain was burdened with a roman host  often in thy waters have the heroes laved their valarous limbs and often along thy channel strayed delighted with fertility  here too the altar blazed to festive ceres and the grove resounded with the rights of pan    to them another host succeeded usurped their lustrals and their altars and pitched their tent on m  r  ns plains to foster foreign piety in these rich lands  the fair exotic asked for happy vales where nature lavished her luxuriancy the mountain and the rock where in the days of yore the sage had sought the presence of his god the gloomy forest and the dark damp cave were not befitted to her soft italian constitution  too long my pen dwells on thy scenes or  k  by whilst other objects wait my muse  where t  pe in rural opulence surmounts the hill and to the eastern sun extends its golden meads    beneath whose feet deep in the silent and sequestered dale a friend to science lives a lettered sage devoted to tranquillity and sacred truth where pious w  k  ff once conversed with god  wide spreading groves and deep embowring shades wrap up in solemn stillness t  ls mansion  where the discontented genius of the glades sits sighing for the absence of her lord who from her haunts estranges science and philosophy the muses and the graces and carries them as captives far from his long deserted lands  those lines of dusky pines which mark d  n  s rich demesnes shut up the prospect  there through an arch of boughs the elevated fane of k  y strikes the eye and gives its sacred tower to form a noble distant obelisk    and here the woody banks of brgm are bent up to the mountains brow where m  k still inherits the patrician virtues and marks the ways of life with such benevolence as purchased for his ancestors immortal love    still nearer lie the lands of e  n where cultivation with a comely countenance sits smiling in its youth and makes abashed the neighboring hills where nature sleeps in native russet wrapped in indolence and barrenness  where h  e forlorn creeps from the gloomy mountains side and hides its claybuilt cottages  from whence a winding way is marked aloft ascending to the summit of the steep conducting to the golden regions and the mines of patriotic t  r and paternal s  whose knees benevolent are crowded with his childrens children  the southern prospect calls for my attention    the nearest object is the town of b  where on the hanging steep the streets extend and pour their thousands forth    there on the cliff a ruined castle stands and frowns impending over the foaming streams where t  s precipitates his noisy floods and drives his frighted neiades from the scene of horror  ghastly and wild the disconcerted walls stand sullenly and brave the wrath of time  gloomy and dark their aspect as the age in which the scottish founder formed his plan and labored up these bulwarks and this mass of stone  the work of vassalage  once the seat of slavery and arbitrary sway  in after ages made the holds of cursed rebellion and a thousand crimes  now left the monument of tyranny expired and great in ruins tells the age of liberty restored  become an object now for pleasures eye augustly reverent thy ivy mantled arches shattered walls and rifted towers thy nodding battlements now domineer not but adorn the place    rich in meadows with hangin woods and scenes of pleasure girt  b  thou art highly favored of the hand of providence and yet ungracious and unhappy  declining trade sits sighing in thy streets and lean industry angs languishing upon her loom  forsaken of thy patron an outcast of thy lord a prodigal yet to thy fathers house a stranger  the joys of learning beam not on thy bosom where yet the social virtues never dwelt  where feigned compassion prostitutes the countenance divine to many a slanderous tale and trimmed in mask of pity malice walks  where mutual friendships yet remain unknown and envy poisons every breath of young benevolence  how graceful are the labors of the few who struggle by example to envigorate the fainting virtues  where h  k for fraternal love and filial piety revered teaches the delights of doing good  beyond the town on rising ground the mansion of the sons of israel stands commanding to the east a varied prospect full of beauties  woods which deck the rivers banks  bright broad canals and flowery vales oertopd by hamiltons high sky tinged hills  thy lord excells in his paternal duty and hospitable board famed for the chastity of each excentric toast that flows superior to his military habits   adjoining on a grassy brow a church is seen whose humble architecture not debasing divine worship retains this christian maxim that pure religion dwells in simplicity  the gaudy robe the gilded fane are ostentations own in which hypocrisy is seen to sit  pride is religions profanation and arrogance in her priests is blasphemy  the villagers crowd the tombstones and thoughtless over the dead their rustic jests propound or lovetales whisper till the holy man in robes of white religions emblem and the type of innocence convokes the giddy herd and with his doctrines lulls them to repose   beneath the hill the hasty river falls in hoarse cascades and as it laves the sounding shores yields a loud plaudit to its bounteous author whilst the leaping floods exulting clap their hands  all on the verdant steep the green turf marks the peasants grave where many an honest heart has fled from woe and yielding up the spirit to its god sleeps in a mothers lap serene  there in the verdant mantle many a maid has wrapped her cares has hushed her wishes for the world and given an angel to the skies  on the gently rising hills behind the hamlets stand diversifying the extended prospect  there b  n scatters out her cottages crouching beneath the smoke of burning lime that clouds the sultry sun with its expanding volumes  and here the dusty road leads up to b  s beat by the feet of travelers and at the instant of my observation crowded with cattle

which terminates the view rises in rocks that lift their storm bleachd countenance from out the fringes of the brushwood and support some shepherds huts under whose brow which battles with the

its walls a bending matro took her abode and cherished in he bosom one fair blossom an only daughter  in this retirement long had she been hid and on a scanty income lived content with strict frugality  her daughter had attained her seventeenth year and now she sat attentive to the history of her progenitors  monday reveals our heroines birth stricken in years the matros sat bending on her couch  the sable crape and widowweeds which clothed her were adorned with linne white as snow  her face on which benevolence was dressed with beaut in decay shone with a grace divine  soft silver hairs hung on her elevated brow  and sensibility was in her looks mixing with fond affection as she gazed upon her daughter  one hand extended leaned upon her staff the other pressed her bosom as she spoke  my marianne it is time that thou should know from whence thou sprang and what thy fortune is  my ancestors were men of little note for pedigree or opulence but honesty had marked them for her own  humble in station with humility they smoothed the days of life  as useful members of community they lived beloved and mented died    thy father was a man of bter birth the eldest son of an exal family  his valor was well tryd his loyalty was warm and hon without stain  the good mans yo was flattered by the smiles of fi fortune  but alas his parent w imprudent and in his follies ow whelmed as fair a race as ever ble a father    distress which to m minds brings on despair served only to exhilirate the genius and svour of thy father  worthin is seldom blessed with worldly honors  for so corrupt are courts that manly merit when it comes suspended on the arm of poverty is turned aside abashed and gives its place to babylooks of title and the insolence of interest    the fate of thy dear father   long lingering wars he served cruel campaigns drear voyages and many a bloody seige  whilst i the choice of his affection hapless left at home passed on a life of languishment and love  my soul was full of his indelible dear image  regard possessed my bosom with its purest fervor and whilst my thoughts were ever with my lord they were ever filled with doubts of danger and with fears forlorn  how could i marianne but dread the tale of battles and of slaughter when he i lovd my souls sole lord all that was dear on earth was braving the attack   fancy went forth and dipped her wings in blood fancy returned and laved her plumes with tears  imaginations visionary scenes were all displayed i heard the dire confusion of fire arms i saw the gleam of swords unsheathed by the advancing cavalry i heard the ordonance and thought battalions fell to the tremendous battery i saw the rushing phalanx with the bionet breaking down ranks and bearing victory before them  horror beset me at the shouts of victory  and coldness crept upon my nerves when ever i bethought me of the wounded  of the conquered  of the slain    oh what could love oh what could such affection as my soul possessed under such circumstances but lament and languish out in sighs the dismal seasons of my solitude  day after day reflection sat associate with despondency  night after night my tears bedewed my bed

first smiles were spent on sorrow  thy looks appeared to claim protection from above as god delights in cherubs  affliction stood upon our countenances  our tongues were silent for the woe was inexpressible  the good amintor sighed  oh the energy of such a sigh  he dropped his arms from the embrace  and tears od in his parting eyes   deep drawn sighs obstructed the widows narrative  and marianne sat rowing at the picture of her parent  thy prattling tongue soon learnt lisp the name of father  my ears  joicing at the voice have tingled w delight  and yet for years past   years  that name repeated from  same tongue has tortured eve thought and wrenchd my ack heart    for oh my marianne  two short years were past the drea news was heard of the battalions verthrow in which thy

the breast i loved i sunk and dropped upon the floor    doubting the affection of my husband i shrunk back to view the man and trace my misfortune in his looks if there discovery was written to teach me what he thought    thy father marianne had sunk upon a knee to bend himself toward e  and to my tortured sight displayed the cause why my embrace was unreturnd    for oh my daughter h right arm extended showed a miserable limb without a hand which mocked his wishes to enclasp me  an his left side was totally bereft  hand and arm  then from her breast she drew the picture of amintor and kissing it delivered it to marianne  crying ho changed was this sacred image  alas then how unlike to this dear portrait which i wear upon my bosom within my heart a still more delicat resemblance is retained    poor marianne with trembling and on bended knee received the porit and looking on it with devotion pt  after some moments amidst interrup sobs the matron thus continued   oh horror not to

touched with more afflicting fights than to behold the hero who amidst terrors had despised the threats of death advancing in multitudes of dangers horrible as various to see the man who braved the slaughter of the field of battle in whose soul the ardour of honor kindled up intripid courage and despite of wounds sitting the mangled image of a man and like a child submitting to be fed  so the aspiring pine on mountains brow which scorned the storms of ages smote by lightning yields its shattered arms and shows its cloven mutilated trunk a spectacle of terror to the plains around  as he

sliding banks whilst shrinking e brook leave grassy edges to invite pose upon their easy seats  there t my muse presents to me the image marianne  there first reveals the ces of the maid whose story claims  sylvan reed and tunes it to melmene and love    there marianne sat  in stae tall and straight as rushes of the ulet  clad in russet her beauty  confusion to the pride of ornament er arms like alabaster displayed their teness with a delicate proportion her k was lofty and a hat of straw shad her countenance where modesty sat trimming wisdom with the ve of diffidence    with clasping hands she sat  meditate her humble lot and sighed for the adversity which overwhelmed her father  she ruminated on the peacess hours of rural life with unambitio mind and blessed with contentmen she called it happiness    within her breast young lov had learnt to sport with innocence an hope by the flatterings of fancy ha entangled her desires  she wished not  be greater for her humble passion h its birth without ambition  there w  youth on whom her virgin wishes rested a shepherd  as on the image of her love she ent a rapturous thought with eyes st up to heaven her pure desires breathed into a prayer  it was then that she revealed her face where beauty such as adorned edens eve shone forth  marianne  her eyes of blue were eek and languishing her brow was evated and adorned with pale brown ir her cheeks were tinged with blush like roses scattered upon snow her ps were glowing with full tides of health and in attention separated shew her teeth of ivory    fair flower the bosom of retirement dressing  sweet as the spring tide hawthorn blossom trimming maias chaplet as she walks the dale  fair  the wild rose on the rivers brink tha brightens her attire by the reflection o the shining stream  humble and chas as yonder pretty stem of lillyofthe vale that in its verdant mantle hides i charms contented with its purity and peace  such was fair marianne  her mother bending on her staff forsakes the cottage to salute her daughter and see the linen bleach which read the green  the matron soon pereivd some new anxiety sat on her maias looks and feared the tale of their alamities had born too hard upon her ind  thus she assays to comfort her    my marianne forbear to cherish sorrows  lamentation is in vain when remedy is gone  the fittest duties of the mind are to enumerate the consolations which are left us  to weigh the blessings which we taste to estimate the good things we enjoy compare them with the fortunes of the many who experience greater ills than we and then in gratitude give praises to the god of heaven who ye preserves us from worse estate  the way of happiness leads not on stee assets trod by ambition and inordinate desire  no  she has made her passes in the deep sequestered val of still content  all that i wish  to secure my marianne and in he happy marriage harbor the bark i which my treasure is laid up in which my care for ever sails and seeks the hoped for shore  but perils wait the voyage  love like the ocean is  inconstant scene for now it tempt with smoothness and with smiles and you would think that pleasur played upon its shining bosom with security  but soon the sunreflecting plain is curled by rising breezes up the billows heave and swell as bosoms panting with their passion  rougher it rises till the leaping surge confounds its waters with the clouds the winds with ruffled wings dash on the tide and stir the direful tumult up to tempest  the little female bark that launched from shore with only innocence on board plays thoughtless on the pleasurable mirror and sees but innocence in its reflection  but when the ocean troubled with the wind his countenance deforms confounded she perceives that her ret is rendered impossible without  rudder of experience without supicions mariners to hand the s without the oars of resolution  struggle with the tempest with prudence and without perspicu to guide the helm with only p on board who calls on chastity go to prayers  the vessel fills wi floods tremendous and immersing  for ever lost  love is insidious  the passion first advances with soft insinuating joys  the eyes delight to gaze  the ear is charmed with sweet professions corresponding with the hearer wish and what the sympathetic lover feels  the clasping hand receives the mutual grasp  advancing wishes rising on a growing intimacies soft gradations at length break the bounds of modestys reluctance and glowing kisses kindle feverish raptures  each breast beats with impatient throbs  eyes in their humid gaze grow languid  and passion soon advances beyond the barriers of prudence  what we wish to credit we confide in  and innocence as void of suspicion as of guile lays all abroad for treachery and treason  as thus the matron spoke fair marianne placing her clasped hands upon her knees with unshifting gaze kept her eyes upon her mother whilst her tears in trickling showers fell fast   she ceased thus the sweet maid replied   the tender care and parental love of my dear mother command my duty and gratitude  my bosom knows no thought my mother ought not to know  my soul can breath no wish you should not govern  do you suspect your daughter of imprudence  alas my mother have i disobeyed  i do confess  dear emma i admit    what does my child intend to say    whilst you described the dangers of the passion i trembled for myself  indeed my mother  nay let not anger grow into your loving looks  let not a thought of condemnation touch your mind or wrestle with affection  your marianne has not a sentiment unworthy of her mothers ear    you keep me in suspense emma interrepts whilst doubt and apprehension raise their visionary terrors  spare a parents fears    oh blessed matron do i give you pain  let it be increased a thousand times on me could i but save my mothers anguish  if your beloved marianne has listened to the tale of love  alas i see the frown is gathering on your brow and i have erred    with confidence my child reveal the story of thy passion  my experience may conduct thee in the labyrinth and lead thee safely to the paths of honor    my passion said the fair one with a blush do you suspect your child of such imprudence as to have yielded up her heart to passions without a mothers knowledge  when i examine into all my mind i think myself as free as ever  but some how i perceive a sigh steals from my breast and tells me that i am not easy and yet i feel no pain  a tender anxiety sits on my thoughts  sometimes i wish i were in these retirements and when i am here i wish i were away  a listlesness hangs on me i know not how that gives me little rest and yet it is a kind of melancholy pleasure    tell me my marianne from whence these new sensations come    my heart is open to my mothers eye  concealment is not known within my soul  you know the gay olissus the lord of yonder rich demesnes  he talked to me of love  and with a graceful person flowery tongue and strange humility of tenderness discovered to me first the character of a lover for indeed i had not formed the least idea what a lover meant    and what ensued my girl the matron hastily replied for to her bosom glowing with wishes for her daughters welfare ambition had insinuated its delusive visions  on his pursuit of pleasure here he strayed  his dogs were in the thicket after game  he bearing on his arm a gun surprised me at my work  then it was i first beheld olissus  he seemed to eye me with a fond attention  abashed to beat the looks of this rich man i blushed and walked away  he followed me and asked my name and where i dwelt and who belonged i to  never ashamed to own my habitation or my dear mother i replied with truth and showed him where our cottage stood and talked of you  he looked upon me steadfastly and smiled as if i pleased him with my sincerity  your speech says he distinguishes you are not a native of this dale your manners tell me you are better bred  he seized my hand  i trembled  observing my confusion h bowed and left me    i never thought of the ever for many days till again i saw olissus coming toward me in the grove where i sat to shelter me from noo tide heat  when he approached beheld the character of benevolen imprinted on his looks his eyes we flashing with good humor  i attempted to arise but he prevented me ar sat down by my side  with a degree of fervor which i never had perceived i any man he talked to me of love assured me that his soul was languishing and all his happiness depend on my smiles  i wondered at his words and grew afraid  his face began to glow like the countenance of a man in wrath his lips were trembling and his eyes grew piercing  then seizing my hand he grasped me passionately  i shrunk away  with soft persuasion and the gentlest accents he stilled my apprehension  as i grew bolder he grew bolder too  he cast one arm about my waist and kissed my cheek  i thought his lips were burning  he sighed and seemed uneasy  i was abashed  confusion grew upon me  i was overwhelmed with shame and yet i gained recollection sufficient to enable me to reprove him for his boldness  you kill me with your frown says he  you make me tremble sir  indeed i am much ashamed and terrified  your blushes set my bosom in a blaze your eyes dissolve my soul says he and press a himself upon me  i bent back and shunned his kisses  i tumbled on the green    alas my marianne the matron cries   then unbounded in his kisses he planted them upon my bosom  his hands were wandering over my neck  i was fluttered distressed and out of breath  he saw my misery  oh my mother the remembrance agitates me grievously  for giddy with the strange unusual freedom and my fright i was ready to expire within his arms  when he perceiving my distress and weak estate seized the occasion  he paused    with eyes and hands directed up to eaven the matron sat mute    again she breaks the awful though omentary silence at that instant he displayed himself in the most amiable character  he arose and bending toward me took my trembling hand and raised me  he seemed to pity me  how godlike was his figure in h pity  the expressions of charity and benevolence were stamped upon h features  a gracious greatness sho upon his countenance and like the saving angel he appeared who le the brokenhearted hagars fainting steps to streams of water in the wderness  your images of love str my mind with the just similitude o my mishap and brought your codemnations home upon my own imprudence  for till the strange event was past i never conceived the danger i was exposed to or weighed the wi disparities of fortune the inequalities between us  i thought he uttered truths and entertaining no impulse of guile i doubted no deceit  but since that time dear mother i have trembled at the recollection of myself  for i have heard say that man is often base and can dissemble and counterfeit the passions of a lover  can vow such vows and tell such tales as cheat poor innocents  can like the barbarous man who slays a lamb divest himself of all humanity possess the virgins moment of distress and whilst she places all her virtuous confidence and holy faith upon delusive promises and whilst he plants the rapturous kiss to seal the lips which breath her innocence his heart is harboring the worst of wishes and the maiden is lost in wiles  alas my mother  i tremble at the precipice on which i trod   the matron shook her head and sighed  and yet thou art not from that precipice escaped  within thy bosom lurks the traitor that will yield thee back into olissus arms  the affrighted marianne dropped upon her knee and holding forth her hands beseechd her mother to discover the insiduous sentiment which threatned to ndo her  what was that listlesness my maianne of which you talked that gave you little rest yet seemed to be a melancholy pleasure  olissus name replies the maid has no connection with those sentiments  of him or his professions i have never thought but with a blush  no tenderness of mind is due to him  if love is known by such sensations as i heretofore spoke of that love belongs not to olissus  no another claims my sighs   the matrons silence gave liberty to marianne to tell her tale  some months since when winter clothed the ground with snow i went to visit my poor lamb which went with neighbor symkins flock upon the fell  the pretty animal was given to me by alciris cymons son  its mother dear creature died soon after it was born and then the little orphan wanting sustenance was trusted to my tenderness and care  with great compassion i beheld its desolate estate helpless and harmless  in its looks were soft distresses written and in languid eye expressed dejected innocence its cries were pitiful complainings and my compassion succeeded to its moan  i fed it with my hands i made its couch of wool i heard its calls of hunger and i tended it with tenderness  the pretty female grew in strength  as if its little heart was moved with gratitude it followed to my call and lifted up its face to court my looks its countenance expressed the pleasures of its mind whilst on its curling wool i stroakd my hand  grown older in my walks it walked and whilst i sat it cropd the blades of grass played round my seat and when some length of time elapsed without my calling on its name it came and bleated in my face and seemed to court continuance of my care or seemed to fear i had neglected her  these were pretty tricks which won my heart and of its innocence and sweetness sure i was enamored  for i loved the lamb as now i seem to love a swain whom may the heavens be pleased my mother may approve    alciris met me trudging in the snow  the sheep were gathered on the hillocks where they stood lamenting and dismayed hungry and trembling  for my lamb i wept  he caught it up and bare it in his arms home to our cott  as then i loved the lamb i liked the man who saved it from the misery it felt  he asked a poor reward for such his care and with good will i yielded it  he asked a kiss he took it for his pains and for my lamb i gave him one again  my transport made me bold for all my mind was full of the dear lamb i never thought of what it was i did  but recollection soon rushed upon me my confusion was almost immediate and blushes were incessant  he gazed upon me with looks of languishment mixing with smiles an expression not to be described was in his eyes  then was the time i first perceived peculiar pleasure in the conversation of a man  and thence i first began to observe the image of his sex with more than cold indifference  for my involuntary gaze ran rambling over his figure with a curiosity fraught with pleasure  i beheld him tall and well proportioned  his limbs are not robust but of a gentle turn  his jetty locks break careless over his neck in ringlets his garb though homely shows his form to some advantage  his brow is open  his eyes as dark as sloes look quick as sparks struck from the travelers horseshoe in the lanes at night and make one start with the acuteness of the flash  his cheek is ruddy with the glow of health where smiles sit goodnaturedly in dimples and from his lips the softest voice in sweet in mild and modest accents fall  his education far beyond his station gives him sentiments and phraze would make my mother wonder  a shepherd in his occupation but above olissus in his wisdom  my marianne he says the lambs an orphan bereft of aid  it has lost its parent  animals of prey will soon devour it if it is not fostered by thee  all orphans are exposed to perils  preserve my lamb and let me be thy shepherd  i wondered at his talk  thou art says he just as this lamb bereft of that good parent who might defend sustain and bring thee out of dangers  thy ancient mother may instruct thee b the wisdom of all precept is confounded by evil fortune and subject to the subtilties of knaves as aspines tremble to every breeze  the woodbine unsupported dangles in the dust and untimely all her sweets and beauties languish and expire  my arm methinks could find for thee protection my bosom could ensure a resting place my industry could earn thee competency and comfort  i guessed not at his wishes    and i could love my lamb forever he cries    then it was i first was struck with comprehension  i told him that my mother ruled my actions and that i had not entertained a wish to call my own    but will thou adds he with a degree of impatiency hear me tell my passion for i love thee as my life  i first observed thee at the chapel and i thought i saw an angel pray  my soul was set on fire and i was all enthusiasm my devotion was carried to a fervor beyond what i had before experienced  yet whilst i kneeled my mind began to wander and my thoughts would often stray from heaven replete with love of thee  i cherished the fond flame and often it led me musing in the grove and often my fancy wandered inspired by thy image as on the hill i lay to tend my sheep  when ever i tuned my pipe thou were the music of my mind and full of thee each warbling sonnet trild  often to myself i talked and praised thy charms and prayed for thy embrace  the beachen bark stands lettered with thy name the limetree bears the emblems of my love    as thus he talked my bosom heaved with hasty breathing on my cheeks the color arose and tears stood in my eyes  he pressed my hand to his soft lips whilst my impatient bosom throbd to exchange the pleasure    he added to wedlock fairest marianne my wishes lead for it would equal a state of paradise to have thee mine    i bid him talk to you of marriage  here in this dale he often comes in these sequestered plains we walk and in yonder long green lane beneath the shade of hawthorns our talk is full of gentleness and the more he professes himself the lover seems the more abashed timorous and doubtful to offend  not like olissus whose impetuous passion kindling up from sparks blazed out in vehemence and terrified me with a flood of kisses  when alciris is here the hours seem enviously short and he is departing before i think i have welcomed him  his kindness delights my recollection  i could think of him for ever  if this is love dear matron then your marianne has been ensnared  wednesday is spent in counter plots as the panting zephyr arises from the opening rose loaded with sweets the muse enraptured with the image of fair marianne withdraws her wing fraught with the simple beauties of meek innocence and lingering on the haunts of pleasure with reluctance bends her way to yonder vale which from thronged alders thriving in their watery situation give to cymons lands the name of aller copse  the dwelling of this family is placed on a low ground where rushes are abundant  a creeping stream winds through the flat worn in the peaty earth which stains the muddy waters  a grove of alders crowd the

blazes circled round with bricks whose smoke n winding volumes eddies in the open ange where many an iron instrument f household as decorations hang  a ong settee the fireside throngs covered with calfskin beneath whose frame old cymons wooden shoes keep holyay and harbor tabbys kittens  a hining table spreads its ample board eneath the window laden with a leaen loaf a cheese and scattered leeks  ull opposite an oaken cupboard stands where carving is benumbed in stiff stalked lillies lumps of grapes and wooden foliage  the pillars swell protuberant with timber and half reveal each

insensibility he was fully conscious from its beginning    bending with age the sage old man sat multiplying in his mind the store he had amassed by numbers to which his love of life had bid him hope he should increase his years  a little white hair silvered his brow beneath a cap of woolen stripped with green and gray  his heavy eyebrow hid his eyes with tufts of yellow hair  on his sharp nose two shattered glasses hung  hollow was his cheek brushed with a bristly beard  his party colored coat bound with a leathern girdle had wearied industry to patch and avarice to gather    the partner of

croakd and wandered  alciris was the issue of their youth  a child they had born in their elder years a daughter  alciris was the dayong from their sight he was the guardian of their flocks  but their jenneta was employed at home in domestic duties  her occupations were the dairy and the fold  this daughter sad misfortunes had ishapen  her shoulders were protuberant  her ankles twisted and her countenance was crooked  as her frame so was her mind distorted  for though the cows benevolence supplied her daily pail and filled her bowls with riches though the meek flocks their heavy fleeces yielded to her arms and filled the grasp of avarice with wealth  though the prolific stye with litters teemed the roost poured forth her hidden hoards and living troops  although fertility had blessed the furrow and the mead yet void of gratitude untouched by daily bounties and examples her soul remained as sullen as the rocks which frowned upon the dale and tasteless of the gifts of providence as the dark barrenness of hought which broode only on the opes of future gain    led by chance as she returned from the town jennetta passed the cottage of fair marianne  within the ong green lanes alciris strayed and with his lovely maid in tales of soft affection unsuspiciously enjoyed the shadowy haunts where blowing woodbines ent round the hazel boughs and where they thought themselves in secret and secure  jennetta viewed the pair and with sour looks askance gave up er mind to malice for within her soul soft sympathetic pleasures never beemd    homeward jennetta heyd and to her parents gave descriptions of the scene she hated  at her approach the bolt was drawn with cautious hand  with eye placed to the latchhole of the door the matron viewed jennettas face ever she would give her passage  haste had made her breathings short wrath enflamed her cheek and glared upon her eye  the parents saw their daughters image changed and feared some danger had beset her steps  the maid impatient of their error cries stay your mistaken apprehensions it is not for me that your parental hearts should pant with terror but for your son alciris  as she paused dread stole into their souls and struck them dumb for with the tmost tenderness they lod alciris   he says jennetta is betrayed  deluded by the arts and fly insinuations of that marianne of whom too busy fame has often spoken ill    of marianne the mother interrupts and who is she    one cries the maid whom the world has treated with contempt  of spurious birth  or if of birth legitimate of father and of stock unknown  she with her mother lives an homely life but how they are sustained the neighbors have not learnt save what their needle work procures them a sorry pittance  yet with their poverty so proud they scorn all intercourse with the people despising to be social with the cottagers who dwell within their dale they live unneighbourly and hid their wants in a sequestered solitary life    the old man from his stoo edge with projecting figure fat uneasy with hand extended and impatient looks attentive to the tale   yet with their poverty so proud that all their converse when the condescend to talk with peasants is of romantic virtues lofty views presuming maxims manners dictating and modes ambitious  they scorn the little talk of dairy duties and the reapers joys  this marianne has filled her simple soul with empty tales of times past by and what she calls philosophy and gives her wandering thoughts up to the stars  a mate unfit for our alciris    the old man interrupts  whence know thou that she has snared my boy  for him i toiled  i love the lad  for him i have rejoiced to multiply my gains  the youth deserves my care for disobedience since his earliest breath has never marked his life    comes not disobedience soon enough replied jennetta when alciris would dispose his heart on other objects than his fathers will  i saw him in yonder gre lanes walk hid from the beams of day by shading trees and hanging woodbines concealing from the eye of man his odious intercourse with marianne  i saw her stretch her neck aloft exulting in the vows he paid  her lofty neck extended with the empty pride of this her conquest like the giddy goose that looks around rejoicing in the empire of her gadling gander  so simple looked the man amidst her triumph  with portly gait she walked and seemed to think herself a goddess  and when she deigned to smile the swain around her waist cast his transported arms and in a strain of phrenzy caught a kiss  whence can such fond infatuation flow  such fascination of the human mind  i neither feel nor fancy the sensation which can beget such transports    the mother with a scream claspng her hands interrupts the story asking a thousand questions in a breath which in the same breath she resolves into the darkest doubtfulness  the father heard the tale and thus harrangues  here all my days have been consumed in toil  my years in labor spent have yielded riches which hitherto i have not enjoyed  for in those riches selfdenial has withdrawn my lip from comforts cup and appetite has often yearnd at my most parsimonious board whilst selfenjoyment held in chains of avarice has languishd out existence  i loved my boy and for his happiness forsook my own  yet what is happiness  with him it is love  his undeserning mind is occupied by present objects and perceives not what futurity is pregnant with  he thinks the smiles of marianne are smiles of heaven and tastes in kisses loves infatuating fond felicity  once i was young and ellen on my breast was all my wishes craved  i loved my ellen with a transport not to be expressed  my daily toils though wearisome were sweet since they supplied my wife with comfort  my cares were for her pleasures for the cares proceeding from necessity were weighed alone by ellens wants  labor was cheerfully sustained as it purchased us such blessings  ease so seldom tasted was an inestimable joy as it indulged our intercourse of love and made the sunday happinesses sabbath  but years came on and cooled our passions  when nature cooled felicity fell from transport into temperance and love extinguished his fervor and his fires  the various estimates of life were changed  necessities grew irksome  care came on in frowns  and all the sweets which once could meliorate the sorrows of our station like the roses on the briars with the seasons drooping died away and left the thorns naked  we thence perceived that money was the only source of lasting peace as it secured our ease  for our infants we became anxious to gain them property was to secure them pleasure  love is the seasoning of youth  but youth is as a span in human life which when elapsed resigns mankind to care  jennetta sighed  the father ceased  the maid cries out why what am i  of what am i compounded unlike my parents and unlike my brother  i neither feel the pleasure which my father pictures or my brother tastes nor does my mind conceive what kind of joy this love inspires i often thought the strang contagion was a kind of madness i which the patient was busied with eternal fever of the mind and image extravagant  a malady of thought  a wild conception of delights delusive as the images of a delirium  a other times i looked upon it as a intoxication a disease that drowns the judgment and benumbs the nerves  am i by nature blighted misshapen iform and in my sensations untoned and unharmonized  i feel myself in no wise made deficient judgment rules my thoughts and all my senses own the same impulse as others of my sex experience  surely this deficiency is in the soul for by my fathers talk it seems this love is sentiment not mere sensation  i cannot comprehend it  to yield to conjectures is to lead to anxiety  but of alciriss father  if your experience shows that loves a transitory scene of vague instable transports and that wealth procures a lifelong joy wherefore do you hesitate you love your son and from parental principles would save him from his follies  forbid his intercourse with marianne i hate he haughtiness and arrogance of widom  a girl who thinks she is prett will be disagreeable and vain b one who thinks she is wise will aways render herself detestable  wake his mind from this letharg love and banish the visions of ifatuation give him new pursuits a try if love can battle love try annas prudent years and wealt portion with a parents kind commands will not move the youth testify his obedience and judment    the name of anna roused old cyons ear there was music in her porion  he cast up his countenance and rind a smile glancing at jenneta  ooks of approbation over his spectacles  wherefore talkest thou of anna says the sage    anna sighs in vain for your alciris but he derides her passion  she often tells me of his scorn in tears  you know her large estate  she has not yet attained her fortieth year  her form is comely though not beautiful  her education rural and domestic  her acres spread the valley with grassy walks for pleasures steps  her golden furrows laugh with opulence and on her lap prosperity and prudence have been fostered  unlike this marianne  for she is bred with notions arrogant and impious and all your little wealth would squander to indulge her fellies    a frown stood lowering on old cymons brow  he sighed  and from his murmurs no articulation escaped but just the name of money    extravagance would hold revels in the stores which your industry gained and a progeny of beggars would enthral your sons sad steps    old cymon cast an angry glance toward heaven and knit his tusks with ehemence    for what are all the empty tales reaped from the pens of poets visions and drunken dreams which constitute the drama  vain tittle tattle fit only to become the conversation of those who hold the hands of indolence  but anna can adorn the marriage life with maxims plucked from the pinions of prudence and propriety of judgment ensuring wealth with hand assiduous and the measures of frugality   the father clasping both his hands upon his breast replied  i love my son  such is the human mind that if the lad should be restrained in this his early passion all the wealth that i can give may but increase his wretchedness  love sometimes is so fickle that with indulgence it grows languid sickens and dies if love is well established if it depends not on outward beauties but is fed by excellencies of the mind and virtue and is supported by pure judgment it will never be liable to extinction  nay there is even a bias of the mind which arises in nature and nature herself from sympathy influences mans heart  the common proverb is that marriages are made in heaven implying that our love is involuntary  but how we for the sake of prudence may counteract this passion there is the rub  by indulgence in a course of years it may grow faint but then becoming temperate it may grow into an indissoluble friendship  so was my love of ellen  a friendship which with mutual pleasure flows and all the measures of a mutual mind friendship on mutual offices and aids sustained  perhaps my boy has centered all his soul on this his choice an shapes his happiness from mutu love and sympathetic sentiments  we should blight this blossom of la life the plant would sicken would untimely fade and prematurely without fruit expire  for by resistanc love like an impeded river gathe strength and grows impetuous the banks at length are overflowed the barriers broken down and all become a deluge  his happiness is all my ai  to purchase it i gave my life for wealth to purchase it i will all m wealth resign  thou art no judg jennetta of his thoughts  for in hi youth i gave him an education from whence manly judgment forms the maxims of his mind above the bounds of our unlettered sentiments  for learning pours into the human stores collected laws for regulating life  from thence one mind attains the reasonings of thousands is taught to judge from others judgments accumulates the experience of multitudes and the examples of ages ten  its wisdom with the knowledge thered by sages of all times  the m of learning tries discretion in examples scale and like the be which carries to his hive the honey of each flower his understanding is enriched from all the science of the world    jennetta from impatiency sa knawing from her nails the bleeding flesh    alciris may discover in hi marianne virtues and excellency which lay concealed from vulgar eyes a treasure for the enjoyment of hi understanding  but the fairest of the feminine accomplishments is virtue  possessed of that    possessed of virtue father interrupts the maid with vehemence pray what is virtue  is it is chastity alone or in discretion  perhaps in neither can this sorceress make boast that she possesses virtue  the world is busied with her friendship for the gay olissus  they meet they walk they hold their intercourse in every grove and each sequestered bower  and what olissus leaves alciris takes  to a young mans mind perhaps her vices have allurements more infatuating than the pale faced virtues and sensuality may fascinate beyond pure love  in case discretion be the characteristic or the type of virtue it is not known to marianne  for famed olissus full of opulence and arts polite never blushes at the title of lascivious and famed olissus is the devotee o marianne  as the sun and moon atend this earth olissus and alcir wait the maid  olissus like the day is all glowing rapture alciris lik the cool and languid moon gazes alone upon the shadowed side when all her imperfections lay enveild  female virtue gone her place is soo occupied by craft and treacherybetrayd by man man is a woman prey to gratify revenge  and to appease despoiled chastity as is the fashion of the world some cunnin wedlock must expunge the stain  the vices of olissus and the dark insinuations inflame the mothers mind where in a strain of enthusiasm virtue reigned  she glowed with vehemence and to the sire such arguments enforced of lavishing and waste intemperance and pride inchastity and vice ruin and misery as overpowered the old mans judgment and love for his alciris and gave him back to avarice and all her train of images unfeeling and unkind  thursday in loves distress abounds at the accustomed hour of assignation came alciris to the vale to meet his marianne and true as fidelity the maid his presence waits  but ah his looks how changed    wan wore his cheek and dimly shone his eye through woe  his lip hung trembling on the long protracted kiss and sighs disturbed his speech    marianne affrighted burst into tears and in apprehension trembling sunk her head upon his bosom  so the narciss when burdened with the shower conceals her languid countenance in dew and bends her pale face to the earth  they both forbore to speak their sentiments and silence stood encumbered with their woe  at length with smiles forced on the face of grief as sunshine shed on rain alciris to her anxious ear the dread silence brake    let us dear maid from these lovehaunted walks retire with speed for even these sweet scenes are treacherous and tell our intercourse and mutual vows  well seek the more sequestered walks which skirt the rivers brink and there from all the busy world concealed i will tell thee such a tale as rocks alone should witness to and mountains shadow with their frowns    through all the winding tracks they haste with silent steps they pass the mazes of the wood and gain the solemn haunts where echo sits lamenting over the never returning stream and repeats with sighs the murmurs of the water nymph whose lovesick soul forlorn wastes all its languishment on faun haunting green wood shades  close b the rivers brink a sandy plain left by the winter torrents affords a narrow walk  the hasty river hurried over rocks with a hoarse voice murmurs  the cliffs are high and horrid which em in the rivers bounds on whose black brows hazels and thorns with heckberries in thickets thronged protect the precipice and yield a solemn shade  the mossy rocks with trilling streams are wet and melancholy seems to hold her moping meditations in their cells  there the two lovers strayed  and there alciris told the sorrowing mariianne the story of his misery and ears  envys eye has overlooked ou walks and from jennettas lips our mutual love is in piously traduced  she in acts of cruelty has joy and in dissimulations arts has he perfections  my father is a man enslaved by avarice  the sordid habit of his saving mind have worn awa all sentiments but thoughts of gainone only passion is preserved to sa the universal wreck of all that that human in him  love to me  tha love alone holds conflicts with his covetousness  for me he quits his estmates of gold and i alone stand the competitor with riches in my fathers judgment  my mother yet of weaker mind is yet more bigoted and to the bitter drench adds such suspicions and such jealousies as only want of judgment could devise  to them jennetta has revealed our meetings and our mutual love    what estimation interrupts the maid bear they of thy marianne  what value do they set upon her virtues    he lighd  alas with them her virtues are despised  her fortune is the estimate they give into the wretched balance where far outweighd by lucre the light beam is kicked aloft and gives thy virtues only to the skies    and of thy love says she are they insensible against thy happiness obdurate    my father puts my filial duty in competition with my love  he measures happiness by hundreds and by wealth  his tenderness is sapd by treachery and jennetta has depoild alciris of a fathers love    i tremble with the apprehensio of my fate the maid replies  i then our intercourse forbidden    alas my marianne answer alciris dropping a tear perhaps the night shall prove our severance so years    the maid affrighted on her quivering knees scarce for a moment was supported  down she sunk from her alciriss arm on the sand her lovely visage drooped as she shed a flood of tears  alciris bending on his knee relieved the fair one and sustained her pale cheek on his throbbing bosom  grief choked her words and deep despair heaved her afflicted heart  alciris in his soul experienced a woe most exquisite for the idea of the hated anna present to his mind was undiscovered to his marianne in his heart the conflict betwixt love and duty waged and stirred up wild confusion in his brain   alas she cries what is the wretchedness that shall beset my orphan steps  i had already given to my soul consolotary hopes sustaining them on thee    how heavy are the troubles o my mind replied alciris  amids this scene of filial duty enforced by all that is religious in my principles by gratitude by early bred affection what measures can alciris move in    sustain thy virtue interrupted marianne though i am yielded to a desolate estate  for even marianne could look upon alciris with disdain if passion should divest him of his duty and take away his principles of honor  amidst the sorrows of life i could adore thee beaming with thy rectitude of manners  but in thy errors even thy beloved bosom could not sooth my condemnations and my grief for thy misconduct  no i love alciris with such purity of passion that severed from thee by propriety of duty i could love thee for ever  but given to thee by thy disobedience my approbation ravished by the thief that stole thy honor would leave the fruits o love blighted and despoiled    whilst thus thou would persuade me says alciris to forsake thee thou bindst the fetters with a adamantine rivet and makes my admiration gather strength from excellencies which adversity has give existence to  no marianne i will not leave thee    and will thou leave thy duty  she replies thou who tastes religious sense of filial virtues  the duty of a child is an implicit obedience to a parents will  by birth our sovereigns we by birth their subject unto death  next to the deity we owe existence to them and for their tender care parental assiduity and love over our infant state what compensation can our gratitude and duty make  what are the sorrows which a sire sustains in the unnatural wandrings of his child from his commands which by the laws of nature and of god are ordonances not to be eluded or opposed  i cannot feel the sorrows  all my thoughts are not so powerful as to collect sad images enough to give imagination half their horrors  often amongst inferior animals i have viewed with tears an image of this sad estate and often as i observed it cried aloud wi then must be the parents lot wh sees her human race undutiful    give me thy sentiments says h in all their energy thy images in a their force that even against the strength i yet may strengthen my determined choice   with a sigh she thus delivered her f simile  often i perceived the pare hen lead forth her infant brood ducklings nourished by her assidui and care and as she called her wa ward flock with wondering eye s stood and gazed upon the negroe race expressing in her looks maternal disappointment and distress that she should foster such a monstrous tribe who showed their disobedience in their earliest age  and when in bold defiance of her voice they hastened to the neighboring pools and ponds with plumes disordered and with drooping wings bemired in strange distraction round she ran and called to them aloud and waild the dangers which their wilful natures tempted  then on some eminence she stood the image of despair and saw them lave the stream with head projected hanging pinions quivering with agony of mind feathers with fright erect and eye enflamed in wrath she breathed out her condemnations  the direfu semblance of a despairing parent who in broken heartedness beholds a sinfu race of disobedient children unnatura in their crimes    alciris thus replied  from your examples i new arguments derive to aid my fixed resolves  i own the image striking  but reflect tha this maternal bird was giving law unnatural to her brood and from he own improper judgment she derived her own distress  so nature has no given to mankind authority to chain the marriage choice  it is natures work from sympathy derived  an influence which nature throws through all existence an involuntary impulse an attraction irresistible  but further in thy images i read that children may possess superior powers and excellences unknown unto their parents  for the ducks enjoyed amphibious nature earth or water were alike to them the elements for their existence  and what is duty when it should restrain the bounteous gifts of providence and what is disobedience when it is the exercise of powers by parents unexperienced of which their judgment is not competent from want o knowledge and from ignorance tasting despair    what does alciris mean crie she  amidst the purest love i tremble at the very sentiments which flatter my flame    and is my marianne so very cool alciris interrupted with a sigh  can my deluded heart have bee mistaken in its views of happiness o was my passion blinded by its energy so that it could not decern that cold indifference had possession of thy hear  nay start not marianne yet i will not doubt thy love  my soul is full of confidence though full of grief yesterday my cruel parents laid injunctions on their son to quit thy arms for ever   the maid affrighted started from his side    to quit my marianne and by the wealth of anna to increase my fathers avarice from bands unhallowed and a hateful marriage   with extended hands  with trembling knees  with countenance of beauty in distraction stood the fair one growing into madness    ye cruel stars she cries y fates presiding on the hour of my ntivity you marked me out for wretcedness and woe  robbed of my father in my infancy  portiond with little more than stern necessity ye blighed me even in the bud of life a marked my years with sorrow a progressive miseries    alciris full of pity full of lov with open arms rushed upon the mai and clasped her to his bosom    no my marianne i still w save thee still will be thy shepher and protect my orphan from a wretchedness to come thy alcir will support all that is laudable in duty  for though i marry not my marianne yet to these arms shall anna never come  perhaps relenting rigor may consent to give me back my happiness and thee  perhaps elapting time may touch their hearts  but time and stern command obduracy of power and will grown obstinate shall never change my love shall never fever me from this fidelity shall never shake my vows  for as the god who gave us mutual love first formed our sympathetic hearts conformed our natures passions dispositions and affections he will delight in vows born of the feelings which he has i spird and angels will record the in the book of

despises virtue in the garb of poverty  the world would scoff at improprieties in wedlock such as these  and what was due to great olissuss wife would become ridicule for marianne  such marriage sir would bring upon you scorn from equals and from inferiors strange impertinence and laughter  felicity is born of tranquil parents virtue and conscious rectitude of matters  but pomp and fashion vanity and custom are the maids who trim the modern nuptial couch and strew the pillows with the poisons of the world  love may unloose the wedding girdle but after him comes stale satiety and if his steps stray unsupported by the graces the scene of wedlock is a scene of woe    wherefore so much of wedlock  he interrupts   so much of wedlock sir cries she good heaven forbid that yo could think of marianne on an other terms  do you reproach u with our poverty and think that wan of wealth brings with it want of honor  do you conceive that in thi state forlorn in which a mother gifts have only

endured a strange conflict in his mind touched at once with love for his alciris and the desire of rich olissuss gifts  his stubborn heart reented   the pious anthony assumes the solemn duty and seeks the cott of emma to escort the weeping marianne  saturday is full of the catastrophe the morning wakes the pious anthony  he walks to emmas cot and calls the mourning marianne abroad  with gentle converse he at first insinuates to her mind an apprehension of the sickness of alciris and with gradual cautions tells the import of his visit  she heard his tale with tears and hasted to behold her wellloved swain  as they pass on thus she entertained the priest  here by this elm i often sat to taste tranquillity and think of that peace which i enjoyed before ever love had moved my youthful heart or wishes of ambitious tendency to bless my lover stole upon my mind possessed of all necessity required i knew content  but with my wretchedness i will not wound your mind    this elm reminds me of the pain i suffered through my compassion for a little wren  and little as the object was it caused me with a thousand tears to think of my dear mother and to feel the supposition that the case might once be here is    within a little cell a wren had built her nest as every day i sat within her eye she grew familiar as she grew assured i was no foe  for every day i scattered crumbs to feed the little pair  with pleasure i beheld their mutual care and assiduity whilst they constructed all their pretty nest and formed the safe repository of the eggs with which she teemed  i often viewed his tenderness and love how he would play gay anticks on the bough and chirm his wild notes to divert his incubating mate  how he would peck the insect from the leaf and with exulting pinions bear the dainty to his hen over whose repast he sat with fluttering feathers as if he tasted transport in her appetite indulged  this daily pleasure i possessed but after all as if the joys of human minds were preordaind to be dashed out by disappointments hand as i was sitting there a fullen hawk with savage eye decerned the wren and stooping struck him with his cruel tallons  the hen perceived the blow and screaming left her nest  distration throbd within her little brea her eyeball rolled with frantic wrat and disappointed love and ever feather ruffled stood upright as s beheld her dying bird and mourn her widowed lot   affecting was the circumstance    it was distressful to me  wept and watched the wren and sa her to her nest retire disconsolate a sick with woe  amidst the misery  widowhood she brooded over h young yet unbrought forth and f of hunger and despondency she st fulfilled the duties of her nature and hatched the little creatures  tedious seemed her duty for on her nest she laid with hanging looks of wretched thought and hopeless meditation  five little wretches filled the tenement  wretches i call them for their misfortunes had existence ever they had birth  their father was no more    oh marianne your tender images at once delight and torture  interrupts the holy man the picture is so striking that my mind transports its sad ideas to another scene    a parent wren says she can give but small protection to his progeny  but wrens have their proportion to their enemies and man can nothing boast superior for the wrath of fortune the enmity of an inveterate world will ever be superior to the bravest father of the human race   a melancholy truth    five little wretches filled the nest  the mother in her tenderness and care absorbed the sorrows of he widowhood and tasted hopes for he small progeny  i saw her passage to an fro in quest of food  i heard their call and her reply and saw her swift retur when ever their voice expressed calamity  and when she brought the diet over her brood with lapsing quivering wing she hung expressing the soft feelings of her maternal heart    the birds were almost fledged and fit for flight  the mothers assiduity was ripe for a reward and often had she thought of leading forth her infanttrain to woods and fountains and the world of liberty and joy  when from yonder village spoiling boys in cruel pastime ranged the fields in quest of hapless tenants of the spray  they came  they ravaged all the labors of my wren  despoiled her nest and took the young ones forth  in human minds what early strain of cruelty appears  strang disposition in the heart of man uncultivated and unpruned by learning thou would give the human race t forests and to dens as barbarous an savage as the tiger    but of the mother wren  with food encumbred home she cam exulting in the labors of her flight  she found her nest despoiled and rui marked the havoc made by sacriligious hands in the destruction of widows house  distracted she sun down and in the dust expired  the good man gazed on marianne with eyes brimfull of tears  and marianne looked languishing and pale    such is my mothers fate for cruelty has laid her iron grasp upon my life  i loved alciris with the purest passion and happiness was in our view  but cymon of unfeeling soul of nature like the clod he tills he tasting only avarice will slay us both    not so fair marianne replied antonie for fortune dawns upon thee and olissus once a lover now thy friend will give thee such a portion as shall overshadow old cymons rankest boddings of ambition    happy the hour which gave olissus to the world she cried  bu what is wealth to me if my alciris dies  it is but dust to sprinkle on our tombs   the holy man was smitten with he talk for he was fearful of the young mans fate  he dared not weep least his affliction should touch her troubled spirit with increase of woe  he smothered in his breast the secret sigh   they reached the the house of cymon   the pious anthony conducted the sorrowing fair one to the sick mans bed  he bowed  he dropped a tear and quitted the room  the parents now with true compunction stung beheld the danger of their child and were smitten with freezing terror and incessant grief  selfcondemnation galled their aching hearts and many a fruitless prayer they breathed to angry stars for pardon of their sad obduracy and sinful avarice  unable to sustain the wretched scene they both withdrew  jennetta only staid  and that no vow no voice might from her wicked ear escape fast at the sick mans back she laid to cut off all the tenderness which true loves delicacy hates should bear anothers eye   fair marianne sat on her knees close by the sick mans bed and in her hands clasping his hand she prayed  her voice was heard by cherubims her virtuous prayer was wafted up to heaven where angels with a tear repeated  spare him good lord    with ghastly smiles the youths diffigured countenance was set  the clotted blood hung in his hair  deep in their sockets sunk his languid eyes  his lips were scorching hot  his nostrils parched and in a tumult beat the blood on every artery  the image which she often had gazed on with delight how wretchedly transformed  her looks fixed on his looks  with tears to tears  with sighs to sighs they mourned their fate in silence   jennetta like a demon lurked behind and felt no impulse but inveteracy   alciris with a languid voice breathed out my marianne and marianne with her affliction choked scarce uttered to be heard alas my dear alciris  dreadful grief set all her frame in torture  aching throbs affected her head  her heart was sick  her limbs were shook in burning ague  indulge us dear jennetta says alciris and give us but a moment to ourselves   jennetta was not moved    oh marianne breaths out the swain often interrupted by his sighs thy faithful youth has fallen amongst murderers  inhuman wretches who rejoice in slaying every comfort which the heart can taste on earth  assassins of the soul  parents and sister murdering a son a brother  putting his soul upon the rack and wrenching out of joint his spirits sensibility    alas alciris replies the maid think not that the world permits existence to such wickedness  i bring thee comfort  all the bar to our felicity is taken from us  to satiate thy fathers wishes i come enriched  to thee i come endowed with virtue and the truest love    it is too late cries he  the act is perpetrated  my deaths wound has its seat within my heart and medicine and hope are vanities  i love thee marianne and if an angel did not tell me false we soon shall have our nuptials in the tomb  ou souls they cannot sever  after death their tyranny cannot prevail against us    i love alciris says marianne with an equal fervor i die with thee  i court the nuptial funeral  the joy o spirits is infinite  in heaven alone is justice  is mercy  is festivity without alloy   on the hand of marianne he pressed his burning lips  the fluttered spirits overcame her strength  she fainted    jennettas screams alarmed them all without  they bore the breathless maiden forth  the fresh air in a little time restored her strength  but apprehensive that such agitation would increase alciriss malady they denied her readmittance to the room  onward in the way cymon attends the mourning marianne on her return  with silent steps she quits the vale of sorrow    when left alone the wretched maiden strayed in unknown paths and wandered in the woods till night drew on  the pale moon from the broken clouds by intermissions gleamd and glancing through the trees with many a shadow trimmed the solemn grove and many a pale shine cast that to the frighted eye of fanciful dejection often stood the semblance of sad specter and the ghost of her alciris haunted every glade  whilst boding birds shrieked from the ivyd shade and hooted out misfortunes dire presage   during this absence of the maid olissus to poor emmas cottage hastened impatient to relate his knowledge of her family   dejected emma sat and mused upon the melancholy scene of which her marianne was then a visitor    let me salute my sister and my friend olissus cries  and fell upon the astonished emmas neck    what means my lord the widow enclaspd in his arms scarce uttered from the strange profusion of his kisses  she trembled as he held her to his bosom    thy surprise dear matron is not yet arrived to its pitch cries he  good emma look upon me  in olissus you behold the brother of amintor    tears dimmed the matrons eyes astonishment was big within her heart    i was more fortunate than thy beloved husband  i was bred a merchant  to foreign climes in early youth transported i remained a stranger to my fathers house for forty years  when i returned alas my father was no more  his mansion and his lands were possessed by others  your amintor was dead  and i presumed the last remains of all my family here fixed my residence in rural ease to take enjoyment of the wealth my industry acquired  the hand of providence pointed out dear marianne  her innocence and beauty taught me love  her history revealed despoiled my marriage bed but gave to me a neice whom i rejoice to honor   the happy event overcame the strength of emma she was ready to expire with joy    olissus saw the strong emotions of her soul in her fainting looks and led her to the air    there is a rumor that your mariannes enamored of a meritorious youth whose avaritious father interferes and stays their happiness  i will send to cymon and promote the match and with her give a dowry equal to his wishes    alas my lord replies emma that youth from disappointed love lies sick and now is visited by marianne    well send him comfort instantly says he  for time in love forlorn amidst the languishing of hopelesness is often precious beyond estimation  well hasten mariannes return nor longer let her lingering fears prevail but cheer her soul with consolation and the knowledge of her fortune   olissus scarce had uttered these last words when breathless and in haste the fair one entered   distraction stood upon her wandering looks and sported with her smiles   little butterfly sat on her hand to which she held discourse in frantic phraze regardless of olissus and the hrieks of her affrighted mother  her clothes were all disordered and in her hair were plaited roses mixed with ivy leaves    struck with the sad disastrous spectacle distressed with disappointed views of his benevolence olissus sunk his face toward the earth and over his manly countenance the bigh tear tumbled    emma fell upon her couch and hld her face    see here cries marianne  this little fluttering insect here  it is a butterfly you say  you see not what it is  for outward forms deceive us  providence has cast deception on the face of every thing  i thought olissus was a lover once but he is unmasked and stands bereft of his
