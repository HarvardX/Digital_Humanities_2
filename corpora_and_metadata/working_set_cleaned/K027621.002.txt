the sermons of mr yorick  vol ii  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall  sermons by laurence stern am prebendary of york and vicar of sutton on the forest and of stillington near york  sermon vii vindication of human nature sermon vii romans xiv   for none of us lives to himself   there is not a sentence in scripture which strikes a narrow soul with greater astonishment  and one might as easily engage to clear up the darkest problem in geometry to an ignorant mind as make a sordid one comprehend the truth and reasonableness of this plain proposition  no man lives to himself why  does any man live to any thing else  in the whole compass of human life can a prudent man steer to a safer point  not live to himself  to whom then  can any interests or concerns which are foreign to a mans self have such a claim over him that he must serve under them  suspend his own pursuits  step out of his right course till others have passed by him and attained the several ends and purposes of living before him  if with a selfish heart such an enquirer should happen to have a speculating head too he will proceed and ask you whether this same principle which the apostle here throws out of the life of man is not in fact the grand bias of his nature  that however we may flatter ourselves with finespun notions of disinterestedness and heroism in what we do that were the most popular of our actions stripped naked and the true motives and intentions of them searched to the bottom we should find little reason for triumph upon that score   in a word he will say that a man is altogether a bubble to himself in this matter and that after all that can be said in his behalf the truest definition that can be given of him is this that he is a selfish animal and that all his actions have so strong a tincture of that character as to show to whomever else he was intended to live that in fact he lives only to himself  before i reply directly to this accusation i cannot help observing by the way that there is scarce any thing which has done more disservice to social virtue than the frequent representations of human nature under this hideous picture of deformity which by leaving out all that is generous and friendly in the heart of man has sunk him below the level of a brute as if he was a composition of all that was meanspirited and selfish surely it is one step toward acting well to think worthily of our nature and as in common life the way to make a man honest is to suppose him so and treat him as such  so here to set some value upon ourselves enables us to support the character and even inspires and adds sentiments of generosity and virtue to those which we have already preconceived the scripture tells that god made man in his own image  not surely in the sensitive and corporeal part of him that could bear no resemblance with a pure and infinite spirit  but what resemblance he bore was undoubtedly in the moral rectitude and the kind and benevolent affections of his nature and though the brightness of this image has been sullied greatly by the fall of man in our first parents and the characters of it rendered still less legible by the many superinductions of his own depraved appetites since  yet it is a laudable pride and a true greatness of mind to cherish a belief that there is so much of that glorious image still left upon it as shall restrain him from base and disgraceful actions to answer which end what thought can be more conducive than that of our being made in the likeness of the greatest and best of beings this is a plain consequence and the consideration of it should have in some measure been a protection to human nature from the rough usage she has met with from the satirical pens of so many of the french writers as well as of our own country who with more wit than wellmeaning have desperately fallen foul upon the whole species as a set of creatures incapable either of private friendship or public spirit but just as the case suited their own interest and advantage  that there is selfishness and meanness enough in the souls of one part of the world to hurt the credit of the other part of it is what i shall not dispute against but to judge of the whole from this bad sample and because one man is plotting and artful in his nature  or a second openly makes his pleasure or his profit the sole center of all his designs  or because a third straithearted wretch sits confined within himself  feels no misfortunes but those which touch himself to involve the whole race without mercy under such detested characters is a conclusion as false as it is pernicious and was it in general to gain credit could serve no end but the rooting out of our nature all that is generous and planting in the stead of it such an aversion to each other as must untie the bands of society and rob us of one of the greatest pleasures of it the mutual communications of kind offices and by poisoning the fountain rendering every thing suspected that flows through it  to the honor of human nature the scripture teaches us that god made man upright  and though he has since found out many inventions which have much dishonored this noble structure yet the foundation of it stands as it was  the whole frame and design of it carried on upon social virtue and public spirit and every member of us so evidently supported by this strong cement that we may say with the apostle that no man lives to himself in whatsoever light we view him we shall see evidently that there is no station or condition of his life  no office or relation or circumstance but there arises from it so many ties so many indispensible claims upon him as must perpetually carry him beyond any selfish consideration and show plainly that was a man foolishly wicked enough to design to live to himself alone he would either find it impracticable or he would lose at least the very thing which made life itself desirable we know that our creator like an allwise contriver in this as in all other of his works has implanted in mankind such appetites and inclinations as were suitable for their state that is such as would naturally lead him to the love of society and friendship without which he would have been found in a worse condition than the very beasts of the field no one therefore who lives in society can be said to live to himself  he lives to his god  to his king and his country  he lives to his family to his friends to all under his trust and in a word he lives to the whole race of mankind whatsoever has the character of man and wears the same image of god that he does is truly his brother and has a just claim to his kindness  that this is the case in fact as well as in theory may be made plain to any one who has made any observations upon human life  when we have traced it through all its connections  viewed it under the several obligations which succeed each other in a perpetual rotation through the different stages of a hasty pilgrimage we shall find that these do operate so strongly upon it and lay us justly under so many restraints that we are every hour sacrificing something to society in return for the benefits we receive from it  to illustrate this let us take a short survey of the life of any one man not liable to great exceptions but such a life as is common to most let us examine it merely to this point and try how far it will answer such a representation  if we begin with him in that early age wherein the strongest marks of undisguised tenderness and disinterested compassion show themselves  i might previously observe with what impressions he is come out of the hands of god  with the very bias upon his nature which prepares him for the character which he was designed to fulfill  but let us pass by the years which denote childhood as no lawful evidence you will say in this dispute let us follow him to the period when he is just got loose from tutors and governors when his actions may be argued upon with less exception if you observe you will find that one of the first and leading propensities of his nature is that which discovers itself in the desire of society and the spontaneous love toward those of his kind and though the natural wants and exigencies of his condition are no doubt one reason of this amiable impulse  god having founded that in him as a provisional security to make him social  yet though it is a reason in nature  it is a reason to him yet undiscovered youth is not apt to philosophise so deeply  but follows  as it feels itself prompted by the inward workings of benevolence  without view to itself or previous calculation either of the loss or profit which may accrue agreeably to this observe how warm how heartily he enters into friendships  how disinterested and unsuspicious in the choice of them  how generous and open in his professions  how sincere and honest in making them good  when his friend is in distress  what lengths he will go  what hazards he will bring upon himself  what embarassment upon his affairs to extricate and serve him if man is altogether a selfish creature as these moralisers would make him it is certain he does not arrive at the full maturity of it in this time of his life  no if he deserves any accusation it is in the other extreme that in his youth he is generally more fool than knave  and so far from being suspected of living to himself that he lives rather to every body else the unconsciousness of art and design in his own intentions rendering him so utterly void of a suspicion of it in others as to leave him too often a bubble to every one who will take the advantage  but you will say he soon abates of these transports of disinterested love and as he grows older  grows wiser and learns to live more to himself  let us examine   that a longer knowledge of the world and some experience of insincerity  will teach him a lesson of more caution in the choice of friendships and less forwardness in the undistinguished offers of his services is what i grant but if he cools of these does he not grow warmer still in connections of a different kind follow him i pray you into the next stage of life where he has entered into engagements and appears as the father of a family and you will see the passion still remains  the stream somewhat more confined  but runs the stronger for it  the same benevolence of heart altered only in its course and the difference of objects toward which it tends take a short view of him in this light as acting under the many tender claims which that relation lays upon him  spending many weary days and sleepless nights  utterly forgetful of himself  intent only upon his family and with an anxious heart contriving and laboring to preserve it from distress against that hour when he shall be taken from its protection does such a one live to himself  he who rises early late takes rest and eats the bread of carefulness to save others the sorrow of doing so after him does such a one live only to himself  ye who are parents answer this question for him how often have ye sacrified your health  your ease  your pleasures  nay the very comforts of your lives for the sake of your children  how many indulgencies have ye given up  what selfdenials and difficulties have ye cheerfully undergone for them  in their sickness or reports of their misconduct how have ye gone on your way sorrowing what alarms within you when fancy forebodes but imaginary misfortunes hanging over them  but when real ones have overtaken them and mischief befallen them in the way in which they have gone how sharper than a sword have ye felt the workings of parental kindness in whatever period of human life we look for proofs of selfishness  let us not seek them in this relation of a parent whose whole life when truly known is often little else but a succession of cares heartaches and disquieting apprehensions  enough to show that he is but an instrument in the hands of god to provide for the wellbeing of others to serve their interest as well as his own  if you try the truth of this reasoning upon every other part or situation of the same life you will find it holds good in one degree or other take a view of it out of these closer connections both of a friend and parent  consider him for a moment under that natural alliance in which even a heathen poet has placed him namely that of a man  and as such to his honor as one capable of standing unconcerned in whatever concerns his fellow creatures  compassion has so great a share in our nature and the miseries of this world are so constant an exercise of it as to leave it in no ones power who deserves the name of man in this respect to live to himself  he cannot stop his ears against the cries of the unfortunate  the sad story of the fatherless and him that has no helper must be heard  the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners will come before him and a thousand other untold cases of distress to which the life of man is subject find a way to his heart  let interest guard the passage as it will if he has this worlds goods and sees his brother have need he will not be able to shut up his bowels of compassion from him  let any man of common humanity look back upon his own life as subjected to these strong claims and recollect the influence they have had upon him how often the mere impulses of generosity and compassion have led him out of his way  in how many acts of charity and kindness his fellowfeeling for others has made him forget himself  in neighbourly offices how often he has acted against all considerations of profit convenience nay sometimes even of justice itself  let him add to this account how much in the progress of his life has been given up even to the lesser obligations of civility and good manners  what restraints they have laid him under how large a portion of his time  how much of his inclination and the plan of life he could most choose has from time to time been made a sacrifice to his good nature and disinclination to give pain or disgust to others  whoever takes a view of the life of man in this glass wherein i have shown it will find it so beset and hemmed in with obligations of one kind or other as to leave little room to suspect that man can live to himself and so closely has our creator linked us together as well as all other parts of his works for the preservation of that harmony in the frame and system of things which his wisdom has at first established  that we find this bond of mutual dependence however relaxed is too strong to be broke and i believe that the most selfish men find it is so and that they cannot in fact live so much to themselves as the narrowness of their own hearts incline them if these reflections are just upon the moral relations in which we stand to each other let us close the examination with a short reflection upon the great relation in which we stand to god  the first and most natural thought on this subject which at one time or other will thrust itself upon every mans mind is this  that there is a god who made me  to whose gift i owe all the powers and faculties of my soul to whose providence i owe all the blessings of my life and by whose permission it is that i exercise and enjoy them that i am placed in this world as a creature but of a day hastening to the place from whence i shall not return  that i am accountable for my conduct and behavior to this great and wisest of beings before whose judgment seat i must finally appear and receive the things done in my body  whether it is good or whether it is bad  can any one doubt but the most inconsiderate of men sometimes sit down coolly and make some such plain reflections as these upon their state and condition  or that after they have made them can one imagine they lose all effect  as little appearance as there is of religion in the world there is a great deal of its influence felt in its affairs  nor can one so root out the principles of it but like nature they will return again and give checks and interruptions to guilty pursuits there are seasons when the thought of a just god overlooking and the terror of an after reckoning has made the most determined tremble and stop short in the execution of a wicked purpose and if we conceive that the worst of men lay some restraints upon themselves from the weight of this principle what shall we think of the good and virtuous part of the world who live under the perpetual influence of it  who sacrifice their appetites and passions from confidence of their duty to god and consider him as the object to whom they have dedicated their service and make that the first principle and ultimate end of all their actions  how many real and unaffected instances there are in this world of men thus governed will not so much concern us to enquire as to take care that we are of the number which may god grant for the sake of jesus christ amen  sermon viii time and chance sermon viii ecclesiastes ix    i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift  nor the battle to the strong  neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favor to men of skill  but time and chance happens to them all   when a man casts a look upon this melancholy description of the world and sees contrary to all his guesses and expectations what different fates attend the lives of men  how often it happens in the world that there is not even bread to the wise nor riches to men of understanding etc  he is apt to conclude with a sigh upon it  in the words  though not in the sense of the wise man  that time and chance happens to them all  that time and chance  apt seasons and fit conjunctures have the greatest sway in the turns and disposals of mens fortunes and that as these lucky hits as they are called happen to be for or against a man  they either open the way to his advancement against all obstacles  or block it up against all helps and attempts that as the text intimates neither wisdom nor understanding nor skill shall be able to surmount them  however widely we may differ in our reasonings upon this observation of solomons the authority of the observation is strong beyond doubt and the evidence given of it in all ages so alternately confirmed by examples and complaints as to leave the fact itself unquestionable  that things are carried on in this world sometimes so contrary to all our reasonings and the seeming probabilities of success  that even the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong  nay what is stranger still  nor yet bread to the wise who should last stand in want of it  nor yet riches to men of understanding who you would think best qualified to acquire them  nor yet favor to men of skill whose merit and pretenses bid the fairest for it  but that there are some secret and unseen workings in human affairs which baffle all our endeavors  and turn aside the course of things in such a manner  that the most likely causes disappoint and fail of producing for us the effects which we wished and naturally expected from them  you will see a man of whom was you to form a conjecture from the appearances of things in his favor  you would say was setting out in the world with the fairest prospect of making his fortune in it  with all the advantages of birth to recommend him  of personal merit to speak for him  and of friends to help and push him forwards you will behold him notwithstanding this disappointed in every effect you might naturally have looked for from them  every step he takes toward his advancement something invisible shall pull him back  some unforeseen obstacle shall rise up perpetually in his way and keep there  in every application he makes  some untoward circumstance shall blast it  he shall rise early  late take rest  and eat the bread of carefulnesess  yet some happier man shall still rise up and ever step in before him and leave him struggling to the end of his life in the very same place in which he first begun it  the history of a second shall in all respects be the contrast to this he shall come into the world with the most unpromising appearance  shall set forwards without fortune  without friends  without talents to procure him either the one or the other nevertheless you will see this clouded prospect brighten up insensibly unaccountably before him every thing presented in his way shall turn out beyond his expectations  in spite of that chain of unsurmountable difficulties which first threatened him  time and chance shall open him a way  a series of successful occurrences shall lead him by the hand to the summit of honor and fortune and in a word without giving him the pains of thinking or the credit of projecting it shall place him in safe possession of all that ambition could wish for  the histories of the lives and fortunes of men are full of instances of this nature  where favorable times and lucky accidents have done for them what wisdom or skill could not and there is scarce any one who has lived long in the world who upon looking backwards will not discover such a mixture of these in the many successful turns which have happened in his life as to leave him very little reason to dispute against the fact and i should hope as little upon the conclusions to be drawn from it some indeed from a superficial view of this representation of things have atheistically inferred  that because there was so much of lottery in this life  and mere casualty seemed to have such a share in the disposal of our affairs  that the providence of god stood neuter and unconcerned in their several workings leaving them to the mercy of time and chance to be furthered or disappointed as such blind agents directed whereas in truth the very opposite conclusion follows for consider  if a superior intelligent power did not sometimes cross and overrule events in this world  then our policies and designs in it would always answer according to the wisdom and stratagem in which they were laid and every cause in the course of things would produce its natural effect without variation now as this is not the case it necessarily follows from solomons reasoning that if the race is not to the swift if knowledge and learning do not always secure men from want  nor care and industry always make men rich  nor art and skill infallibly raise men high in the world  that there is some other cause which mingles itself in human affairs and governs and turns them as it pleases which cause can be no other than the first cause of all things and the secret and overruling providence of that almighty god who though his dwelling is so high yet humbles himself to behold the things that are done in earth raising up the poor out the dust and listing the beggar from the dunghill and contrary to all hopes setting him with princes even with the princes of his people which by the way was the case of david who makes the acknowledgment  and no doubt  one reason why god has selected to his own disposal so many instances as this where events have run counter to all probabilities  was to give testimony to his providence in governing the world and to engage us to a consideration and dependence upon it for the event and success of all our undertakings vid tillotsons sermon on this subject  for undoubtedly  as i said  it should seem but suitable to natures law that the race should ever be to the swift  and the battle to the strong  it is reasonable that the best contrivances and means should have best success  and since it often falls out otherwise in the case of man where the wiseest projects are overthrown  and the most hopeful means are blasted and time and chance happens to all  you must call in the deity to untye this knot  for for though at sundry times  sundry events fall out  which we who look no further than the events themselves call chance because they fall out quite contrary both to our intentions and our hopes  though at the same time in respect of gods providence overruling in these events it were profane to call them chance for they are pure designation and though invisible are still the regular dispensations of the superintending power of that almighty being from whom all the laws and powers of nature are derived  who as he has appointed  so holds them as instruments in his hands and without invading the liberty and free will of his creatures can turn the passions and desires of their hearts to fulfill his own righteousness and work such effects in human affairs which to us seem merely casual  but to him certain and determined and what his infinite wisdom sees necessary to be brought about for the government and preservation of the world over which providence perpetually presides  when the sons of jacob had cast their brother joseph into the pit for his destruction  one would think if ever any incident which concerned the life of man deserved to be called chance it was this  that the company of ishmaelites should happen to pass by in that open country at that very place at that time too when this barbarity was committed after he was rescued by so favorable a contingency  his life and future fortune still depended upon a series of contingencies equally improbable for instance had the business of the ishmaelites who bought him carried them from gilead to any other part of the world besides egypt or when they arrived there had they sold their bondslave to any other man but potiphar throughout the whole empire  or after that disposal had the unjust accusations of his masters wife cast the youth into any other dungeon than that where the kings prisoners were kept  or had it fallen out at any other crisis than when pharoahs chief butler was cast there too  had this or any other of these events fallen out otherwise than it did  a series of unmerited misfortunes had overwhelmed him  and in consequence the whole land of egypt and canaan from the first opening to the conclusion of this long and interesting transaction the providence of god suffered every thing to take its course the malice and cruelty of josephs brethren wrought their worst mischief against him  banished him from his country and the protection of his parent  the lust and baseness of a disappointed woman sunk him still deeper  loaded his character with an unjust reproach  and to complete his ruin doomed him friendless to the miseries of a hopeless prison where he lay neglected providence though it did not cross these events  yet providence bent them to the most merciful ends when the whole drama was opened then the wisdom and contrivance of every part of it was displayed then it appeared it was not they as the patriarch inferred in consolation of his brethren it was not they who sold him but god  twas he sent him thither before them  his superintending power availed itself of their passions  directed the operations of them  held the chain in his hand and turned and wound it to his own purpose ye verily thought evil against me  but god meant it for good  ye had the guilt of a bad intention  his providence the glory of accomplishing a good one  by preserving you a posterity upon the earth and bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive all history is full of such testimonies which though they may convince those who look no deeper than the surface of things that time and chance happen to all  yet to those who look deeper they manifest at the same time that there is a hand much busier in human affairs than what we vainly calculate which though the projectors of this world overlook  or at least make no allowance for in the formation of their plans they generally find it in the execution of them and though the fatalist may urge that every event in this life is brought about by the ministry and chain of natural causes  yet in answer  let him go one step higher  and consider  whose power it is that enables these causes to work  whose knowledge it is that foresees what will be their effects  whose goodness it is that is invisibly conducting them forwards to the best and greatest ends for the happiness of his creatures  so that as a great reasoner justly distinguishes upon this point  it is not only religiously speaking but with the strictest and most philosophical truth of expression that the scripture tells us that god commands the ravens  that they are his directions which the winds and the seas obey if his servant hides himself by the brook such an order causes and effects shall be laid  that the fowls of the air shall minister to his support  when this resource fails and his prophet is directed to go to zerepha  for that he has commanded a widow woman there to sustain him  the same hand which leads the prophet to the gate of the city  shall lead forth the distressed widow to the same place to take him under her roof  and though upon the impulse of a different occasion shall nevertheless be made to fulfill his promise and intention of their mutual preservation  thus much for the proof and illustration of this great and fundamental doctrine of a providence the belief of which is of such consequence to us as to be the great support and comfort of our lives  justly therefore might the psalmist upon this declaration  that the lord is king  conclude that the earth may be glad thereof yea the multitude of the isles may be glad thereof  may god grant the persuasion may make us as virtuous as it has reason to make us joyful and that it may bring forth in us the fruits of good living to his praise and glory to whom be all might majesty and dominion now and for evermore amen  sermon ix the character of herod preached on innocents day sermon ix matthew ii      then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying  in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachael weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not   the words which st matthew cites here as fulfilled by the cruelty and ambition of herod  are in the   st chapter of jeremiah   th verse in the foregoing chapter the prophet having declared gods intention of turning the mourning of his people into joy by the restoration of the tribes which had been led away captive into babylon he proceeds in the beginning of this chapter which contains this prophecy to give a more particular description of the great joy and festivity of that promised day when they were to return once more to their own land to enter upon their ancient possessions and enjoy again all the privileges they had lost and amongst others and what was above them all  the favor and protection of god and the continuation of his mercies to them and their posterity  to make therefore the impression of this change the stronger upon their minds  he gives a very pathetic representation of the preceding sorrow on that day when they were first led away captive  thus says the lord a voice was heard in rama lamentation and bitter weeping rachael weeping for her children refused to be comforted because they were not  to enter into the full sense and beauty of this description it is to be remembered that the tomb of rachael jacobs beloved wife as we read in the   th of genesis was situated near rama and betwixt that place and bethlehem upon which circumstance the prophet raises one of the most affecting scenes that could be conceived for as the tribes in their sorrowful journey betwixt rama and bethlehem in their way to babylon were supposed to pass by this monumental pillar of their ancestor rachael jacobs wife the prophet by a common liberty in rhetoric introduces her as rising up out of her sepulcher and as the common mother of two of their tribes weeping for her children bewailing the sad catastrophe of her posterity led away into a strange land  refusing to be comforted because they were not  lost and cut off from their country and in all likelihood never to be restored back to her again  the jewish interpreters say upon this that the patriarch jacob buried rachael in this very place foreseeing by the spirit of prophecy that his posterity should that way be led captive that she might as they passed her intercede for them   but this fanciful superstructure upon the passage seems to be little else than a mere dream of some of the jewish doctors and indeed had they not dreamed it when they did it is great odds but some of the romish dreamers would have hit upon it before now for as it favors the doctrine of intercessions  if there had not been undeniable vouchers for the real inventors of the conceit one should much sooner have sought for it amongst the oral traditions of this church than in the talmud where it is   but this by the bye there is still another interpretation of the words here cited by st matthew which altogether excludes this scenecal representation i have given of them  by which it is thought that the lamentation of rachael here described has no immediate reference to rachael jacobs wife but that it simply alludes to the sorrows of her descendents the distressed mothers of the tribes of benjamin and ephraim who might accompany their children led into captivity as far as rama in their way to babylon who wept and wailed upon this sad occasion and as the prophet describes them in the person of rachael refusing to be comforted for the loss of her children looking upon their departure without hope or prospect of ever beholding a return  which ever of the two senses you give the words of the prophet the application of them by the evangelist is equally just and faithful for as the former scene he relates was transacted upon the very same stage  in the same district of bethlehem near rama  where so many mothers of the same tribe now suffered this second most affecting blow  the words of jeremiah as the evangelist observes were literally accomplished and no doubt in that horrid day a voice was heard again in rama lamentation and bitter weeping  rachael weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted  every bethlemitish mother involved in this calamity beholding it with hopeless sorrow  gave vent to it  each one bewailing her children and lamenting the hardness of their lot with the anguish of a heart as incapable of consolation as they were of redress monster  could no consideration of all this tender sorrow stay thy hands  could no reflection upon so much bitter lamentation throughout the coasts of bethlehem interpose and plead in behalf of so many wretched objects as this tragedy would make  was there no way open to ambition but that thou must trample upon the affections of nature could no pity for the innocence of childhood  no sympathy for the yernings of parental love incline thee to some other measures for thy security  but thou must thus pitilessly rush in  take the victim by violence  tear it from the embraces of the mother  offer it up before her eyes  leave her disconsolate for ever  brokenhearted with a loss  so affecting in itself  so circumstanced with horror that no time how friendly soever to the mournful  should ever be able to wear out the impressions  there is nothing in which the mind of man is more divided than in the accounts of this horrid nature  for when we consider man as fashioned by his maker  innocent and upright  full of the tenderest dispositions  with a heart inclining him to kindness and the love and protection of his species  this idea of him would almost shake the credit of such accounts  so that to clear them  we are forced to take a second view of man  very different from this favorable one in which we insensibly represent him to our imaginations  that is  we are obliged to consider him  not as he was made  but as he is  a creature by the violence and irregularity of his passions capable of being perverted from all these friendly and benevolent propensities and sometimes hurried into excesses so opposite to them as to render the most unnatural and horrid accounts of what he does but too probable  the truth of this observation will be exemplifyed in the case before us for next to the faith and character of the historian who reports such facts  the particular character of the person who committed them is to be considered as a voucher for their truth and credibility  and if upon enquiry it appears that the man acted but consistent with himself  and just so as you would have expected from his principles  the credit of the historian is restored  and the fact related stands incontestable from so strong and concurring an evidence on its side   with this view it may not be an unacceptable application of the remaining part of a discourse upon this day to give you a sketch of the character of herod not as drawn from scripture  for in general it furnishes us with few materials for such descriptions  the sacred scripture cuts off in few words the history of the ungodly how great soever they were in the eyes of the world  and on the other hand dwells largely upon the smallest actions of the righteous  we find all the circumstances of the lives of abraham isaac jacob and joseph recorded in the minutest manner  the wicked seem only mentioned with regret just brought upon the stage on purpose to be condemned the use and advantage of which conduct  is i suppose the reason  as in general it enlarges on no character but what is worthy of imitation it is however undeniable that the lives of bad men are not without use  and whenever such a one is drawn not with a corrupt view to be admired  but on purpose to be detested  it must excite such an horror against vice as will strike indirectly the same good impression and though it is painful to the last degree to paint a man in the shades which his vices have cast upon him  yet when it serves this end and at the same time illustrates a point in sacred history  it carries its own excuse with it  this herod therefore of whom the evangelist speaks if you take a superficial view of his life you would say was a compound of good and evil  that though he was certainly a bad man  yet you would think the mass was tempered at the same time with a mixture of good qualities so that in course as is not uncommon he would appear with two characters very different from each other if you looked on the more favorable side you would see a man of great address  popular in his behavior  generous princelike in his entertainments and expenses and in a word set off with all such virtues and shewy properties as bid high for the countenance and approbation of the world  view him in another light he was an ambitious designing man  suspicious of all the world  rapacious  implacable in his temper  without sense of religion  or feeling of humanity  now in all such complex characters as this  the way the world usually judges is  to sum up the good and the bad against each other  deduct the lesser of these articles from the greater and as we do in passing other accounts give credit to the man for what remains upon the balance now though this seems a fair  yet i fear it is often a fallacious reckoning  which though it may serve in many ordinary cases of private life yet will not hold good in the more notorious instances of mens lives especially when so complicated with good and bad as to exceed all common bounds and proportions not to be deceived in such cases we must work by a different rule which though it may appear less candid  yet to make amends i am persuaded will bring us in general much nearer to the thing we want  which is truth the way to which is  in all judgments of this kind to distinguish and carry in your eye the principle and ruling passion which leads the character  and separate that from the other parts of it  and then take notice how far his other qualities good and bad are brought to serve and support that for want of this distinction  we often think ourselves inconsistent creatures when we are the furthest from it and all the variety of shapes and contradictory appearances we put on are in truth but so many different attempts to gratify the same governing appetite   with this clew let us endeavor to unravel this character of herod as here given  the first thing which strikes one in it is ambition an immoderate thirst as well as jealousy of power  how inconsistent soever in other parts his character appears invariable in this and every action of his life was true to it  from hence we may venture to conclude that this was his ruling passion  and that most if not all the other wheels were put in motion by this first spring now let us consider how far this was the case in fact  to begin with the worst part of him  i said he was a man of no sense of religion or at least no other sense of it but that which served his turn  for he is recorded to have built temples in judea and erected images in them for idolatrous worship  not from a persuasion of doing right for he was bred a jew and consequently taught to abhor all idolatry  but he was in truth sacrificing all this time to a greater idol of his own his ruling passion for if we may trust josephus his sole view in so gross a compliance was to ingratiate himself with augustus and the great men of rome from whom he held his power  with this he was greedy and rapacious  how could he be otherwise with so devouring an appetite as ambition to provide for  he was jealous in his nature and suspicious of all the world  show me an ambitious man that is not so for as such a mans hand like ishmaels is against every man he concludes that every mans hand in course is against his  few men were ever guilty of more astonishing acts of cruelty  and yet the particular instances of them in herod were such as he was hurried into by the alarms this waking passion perpetually gave him he put the whole sanadrim to the sword  sparing neither age or wisdom or merit  one cannot suppose simply from an inclination to cruelty  no  they had opposed the establishment of his power at jerusalem  his own sons two hopeful youths he cut off by a public execution  the worst men have natural affection  and such a stroke as this would run so contrary to the natural workings of it that you are forced to suppose the impulse of some more violent inclination to overrule and conquer it  and so it was for the jewish historian tells us twas jealousy of power  his darling object  of which he feared they would one day or other dispossess him  sufficient inducement to transport a man of such a temper into the bloodiest excesses  thus far this one fatal and extravagant passion accounts for the dark side of herods character this governing principle being first laid open  all his other bad actions follow in course like so many symptomatic complaints from the same distemper  let us see if this was not the case even of his virtues too  at first sight it seems a mystery  how a man so black as herod has been thus far described  should be able to support himself in the favor and friendship of so wise and penetrating a body of men as the roman senate of whom he held his power to counterballance the weight of so bad and detested a character  and be able to bear it up as herod did one would think he must have been master of some great secret worth enquiring after  he was so but that secret was no other than what appears on this reverse of his character he was a person of great address  popular in his outward behavior  he was generous princelike in his entertainments and expenses the world was then as corrupt at least as now  and herod understood it  knew at what price it was to be bought  and what qualities would bid the highest for its good word and approbation  and in truth he judged this matter so well  that notwithstanding the general odium and prepossession which arose against so hateful a character  in spite of all the ill impressions from so many repeated complaints of his cruelties and oppressions  he yet stemmed the torrent  and by the specious display of these popular virtues bore himself up against it all his life so that at length when he was summoned to rome to answer for his crimes  josephus tells us  that by the mere magnificence of his expenses  and the apparent generosity of his behavior he entirely confuted the whole charge  and so ingratiated himself with the roman senate  and won the heart of augustus  as he had that of anthony before that he ever after had his favor and kindness which i cannot mention without adding  that it is an eternal stain upon the character and memory of augustus that he sold his countenance and protection to so bad a man for so mean and base a consideration  from this point of view if we look back upon herod  his best qualities will shrink into little room and how glittering soever in appearance when brought to this balance are found wanting and in truth if we would not willingly be deceived in the value of any virtue or set of virtues in so complex a character  we must call them to this very account examine whom they serve what passion and what principle they have for their master when this is understood the whole clew is unravelled at once and the character of herod as complicated as it is given us in history  when thus analyzed is summed up in three words  that he was a man of unbounded ambition who stuck at nothing to gratify it  so that not only his vices were ministerial to his ruling passion but his virtues too if they deserve the name were drawn in and listed into the same service  thus much for this character of herod  the critical review of which has many obvious uses to which i may trust you having time but to mention that particular one which first led me into this examination namely that all objections against the evangelists account of this days slaughter of the bethlemitish infants  from the incredibility of so horrid an account  are silenced by this account of the man since in this he acted but like himself and just so as you would expect in the same circumstances from every man of so ambitious a head  and so bad a heart  consider what havoc ambition has made  how often the same tragedy has been acted upon larger theaters  where not only the innocence of childhood  or the gray hairs of the aged have found no protection  but whole countries without distinction have been put to the sword or what is as cruel have been driven forth to nakedness and famine to make way for new comers under the guidance of this passion  for a specimen of this reflect upon the story related by plutarch  when by order of the roman senate seventy populous cities were unawares sacked and destroyed at one prefixed hour by p aemilius  by whom one hundred and fifty thousand unhappy people were driven in one day into captivity  to be sold to the highest bidder to end their days in cruel labor and anguish as astonishing as the account before us is it vanishes into nothing from such views since it is plain from all history that there is no wickedness too great for so unbounded a cause and that the most horrid accounts in history are as i said above but too probable effects of it   may god of his mercy defend mankind from future experiments of this kind  and grant we may make a proper use of them for the sake of jesus christ amen  sermon x jobs account of the shortness and troubles of life considered sermon x job xiv     man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble  he comes forth like a flower and is cut down he flees also as a shadow and continues not   there is something in this reflection of holy jobs upon the shortness of life and instability of human affairs so beautiful and truly sublime that one might challenge the writings of the most celebrated orators of antiquity to produce a specimen of eloquence so noble and thoroughly affecting whether this effect be owing in some measure to the pathetic nature of the subject reflected on  or to the eastern manner of expression in a style more exalted and suitable to so great a subject or which is the more likely account because they are properly the words of that being who first inspired man with language and taught his mouth to utter who opened the lips of the dumb and made the tongue of the infant eloquent  to which of these we are to refer the beauty and sublimity of this as well as that of numberless other passages in holy writ may not seem how material but surely without these helps never man was better qualified to make just and noble reflections upon the shortness of life and instability of human affairs than job was who had himself waded through such a sea of troubles and in his passage had encountered many vicissitudes of storms and sunshine and by turns had felt both the extremes of all the happiness and all the wretchedness that mortal man is heir to  the beginning of his days was crowned with every thing that ambition could wish for  he was the greatest of all the men of the east  had large and unbounded possessions and no doubt enjoyed all the comforts and advantages of life which they could administer  perhaps you will say a wise man might not be inclined to give a full loose to this kind of happiness without some better security for the support of it than the mere possession of such goods of fortune which often slip from under us and sometimes unaccountably make themselves wings and fly away  but he had that security too  for the hand of providence which had thus far protected was still leading him forwards and seemed engaged in the preservation and continuance of these blessings  god had set a hedge about him and about all that he had on every side he had blessed all the works of his hands and his substance increased every day indeed even with this security riches to him that has neither child or brother as the wise man observes instead of a comfort prove sometimes a fore travel and vexation  the mind of man is not always satisfied with the reasonable assurance of its own enjoyments but will look forwards and if it discovers some imaginary void the want of some beloved object to fill his place after him will often disquiet itself in vain and say  for whom do i labor and bereave myself of rest  this bar to his happiness god had likewise taken away in blessing him with a numerous offspring of sons and daughters the apparent inheriters of all his present happiness  pleasing reflection to think the blessings god has indulged ones self in shall be handed and continued down to a mans own seed how little does this differ from a second enjoyment of them to an affectionate parent who naturally looks forwards with as strong an interest upon his children as if he was to live over again in his own posterity  what could be wanting to finish such a picture of a happy man  surely nothing except a virtuous disposition to give a relish to these blessings and direct him to make a proper use of them  he had that too for  he was a perfect and upright man one that feared god and eschewed evil  in the midst of all this prosperity which was as great as could well fall to the share of one man  whilst all the world looked gay and smiled upon him and every thing round him seemed to promise if possible an increase of happiness in one instant all is changed into sorrow and utter despair   it pleases god for wise purposes to blast the fortunes of his house and cut off the hopes of his posterity and in one mournful day to bring this great prince from his palace down to the dunghill his flocks and herds in which consisted the abundance of his wealth were part consumed by a fire from heaven the remainder taken away by the sword of the enemy his sons and daughters whom it is natural to imagine so good a man had so brought up in a sense of their duty as to give him all reasonable hopes of much joy and pleasure in their future lives  natural prospect for a parent to look forwards at to recompense him for the many cares and anxieties which their infancy had cost him these dear pledges of his future happiness were all all snatched from him at one blow just at the time that one might imagine they were beginning to be the comfort and delight of his old age which most wanted such staves to lean on  and as circumstances add to an evil so they did to this  for it fell out not only by a very calamitous accident which was grievous enough in itself but likewise upon the back of his other misfortunes when he was ill prepared to bear such a shock and what would still add to it it happened at an hour when he had least reason to expect it when he would naturally think his children secure and out of the way of danger for whilst they were feasting and making merry in their eldest brothers house a great wind out of the wilderness smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon them  such a concurrence of misfortunes are not the common lot of many and yet there are instances of some who have undergone as severe trials and bravely struggled under them perhaps by natural force of spirits the advantages of health and the cordial assistance of a friend and with these helps what may not a man sustain  but this was not jobs case for scarce had these evils fallen upon him when he was not only borne down with a grievous distemper which afflicted him from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot but likewise his three friends in whose kind consolations he might have found a medicine  even the wife of his bosom whose duty it was with a gentle hand to have softened all his sorrows instead of doing this they cruelly insulted and became the reproachers of his integrity o god what is man when thou thus bruisest him and make his burden heavier as his strength grows less  who that had found himself thus an example of the many changes and chances of this mortal life  when he considered himself now stripped and left destitute of so many valuable blessings which the moment before thy providence had poured upon his head  when he reflected upon this gay delightsome structure in appearance so strongly built so pleasingly surrounded with every thing that could flatter his hopes and wishes and beheld it all levelled with the ground in one moment and the whole prospect vanish with it like the description of an enchantment  who i say that had seen and felt the shock of so sudden a revolution would not have been furnished with just and beautiful reflections upon the occasion and said with job in the words of the text that man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of misery  that he comes forth like a flower and is cut down he flees also as a shadow and continues not  the words of the text are an epitome of the natural and moral vanity of man and contain two distinct declarations concerning his state and condition in each respect  first that he is a creature of few days and secondly that those days are full of trouble  i shall make some reflections upon each of these in their order and conclude with a practical lesson from the whole  and first that he is of few days the comparison which job makes use of that man comes forth like a flower is extremely beautiful and more to the purpose than the most elaborate proof which in truth the subject will not easily admit of  the shortness of life being a point so generally complained of in all ages since the flood and so universally felt and acknowledged by the whole species as to require no evidence beyond a similitude the intent of which is not so much to prove the fact as to illustrate and place it in such a light as to strike us and bring the impression home to ourselves in a more affecting manner  man comes forth says job like a flower and is cut down  he is sent into the world the fairest and noblest part of gods works  fashioned after the image of his creator with respect to reason and the great faculties of the mind he comes forth glorious as the flower of the field as it surpasses the vegetable world in beauty so does he the animal world in the glory and excellencies of his nature  the one  if no untimely accident oppress it soon arrives at the full period of its perfection  is suffered to triumph for a few moments and is plucked up by the roots in the very pride and gayest stage of its being  or if it happens to escape the hands of violence in a few days it necessarily sickens of itself and dies away  man likewise though his progress is slower and his duration something longer yet the periods of his growth and declension are nearly the same both in the nature and manner of them  if he escapes the dangers which threaten his tenderer years he is soon got into the full maturity and strength of life and if he is so fortunate as not to be hurried out of it then by accidents by his own folly or intemperance  if he escapes these he naturally decays of himself  a period comes fast upon him beyond which he was not made to last  like a flower or fruit which may be plucked up by force before the time of their maturity yet cannot be made to outgrow the period when they are to fade and drop of themselves when that comes the hand of nature then plucks them both off and no art of the botanist can uphold the one or skill of the physician preserve the other beyond the periods to which their original frames and constitutions were made to extend as god has appointed and determined the several growths and decays of the vegetable race so he seems as evidently to have prescribed the same laws to man as well as all living creatures in the first rudiments of which there are contained the specific powers of their growth duration and extinction and when the evolutions of those animal powers are exhausted and run down the creature expires and dies of itself as ripe fruit falls from the tree or a flower preserved beyond its bloom droops and perishes upon the stalk  thus much for this comparison of jobs which though it is very poetical yet conveys a just idea of the thing referred to  that he flees also as a shadow and continues not  is no less a faithful and fine representation of the shortness and vanity of human life of which one cannot give a better explanation than by referring to the original from whence the picture was taken  with how quick a succession do days months and years pass over our heads  how truly like a shadow that departs do they flee away insensibly and scarce leave an impression with us  when we endeavor to call them back by reflection and consider in what manner they have gone how unable are the best of us to give a tolerable account  and were it not for some of the more remarkable stages which have distinguished a few periods of this rapid progress  we should look back upon it all as nebuchadnezzar did upon his dream when he awoke in the morning  he was sensible many things had passed and troubled him too but had passed on so quickly they had left no footsteps behind by which he could be enabled to trace them back  melancholy account of the life of man which generally runs on in a such a manner as scarce to allow time to make reflections which way it has gone  how many of our first years slide by in the innocent sports of childhood in which we are not able to make reflections upon them  how many more thoughtless years escape us in our youth when we are unwilling to do it and are so eager in the pursuit of pleasure as to have no time to spare to stop and consider them  when graver and riper years come on and we begin to think it time to reform and set up for men of sense and conduct then the business and perplexing interests of this world and the endless plotting and contriving how to make the most of it do so wholly employ us that we are too busy to waste reflections upon so unprofitable a subject  as families and children increase so do our affections and with them are multiplied our cares and toils for their preservation and establishment  all which take up our thoughts so closely and possess them so long that we are often overtaken by gray hairs before we see them or have found leisure to consider how far we were got  what we have been doing  and for what purpose god sent us into the world as man may justly be said to be of few days considered with respect to this hasty succession of things which soon carries him into the decline of his life so may he likewise be said to flee like a shadow and continue not when his duration is compared with other parts of gods works and even the works of his own hands which outlast him many generations  whilst his  as homer observes like leaves one generation drops and another springs up to fall again and be forgotten  but when we further consider his days in the light in which we ought chiefly to view them as they appear in thy sight o god with whom a thousand years are but as yesterday when we reflect that this handbreadth of life is all that is measured out to us from that eternity for which he is created how does his short span vanish to nothing in the comparison it is true the greatest portion of time will do the same when compared with what is to come and therefore so short and transitory a one as threescore years and ten beyond which all is declared to be labor and sorrow may the easier be allowed and yet how uncertain are we of that portion short as it is do not ten thousand accidents break off the slender thread of human life long before it can be drawn out to that extent  the newborn babe falls down an easy prey and moulders back again into dust like a tender blossom put forth in an untimely hour  the hopeful youth in the very pride and beauty of life is cut off some cruel distemper or unthought of accident lays him prostrate upon the earth to pursue jobs comparison like a blooming flower smit and shrivelled up with a malignant blast  in this stage of life chances multiply upon us  the seeds of disorders are sown by intemperance or neglect  infectious distempers are more easily contracted when contracted they rage with greater violence and the success in many cases is more doubtful insomuch that they who have exercised themselves in computations of this kind tell us that one half of the whole species which are born into the world go out of it again and are all dead in so short a space as the first seventeen years  these reflections may be sufficient to illustrate the first part of jobs declaration  that man is of few days let us examine the truth of the other and see whether he is not likewise full of trouble  and here we must not take our account from the flattering outside of things which are generally set off with a glittering appearance enough especially in what is called higher life  nor can we safely trust the evidence of some of the more merry and thoughtless amongst us who are so set upon the enjoyment of life as seldom to reflect upon the troubles of it  or who perhaps because they are not yet come to this portion of their inheritance imagine it is not their common lot  nor lastly are we to form an idea of it from the delusive stories of a few of the more prosperous passengers who have fortunately sailed through and escaped the rougher toils and distresses but we are to take our accounts from a close survey of human life and the real face of things stripped of every thing that can palliate or gild it over we must hear the general complaint of all ages and read the histories of mankind if we look into them and examine them to the bottom what do they contain but the history of sad and uncomfortable passages which a goodnatured man cannot read but with oppression of spirits  consider the dreadful succession of wars in one part or other of the earth perpetuated from one century to another with so little intermission that mankind have scarce had time to breathe from them since ambition first came into the world consider the horrid effects of them in all those barbarous devastations we read of where whole nations have been put to the sword or have been driven out to nakedness and famine to make room for new comers for a specimen of this let us reflect upon the story related by plutarch when by order of the roman senate seventy populous cities were unawares sacked and destroyed at one prefixed hour by p aemilius by whom one hundred and fifty thousand unhappy people were driven in one day into captivity to be sold to the highest bidder to end their days in cruel anguish  consider how great a part of our species in all ages down to this have been trod under the feet of cruel and capricious tyrants who would neither hear their cries nor pity their distresses  consider slavery  what it is  how bitter a draught and how many millions have been made to drink of it  which if it can poison all earthly happiness when exercised barely upon our bodies what must it be when it comprehends both the slavery of body and mind  to conceive this look into the history of the romish church and her tyrants or rather executioners who seem to have taken pleasure in the pangs and convulsions of their fellow creatures  examine the prisons of the inquisition hear the melancholy notes sounded in every cell  consider the anguish of mocktrials and the exquisite tortures consequent thereupon mercilessly inflicted upon the unfortunate where the racked and weary soul has so often wished to take its leave  but cruelly not suffered to depart  consider how many of these helpless wretches have been haled from thence in all periods of this tyrannic usurpation so undergo the massacres and flames to which a false and a bloody religion has condemned them if this sad history and detail of the mere public causes of the miseries of man are not sufficient let us behold him in another light with respect to the more private causes of them and see whether he is not full of trouble likewise there and almost born to it as naturally as the sparks fly upwards if we consider man as a creature full of wants and necessities whether real or imaginary which he is not able to supply of himself what a train of disappointments vexations and dependencies are to be seen issuing from thence to perplex and make his being uneasy  how many justlings and hard struggles do we undergo in making our way in the world  how barbarously held back  how often and basely overthrown in aiming only at getting bread  how many of us never attain it  at least not comfortably  but from various unknown causes  eat it all their lives long in bitterness  if we shift the scene and look upwards toward those whose situation in life seems to place them above the sorrows of this kind yet where are they exempt from others do not all ranks and conditions of men meet with sad accidents and numberless calamities in other respects which often make them go heavily all their lives long  how many fall into chronical infirmities which render both their days and nights restless and insupportable  how many of the highest rank are tore up with ambition or soured with disappointments and how many more from a thousand secret causes of disquiet pine away in silence and owe their deaths to sorrow and dejection of heart  if we cast our eyes upon the lowest class and condition of life  the scene is more melancholy still  millions of our fellow creatures born to no inheritance but poverty and trouble forced by the necessity of their lots to drudgery and painful employments and hard set with that too to get enough to keep themselves and families alive  so that upon the whole when we have examined the true state and condition of human life and have made some allowances for a few fugacious deceitful pleasures there nb most of these reflections upon the miseries of life are taken from wollaston is scarce any thing to be found which contradicts jobs description of it  which ever way we look abroad we see some legible characters of what god first denounced against us that in sorrow we should eat our bread till we returned to the ground from whence we were taken  but some one will say why are we thus to be put out of love with human life to what purpose is it to expose the dark sides of it to us or enlarge upon the infirmities which are natural and consequently out of our power to redress  i answer that the subject is nevertheless of great importance since it is necessary every creature should understand his present state and condition to put him in mind of behaving suitably to it  does not an impartial survey of man  the holding up this glass to show him his defects and natural infirmities naturally tend to cure his pride and cloth him with humility which is a dress that best becomes a shortlived and a wretched creature  does not the consideration of the shortness of our life convince us of the wisdom of dedicating so small a portion to the great purposes of eternity   lastly when we reflect that this span of life short as it is is chequered with so many troubles that there is nothing in this world springs up or can be enjoyed without a mixture of sorrow how insensibly does it incline us to turn our eyes and affections from so gloomy a prospect and fix them upon that happier country where afflictions cannot follow us and where god will wipe away all tears from off our faces for ever and ever amen  sermon xi evilspeaking sermon xi james i    if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceives his own heart this mans religion is vain   of the many duties owing both to god and our neighbor there are scarce any men so bad as not to acquit themselves of some and few so good i fear as to practice all  every man seems willing enough to compound the matter and adopt so much of the system as will least interfere with his principal and ruling passion and for those parts which would occasion a more troublesome opposition to consider them as hard sayings and so leave them for those to practice whose natural tempers are better suited for the struggle so that a man shall be covetous oppressive revengeful neither a lover of truth or common honesty and yet at the same time shall be very religious and so sanctified as not once to fail of paying his morning and evening sacrifice to god so on the other hand a man shall live without god in the world have neither any great sense of religion or indeed pretend to have any and yet be of nicest honor conscientiously just and fair in all his dealings and here it is that men generally betray themselves deceiving as the apostle says their own hearts of which the instances are so various in one degree or other throughout human life that one might safely say the bulk of mankind live in such a contradiction to themselves that there is no character so hard to be met with as one which upon a critical examination will appear altogether uniform and in every point consistent with itself  if such a contrast was only observable in the different stages of a mans life it would cease to be either a matter of wonder or of just reproach age experience and much reflection may naturally enough be supposed to alter a mans sense of things and so entirely to transform him that not only in outward appearances but in the very cast and turn of his mind he may be as unlike and different from the man he was twenty or thirty years ago as he ever was from any thing of his own species this i say is naturally to be accounted for and in some cases might be praiseworthy too but the observation is to be made of men in the same period of their lives that in the same day sometimes in the very same action they are utterly inconsistent and irreconcilable with themselves  look at a man in one light and he shall seem wise penetrating discreet and brave behold him in another point of view and you see a creature all over folly and indiscretion weak and timorous as cowardice and indiscretion can make him a man shall appear gentle courteous and benevolent to all mankind follow him into his own house may be you see a tyrant morose and savage to all whose happiness depends upon his kindness a third in his general behavior is found to be generous disinterested humane and friendly  hear but the sad story of the friendless orphans too credulously trusting all their little substance into his hands and he shall appear more sordid more pitiless and unjust than the injured themselves have bitterness to paint him another shall be charitable to the poor uncharitable in his censures and opinions of all the rest of the world besides  temperate in his appetites intemperate in his tongue shall have too much conscience and religion to cheat the man who trusts him and perhaps as far as the business of debtor and creditor extends shall be just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite yet in matters of full as great concern where he is to have the handling of the parties reputation and good name  the dearest the tenderest property the man has he will do him irreparable damage and rob him there without measure or pity   and this seems to be that particular piece of inconsistency and contradiction which the text is levelled at in which the words seem so pointed as if st james had known more flagrant instances of this kind of delusion than what had fallen under the observation of any of the rest of the apostles he being more remarkably vehement and copious upon that subject than any other  doubtless some of his converts had been notoriously wicked and licentious in this remorseless practice of defamation and evilspeaking perhaps the holy man though spotless as an angel for no character is too sacred for calumny to blacken had grievously suffered himself and as his blessed master foretold him had been cruelly reviled and evil spoken of  all his labors in the gospel his unaffected and perpetual solicitude for the preservation of his flock his watchings his fastings his poverty his natural simplicity and innocence of life all perhaps were not enough to defend him from this unruly weapon so full of deadly poison and what in all likelihood might move his sorrow and indignation more some who seemed the most devout and zealous of all his converts were the most merciless and uncharitable in that respect having a of godliness full of bitter envyings and strife  with such it is that he expostulates so largely in the third chapter of his epistle and there is something in his vivacity tempered with such affection and concern as well suited the character of an inspired man my brethren says the apostle these things ought not to be  the wisdom that is from above is pure peaceable gentle full of mercy without partiality without hypocrisy the wisdom from above  that heavenly religion which i have preached to you is pure alike and consistent with itself in all its parts like its great author it is universally kind and benevolent in all cases and circumstances its first glad tidings were peace upon earth good will toward men its chief corner stone its most distinguishing character is love that kind principle which brought it down in the pure exercise of which consists the chief enjoyment of heaven from whence it came but this practice my brethren comes not from above but is earthly sensual devilish full of confusion and every evil work reflect then a moment can a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries either a vine figs lay your hands upon your hearts and let your consciences speak  ought not the same just principle which restrains you from cruelty and wrong in one case equally to withhold you from it in another  should not charity and good will like the principle of life circulating through the smallest vessels in every member ought it not to operate as regularly upon you throughout as well upon your words as upon your actions  if a man is wise and endued with knowledge let him show it out of a good conversation with meekness of wisdom but  if any man amongst you seems to be religious  seems to be  for truly religious he cannot be  and bridleth not his tongue but deceives his own heart this mans religion is vain  this is the full force of st jamess reasoning upon which i have dwelt the more it being the foundation upon which is grounded this clear decision of the matter left us in the text in which the apostle seems to have set the two characters of a saint and a slanderer at such variance that one would have thought they could never have had a heart to have met together again but there are no alliances too strange for this world  how many may we observe every day even of the gentler sex as well as our own who without conviction of doing much wrong in the midst of a full career of calumny and defamation rise up punctual at the stated hour of prayer leave the cruel story half untold till they return  go  and kneel down before the throne of heaven thank god that he had not made them like others and that his holy spirit had enabled them to perform the duties of the day in so christian and conscientious a manner  this delusive itch for slander too common in all ranks of people whether to gratify a little ungenerous resentment  whether oftener out of a principle of levelling from a narrowness and poverty of soul ever impatient of merit and superiority in others whether a mean ambition or the insatiate lust of being wity a talent in which ill nature and malice are no ingredients  or lastly whether from a natural cruelty of disposition abstracted from all views and considerations of self to which one or whether to all jointly we are indebted for this contagious malady thus much is certain from whatever seeds it springs its growth and progress of it are as destructive to as they are unbecoming a civilized people to pass a hard and illnatured reflection upon an undesigning action to invent or which is equally bad to propagate a vexatious report without color and grounds to plunder an innocent man of his character and good name a jewel which perhaps he has starved himself to purchase and probably would hazard his life to secure to rob him at the same time of his happiness and peace of mind perhaps his bread  the bread may be of a virtuous family and all this as solomon says of the madman who casts firebrarnds arrows and death and says am i not in sport all this out of wantonness and oftener from worse motives the whole appears such a complication of badness as requires no words or warmth of fancy to aggravate pride treachery envy hypocrisy malice cruelty and selflove may have been said in one shape or other to have occasioned all the frauds and mischiefs that ever happened in the world but the chances against a coincidence of them all in one person are so many that one would have supposed the character of a common slanderer as rare and difficult a production in nature as that of a great genius which seldom happens above once in an age  but whatever was the case when st james wrote his epistle we have been very successful in later days and have found out the art by a proper management of light and shade to compound all these vices together so as to give body and strength to the whole whilst no one but a discerning artist is able to discover the labors that join in finishing the picture  and indeed like many other bad originals in the world  it stands in need of all the disguise it has  for who could be enamoured of a character made up of so loathsome a compound  could they behold it naked  in its crooked and deformed shape  with all its natural and detested infirmities laid open to public view  and therefore it were to be wished that one could do in this malignant case of the mind  what is generally done for the public good in the more malignant and epidemical cases of the body  that is  when they are found infectious  to write a history of the distemper  and ascertain all the symptoms of the malady so that every one might know whom he might venture to go near with tolerable safety to himself  but alas the symptoms of this appear in so many strange and contradictory shapes and vary so wonderfully with the temper and habit of the patient that they are not to be classed  or reduced to any one regular system  ten thousand are the vehicles in which this deadly poison is prepared and communicated to the world  and by some artful hands it is done by so subtle and nice an infusion that it is not to be tasted or discovered but by its effects  how frequently is the honesty and integrity of a man disposed of by a smile or a shrug  how many good and generous actions have been sunk into oblivion by a distrustful look  or stamped with the imputation of proceeding from bad motives by a mysterious and seasonable whisper  look into companies of those whose gentle natures should disarm them  we shall find no better account  how large a portion of chastity is sent out of the world by distant hints  nodded away and cruelly winked into suspicion by the envy of those who are passed all temptation of it themselves  how often does the reputation of a helpless creature bleed by a report  which the party who is at the pains to propagate it beholds with so much pity and fellowfeeling  that she is heartily sorry for it  hopes in god it is not true  however as archbishop tillotson witily observes upon it is resolved in the mean time to give the report her pass that at least it may have fair play to take its fortune in the world  to be believed or not according to the charity of those into whose hands it shall happen to fall  so fruitful is this vice in variety of expedients to satiate as well as disguise itself but if these smoother weapons cut so sore  what shall we say of open and unblushing scandal  subjected to no caution  tied down to no restraints  if the one like an arrow shot in the dark does nevertheless so much secret mischief  this like the pestilence which rages at noon day sweeps all before it levelling without distinction the good and the bad a thousand fall beside it and ten thousand on its right hand  they fall  so rent and torn in this tender part of them so unmercifully butchered as sometimes never to recover either the wounds  or the anguish of heart  which they have occasioned   but there is nothing so bad which will not admit of something to be said in its defense  and here it may be asked  whether the inconveniences and ill effects which the world feels  from the licentiousness of this practice  are not sufficiently counterballanced by the real influence it has upon mens lives and conduct  that if there was no evilspeaking in the world thousands would be encouraged to do ill  and would rush into many indecorums like a horse into the battle  were they sure to escape the tongues of men  that if we take a general view of the world  we shall find that a great deal of virtue  at least of the outward appearance of it  is not so much from any fixed principle as the terror of what the world will say  and the liberty it will take upon the occasions we shall give  that if we descend to particulars numbers are every day taking more pains to be well spoken of  than what would actually enable them to live so as to deserve it  that there are many of both sexes who can support life well enough without honor or chastity  who without reputation which is but the opinion which the world has of the matter would hide their head in shame and sink down in utter despair of happiness  no doubt the tongue is a weapon which does chastise many indecorums which the laws of men will not reach  and keeps many in awe  whom conscience will not  and where the case is indisputably flagrant  the speaking of it in such words as it deserves  scarce comes within the prohibition  in many cases it is hard to express ourselves so as to fix a distinction betwixt opposite characters  and sometimes it may be as much a debt we owe to virtue and as great a piece of justice to expose a vicious character and paint it in its proper colors  as it is to speak well of the deserving and describe his particular virtues  and indeed when we inflict this punishment upon the bad merely out of principle and without indulgences to any private passion of our own  it is a case which happens so seldom that one might venture to except it  however to those who in this objection are really concerned for the cause of virtue i cannot help recommending what would much more effectually serve her interest and be a surer token of their zeal and attachment to her and that is  in all such plain instances where it seems to be duty to fix a distinction betwixt the good and the bad  to let their actions speak it instead of their words or at least to let them both speak one language we all of us talk so loud against vicious characters and are so unanimous in our cry against them  that an unexperienced man who only trusted his ears would imagine the whole world was in an uproar about it and that mankind were all associating together to hunt vice utterly out of the world  shift the scene  and let him behold the reception which vice meets with  he will see the conduct and behavior of the world toward it so opposite to their declarations  he will find all he heard so contradicted by what he saw  as to leave him in doubt which of his senses he is to trust  or in which of the two cases mankind were really in earnest was there virtue enough in the world to make a general stand against this contradiction  that is  was every one who deserved to be ill spoken of  sure to be ill looked on  too was it a certain consequence of the loss of a mans character  to lose his friends  to lose the advantages of his birth and fortune  and thenceforth be universally shunned universally slighted   was no quality a shelter against the indecorums of the other sex but was every woman without distinction  who had justly forfeited her reputation  from that moment was she sure to forfeit likewise all claim to civility and respect   or in a word  could it be established as a law in our ceremonial  that wherever characters in either sex were become notorious  it should be deemed infamous either to pay or receive a visit from them and that the door shut against them in all public places till they had satisfied the world by giving testimony of a better life  a few such plain and honest maxims faithfully put in practice  would force us upon some degree of reformation till this is done  it avails little that we have no mercy upon them with our tongues since they escape without feeling any other inconvenience  we all cry out that the world is corrupt  and i fear too justly  but we never reflect what we have to thank for it and that it is our open countenance of vice which gives the lie to our private censures of it which is its chief protection and encouragement  to those however who still believe that evilspeaking is some terror to evil doers one may answer as a great man has done upon the occasion  that after all our exhortations against it  it is not to be feared but that there will be evilspeaking enough left in the world to chastise the guilty  and we may safely trust them to an illnatured world that there will be no failure of justice upon this score  the passions of men are pretty severe executioners and to them let us leave this ungrateful task  and rather ourselves endeavor to cultivate that more friendly one recommended by the apostle  of letting all bitterness and wrath and clamor and evilspeaking be put away from us  of being kind to one another  tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake forgave us amen  sermon xii josephs history considered forgiveness of injuries sermon xii genesis l    and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him   there are few instances of the exercise of particular virtues which seem harder to attain to or which appear more amiable and engaging in themselves than those of moderation and the forgiveness of injuries and when the temptations against them happen to be heightened by the bitterness of a provocation on one hand and the fairness of an opportunity to retaliate on the other the instances then are truly great and heroic the words of the text which are the consultation of the sons of jacob amongst themselves upon their father israels death when because it was in josephs power to revenge the deadly injury they had formerly done him they concluded in course that it was in his intention will lead us to a beautiful example of this kind in the character and behavior of joseph consequent thereupon and as it seems a perfect and very engaging pattern of forbearance it may not be improper to make it serve for the groundwork of a discourse upon that subject  the whole transaction from the first occasion given by joseph in his youth to this last act of remission at the conclusion of his life may be said to be a masterpiece of history there is not only in the manner throughout such a happy though uncommon mixture of simplicity and grandeur which is a double character so hard to be united that it is seldom to be met with in compositions merely human  but it is likewise related with the greatest variety of tender and affecting circumstances which would afford matter for reflections useful for the conduct of almost every part and stage of a mans life  but as the words of the text as well as the intention and compass of this discourse particularly confine me to speak only to one point namely the forgiveness of injuries it will be proper only to consider such circumstances of the story as will place this instance of it in its just light and then proceed to make a more general use of the great example of moderation and forbearance which it sets before us  it seems strange at first sight that after the sons of jacob had fallen into josephs power when they were forced by the soreness of the famine to go down into egypt to buy corn and had found him too good a man even to expostulate with them for an injury which he seemed then to have digested and piously to have resolved into the overruling providence of god for the preservation of much people how they could ever after question the uprightness of his intentions or entertain the least suspicion that his reconciliation was dissembled would not one have imagined that the man who had discovered such a goodness of soul that he sought where to weep because he could not bear the struggle of a counterfeited harshness could never be suspected afterward of intending a real one  and that he only waited till their father israels death to requite them all the evil which they had done unto him what still adds to this difficulty is that his affectionate manner of making himself known to them  his goodness in forbearing not only to reproach them for the injury they had formerly done him but extenuating and excusing the fault to themselves his comforting and speaking kindly to them and seconding all with the tenderest marks of an undisguised forgiveness in falling upon their necks and weeping aloud that all the house of pharaoh heard him  that moreover this behavior of joseph could not appear to them to be the effect of any warm and sudden transport which might as suddenly give way to other reflections but that it evidently sprung from a settled principle of uncommon generosity in his nature which was above the temptation of making use of an opportunity for revenge which the course of gods providence had put into his hands for better purposes and what might still seemed to confirm this was the evidence of his actions to them afterward in bringing them and all their household up out of canaan and placing them near him in the land of goshen the richest part of egypt where they had had so many years experience of his love and kindness and yet it is plain all this did not clear his motive from suspicion or at least themselves of some apprehensions of a change in his conduct toward them and was it not that the whole transaction was wrote under the direction of the spirit of truth and that other historians concur in doing justice to josephs character and speak of him as a compassionate and merciful man one would be apt you will say to imagine here that moses might possibly have omitted some circumstances of josephs behavior which had alarmed his brethren betwixt the time of his first reconciliation and that of their fathers death  for they could not be suspicious of his intentions without some cause and fear where no fear was  but does not a guilty conscience often do so  and though it has the grounds yet wants the power to think itself safe  and could we look into the hearts of those who know they deserve ill we should find many an instance where a kindness from an injured hand where there was least reason to expect one has struck deeper and touched the heart with a degree of remorse and concern which perhaps no severity or resentment could have reached this reflection will in some measure help to explain this difficulty which occurs in the story for it is observable that when the injury they had done their brother was first committed and the fact was fresh upon their minds and most likely to have filled them with a sense of guilt we find no acknowledgment or complaint to one another of such a load as one might imagine it had laid upon them and from that event through a long course of years to the time they had gone down to egypt we read not once of any sorrow or compunction of heart which they had felt during all that time for what they had done they had artfully imposed upon their parent  and as men are ingenious casuits in their own affairs they had probably as artfully imposed upon their own consciences  and possibly had never impartially reflected upon the action or considered it in its just light till the many acts of their brothers love and kindness had brought it before them with all the circumstances of aggravation which his behavior would naturally give it  they then began maturely to consider what they had done  that they had first undeservedly hated him in his childhood for that which if it was a ground of complaint ought rather to have been charged upon the indiscretion of the parent than considered as a fault in him that upon a more just examination and a better knowledge of their brother they had wanted even that pretense  it was not a blind partiality which seemed first to have directed their fathers affection to him  though then they thought so  for doubtless so much goodness and benevolence as shone forth in his nature now that he was a man could not lay all of it so deep concealed in his youth but the sagacity of a parents eye would discover it and that in course their enmity toward him was founded upon that which ought to have won their esteem  that if he had incautiously added envy to their ill will in reporting his dreams which presaged his future greatness it was but the indiscretion of a youth unpractised in the world who had not yet found out the art of dissembling his hopes and expectations and was scarce arrived at an age to comprehend there was such a thing in the world as envy and ambition  that if such offenses in a brother so fairly carried their own excuses with them what could they say for themselves when they considered it was for this they had almost unanimously conspired to rob him of his life  and though they were happily restrained from shedding his blood upon reubens remonstrance that they had nevertheless all the guilt of the intention to answer for  that whatever motive it was which then stayed their hands their consciences told them it could not be a good one since they had changed the sentence for one no less cruel in itself and what to an ingenuous nature was worse than death to be sold for a slave  the one was common to all  the other only to the unfortunate that it was not compassion which then took place for had there been any way open to that his tears and entreaties must have found it when they saw the anguish of his soul when he besought and they would not hear  that if aught still could heighten the remorse of banishing a youth without provocation for ever from his country and the protection of his parent to be exposed naked to the buffetings of the world and the rough hand of some merciless master they would find it in this reflection that many afflictions and hardships which they might naturally have expected would overtake the lad consequent upon this action had actually fallen upon him  that besides the anguish of suspected virtue he had felt that of a prison where he had long lain neglected in a friendless condition and where the affliction of it was rendered still sharper by the daily expectations of being remembered by pharoahs chief butler and the disappointment of finding himself ungratefully forgotten  and though moses tells us that he found favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison yet the psalmist acquaints that his sufferings were still grievous  that his feet were hurt with fetters and the iron entered even into his soul and no doubt his brethren thought the sense of their injury must have entered at the same time and was then rivetted and fixed in his mind for ever  it is natural to imagine they argued and reflected in this manner and there seems no necessity of seeking for the reason of their uneasiness and distrust in josephs conduct or any other external cause since the inward workings of their own minds will easily account for the evil they apprehended  a series of benefits and kindnesses from the man they had injured gradually heightened the idea of their own guilt till at length they could not conceive how the trespass could be forgiven them  it appeared with such fresh circumstances of aggravation that though they were convinced his resentment slept yet they thought it only slept and was likely some time or other to awake and most probably then that their father was dead when the consideration of involving him in his revenge had ceased and all the duty and compassion he owed to the gray hairs and happiness of a parent was discharged and buried with him  this they express in the consultation held amongst themselves in the words of the text and in the following verse we find them accordingly sending to him to deprecate the evil they dreaded and either because they thought their fathers name more powerful than their own in this application  or rather that they might not commit a fresh injury in seeming to suspect his sincerity they pretend their fathers direction for we read they sent messengers unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying  so shall ye say unto joseph  forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father the address was not without art and was conceived in such words as seemed to suggest an argument in their favor  as if it would not become him who was but a fellow servant of their fathers god to harbor revenge or use the power their fathers god had given him against his children nor was there a reason in any thing but the fear of a guilty conscience to apprehend it as appears from the reception which the address met which was such as bespoke an uncommon goodness of nature for when they thus spoke unto him  the historian says he wept sympathy for the sorrow and distress of so many sons of his father now all in his power  pain at so open and ingenuous a confession of their guilt  concern and pity for the long punishment they must have endured by so stubborn a remorse which so many years seemed not to have diminished the affecting idea of their condition which had seemed to reduce them to the necessity of holding up their hands for mercy when they had lost their protector  so many tender passions struggling together at once overcame him  he burst into tears which spoke what no language could attempt it will be needless therefore to enlarge any further upon this incident which furnishes us with so beautiful a picture of a compassionate and forgiving temper that i think no words can heighten it  but rather let us endeavor to find out by what helps and reasoning the patriarch might be supposed to attain to so exalted and engaging a virtue perhaps you will say that one so thoroughly convinced as joseph seemed to be of the overruling providence of god which so evidently made use of the malice and passions of men and turns them as instruments in his hands to work his own righteousness and bring about his eternal decrees  and of which his own history was so plain an instance could not have far to seek for an argument to forgiveness or feel much struggle in stifling an inclination against it  but let any man lay his hand upon his heart and say how often in instances where anger and revenge had seized him has this doctrine come in to his aid  in the bitterness of an affront how often has it calmed his passions and checked the fury of his resentment  true and universally believed as the doctrine is amongst us it seldom does this service though so well suited for it and like some wise statute never executed or thought of though in full force lies as unheeded as if it was not in being  it is plain twas otherways in the present instance where joseph seems to acknowledge the influence it had upon him in his declaration   that it was not they but god who sent him and does not this virtue shine the brightest in such a pious application of the persuasion to so benevolent a purpose  without derogating from the merit of his forbearance he might be supposed to have cast an eye upon the change and uncertainty of human affairs which he had seen himself and which had convinced him we were all in anothers power by turns and stand in need of one anothers pity and compassion  and that to restrain the cruelties and stop the insolences of mens resentments god has so ordered it in the course of his providence that very often in this world  our revenges return upon our own heads and mens violent dealings upon their own pates  that besides these considerations  that in generously forgiving an enemy he was the truest friend to his own character and should gain more to it by such an instance of subduing his spirit than if he had taken a city  the brave know only how to forgive  it is the most refined and generous pitch of virtue human nature can arrive at  christian hero coward shave done good and kind actions  cowards have even fought  nay sometimes even conquered  but a coward never forgave  it is not in his nature  the power of doing it flows only from a strength and greatness of soul conscious of its own force and security and above the little temptations of resenting every fruitless attempt to interrupt its happiness moreover setting aside all considerations of his character in passing by an injury he was the truest friend likewise to his own happiness and peace of mind he neither felt that fretful storm of passions which hurry men on to acts of revenge or suffered those pangs of horror which pursue it  thus he might possibly argue and no further  for want of a better foundation and better helps he could raise the building no higher  to carry it upwards to its perfection we must call in to our aid that more spiritual and refined doctrine introduced upon it by christ namely to forgive a brother not only to seven times but to seventy times  that is without limitation  in this the excellency of the gospel is said by some one to appear with a remarkable advantage that a christian is as much disposed to love and serve you when your enemy as the mere moral man can be when he is your friend  this no doubt is the tendency of his religion  but how often or in what degrees it succeeds  how nearly the practice keeps pace with the theory the allwise searcher into the hearts of men alone is able to determine but it is to be feared that such great effects are not so sensibly felt as a speculative man would expect from such powerful motives and there is many a christian society which would be glad to compound amongst themselves for some lesser degrees of perfection on one hand were they sure to be exempted on the other from the bad effects of those fretful passions which are ever taking as well as ever giving the occasions of strife the beginnings of which solomon aptly compares to the letting out of waters the opening a breach which no one can be sure to stop till it has proceeded to the most fatal events  with justice therefore might the son of syrach conclude concerning pride that secret stream which administers to the overflowings of resentments that it was not made for man nor furious anger for him that is born of a woman that the one did not become his station and that the other was destructive to all the happiness he was intended to receive from it how miserably then must those men turn tyrants against themselves as well as others who grow splenetic and revengeful not only upon the little unavoidable oppositions and offenses they must meet with in the commerce of the world but upon those which only reach them by report and accordingly torment their little souls with meditating how to return the injury before they are certain they have received one whether this eager sensibility of wrongs and resentment arises from that general cause to which the son of syrach seems to reduce all fierce anger and passion or whether to a certain soreness of temper which stands in every bodys way and therefore subject to be often hurt from which ever cause the disorder springs the advice of the author of the book of ecclesiasticus is proper admonish a friend says he it may be he has not done it and if he have that he do it not again admonish thy friend it may be he has not said it and if he have that he speak it not again there is that slippeth in his speech but not from his heart and who is he who has not offended with his tongue  i cannot help taking notice here of a certain species of forgiveness which is seldom enforced or thought of and yet is no way below our regard i mean the forgiveness of those if we may be allowed the expression whom we have injured ourselves one would think that the difficulty of forgiving could only rest on the side of him who has received the wrong but the truth of the fact is often otherwise the consciousness of having provoked anothers resentment often excites the aggressor to keep beforehand with the man he has hurt and not only to hate him for the evil he expects in return but even to pursue him down and put it out of his power to make reprisals  the baseness of this is such that it is sufficient to make the same observation which was made upon the crime of parricide amongst the grecians  it was so black  their legislators did not suppose it could be committed and therefore made no law to punish it  sermon xiii duty of setting bounds to our desires sermon xiii   kings iv    and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou have been careful for us with all this care  what is to be done for thee  would thou be spoken for to the king or the captain of the host  and she answered i dwell among mine own people   the first part of the text is the words which the prophet elisha puts into the mouth of his servant gehazi as a message of thanks to the woman of shunem for her great kindness and hospitality of which after the acknowledgment of his just sense which gehazi is bid to deliver in the words  behold thou have been careful for us with all this care  he directs him to enquire in what manner he may best make a return in discharge of the obligation  what shall be done for thee would thou be spoken for to the king or the captain of the host the last part of the text is the shunamites answer which implies a refusal of the honor or advantage which the prophet intended to bring upon her by such an application which she indirectly expresses in her contentment and satisfaction with what she enjoyed in her present station i dwell among mine own people this instance of selfdenial in the shunamite is but properly the introduction to her story and gives rise to that long and very pathetic transaction which follows in the supernatural grant of a child which god had many years denied her  the affecting loss of him as soon as he was grown up  and his restoration to life by elisha after he had been some time dead the whole of which though extremely interesting and from such incidents as would afford sufficient matter for instruction yet as it will not fall within the intention of this discourse i shall beg leave at this time barely to consider these previous circumstances of it to which the text confines me upon which i shall enlarge with such reflections as occur and then proceed to that practical use and exhortation which will naturally fall from it  we find that after elisha had rescued the distressed widow and her two sons from the hands of the creditor by the miraculous multiplication of her oil  that he passed on to shunem where we read was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as often as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread the sacred historian speaks barely of her temporal condition and station in life  that she was a great woman but describes not the more material part of her her virtues and character because they were more evidently to be discovered from the transaction itself from which it appears that she was not only wealthy but likewise charitable and of a very considerate turn of mind for after many repeated invitations and entertainments at her house finding his occasions called him to a frequent passage that way  she moves her husband to set up and furnish a lodging for him with all the conveniences which the simplicity of those times required and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is an holy man of god which passes by us continually let us make him a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he comes to us that he shall turn in thither  she perceived he was a holy man  she had had many opportunities as he passed by them continually of observing his behavior and deportment which she had carefully remarked and saw plainly what he was that the sanctity and simplicity of his manners  the severity of his life  his zeal for the religion of his god and the uncommon fervency of his devotion when he worshipped before him which seemed his whole business and employment upon earth  all bespoke him not a man of this world but one whose heart and affections were fixed upon another object which was dearer and more important to him but as such outward appearances may and often have been counterfeited so that the actions of a man are certainly the only interpreters to be relied on whether such colors are true or false  so she had heard that all was of a piece there and that he was throughout consistent that he had never in any one instance of his life acted as if he had any views in the affairs of this world in which he had never interested himself at all but where the glory of his god or the good and preservation of his fellow creatures at first inclined him  that in a late instance before he came to shunem he had done one of the kindest and most charitable actions that a good man could have done in assisting the widow and fatherless  and as the fact was singular and had just happened before her knowledge of him no doubt she had heard the story with all the tender circumstances which a true report would give it in his favor namely that a certain woman whose husband was lately dead and had left her with her children in a very helpless condition  very destitute  and what was still worse charged with a debt she was not able to pay  that her creditor bore exceeding hard upon her and finding her little worth in substance was coming to take the advantage which the law allowed of seizing her two sons for his bondsmen  so that she had not only lost her husband which had made her miserable enough already but was going to be bereaved of her children which were the only comfort and support of her life that upon her coming to elisha with this sad story he was touched with compassion for her misfortunes and had used all the power and interest which he had with his god to relieve and befriend her which in an unheard of manner by the miraculous increase of her oil which was the only substance she had left he had so bountifully effected as not only to disintangle her from her difficulties in paying the debt but withal what was still more generous to enable her to live comfortably the remainder of her days she considered that charity and compassion was so leading a virtue and had such an influence upon every other part of a mans character as to be a sufficient proof by itself of the inward disposition and goodness of the heart but that so engaging an instance of it as this exercised in so kind and seasonable a manner was a demonstration of his  and that he was in truth what outward circumstances bespoke a holy man of god  as the shunamites principle and motive for her hospitality to elisha was just as it sprung from an idea of the worth and merit of her guest so likewise was the manner of doing it kind and considerate it is observable she does not solicit her husband to assign him an apartment in her own house but to build him a chamber in the wall apart  she considered  that true piety wanted no witnesses and was always most at ease when most private  that the tumult and distraction of a large family were not fit for the silent meditations of so holy a man who would perpetually there meet with something either to interrupt his devotion or offend the purity of his manners  that moreover under such an independent roof where he could take shelter as often as his occasions required she thought he might taste the pleasure which was natural to man in possessing something like what he could call his own  and what is no small part of conferring a favor he would scarce feel the weight of it or at least much seldomer in this manner than where a daily invitation and repetition of the kindness perpetually put him in mind of his obligation if any thing could still add to this  it was  that it did not appear to be the dry offer of a faint civility but that it came directly from the heart there is a nicety in honest minds which will not accept a cold and suspected offer  and even when it appears to be sincere and truly meant there is a modesty in true merit which knows not how to accept it and no doubt she had one if not both these difficulties to conquer in their turns  for we read that she constrained him and in all likelihood forced his acceptance of it with all the warmth and friendly openness of a humane and hospitable temper  it is with benefits as with injuries in this respect that we do not so much weigh the accidental good or evil they do us as that which they were designed to do us  that is we consider no part of them so much as their intention and the prophets behavior consequent upon this shows he beheld it through this medium or in some such advantageous light as i have placed it  there is no burden so heavy to a grateful mind as a debt of kindness unpaid  and we may believe elisha felt it so from the earnest desire which he had upon the immediate receipt of this to discharge himself of it which he expresses in the text in the warmest manner  behold thou have been careful for us with all this care  what shall be done for thee would thou be spoken for to the king or the captain of his host  there is a degree of honest impatience in the words such as was natural to a good man who would not be behindhand with his benefactor  but there is one thing which may seem strange at first sight that as her station and condition in life was such that she appeared rather to have abounded already than stood in want of any thing in this world which such an application could supply  why the prophet should not rather have proposed some spiritual advantage which as it would better have become the sanctity of his character on the one hand so on the other it would have done a more real and lasting service to his friend  but we are to reflect that in returning favors we act differently from what we do in conferring them  in the one case we simply consider what is best  in the other what is most acceptable the reason is that we have a right to act according to our own ideas of what will do the party most good in the case where we bestow a favor  but where we return one we lose this right and act according to his conceptions who has obliged us and endeavor to repay in such a manner as we think is most likely to be accepted in discharge of the obligation  so that though we are not to imagine elisha could be wanting in religious duties as well as wishes to so hospitable a friend we may yet suppose he was directed here by this principle of equity  and that in reflecting in what manner he should requite his benefactress he had considered that to one of her affluent condition who had all the reasonable comforts of an independent life  if there was any passion yet unsatisfied it must certainly be ambition that though in general it was an irregular appetite which in most cases twas dangerous to gratify yet in effect twas only so far criminal as the power which it acquired was perverted to bad and vicious purposes which it was not likely to be here from the specimen she had already given of her disposition which showed that if she did wish for an increase of wealth or honor she wished it only as it would enable her more generously to extend her arm in kind offices and increase the power as well as the opportunities of doing good  in justice to elishas motive which must have been good we must suppose he considered his offer in this light and what principally led him to propose it was the great interest which he had with the king of israel at that time which he had merited by a signal service and as he had no views for himself he thought it could not be employed so well as in establishing the fortune of one whose virtue might be so safely trusted with it it was a justifiable prepossession in her favor  though one not always to be relied on for there is many a one who in a moderate station and with a lesser degree of power who has behaved with honor and unblemished reputation and who has even borne the buffetings of adverse fortune well and manifested great presence and strength of mind under it whom nevertheless a high exaltation has at once overcome and so entirely changed as if the party had left not only his virtue but even himself behind him  whether the shunamite dreaded to make this dangerous experiment of herself  or which is more likely that she had learned to set bounds to her desires and was too well satisfied with her present condition to be tempted out of it she declines the offer in the close of the text  i dwell amongst my own people as if she had said the intended kindness is far from being small but it is not useful to me i live here as thou art a witness in peace in a contented obscurity  not so high as to provoke envy nor so low as to be trodden down and despised in this safe and middle state as i have lived amongst my own people so let me die out of the reach both of the cares and glories of the world  it is fit o holy man of god that i learn some time or other to set bounds to my desires and if i cannot fix them now when i have already more than my wants require when shall i hope to do it  or how should i expect that even this increase of honor or fortune would fully satisfy and content my ambition should i now give way to it  so engaging an instance of unaffected moderation and selfdenial deserves well to be considered by the bustlers in this world  because if we are to trust the face and course of things we scarce see any virtue so hard to be put in practice and which the generality of mankind seem so unwilling to learn as this of knowing when they have enough and when it is time to give over their worldly pursuits  aye but nothing is more easy you will answer than to fix this point and set certain bounds to it  for my own part you will say i declare i want and would wish no more but a sufficient competency of those things which are requisite to the real uses and occasions of life suitable to the way i have been taught to expect from use and education  but recollect how seldom it ever happens when these points are secured but that new occasions and new necessities present themselves and every day as you grow richer fresh wants are discovered which rise up before you as you ascend the hill so that every step you take  every accession to your fortune sets your desires one degree further from rest and satisfaction  that something you have not yet grasped and possibly never shall  that devil of a phantom unpossessed and unpossessable is perpetually haunting you and stepping in betwixt you and your contentment  unhappy creature to think of enjoying that blessing without moderation  or imagine that so sacred a temple can be raised upon the foundation of wealth or power  if the ground work is not laid within your own mind they will as soon add a cubit to your stature as to your happiness  to be convinced it is so  pray look up to those who have got as high as their warmest wishes could carry them in this ascent  do you observe they live the better the longer the merrier  or that they sleep the sounder in their beds for having twice as much as they wanted or well know how to dispose of  of all rules for calculating happiness this is the most deceitful and which few but weak minds and those unpractised in the world too ever think of applying as the measure in such an estimation  great and inexpressible may be the happiness which a moderate fortune and moderate desires with a consciousness of virtue will secure  many are the silent pleasures of the honest peasant who rises cheerful to his labor  why should they not  look into his house the seat of each mans happiness  has he not the same domestic endearments  the same joy and comfort in his children and as flattering hopes of their doing well to enliven his hours and glad his heart as you could conceive in the highest station  and i make no doubt in general but if the true state of his joy and sufferings could be fairly balanced with those of his betters whether any thing would appear at the foot of the account but what would recommend the moral of this discourse  this i own is not to be attained to by the cynical stale trick of haranguing against the goods of fortune  they were never intended to be talked out of the world  but as virtue and true wisdom lie in the middle of extremes  on one hand not to neglect and despise riches so as to forget ourselves  and on the other not to pursue and love them so as to forget god  to have them sometimes in our heads  but always something more important in our hearts  sermon xiv selfexamination sermon xiv isaiah     the ox knows his owner and the ass his masters crib  but israel does not know  my people does not consider   it is a severe but an affectionate reproach of the prophets laid against the israelites  which may safely be applied to every heedless and unthankful people who are neither won by gods mercies or terrified by his punishments  there is a giddy thoughtless intemperate spirit gone forth into the world which possesses the generality of mankind  and the reason the world is undone is because the world does not consider  considers neither aweful regard to god  or the true relation themselves bear to him  could they consider this and learn to weigh the causes and compare the consequences of things and to exercise the reason which god has put into us for the government and direction of our lives  there would be some hopes of a reformation  but as the world goes there is no leisure for such enquiries and so full are our minds of other matters that we have not time to ask or a heart to answer the questions we ought to put to ourselves  whatever our condition is it is good to be acquainted with it in time to be able to supply what is wanting  and examine the state of our accounts before we come to give them up to an impartial judge  the most inconsiderate see the reasonableness of this  there being few i believe either so thoughtless or even so bad but that they sometimes enter upon this duty and have some short intervals of selfexamination which they are forced upon if from no other motive yet at least to free themselves from the load and oppression of spirits they must necessarily be subject to without it  but as the scripture frequently intimates  and observation confirms it daily  that there are many mistakes attending the discharge of this duty  i cannot make the remainder of this discourse more useful than by a short enquiry into them i shall therefore first beg leave to remind you of some of the many unhappy ways by which we often set about this irksome task of proving our works without being either the better or the wiser for the employment  and first then let us begin with that which is the foundation of almost all the other false measures we take in this matter  that is the setting about the examination of our works before we are prepared with honest dispositions to amend them  this is beginning the work at the wrong end these previous dispositions in the heart are the wheels that should make this work go easily and successfully forwards  and to take them off and proceed without them it is no miracle if like pharaohs chariots they that drive them  drive them heavily along  besides if a man is not sincerely inclined to reform his faults  it is not likely he should be inclined to see them  nor will all the weekly preparations that ever were wrote bring him nearer the point  so that with how serious a face soever he begins to examine  he no longer does the office of an enquirer  but an apologist whose business is not to search for truth  but skilfully to hide it  so long  therefore as this preengagement lasts betwixt the man and his old habits  there is little prospect of proving his works to any good purpose  of whatever kind they are with so strong an interest and power on their side  as in other trials so in this it is no wonder if the evidence is puzzled and confounded and the several facts and circumstances so twisted from their natural shapes and the whole proof so altered and confirmed on the other side  as to leave the last state of that man even worse than the first  a second unhappy though general mistake in this great duty of proving our works  is that which the apostle hints at in the doing it not by a direct examination of our own actions but from a comparative view of them with the lives and actions of other men  when a man is going to enter upon this work of selfexamination  there is nothing so common as to see him  look round him  instead of looking within him  he looks round  finds out some one who is more malicious  sees another that is more covetous a third that is more proud and imperious than himself  and so indirectly forms a judgment of himself not from a review of his life and a proving of his own works as the apostle directs him but rather from proving the works of others and from their infirmities and defects drawing a deceitful conclusion in favor of himself  in all competitions of this kind  one may venture to say there will be ever so much of selflove in a man as to draw a flattering likeness of one of the parties  and it is well  if he has not so much malignity too as to give but a coarse picture of the other  finished with so many hard strokes as to make the one as unlike its original as the other  thus the pharisee when he entered the temple  no sooner saw the publican but that moment he formed the idea to himself of all the vices and corruptions that could possibly enter into the mans character  and with great dexterity stated all his own virtues and good qualities over against them his abstinence and frequent fasting  exactness in the debts and ceremonies of the law not ballancing the account as he ought to have done in this manner  what though this man is a publican and a sinner have not i my vices as well as he it is true his particular office exposes him to many temptations of committing extortion and injustice  but then  am not i a devourer of widows houses and guilty of one of the most cruel instances of the same crime he possibly is a profane person and may set religion at naught  but do not i myself for a pretense make long prayers and bring the greatest of all scandals upon religion by making it the cloak to my ambition and worldly views  if he lastly is debauched or intemperate  am not i conscious of as corrupt and wanton dispositions and that a fair and guarded outside is my best pretense to the opposite character  if a man will examine his works by a comparative view of them with others  this no doubt would be the fairer way and least likely to mislead him  but as this is seldom the method this trial is gone through  in fact it generally turns out to be as treacherous and delusive to the man himself  as it is uncandid to the man who is dragged into the comparison and whoever judges of himself by this rule  so long as there is no scarcity of vicious characters in the world  it is to be feared he will often take the occasions of triumph and rejoicing  where in truth he ought rather to be sorry and ashamed  a third error in the manner of proving our works is what we are guilty of when we leave out of the calculation the only material parts of them  i mean the motives and first principles from whence they proceeded there is many a fair instance of generosity chastity and selfdenial which the world may give a man the credit of  which if he would give himself the leisure to reflect upon and trace back to their first springs  he would be conscious proceeded from such views and intentions as if known would not be to his honor  the truth of this may be made evident by a thousand instances in life  and yet there is nothing more usual than for a man when he is going upon this duty of selfexamination  instead of calling his own ways to remembrance  to close the whole enquiry at once with this short challenge   that he defies the world to say ill of him if the world has no express evidence this indeed may be an argument of his good luck  but no satisfactory one of the real goodness and innocence of his life  a man may be a very bad man  and yet through caution  through deeplaid policy and design may so guard all outward appearances as never to want this negative testimony on his side  that the world knows no evil of him  how little soever he deserves it  of all assays upon a mans self this may be said to be the slightest this method of proving the goodness of our works  differing but little in kind from that unhappy one which many unwary people take in proving the goodness of their coin  who if it happens to be suspicious  instead of bringing it either to the balance or the touchstone to try its worth  they ignorantly go forth try if they can pass it upon the world  if so all is well and they are saved all the expense and pains of enquiring after and detecting the cheat  a fourth error in this duty of examination of mens works  is that of committing the task to others  an error into which thousands of wellmeaning creatures are ensnared in the romish church by her doctrines of auricular confession of works of supererogation and the many lucrative practices raised upon that capital stock  the trade of which is carried to such a height in popish countries that if you was at rome or naples now and was disposed in compliance with the apostles exhortation in the text  to set about this duty to prove your own works  it is great odds whether you would be suffered to do it yourself without interruption and you might be said to have escaped well if the first person you consulted upon it did not talk you out of your resolution and possibly your senses too at the same time  prove your works  for heavens sake desist from so rash an undertaking  what  trust your own skill and judgment in a matter of so much difficulty and importance  when there are so many whose business it is  who understand it so well and who can do it for you with so much safety and advantage  if your works must be proved you would be advised by all means to send them to undergo this operation with some one who knows what he is about either some expert and noted confessor of the church  or to some convent or religious society who are in possession of a large stock of good works of all kinds wrought up by saints and confessors where you may suit yourself  and either get the defects of your own supplied  or be accommodated with new ones ready proved to your hands sealed and certified to be so by the popes commissary and the notaries of his ecclesiastic court there needs little more to lay open this fatal error  than barely to represent it so i shall only add a short remark  that they who are persuaded to be thus virtuous by proxy and will prove the goodness of their works only by deputies  will have no reason to complain against gods justice  if he suffers them to go to heaven only in the same manner  that is  by deputies too  the last mistake which i shall have time to mention is that which the methodists have revived for it is no new error  but one which has misled thousands before these days wherever enthusiasm has got footing  and that is  the attempting to prove their works by that very argument which is the greatest proof of their weakness and superstition  i mean that extraordinary impulse and intercourse with the spirit of god which they pretend to and whose operations if you trust them are so sensibly felt in their hearts and souls as to render at once all other proofs of their works needless to themselves  this i own is one of the the most summary ways of proceeding in this duty of selfexamination and as it proves a mans works in the gross it saves him a world of sober thought and enquiry after many vexatious particulars  indeed if the premises were true  the inference is direct for when a man dreams of these inward workings  and wakes with the impression of them strong upon his brain  it is not strange he should think himself a chosen vessel  sanctified within and sealed up unto the perfect day of redemption and so long as such a one is led captive to this error  there is nothing in nature to induce him to this duty of examining his own works in the sense of the apostle  for however bad they are  so long as his credulity and enthusiasm equals them it is impossible they should disturb his conscience or frighten him into a reformation these are some of the unhappy mistakes in the many methods this work is set about  which in a great measure rob us of the fruits we expected  and sometimes so entirely blast them that we are neither the better or wiser for all the pains we have taken  there are many other false steps which lead us the same way  but the delineation of these however may serve at present not only as so many landmarks to guard us from this dangerous coast which i have described but to direct us likewise into that safe one where we can only expect the reward the gospel promises for if according to the first recited causes a man fails in examining his works from a disinclination to reform them  from partiality of comparisons  from flattery to his own motives and a vain dependence upon the opinion of the world  the conclusion is unavoidable  that he must search for the qualities the most opposite to these for his conductors  and if he hopes to discharge this work so as to have advantage from it  that he must set out upon the principles of an honest head willing to reform itself and attached principally to that object without regard to the spiritual condition of others or the misguided opinions which the world may have of himself  that for this end  he must call his own ways to remembrance and search out his spirit  search his actions with the same critical exactness and same piercing curiosity we are wont to sit in judgment upon others  varnishing nothing  and disguising nothing if he proceeds thus and in every relation of life takes a full view of himself without prejudice  traces his actions to their principles without mercy and looks into the dark corners and recesses of his heart without fear  and upon such an enquiry  he acts consistent with his view in it by reforming his errors separating the dross and purifying the whole mass with repentance  this will bid fair for examining a mans works in the apostles sense  and whoever discharges the duty thus  with a view to scripture which is the rule in this case  and to reason which is the applier of this rule in all cases  need not fear but he will have what the apostle calls rejoicing in himself and that he will lay the foundation of his peace and comfort where it ought to lay  that is within himself  in the testimony of a good conscience and the joyful expectation that having done his utmost to examine his own works here that god will accept them hereafter through the merits of christ which god grant amen  sermon xv jobs expostulation with his wife sermon xv job ii  0 what  shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil also   these are the words of job uttered in the depth of his misfortunes by way of reproof to his wife for the counsel we find she had given him in the forgoing verse namely not to retain his integrity any longer  but to curse god and die though it is not very evident what was particularly meant and implied in the words  curse god and die  yet it is certain from jobs reply to them that they directed him to some step which was rash and unwarrantable and probably as it is generally explained meant that he should openly call gods justice to an account and by a blasphemous accusation of it provoke god to destroy his being as if she had said  after so many sad things which have befallen thee notwithstanding thy integrity what gainest thou by serving god seeing he bears thus hard upon thee as though thou wast his enemy  ought so faithful a servant as thou have been to receive so much unkind treatment at his hands  and tamely to submit to it  patiently to sustain the evils he has brought upon thy house and neither murmur with thy lips nor charge him with injustice  bear it not thus  and as thy piety could not at first protect thee from such misfortunes  nor thy behavior under them could since move god to take pity on thee  change thy conduct toward him  boldly expostulate with him  upbraid him openly with unkindness  call his justice and providence to an account for oppressing thee in so undeserved a manner and get that benefit by provoking him which thou have not been able to obtain by serving him  to die at once by his hands and be freed at least from the greater misery of a lingering and a more tormenting death  on the other hand some interpreters tell us  that the word curse in the original is equivocal and does more literally signify here to bless than to blaspheme and consequently that the whole is rather to be considered as a sarcastical scoff at jobs piety  as if it had been said  go to  bless god  and die  since thou art so ready to praise him in troubles as thou have done go on in thy own way and see how god will reward thee by a miserable death which thou can not avoid  without disputing the merits of these two interpretations it may not seem an improbable conjecture that the words imply something still different from what is expressed in either of them  and instead of supposing them as an incitement to blaspheme god  which was madness  or that they were intended as an insult  which was unnatural  that her advice to curse god and die was meant here that he should resolve upon a voluntary death himself which was an act not only in his own power but what carried some appearance of a remedy with it and promised at least at first sight some respite from pain as it would put an end both to his life and his misfortunes together  one may suppose that with all the concern and affection which was natural she beheld her lord afflicted both with poverty and sickness  by one sudden blow brought down from his palace to the dunghill  in one mournful day she saw that not only the fortunes of his house were blasted but likewise the hopes of his posterity cut off for ever by the untimely loss of his children  she knew he was a virtuous and an upright man and deserved a better fate  her heart bled the more for him  she saw the prospect before him was dreadful  that there appeared no possible means which could retrieve the sad situation of his affairs  that death the last  the surest friend to the unfortunate could only set him free  and that it was better to resolve upon that at once than vainly endeavor to wade through such a sea of troubles which in the end would overwhelm him  we may suppose her spirits sinking under those apprehensions when she began to look upon his constancy as a fruitless virtue and from that persuasion to have said unto him  curse god  depend no longer upon him nor wait the issues of his providence which has already forsaken thee  as there is no help from that quarter  resolve to extricate thyself  and since thou have met with no justice in this world  leave it  die  and force thy passage into a better country where misfortunes cannot follow thee  whether this paraphrase upon the words is just or the former interpretations be admitted  the reply in the text is equally proper  what  shall we receive good at the hands of god and shall we not receive evil also are not both alike the dispensations of an allwise and good being who knows and determines what is best and wherefore should i make myself the judge to receive the one and yet be so partial as to reject the other when by fairly putting both into the scale i may be convinced how much the good outweighs the evil in all cases in my own consider how strong this argument is against me  in the beginning of my days how did god crown me with honor in how remarkable a manner did his providence set a hedge about me and about all that i had on every side  how he prospered the works of my hands so that our substance and happiness increased every day  and now when for reasons best known to his infinite wisdom he has thought fit to try me with afflictions  shall i rebel against him in sinning with my lips and charging him foolishly  god forbid  o rather may i look up toward that hand which has bruised me  for he makes sore and he binds up  he wounds and his hands make whole from his bounty only has issued all i had from his wisdom  all i have lost for he gives and he has taken away  blessed be his name  there are few instances of particular virtue more engaging than those of this heroic cast and if we may take the testimony of a heathen philosopher upon it there is not an object in this world which god can be supposed to look down upon with greater pleasure than that of a good man involved in misfortunes surrounded on all sides with difficulties  yet cheerfully bearing up his head and struggling against them with firmness and constancy of mind  certainly to our conceptions such objects must be truly engaging  and the reason of so exalted an encomium from this hand is easy to be guessed no doubt the wisest of the heathen philosophers had found from observation upon the life of man that the many troubles and infirmities of his nature the sicknesses disappointments sorrows for the loss of children or property with the numberless other calamities and cross accidents to which the life of man is subject were in themselves so great  and so little solid comfort to be administered from the mere refinements of philosophy in such emergencies that there was no virtue which required greater efforts or which was found so difficult to be achieved upon moral principles upon moral principles  which had no foundation to sustain this great weight which the infirmities of our nature laid upon it and for this reason it is observable that there is no subject upon which the moral writers of antiquity have exhausted so much of their eloquence or where they have spent such time and pains as in this of endeavoring to reconcile men to these evils insomuch that from thence in most modern languages the patient enduring of affliction has by degrees obtained the name of philosophy and almost monopolized the word to itself as if it was the chief end or compendium of all the wisdom which philosophy had to offer and indeed considering what lights they had some of them wrote extremely well yet as what they said proceeded more from the head than the heart twas generally more calculated to silence a man in his troubles than to convince and teach him how to bear them and therefore however subtle and ingenious their arguments might appear in the reading it is to be feared they lost much of their efficacy when tried in the application if a man was thrust back in the world by disappointments or  as was jobs case  had suffered a sudden change in his fortunes from an affluent condition was brought down by a train of cruel accidents and pinched with poverty  philosophy would come in and exhort him to stand his ground  it would tell him that the same greatness and strength of mind which enabled him to behave well in the days of his prosperity should equally enable him to behave well in the days of his adversity  that it was the property of only weak and base spirits who were insolent in the one to be dejected and overthrown by the other whereas great and generous souls were at all times calm and equal  as they enjoyed the advantages of life with indifference  they were able to resign them with the same temper  and consequently  were out of the reach of fortune all which however fine and likely to satisfy the fancy of a man at ease could convey but little consolation to a heart already pierced with sorrow  nor is it to be conceived how an unfortunate creature should any more receive relief from such a lecture however just than a man racked with an acute fit of the gout or stone could be supposed to be set free from torture by hearing from his physician a nice dissertation upon his case the philosophic consolations in sickness or in afflictions for the death of friends and kindred were just as efficacious  and were rather in general to be considered as good sayings than good remedies  so that if a man was bereaved of a promising child in whom all his hopes and expectations centered  or a wife was left destitute to mourn the loss and protection of a kind and tender husband seneca or epictetus would tell the pensive parent and disconsolate widow  that tears and lamentation for the dead were fruitless and absurd  that to die was the necessary and unavoidable debt of nature  and as it could admit of no remedy  twas impious and foolish to grieve and fret themselves upon it upon which sage counsel as well as many other lessons of the same stamp the same reflection might be applied which is said to have been made by one of the roman emperors to one who administered the same consolation to him on a like occasion  to whom advising him to be comforted and make himself easy since the event had been brought about by a fatality and could not be helped  he replied  that this was so far from lessening his trouble  that it was the very circumstance which occasioned it so that upon the whole  when the true value of these and many more of their current arguments have been weighed and brought to the test  one is led to doubt whether the greatest part of their heroes the most renowned for constancy were not much more indebted to good nerves and spirits or the natural happy frame of their tempers for behaving well than to any extraordinary helps which they could be supposed to receive from their instructors and therefore i should make no scruple to assert that one such instance of patience and resignation as this which the scripture gives us in the person of job of one not pompously declaiming upon the contempt of pain and poverty but of a man sunk in the lowest condition of humanity to behold him when stripped of his estate  his wealth his friends his children  cheerfully holding up his head and entertaining his hard fortune with firmness and serenity  and this not from a stoical stupidity but a just sense of gods providence and a persuasion of his justice and goodness in all his dealings  such an example i say as this is of more universal use speaks truer to the heart than all the heroic precepts which the pedantry of philosophy have to offer  this leads me to the point i aim at in this discourse  namely that there are no principles but those of religion to be depended on in cases of real stress and that these are able to encounter the worst emergencies and to bear us up under all the changes and chances to which our life is subject  consider then what virtue the very first principle of religion has and how wonderfully it is conducive to this end that there is a god a powerful a wise and good being who first made the world and continues to govern it  by whose goodness all things are designed  and by whose providence all things are conducted to bring about the greatest and best ends the sorrowful and pensive wretch that was giving way to his misfortunes and mournfully sinking under them the moment this doctrine comes in to his aid hushes all his complaints  and thus speaks comfort to his soul  it is the lord let him do what seems him good  without his direction i know that no evil can befall me  without his permission that no power can hurt me  it is impossible a being so wise should mistake my happiness  or that a being so good should contradict it if he has denied me riches or other advantages  perhaps he foresees the gratifying my wishes would undo me and by my own abuse of them be perverted to my ruin  if he has denied me the request of children  or in his providence has thought fit to take them from me  how can i say  whether he has not dealt kindly with me and only taken that away which he foresaw would embitter and shorten my days  it does so to thousands where the disobedience of a thankless child has brought down the parents gray hairs with sorrow to the grave has he visited me with sickness poverty or other disappointments  can i say but these are blessings in disguise  so many different expressions of his care and concern to disintangle my thoughts from this world and fix them upon another  another a better world beyond this  this thought opens a new scene of hope and consolation to the unfortunate  and as the persuasion of a providence reconciles him to the evils he has suffered  this prospect of a future life gives him strength to despise them and esteem the light afflictions of his life as they are  not worthy to be compared to what is reserved for him hereafter  things are great or small by comparison  and he who looks no further than this world and balances the accounts of his joys and sufferings from that consideration finds all his sorrows enlarged and at the close of them will be apt to look back and cast the same sad reflection upon the whole which the patriarch did to pharaoh  that few and evil had been the days of his pilgrimage but let him lift up his eyes toward heaven and steadfastly behold the life and immortality of a future state  he then wipes away all tears from off his eyes for ever and ever  like the exiled captive big with the hopes that he is returning home  he feels not the weight of his chains or counts the days of his captivity but looks forward with rapture toward the country where his heart is fled before  these are the aids which religion offers us toward the regulation of our spirit under the evils of life  but like great cordials  they are seldom used but on greater occurrences  in the lesser evils of life we seem to stand unguarded  and our peace and contentment are overthrown and our happiness broke in upon by a little impatience of spirit under the cross and untoward accidents we meet with  these stand unprovided for and we neglect them as we do the slighter indispositions of the body  which we think not worth treating seriously  and so leave them to nature in good habits of the body this may do  and i would gladly believe there are such good habits of the temper  such a complexional ease and health of heart as may often save the patient much medicine  we are still to consider  that however such good frames of mind are got  they are worth preserving by all rules  patience and contentment  which like the treasure hid in the field for which a man sold all he had to purchase  is of that price that it cannot be had at too great a purchase since without it the best condition in life cannot make us happy  and with it it is impossible we should be miserable even in the worst  give me leave therefore to close this discourse with some reflections upon the subject of a contented mind  and the duty in man of regulating his spirit in our way through life  a subject in every bodys mouth  preached upon daily to our friends and kindred  but too often in such a style as to convince the party lectured only of this truth  that we bear the misfortunes of others with excellent tranquillity  i believe there are thousands so extravagant in their ideas of contentment as to imagine that it must consist in having every thing in this world turn out the way they wish  that they are to sit down in happiness and feel themselves so at ease at all points as to desire nothing better and nothing more i own there are instances of some who seem to pass through the world as if all their paths had been strewed with rose buds of delight  but a little experience will convince us it is a fatal expectation to go upon  we are born to trouble and we may depend upon it whilst we live in this world we shall have it though with intermissions  that is in whatever state we are we shall find a mixture of good and evil and therefore the true way to contentment is to know to receive these certain vicissitudes of life  the returns of good and evil so as neither to be exalted by the one or overthrown by the other but to bear ourselves toward every thing which happens with such ease and indifference of mind as to hazard as little as may be this is the true temperate climate fitted for us by nature and in which every wise man would wish to live  god knows we are perpetually straying out of it and by giving wings to our imaginations in the transports we dream of from such or such a situation in life we are carried away alternately into all the extremes of hot and cold for which as we are neither fitted by nature or prepared by expectation we feel them with all their violence and with all their danger too  god for wise reasons has made our affairs in this world almost as fickle and capricious as ourselves  pain and pleasure like light and darkness succeed each other and he that knows how to accommodate himself to their periodical returns can wisely extract the good from the evil  knows only how to live  this is true contentment at least all that is to be had of it in this world and for this every man must be indebted not to his fortune but to himself  and indeed it would have been strange if a duty so becoming us as dependent creatures  and so necessary besides to all our well beings had been placed out of the reach of any in some measure to put in practice  and for this reason there is scarce any lot so low but there is something in it to satisfy the man whom it has befallen providence having so ordered things that in every mans cup how bitter soever there are some cordial drops  some good circumstances which if wisely extracted are sufficient for the purpose he wants them  that is to make him contented and if not happy at least resigned may god bless us all with this spirit for the sake of jesus christ amen  the end
