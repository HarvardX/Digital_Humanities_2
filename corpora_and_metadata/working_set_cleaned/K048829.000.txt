annette and lubin a comic opera in one act  price sixpence  annette and lubin a comic opera in one act  as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  london printed for g kearsly no    fleet street mdcclxxviii  advertisement the following little piece is an imitation of the french comic operas of one act which are generally characterized either by their natural simplicity or some single striking incident and little or nothing more is designed  it is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the english theater as containing excellent situations for light airs  on the french stage notwithstanding all their merit they tire in the length of time taken for representation and were they spun out to the common length of our afterpieces it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient  the subject matter therefore being wholly preserved and the dialogue both varied and compressed they are with every deference submitted to public judgment  c dibdin  characters men the lord of the manor mr fearon his bailiff mr wilson lubin mrs farrell woman annette miss brown   annette and lubin a comic opera scene i a view on the borders of the seine  near the front of the stage is a little cabin made with leaves not quite finished  lubin comes on with a load of branches on his back air it is late in the day work away work away at the cottage where annettes to dwell i sing as the branches i fell it is not fine it is not gay but it is done for her sake and the pains which i take love and her will repay mighty well for a carpet to serve where she will tread this matting of ozier i spread come lubin my lad work away love and annette thy toil will repay if the housen of your great folks in town are larger and a got more chambers than ours i can tell em those within lead sadder lives  here annette and i are happier than a king and queen  one branch the more if we are cold keeps out the wind and the rain  if we are warm one branch the less lets in the air to fan us  and when the sun scorches up the leaves away trudge i as i did this morning to the wood and bring home a new house upon my back  annette will be struck all of a heap when she comes home to see how gay we look singing behind ah there she is i will work away without seeming to mind her  scene ii lubin annette an behind the village all may rave and scold to taunt and rail and jeer they are free the young with sneers with threats the old still lubin is the lad for me  lub here comes annette let us nothing forget well said my boy lubin well said thy toil to complete on this hillock her seat these pansies and violets spread  an behind the bailly does our conduct blame cousins to love  that must not be but did the parson cry out shame lubin is the lad for me  lub i hear her i hear her come nearer and nearer let us see have i got every thing when she speaks one may guess how her accents can bless if ones charmed thus in hearing her sing  an behind they say this joy will end in smart that all the men are false  but he is true if i may trust my heart and lubin is the lad for me  lub my annette i hear that annette so dear who so much i regret when away that the sky seems to lour and evry hour to me is as long as a day  a coming on but wherefore in a moments pain he is here and i from doubt am free that smile which welcomes me again says lubin is the lad for me  both but wherefore in a moments etc  an here i am  i am quite out of breath   lub you have been a good while gone   an i am sure i run as fast as ever i could   lub yes you have made yourself all in a heat  what did you run so fast for   an oh that was only as i come back again  when i leave you i go slow enough  oh dear how fine we are   lub not very fine annette but it will be main pretty when thou art within it   an ah lubin how glad i was to come back to thee  ent we much happier than the people in town   lub happier  a thousand times on the finest days in all the year they shut themselves up in a parcel of quarries is it not true that our cabin is prettier than their fine prisons which they call palaces   an for my part i wonder they dont come in the fine weather and live two and two in a little hut as we do  have you seen lubin their carpets they are so fond of  lord they ent a quarter so pretty as a bed of daisies   lub and annette have thee observed how they try to make their walls look like the country by sticking a parcel of pictures about them  they say too it costs them a mint of money if that is the case i am sure they are great fools for our pictures here are ten times handsomer and we have them for nothing   an dear me the other day when i carried some milk to my lords i heard a band of music too  lord lubin what a terrible noise i could not help saying if they wanted music why did not they come and hear our nightingales   lub well said annette   an ah but dear lubin i met that nasty bailly again and he says he will come and scold thee for loving me so much   lub oh he will will he  i will give him as good as he brings  it is a plaguey strange thing they cannot let us alone  icod in our village the folks no sooner see two people happy but they try to make them as miserable as they can   an indeed he frightens me out of my wits  i cannot tell thee what a heap of stuff he says  that we are cousins and that we love one another  i am sure i thought all we did was out of good will but he showed me as plain as could be that it was all love and that love is a terrible thing   air young and void of art or guile from ill intentions free if love i have cherished all this while it came in spight of me when you have to me and i have to you tried who could kindest prove if that was love  what then to do to fly from this same love ii when absent from you i have mourned and thought each hour a score when on a sudden you returned i have thrilled with joy all over they say twas love  i thought twas you had made my heart thus move alas what can a poor girl do to fly from this same love iii to every thing that you can ask what should i say but yes it is because i like the task i freely grant each kiss youre all to me  i am all to you  this truth our deaths would prove were we to part  what then to do to fly from this same love lub never mind them annette  well be happy in spite of them  i will go and see that the sheep dont stray from the valley  and then you shall hear what i will say to mr bailly   scene iii annette and the bailly an sitting in the cabin i dont care if they will not let me love lubin i will never love any body especially after being to him as i am  poor soul what pains he takes for me and then we have neither kin nor kind  and as i often says who should love us if we dont love one another  here the

lub pray dont let annette die my lord  i should die too and that would be a pity  if you could but have seen how we lived together before this old bailly came and frightened us so nothing was ever so

dont afflict yourselves you are not criminal you are only unfortunate if you were rich you might obtain a permission to love and be united it is not just that because you are poor you should be denied so equitable a desire  i will take this matter upon myself and the week shall not pass before i procure a dispensation from the church to reward your innocence and affection as it deserves   air bailly his lordship really is too good what will the people say marry two folks one flesh and blood  henceforth young maids will stray the wolf will creep among the sheep corn will on fire be set what can come less from the wickedness of lubin and annette  annette peace mister bailey  for my lord has now untied my tongue and i may bold put in my word  i own we have been so wrong our former shame each fair should blame and yet without regret might imitate the future state of lubin and annette  lubin wounds let un talk and talk again he will never get his ends his spite will give me little pain if here we find but friends forgives the word you see my lord has the example set doe then pray clap hands and say smile lubin and annette  the end
