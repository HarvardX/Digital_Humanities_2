the writings of james madison journal of the constitutional convention of     —continued thursday july    in convention on reconsideration of the vote rendering the executive reeligible a  d time mr martin moved to reinstate the words to be ineligible a  d time mr governeur morris it is necessary to take into one view all that relates to the establishment of the executive on the due formation of which must depend the efficacy  utility of the union among the present and future states it has been a maxim in political science that republican government is not adapted to a large extent of country because the energy of the executive magistracy can not reach the extreme parts of it our country is an extensive one we must either then renounce the blessings of the union or provide an executive with sufficient vigor to pervade every part of it this subject was of so much importance that he hoped to be indulged in an extensive view of it one great object   of the executive is to controul the legislature the legislature will continually seek to aggrandize  perpetuate themselves and will seize those critical moments produced by war invasion or convulsion for that purpose it is necessary then that the executive magistrate should be the guardian of the people even of the lower classes agst legislative tyranny against the great  the wealthy who in the course of things will necessarily compose the legislative body wealth tends to corrupt the mind to nourish its love of power and to stimulate it to oppression history proves this to be the spirit of the opulent the check provided in the  d branch was not meant as a check on legislative usurpations of power but on the abuse of lawful powers on the propensity in the  st branch to legislate too much to run into projects of paper money  similar expedients it is no check on legislative tyranny on the contrary it may favor it and if the  st branch can be seduced may find the means of success the executive therefore ought to be so constituted as to be the great protector of the mass of the people—it is the duty of the executive to appoint the officers  to command the forces of the republic to appoint   ministerial officers for the administration of public affairs   officers for the dispensation of justice who will be the best judges whether these appointments be well made the people at large who will know will see will feel the effects of them again who can judge so well of the discharge of military duties for the protection  security of the   people as the people themselves who are to be protected  secured he finds too that the executive is not to be reeligible what effect will this have   it will destroy the great incitement to merit public esteem by taking away the hope of being rewarded with a reappointment it may give a dangerous turn to one of the strongest passions in the human breast the love of fame is the great spring to noble  illustrious actions shut the civil road to glory  he may be compelled to seek it by the sword   it will tempt him to make the most of the short space of time allotted him to accumulate wealth and provide for his friends   it will produce violations of the very constitution it is meant to secure in moments of pressing danger the tried abilities and established character of a favorite magistrate will prevail over respect for the forms of the constitution the executive is also to be impeachable this is a dangerous part of the plan it will hold him in such dependence that he will be no check on the legislature will not be a firm guardian of the people and of the public interest he will be the tool of a faction of some leading demagogue in the legislature these then are the faults of the executive establishment as now proposed can no better establishmt be devised if he is to be the guardian of the people let him be appointed by the people if he is to be a check on the legislature let him not be impeachable let him be of short duration that he may with propriety be reeligible it has been said that the candidates for   this office will not be known to the people if they be known to the legislature they must have such a notoriety and eminence of character that they cannot possibly be unknown to the people at large it cannot be possible that a man shall have sufficiently distinguished himself to merit this high trust without having his character proclaimed by fame throughout the empire as to the danger from an unimpeachable magistrate he could not regard it as formidable there must be certain great officers of state a minister of finance of war of foreign affairs c these he presumes will exercise their functions in subordination to the executive and will be amenable by impeachment to the public justice without these ministers the executive can do nothing of consequence he suggested a biennial election of the executive at the time of electing the  st branch and the executive to hold over so as to prevent any interregnum in the administration an election by the people at large throughout so great an extent of country could not be influenced by those little combinations and those momentary lies which often decide popular elections within a narrow sphere it will probably be objected that the election will be influenced by the members of the legislature particularly of the  st branch and that it will be nearly the same thing with an election by the legislature itself it could not be denied that such an influence would exist but it might be answered that as the legislature or the candidates for it would be divided the enmity of one part would counteract   the friendship of another that if the administration of the executive were good it would be unpopular to oppose his reelection if bad it ought to be opposed  a reappointmt prevented and lastly that in every view this indirect dependence on the favor of the legislature could not be so mischievous as a direct dependence for his appointment he saw no alternative for making the executive independent of the legislature but either to give him his office for life or make him eligible by the people again it might be objected that two years would be too short a duration but he believes that as long as he should behave himself well he would be continued in his place the extent of the country would secure his reelection agst the factions  discontents of particular states it deserved consideration also that such an ingredient in the plan would render it extremely palatable to the people these were the general ideas which occurred to him on the subject and which led him to wish  move that the whole constitution of the executive might undergo reconsideration mr randolph urged the motion of mr l martin for restoring the words making the executive ineligible a  d time if he ought to be independent he should not be left under a temptation to court a reappointment if he should be reappointable by the legislature he will be no check on it his revisionary power will be of no avail he had always thought  contended as he still did that the danger apprehended by the little states was chimerical but those who thought otherwise ought to be peculiarly   anxious for the motion if the executive be appointed as has been determined by the legislature he will probably be appointed either by joint ballot of both houses or be nominated by the  st and appointed by the  d branch in either case the large states will preponderate if he is to court the same influence for his reappointment will he not make his revisionary power and all the other functions of his administration subservient to the views of the large states besides is there not great reason to apprehend that in case he should be reeligible a false complaisance in the legislature might lead them to continue an unfit man in office in preference to a fit one it has been said that a constitutional bar to reappointment will inspire unconstitutional endeavours to perpetuate himself it may be answered that his endeavours can have no effect unless the people be corrupt to such a degree as to render all precautions hopeless to which may be added that this argument supposes him to be more powerful  dangerous than other arguments which have been used admit and consequently calls for stronger fetters on his authority he thought an election by the legislature with an incapacity to be elected a second time would be more acceptable to the people than the plan suggested by mr govr morris mr king did not like the ineligibility he thought there was great force in the remark of mr sherman that he who has proved himself most fit for an office ought not to be excluded by the constitution from holding it he would therefore prefer any other   reasonable plan that could be substituted he was much disposed to think that in such cases the people at large would chuse wisely there was indeed some difficulty arising from the improbability of a general concurrence of the people in favor of any one man on the whole he was of opinion that an appointment by electors chosen by the people for the purpose would be liable to fewest objections mr pattersons ideas nearly coincided he said with those of mr king he proposed that the executive should be appointed by electors to be chosen by the states in a ratio that would allow one elector to the smallest and three to the largest states mr wilson it seems to be the unanimous sense that the executive should not be appointed by the legislature unless he be rendered ineligible a  d time he perceived with pleasure that the idea was gaining ground of an election mediately or immediately by the people mr madison if it be a fundamental principle of free govt that the legislative executive  judiciary powers should be separately exercised it is equally so that they be independently exercised there is the same  perhaps greater reason why the executive shd be independent of the legislature than why the judiciary should a coalition of the two former powers would be more immediately  certainly dangerous to public liberty it is essential then that the appointment of the executive should either be drawn from some source or held by some tenure that will give him a free agency with regard to the   legislature this could not be if he was to be appointable from time to time by the legislature it was not clear that an appointment in the  st instance even with an ineligibility afterwards would not establish an improper connection between the two departments certain it was that the appointment would be attended with intrigues and contentions that ought not to be unnecessarily admitted he was disposed for these reasons to refer the appointment to some other source the people at large was in his opinion the fittest in itself it would be as likely as any that could be devised to produce an executive magistrate of distinguished character the people generally could only know  vote for some citizen whose merits had rendered him an object of general attention  esteem there was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people the right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the northern than the southern states and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the negroes the substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to fewest objections mr gerry if the executive is to be elected by the legislature he certainly ought not to be reeligible this would make him absolutely dependent he was agst a popular election the people are uninformed and would be misled by a few designing men he urged the expediency of an appointment of the executive by electors to be chosen   by the state executives the people of the states will then choose the  st branch the legislatures of the states the  d branch of the national legislature and the executives of the states the national executive this he thought would form a strong attachmt in the states to the national system the popular mode of electing the chief magistrate would certainly be the worst of all if he should be so elected  should do his duty he will be turned out for it like govr bowdoin in massts  president sullivan in n hamshire on the question on mr govr morris motion to reconsider generally the constitution of the executive mas ay ct ay n j ay  all the others ay mr elseworth moved to strike out the appointmt by the natl legislature and to insert to be chosen by electors appointed by the legislatures of the states in the following ratio to wit—one for each state not exceeding  00000  inhabts two for each above yt number  not exceeding  00000 and three for each state exceeding  00000—mr broome  ded the motion  mr rutlidge was opposed to all the modes except the appointmt by the natl legislature he will be sufficiently independent if he be not reeligible mr gerry preferred the motion of mr elseworth to  0 an appointmt by the natl legislature or by the people tho not to an appt by the state executives he moved that the electors proposed by mr e should be    in number and

time mr williamson  ds the motion he had no great confidence in electors to be chosen for the special purpose they would not be the most respectable citizens but persons not occupied in the high offices of govt they would be liable to undue influence which might the more readily be practised as some of them will probably be in appointment   or   months before the object of it comes on mr elseworth supposed any persons might be appointed electors excepting solely members of the natl legislature    on the question shall he be ineligible a  d time mas no ct no n j no pa no del no md no

too distant to send electors often mr elseworth was for   years if the elections be too frequent the executive will not be firm eno there must be duties which will make him unpopular for the moment there will be outs as well as ins his administration therefore will be attacked and misrepresented mr williamson was for   years the expence will be considerable  ought not to be unnecessarily repeated if the elections are too frequent the best men will not undertake the service and those of an inferior character will be liable to be corrupted on the question for   years mas ay cont ay n j

intitling them to   electors that this ratio ought either to be made temporary or so varied as that it would adjust itself to the growing population of the states mr gerry moved that in the  st

be removable on impeachment and conviction for malpractice or neglect of duty see resol   mr pinkney  mr govr morris moved to strike out this part of the resolution mr p observd he ought not to be impeachable whilst in office mr davie if he be not impeachable whilst in office he will spare no efforts or means whatever to get himself reelected he considered this as an essential security for the good behaviour of the executive mr wilson concurred in the necessity of making the executive impeachable whilst in office mr govr morris he can do no criminal act without coadjutors who may be punished in case he should be reelected that will be a sufficient proof of his innocence besides who is to impeach is the    impeachment to suspend his functions if it is not the mischief will go on if it is the impeachment will be nearly equivalent to a displacement and will render the executive dependent on those who are to impeach col mason no point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should be continued shall any man be above justice above all shall that man be above it who can commit the most extensive injustice when great crimes were committed he was for punishing the principal as well as the coadjutors there had been much debate  difficulty as to the mode of chusing the executive he approved of that which had been adopted at first namely of referring the appointment to the natl legislature one objection agst electors was the danger of their being corrupted by the candidates  this furnished a peculiar reason in favor of impeachments whilst in office shall the man who has practised corruption  by that means procured his appointment in the first instance be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt docr franklin was for retaining the clause as favorable to the executive history furnishes one example only of a first magistrate being formally brought to public justice every body cried out agst this as unconstitutional what was the practice before this in cases where the chief magistrate rendered himself obnoxious why recourse was had to assassination in wch he was not only deprived of his life but of the opportunity of vindicating his    character it wd be the best way therefore to provide in the constitution for the regular punishment of the executive where his misconduct should deserve it and for his honorable acquittal where he should be unjustly accused mr govr morris admits corruption  some few other offences to be such as ought to be impeachable but thought the cases ought to be enumerated  defined mr madison thought it indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the community agst the incapacity negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate the limitation of the period of his service was not a sufficient security he might lose his capacity after his appointment he might pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression he might betray his trust to foreign powers the case of the executive magistracy was very distinguishable from that of the legislature or any other public body holding offices of limited duration it could not be presumed that all or even a majority of the members of an assembly would either lose their capacity for discharging or be bribed to betray their trust besides the restraints of their personal integrity  honor the difficulty of acting in concert for purposes of corruption was a security to the public and if one or a few members only should be seduced the soundness of the remaining members would maintain the integrity and fidelity of the body in the case of the executive magistracy which was to be administered    by a single man loss of capacity or corruption was more within the compass of probable events and either of them might be fatal to the republic mr pinkney did not see the necessity of impeachments he was sure they ought not to issue from the legislature who would in that case hold them as a rod over the executive and by that means effectually destroy his independence his revisionary power in particular would be rendered altogether insignificant mr gerry urged the necessity of impeachments a good magistrate will not fear them a bad one ought to be kept in fear of them he hoped the maxim would never be adopted here that the chief magistrate could do no wrong mr king expressed his apprehensions that an extreme caution in favor of liberty might enervate the government we were forming he wished the house to recur to the primitive axiom that the three great departments of govts should be separate  independent that the executive  judiciary should be so as well as the legislative that the executive should be so equally with the judiciary would this be the case if the executive should be impeachable it had been said that the judiciary would be impeachable but it should have been remembered at the same time that the judiciary hold their places not for a limited time but during good behaviour it is necessary therefore that a form should be established for trying misbehaviour was the executive to hold his place during good behaviour the executive    was to hold his place for a limited term like the members of the legislature like them particularly the senate whose members would continue in appointmt the same term of   years he would periodically be tried for his behaviour by his electors who would continue or discontinue him in trust according to the manner in which he had discharged it like them therefore he ought to be subject to no intermediate trial by impeachment he ought not to be impeachable unless he held his office during good behavior a tenure which would be most agreeable to him provided an independent and effectual forum could be devised but under no circumstances ought he to be impeachable by the legislature this would be destructive of his independence and of the principles of the constitution he relied on the vigor of the executive as a great security for the public liberties mr randolph the propriety of impeachments was a favorite principle with him guilt wherever found ought to be punished the executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power particularly in time of war when the military force and in some respects the public money will be in his hands should no regular punishment be provided it will be irregularly inflicted by tumults  insurrections he is aware of the necessity of proceeding with a cautious hand and of excluding as much as possible the influence of the legislature from the business he suggested for consideration an idea which had fallen from col hamilton of composing    a forum out of the judges belonging to the states and even of requiring some preliminary inquest whether just ground of impeachment existed doctr franklin mentioned the case of the prince of orange during the late war an agreement was made between france  holland by which their two fleets were to unite at a certain time  place the dutch fleet did not appear every body began to wonder at it at length it was suspected that the statholder was at the bottom of the matter this suspicion prevailed more  more yet as he could not be impeached and no regular examination took place he remained in his office and strengthening his own party as the party opposed to him became formidable he gave birth to the most violent animosities  contentions had he been impeachable a regular  peaceable enquiry would have taken place and he would if guilty have been duly punished if innocent restored to the confidence of the public mr king remarked that the case of the statholder was not applicable he held his place for life and was not periodically elected in the former case impeachments are proper to secure good behaviour in the latter they are unnecessary the periodical responsibility to the electors being an equivalent security mr wilson observed that if the idea were to be pursued the senators who are to hold their places during the same term with the executive ought to be subject to impeachment  removal mr pinkney apprehended that some gentlemen    reasoned on a supposition that the executive was to have powers which would not be committed to him he presumed that his powers would be so circumscribed as to render impeachments unnecessary mr govr morriss opinion had been changed by the arguments used in the discussion he was now sensible of the necessity of impeachments if the executive was to continue for any length of time in office our executive was not like a magistrate having a life interest much less like one having an hereditary interest in his office he may be bribed by a greater interest to betray his trust and no one would say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing the first magistrate in forign pay without being able to guard agst it by displacing him one would think the king of england well secured agst bribery he has as it were a fee simple in the whole kingdom yet charles ii was bribed by louis xiv the executive ought therefore to be impeachable for treachery corrupting his electors and incapacity were other causes of impeachment for the latter he should be punished not as a man but as an officer and punished only by degradation from his office this magistrate is not the king but the prime minister the people are the king when we make him amenable to justice however we should take care to provide some mode that will not make him dependent on the legislature it was moved   ded to postpone the question of impeachments which was negatived mas  s carolina only being ay  0 on ye question shall the executive be removable on impeachments c mass no ct ay n j ay pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo ay executive to receive fixed compensation agreed to nem con to be paid out of the national treasury agreed to n jersey only in the negative mr gerry  govr morris moved that the electors of the executive shall not be members of the natl legislature nor officers of the u states nor shall the electors themselves be eligible to the supreme magistracy agreed to nem con docr mcclurg  asked whether it would not be necessary before a committee for detailing the constitution should be appointed to determine on the means by which the executive is to carry the laws into effect and to resist combinations agst them is he to have a military force for the purpose or to have the command of the militia the only existing force that can be applied to that use as the resolutions now stand the committee will have no determinate directions on this great point mr wilson thought that some additional directions to the committee wd be necessary    mr king the committee are to provide for the end their discretionary power to provide for the means is involved according to an established axiom adjourned saturday july    in convention mr williamson moved that the electors of the executive should be paid out of the national treasury for the service to be performed by them justice required this as it was a national service they were to render the motion was agreed to nem con mr wilson moved as an amendment to resoln  0 that the supreme natl judiciary should be associated with the executive in the revisionary power this proposition had been before made and failed but he was so confirmed by reflection in the opinion of its utility that he thought it incumbent on him to make another effort the judiciary ought to have an opportunity of remonstrating agst projected encroachments on the people as well as on themselves it had been said that the judges as expositors of the laws would have an opportunity of defending their constitutional rights there was weight in this observation but this power of the judges did not go far enough laws may be unjust may be unwise may be dangerous may be destructive and yet may not be so unconstitutional as to justify the judges in refusing to give them effect let them    have a share in the revisionary power and they will have an opportunity of taking notice of these characters of a law and of counteracting by the weight of their opinions the improper views of the legislature—mr madison  ded the motion mr ghorum did not see the advantage of employing the judges in this way as judges they are not to be presumed to possess any peculiar knowledge of the mere policy of public measures nor can it be necessary as a security for their constitutional rights the judges in england have no such additional provision for their defence yet their jurisdiction is not invaded he thought it would be best to let the executive alone be responsible and at most to authorize him to call on judges for their opinions mr elseworth approved heartily of the motion the aid of the judges will give more wisdom  firmness to the executive they will possess a systematic and accurate knowledge of the laws which the executive cannot be expected always to possess the law of nations also will frequently come into question of this the judges alone will have competent information mr madison considered the object of the motion as of great importance to the meditated constitution it would be useful to the judiciary departmt by giving it an additional opportunity of defending itself agst legislative encroachments it would be useful to the executive by inspiring additional confidence  firmness in exerting the revisionary power    it would be useful to the legislature by the valuable assistance it would give in preserving a consistency conciseness perspicuity  technical propriety in the laws qualities peculiarly necessary  yet shamefully wanting in our republican codes it would moreover be useful to the community at large as an additional check agst a pursuit of those unwise  unjust measures which constituted so great a portion of our calamities if any solid objection could be urged agst the motion it must be on the supposition that it tended to give too much strength either to the executive or judiciary he did not think there was the least ground for this apprehension it was much more to be apprehended that notwithstanding this cooperation of the two departments the legislature would still be an overmatch for them experience in all the states had evinced a powerful tendency in the legislature to absorb all power into its vortex this was the real source of danger to the american constitutions  suggested the necessity of giving every defensive authority to the other departments that was consistent with republican principles mr mason said he had always been a friend to this provision it would give a confidence to the executive which he would not otherwise have and without which the revisionary power would be of little avail mr gerry did not expect to see this point which had undergone full discussion again revived the object he conceived of the revisionary power was merely to secure the executive department agst    legislative encroachment the executive therefore who will best know and be ready to defend his rights ought alone to have the defence of them the motion was liable to strong objections it was combining  mixing together the legislative  the other departments it was establishing an improper coalition between the executive  judiciary departments it was making statesmen of the judges and setting them up as the guardians of the rights of the people he relied for his part on the representatives of the people as the guardians of their rights  interests it was making the expositors of the laws the legislators which ought never to be done a better expedient for correcting the laws would be to appoint as had been done in pena a person or persons of proper skill to draw bills for the legislature mr strong thought with mr gerry that the power of making ought to be kept distinct from that of expounding the laws no maxim was better established the judges in exercising the function of expositors might be influenced by the part they had taken in framing the laws mr govr morris some check being necessary on the legislature the question is in what hands it should be lodged on one side it was contended that the executive alone ought to exercise it he did not think that an executive appointed for   years and impeachable whilst in office wd be a very effectual check on the other side it was urged that he ought to be reinforced by the judiciary department agst this it was objected that expositors of    laws ought to have no hand in making them and arguments in favor of this had been drawn from england what weight was due to them might be easily determined by an attention to facts the truth was that the judges in england had a great share in ye legislation they are consulted in difficult  doubtful cases they may be  some of them are members of the legislature they are or may be members of the privy council and can there advise the executive as they will do with us if the motion succeeds the influence the english judges may have in the latter capacity in strengthening the executive check can not be ascertained as the king by his influence in a manner dictates the laws there is one difference in the two cases however which disconcerts all reasoning from the british to our proposed constitution the british executive has so great an interest in his prerogatives and such powerful means of defending them that he will never yield any part of them the interest of our executive is so inconsiderable  so transitory and his means of defending it so feeble that there is the justest ground to fear his want of firmness in resisting incroachments he was extremely apprehensive that the auxiliary firmness  weight of the judiciary would not supply the deficiency he concurred in thinking the public liberty in greater danger from legislative usurpations than from any other source it had been said that the legislature ought to be relied on as the proper guardians of liberty the answer was short and conclusive either bad laws will be    pushed or not on the latter supposition no check will be wanted on the former a strong check will be necessary and this is the proper supposition emissions of paper money largesses to the people—a remission of debts and similar measures will at some times be popular and will be pushed for that reason at other times such measures will coincide with the interests of the legislature themselves  that will be a reason not less cogent for pushing them it may be thought that the people will not be deluded and misled in the latter case but experience teaches another lesson the press is indeed a great means of diminishing the evil yet it is found to be unable to prevent it altogether mr l martin considered the association of the judges with the executive as a dangerous innovation as well as one which could not produce the particular advantage expected from it a knowledge of mankind and of legislative affairs cannot be presumed to belong in a higher degree to the judges than to the legislature and as to the constitutionality of laws that point will come before the judges in their proper official character in this character they have a negative on the laws join them with the executive in the revision and they will have a double negative it is necessary that the supreme judiciary should have the confidence of the people this will soon be lost if they are employed in the task of remonstrating agst popular measures of the legislature besides in what mode  proportion are they to vote in the council of revision    mr madison could not discover in the proposed association of the judges with the executive in the revisionary check on the legislature any violation of the maxim which requires the great departments of power to be kept separate  distinct on the contrary he thought it an auxiliary precaution in favor of the maxim if a constitutional discrimination of the departments on paper were a sufficient security to each agst encroachments of the others all further provisions would indeed be superfluous but experience had taught us a distrust of that security and that it is necessary to introduce such a balance of powers and interests as will guarantee the provisions on paper instead therefore of contenting ourselves with laying down the theory in the constitution that each department ought to be separate  distinct it was proposed to add a defensive power to each which should maintain the theory in practice in so doing we did not blend the departments together we erected effectual barriers for keeping them separate the most regular example of this theory was in the british constitution yet it was not only the practice there to admit the judges to a seat in the legislature and in the executive councils and to submit to their previous examination all laws of a certain description but it was a part of their constitution that the executive might negative any law whatever a part of their constitution which had been universally regarded as calculated for the preservation of the whole the objection agst a union of the judiciary  executive branches    in the revision of the laws had either no foundation or was not carried far enough if such a union was an improper mixture of powers or such a judiciary check on the laws was inconsistent with the theory of a free constitution it was equally so to admit the executive to any participation in the making of laws and the revisionary plan ought to be discarded altogether col mason observed that the defence of the executive was not the sole object of the revisionary power he expected even greater advantages from it notwithstanding the precautions taken in the constitution of the legislature it would still so much resemble that of the individual states that it must be expected frequently to pass unjust and pernicious laws this restraining power was therefore essentially necessary it would have the effect not only of hindering the final passage of such laws but would discourage demagogues from attempting to get them passed it has been said by mr l martin that if the judges were joined in this check on the laws they would have a double negative since in their expository capacity of judges they would have one negative he would reply that in this capacity they could impede in one case only the operation of laws they could declare an unconstitutional law void but with regard to every law however unjust oppressive or pernicious which did not come plainly under this description they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course he wished the further use to be made of the judges of    giving aid in preventing every improper law their aid will be the more valuable as they are in the habit and practice of considering laws in their true principles and in all their consequences mr wilson the separation of the departments does not require that they should have separate objects but that they should act separately tho on the same objects it is necessary that the two branches of the legislature should be separate and distinct yet they are both to act precisely on the same object mr gerry had rather give the executive an absolute negative for its own defence than thus to blend together the judiciary  executive departments it will bind them together in an offensive and defensive alliance agst the legislature and render the latter unwilling to enter into a contest with them mr govr morris was surprised that any defensive provision for securing the effectual separation of the departments should be considered as an improper mixture of them suppose that the three powers were to be vested in three persons by compact among themselves that one was to have the power of making another of executing and a third of judging the laws would it not be very natural for the two latter after having settled the partition on paper to observe and would not candor oblige the former to admit that as a security agst legislative acts of the former which might easily be so framed as to undermine the powers of the two others the two others ought to be armed with a veto for  0 their own defence or at least to have an opportunity of stating their objections agst acts of encroachment and would any one pretend that such a right tended to blend  confound powers that ought to be separately exercised as well might it be said that if three neighbours had three distinct farms a right in each to defend his farm agst his neighbours tended to blend the farms together mr ghorum all agree that a check on the legislature is necessary but there are two objections agst admitting the judges to share in it which no observations on the other side seem to obviate the  st is that the judges ought to carry into the exposition of the laws no prepossessions with regard to them  d that as the judges will outnumber the executive the revisionary check would be thrown entirely out of the executive hands and instead of enabling him to defend himself would enable the judges to sacrifice him mr wilson the proposition is certainly not liable to all the objections which have been urged agst it according to mr gerry it will unite the executive  judiciary in an offensive  defensive alliance agst the legislature according to mr ghorum it will lead to a subversion of the executive by the judiciary influence to the first gentleman the answer was obvious that the joint weight of the two departments was necessary to balance the single weight of the legislature to the  st objection stated by the other gentleman it might be answered that supposing the prepossession to mix itself with    the exposition the evil would be overbalanced by the advantages promised by the expedient to the  d objection that such a rule of voting might be provided in the detail as would guard agst it mr rutlidge thought the judges of all men the most unfit to be concerned in the revisionary council the judges ought never to give their opinion on a law till it comes before them he thought it equally unnecessary the executive could advise with the officers of state as of war finance c and avail himself of their information  opinions on question on mr wilsons motion for joining the judiciary in the revision of laws it passed in the negative— mass no cont ay n j not present pa divd del no md ay va ay n c no s c no geo divd resol  0 giving the ex a qualified veto without the amendt was then agd to nem con the motion made by mr madison july     then postponed that the judges shd be nominated by the executive  such nominations become appointments unless disagreed to by ⅔ of the  d branch of the legislature was now resumed mr madison stated as his reasons for the motion   that it secured the responsibility of the executive who would in general be more capable  likely to select fit characters than the legislature or even the  d b of it who might hide their selfish motives under the number concerned in the appointment   that in case of any flagrant partiality or error in    the nomination it might be fairly presumed that ⅔ of the  d branch would join in putting a negative on it   that as the  d b was very differently constituted when the appointment of the judges was formerly referred to it and was now to be composed of equal votes from all the states the principle of compromise which had prevailed in other instances required in this that there shd be a concurrence of two authorities in one of which the people in the other the states should be represented the executive magistrate wd be considered as a national officer acting for and equally sympathizing with every part of the u states if the  d branch alone should have this power the judges might be appointed by a minority of the people tho by a majority of the states which could not be justified on any principle as their proceedings were to relate to the people rather than to the states and as it would moreover throw the appointments entirely into the hands of ye northern states a perpetual ground of jealousy  discontent would be furnished to the southern states mr pinkney was for placing the appointmt in the  d b exclusively the executive will possess neither the requisite knowledge of characters nor confidence of the people for so high a trust mr randolph wd have preferred the mode of appointmt proposed formerly by mr ghorum as adopted in the constitution of massts but thought the motion depending so great an improvement of the clause as it stands that he anxiously wished it success he    laid great stress on the responsibility of the executive as a security for fit appointments appointments by the legislatures have generally resulted from cabal from personal regard or some other consideration than a title derived from the proper qualifications the same inconveniences will proportionally prevail if the appointments be referred to either branch of the legislature or to any other authority administered by a number of individuals mr elseworth would prefer a negative in the executive on a nomination by the  d branch the negative to be overruled by a concurrence of ⅔ of the  d b to the mode proposed by the motion but preferred an absolute appointment by the  d branch to either the executive will be regarded by the people with a jealous eye every power for augmenting unnecessarily his influence will be disliked as he will be stationary it was not to be supposed he could have a better knowledge of characters he will be more open to caresses  intrigues than the senate the right to supersede his nomination will be ideal only a nomination under such circumstances will be equivalent to an appointment mr govr morris supported the motion   the states in their corporate capacity will frequently have an interest staked on the determination of the judges as in the senate the states are to vote the judges ought not to be appointed by the senate next to the impropriety of being judge in ones own cause is the appointment of the judge   it had been said the executive would be uninformed of    characters the reverse was ye truth the senate will be so they must take the character of candidates from the flattering pictures drawn by their friends the executive in the necessary intercourse with every part of the u s required by the nature of his administration will or may have the best possible information   it had been said that a jealousy would be entertained of the executive if the executive can be safely trusted with the command of the army there cannot surely be any reasonable ground of jealousy in the present case he added that if the objections agst an appointment of the executive by the legislature had the weight that had been allowed there must be some weight in the objection to an appointment of the judges by the legislature or by any part of it mr gerry the appointment of the judges like every other part of the constitution shd be so modelled as to give satisfaction both to the people and to the states the mode under consideration will give satisfaction to neither he could not conceive that the executive could be as well informed of characters throughout the union as the senate it appeared to him also a strong objection that ⅔ of the senate were required to reject a nomination of the executive the senate would be constituted in the same manner as congress and the appointments of congress have been generally good mr madison observed that he was not anxious that ⅔ should be necessary to disagree to a nomination he had given this form to his motion chiefly    to vary it the more clearly from one which had just been rejected he was content to obviate the objection last made and accordingly so varied the motion as to let a majority reject col mason found it his duty to differ from his colleagues in their opinions  reasonings on this subject notwithstanding the form of the proposition by which the appointment seemed to be divided between the executive  senate the appointment was substantially vested in the former alone the false complaisance which usually prevails in such cases will prevent a disagreement to the first nominations he considered the appointment by the executive as a dangerous prerogative it might even give him an influence over the judiciary department itself he did not think the difference of interest between the northern and southern states could be properly brought into this argument it would operate  require some precautions in the case of regulating navigation commerce  imposts but he could not see that it had any connection with the judiciary department on the question the motion now being that the executive should nominate  such nominations

the articles of union taken into consideration mr williamson suggests that a reciprocal oath should be required from the national officers to support the governments of the states mr gerry moved to insert as an amendmt that the oath of the officers of the national government also should extend to the support of the natl govt which was agreed to nem con mr wilson said he was never fond of oaths considering them as a left handed security only a good govt did not need them and a bad one could not or ought not to be supported he was afraid    they might too much trammel the members of the existing govt in case future alterations should be necessary and prove an obstacle to resol    just agd to mr ghorum did not know that oaths would be of much use but could see no inconsistency between them and the    resol or any regular amendt of the constitution the oath could only require fidelity to the existing constitution a constitutional alteration of the constitution could never be regarded as a breach of the constitution or of any oath to support it mr gerry thought with mr ghorum there could be no shadow of inconsistency in the case nor could he see any other harm that could result from the resolution on the other side he thought one good effect would be produced by it hitherto the officers of the two governments had considered them as distinct from and not as parts of the general system  had in all cases of interference given a preference to the state govts the proposed oath will cure that error the resoln    was agreed to nem con resol    referring the new constitution to assemblies to be chosen by the people for the express purpose of ratifying it was next taken into consideration mr elseworth moved that it be referred to the legislatures of the states for ratification mr patterson  ded the motion col mason considered a reference of the plan to    the authority of the people as one of the most important and essential of the resolutions the legislatures have no power to ratify it they are the mere creatures of the state constitutions and cannot be greater than their creators and he knew of no power in any of the constitutions he knew there was no power in some of them that could be competent to this object whither then must we resort to the people with whom all power remains that has not been given up in the constitutions derived from them it was of great moment he observed that this doctrine should be cherished as the basis of free government another strong reason was that admitting the legislatures to have a competent authority it would be wrong to refer the plan to them because succeeding legislatures having equal authority could undo the acts of their predecessors and the national govt would stand in each state on the weak and tottering foundation of an act of assembly there was a remaining consideration of some weight in some of the states the govts were not derived from the clear  undisputed authority of the people this was the case in virginia some of the best  wisest citizens considered the constitution as established by an assumed authority a national constitution derived from such a source would be exposed to the severest criticisms mr randolph one idea has pervaded all our proceedings to wit that opposition as well from the states as from individuals will be made to the system to be proposed will it not then be highly    imprudent to furnish any unnecessary pretext by the mode of ratifying it added to other objections agst a ratification by the legislative authority only it may be remarked that there have been instances in which the authority of the common law has been set up in particular states agst that of the confederation which has had no higher sanction than legislative ratification—whose opposition will be most likely to be excited agst the system that of the local demagogues who will be degraded by it from the importance they now hold these will spare no efforts to impede that progress in the popular mind which will be necessary to the adoption of the plan and which every member will find to have taken place in his own if he will compare his present opinions with those brought with him into the convention it is of great importance therefore that the consideration of this subject should be transferred from the legislatures where this class of men have their full influence to a field in which their efforts can be less mischievous it is moreover worthy of consideration that some of the states are averse to any change in their constitution and will not take the requisite steps unless expressly called upon to refer the question to the people mr gerry the arguments of col mason  mr randolph prove too much they prove an unconstitutionality in the present federal system  even in some of the state govts inferences drawn from such a source must be inadmissible both the state govts  the federal govt have been too long  0 acquiesced in to be now shaken he considered the confederation to be paramount to any state constitution the last article of it authorizing alterations must consequently be so as well as the others and every thing done in pursuance of the article must have the same high authority with the article great confusion he was confident would result from a recurrence to the people they would never agree on any thing he could not see any ground to suppose that the people will do what their rulers will not the rulers will either conform to or influence the sense of the people mr ghorum was agst referring the plan to the legislatures   men chosen by the people for the particular purpose will discuss the subject more candidly than members of the legislature who are to lose the power which is to be given up to the genl govt   some of the legislatures are composed of several branches it will consequently be more difficult in these cases to get the plan through the legislatures than thro a convention   in the states many of the ablest men are excluded from the legislatures but may be elected into a convention among these may be ranked many of the clergy who are generally friends to good government their services were found to be valuable in the formation  establishment of the constitution of massachts   the legislatures will be interrupted with a variety of little business by artfully pressing which designing men will find means to delay from year to year if not to frustrate altogether the national system      if the last art of the confederation is to be pursued the unanimous concurrence of the states will be necessary but will any one say that all the states are to suffer themselves to be ruined if rho island should persist in her opposition to general measures some other states might also tread in her steps the present advantage which n york seems to be so much attached to of taxing her neighbours by the regulation of her trade makes it very probable that she will be of the number it would therefore deserve serious consideration whether provision ought not to be made for giving effect to the system without waiting for the unanimous concurrence of the states mr elseworth if there be any legislatures who should find themselves incompetent to the ratification he should be content to let them advise with their constituents and pursue such a mode as wd be competent he thought more was to be expected from the legislatures than from the people the prevailing wish of the people in the eastern states is to get rid of the public debt and the idea of strengthening the natl govt carries with it that of strengthening the public debt it was said by col mason   that the legislatures have no authority in this case   that their successors having equal authority could rescind their acts as to the  d point he could not admit it to be well founded an act to which the states by their legislatures make themselves parties becomes a compact from which no one of the parties can recede of itself as to the     st point he observed that a new sett of ideas seemed to have crept in since the articles of confederation were established conventions of the people or with power derived expressly from the people were not then thought of the legislatures were considered as competent their ratification has been acquiesced in without complaint to whom have congs applied on subsequent occasions for further powers to the legislatures not to the people the fact is that we exist at present and we need not enquire how as a federal society united by a charter one article of which is that alterations therein may be made by the legislative authority of the states it has been said that if the confederation is to be observed the states must unanimously concur in the proposed innovations he would answer that if such were the urgency  necessity of our situation as to warrant a new compact among a part of the states founded on the consent of the people the same pleas would be equally valid in favor of a partial compact founded on the consent of the legislatures mr williamson thought the resoln    so expressed as that it might be submitted either to the legislatures or to conventions recommended by the legislatures he observed that some legislatures were evidently unauthorized to ratify the system he thought too that conventions were to be preferred as more likely to be composed of the ablest men in the states mr govr morris considered the inference of mr elseworth    from the plea of necessity as applied to the establishment of a new system on ye consent of the people of a part of the states in favor of a like establishmt on the consent of a part of the legislatures as a non sequitur if the confederation is to be pursued no alteration can be made without the unanimous consent of the legislatures legislative alterations not conformable to the federal compact would clearly not be valid the judges would consider them as null  void whereas in case of an appeal to the people of the u s the supreme authority the federal compact may be altered by a majority of them in like manner as the constitution of a particular state may be altered by a majority of the people of the state the amendmt moved by mr elseworth erroneously supposes that we are proceeding on the basis of the confederation this convention is unknown to the confederation mr king thought with mr elseworth that the legislatures had a competent authority the acquiescence of the people of america in the confederation being equivalent to a formal ratification by the people he thought with mr e also that the plea of necessity was as valid in the one case as the other at the same time he preferred a reference to the authority of the people expressly delegated to conventions as the most certain means of obviating all disputes  doubts concerning the legitimacy of the new constitution as well as the most likely means of drawing forth the best men in the states to decide on it he remarked that among other objections    made in the state of n york to granting powers to congs one had been that such powers as would operate within the state could not be reconciled to the constitution and therefore were not grantible by the legislative authority he considered it as of some consequence also to get rid of the scruples which some members of the state legislatures might derive from their oaths to support  maintain the existing constitutions mr madison thought it clear that the legislatures were incompetent to the proposed changes these changes would make essential inroads on the state constitutions and it would be a novel  dangerous doctrine that a legislature could change the constitution under which it held its existence there might indeed be some constitutions within the union which had given a power to the legislature to concur in alterations of the federal compact but there were certainly some which had not and in the case of these a ratification must of necessity be obtained from the people he considered the difference between a system founded on the legislatures only and one founded on the people to be the true difference between a league or treaty and a constitution the former in point of moral obligation might be as inviolable as the latter in point of political operation there were two important distinctions in favor of the latter   a law violating a treaty ratified by a preexisting law might be respected by the judges as a law though an unwise or perfidious one a law violating a constitution established    by the people themselves would be considered by the judges as null  void   the doctrine laid down by the law of nations in the case of treaties is that a breach of any one article by any of the parties frees the other parties from their engagements in the case of a union of people under one constitution the nature of the pact has always been understood to exclude such an interpretation comparing the two modes in point of expediency he thought all the considerations which recommended this convention in preference to congress for proposing the reform were in favor of state conventions in preference to the legislatures for examining and adopting it on question on mr elseworths motion to refer the plan to the legislatures of the states n h no mass no ct ay pa no del ay md ay va no n

be allowed to each state and a majority be made a quorum the power would be lodged in    members which was too small a number for such a trust mr ghorum preferred two to three members for the blank a small number was most convenient for deciding on peace  war c which he expected would be vested in the  d branch the number of states will also increase kentucky vermont the province of mayne  franklin will probably soon be added to the present number he presumed also that some of the largest states would be divided the strength of the general govt will lie not in the largeness but in the smallness of the states col mason thought   from each state including new states would make the  d branch too numerous besides other objections the additional expence ought always to form one where it was not absolutely necessary mr williamson if the number be too great the distant states will not be on an equal footing with the nearer states the latter can more easily send  support their ablest citizens he approved of the voting per capita on the question for filling the blank with three n h no mass no cont no pa ay del no va no n c no s c no geo no    on question for filling it with two

instead of electors appointed by the state legislatures according to the last decision of the mode he dwelt chiefly on the improbability that capable men would undertake the service of electors from the more distant states mr spaight seconded the motion mr gerry opposed it he thought there was no ground to apprehend the danger urged by mr houston the election of the executive magistrate will be considered as of vast importance and will create great earnestness the best men the governours of the states will not hold it derogatory from their character to be the electors if the motion should be agreed to it will be necessary to make the executive ineligible a  d time in order to render him independent of the legislature which was an idea extremely repugnant to his way of thinking mr strong supposed that there would be no necessity if the executive should be appointed by the legislature to make him ineligible a  d time as new elections of the legislature will have intervened and he will not depend for his  d appointment on the same sett of men as his first was recd from it had been suggested that gratitude for his past appointment wd produce the same effect as dependence for his future appointment he thought very differently besides this objection would lie agst the electors who would be objects of gratitude as well as the legislature it was of great importance not to make the govt too complex which would be the case if a  0 new sett of men like the electors should be introduced into it he thought also that the first characters in the states would not feel sufficient motives to undertake the office of electors mr williamson was for going back to the original ground to elect the executive for   years and render him ineligible a  d time the proposed electors would certainly not be men of the  st nor even of the  d grade in the states these would all prefer a seat either in the senate or the other branch of the legislature he did not like the unity in the executive he had wished the executive power to be lodged in three men taken from three districts into which the states should be divided as the executive is to have a kind of veto on the laws and there is an essential difference of interests between the n  s states particularly in the carrying trade the power will be dangerous if the executive is to be taken from part of the union to the part from which he is not taken the case is different here from what it is in england where there is a sameness of interests throughout the kingdom another objection agst a single magistrate is that he will be an elective king and will feel the spirit of one he will spare no pains to keep himself in for life and will then lay a train for the succession of his children it was pretty certain he thought that we should at some time or other have a king but he wished no precaution to be omitted that might postpone the event as long as possible—ineligibility a  d time appeared to him to be the best precaution with this precaution    he had no objection to a longer term than   years he would go as far as  0 or    years mr gerry moved that the legislatures of the states should vote by ballot for the executive in the same proportions as it had been proposed they should chuse electors and that in case a majority of the votes should not centre on the same person the  st branch of the natl legislature should chuse two out of the   candidates having most votes and out of these two the  d branch should chuse the executive mr king seconded the motion—and on the question to postpone in order to take it into consideration the noes were so predominant that the states were not counted question on mr houstons motion that the executive be appd by the nal legislature n h ay mass ay ct no n j ay pa no del ay md no va no n c ay s c ay geo ay mr l martin  mr gerry moved to reinstate the ineligibility of the executive a  d time mr elseworth with many this appears a natural consequence of his being elected by the legislature it was not the case with him the executive he thought should be reelected if his conduct proved him worthy of it and he will be more likely to render himself worthy of it if he be rewardable with it the most eminent characters also will be more willing to accept the trust under this condition than if they foresee a necessary degradation at a fixt period    mr gerry that the executive shd be independent of the legislature is a clear point the longer the duration of his appointment the more will his dependence be diminished it will be better then for him to continue  0    or even  0 years and be ineligible afterwards mr king was for making him reeligible this is too great an advantage to be given up for the small effect it will have on his dependence if impeachments are to lie he considered these as rendering the tenure during pleasure mr l martin suspending his motion as to the ineligibility moved that the appointmt of the executive shall continue for eleven years mr gerry suggested fifteen years mr king twenty years this is the medium life of princes  mr davie eight years mr wilson the difficulties  perplexities into which the house is thrown proceed from the election by the legislature which he was sorry had been reinstated the inconveniency of this mode was such that he would agree to almost any length of time in order to get rid of the dependence which must result from it he was persuaded that the longest term would not be equivalent to a proper mode of election unless indeed it should be during good behaviour it seemed to be supposed that at a certain advance of life a continuance in office would cease    to be agreeable to the officer as well as desirable to the public experience had shewn in a variety of instances that both a capacity  inclination for public service existed in very advanced stages he mentioned the instance of a doge of venice who was elected after he was  0 years of age the popes have generally been elected at very advanced periods and yet in no case had a more steady or a better concerted policy been pursued than in the court of rome if the executive should come into office at    years of age which he presumes may happen  his continuance should be fixt at    years at the age of  0 in the very prime of life and with all the aid of experience he must be cast aside like a useless hulk what an irreparable loss would the british jurisprudence have sustained had the age of  0 been fixt there as the ultimate limit of capacity or readiness to serve the public the great luminary ld mansfield held his seat for thirty years after his arrival at that age notwithstanding what had been done he could not but hope that a better mode of election would yet be adopted and one that would be more agreeable to the general sense of the house that time might be given for further deliberation he wd move that the present question be postponed till tomorrow mr broom seconded the motion to postpone mr gerry we seem to be entirely at a loss on this head he would suggest whether it would not be advisable to refer the clause relating to the executive to the committee of detail to be appointed    perhaps they will be able to hit on something that may unite the various opinions which have been thrown out mr wilson as the great difficulty seems to spring from the mode of election he wd suggest a mode which had not been mentioned it was that the executive be elected for   years by a small number not more than    of the natl legislature to be drawn from it not by ballot but by lot and who should retire immediately and make the election without separating by this mode intrigue would be avoided in the first instance and the dependence would be diminished this was not he said a digested idea and might be liable to strong objections mr govr morris of all possible modes of appointment that by the legislature is the worst if the legislature is to appoint and to impeach or to influence the impeachment the executive will be the mere creature of it he had been opposed to the impeachment but was now convinced that impeachments must be provided for if the appt was to be of any duration no man wd say that an executive known to be in the pay of an enemy should not be removable in some way or other he had been charged heretofore by col mason with inconsistency in pleading for confidence in the legislature on some occasions  urging a distrust on others the charge was not well founded the legislature is worthy of unbounded confidence in some respects and liable to equal distrust in others when their interest coincides precisely with that of their constituents    as happens in many of their acts no abuse of trust is to be apprehended when a strong personal interest happens to be opposed to the general interest the legislature cannot be too much distrusted in all public bodies there are two parties the executive will necessarily be more connected with one than with the other there will be a personal interest therefore in one of the parties to oppose as well as in the other to support him much had been said of the intrigues that will be practised by the executive to get into office nothing had been said on the other side of the intrigues to get him out of office some leader of a party will always covet his seat will perplex his administration will cabal with the legislature till he succeeds in supplanting him this was the way in which the king of england was got out he meant the real king the minister this was the way in which pitt ld chatham forced himself into place fox was for pushing the matter still farther if he had carried his india bill which he was very near doing he would have made the minister the king in form almost as well as in substance our president will be the british minister yet we are about to make him appointable by the legislature something had been said of the danger of monarchy if a good government should not now be formed if a good organization of the executive should not be provided he doubted whether we should not have something worse than a limited monarchy in order to get rid of the dependence of the executive on the    legislature the expedient of making him ineligible a  d time had been devised this was as much as to say we shd give him the benefit of experience and then deprive ourselves of the use of it but make him ineligible a  d time—and prolong his duration even to    years will he by any wonderful interposition of providence at that period cease to be a man no he will be unwilling to quit his exaltation the road to his object thro the constitution will be shut he will be in possession of the sword a civil war will ensue and the com̃ander of the victorious army on which ever side will be the despot of america this consideration renders him particularly anxious that the executive should be properly constituted the vice here would not as in some other parts of the system be curable it is the most difficult of all rightly to balance the executive make him too weak the legislature will usurp his powers make him too strong he will usurp on the legislature he preferred a short period a reeligibility but a different mode of election a long period would prevent an adoption of the plan it ought to do so he shd himself be afraid to trust it he was not prepared to decide on mr wilsons mode of election just hinted by him he thought it deserved consideration it would be better that chance shd decide than intrigue on a question to postpone the consideration of the resolution on the subject of the executive n h no mass no ct ay n j no pa ay del divd md ay va ay n c no s c no geo no    mr wilson then moved that the executive be chosen every — years by — electors to be taken by lot from the natl legislature who shall proceed immediately to the choice of the executive and not separate until it be made mr carrol  ds the motion mr gerry this is committing too much to chance if the lot should fall on a sett of unworthy men an unworthy executive must be saddled on the country he thought it had been demonstrated that no possible mode of electing by the legislature could be a good one mr king the lot might fall on a majority from the same state which wd ensure the election of a man from that state we ought to be governed by reason not by chance as nobody seemed to be satisfied he wished the matter to be postponed mr wilson did not move this as the best mode his opinion remained unshaken that we ought to resort to the people for the election he seconded the postponement mr govr morris observed that the chances were almost infinite agst a majority of electors from the same state on a question whether the last motion was in order it was determined in the affirmative   ays   noes on the question of postponemt it was agreed to nem con mr carrol took occasion to observe that he considered the clause declaring that direct taxation on    the states should be in proportion to representation previous to the obtaining an actual census as very objectionable and that he reserved to himself the right of opposing it if the report of the committee of detail should leave it in the plan mr govr morris hoped the committee would strike out the whole of the clause proportioning direct taxation to representation he had only meant it as a bridge  to assist us over a certain gulph having passed the gulph the bridge may be removed he thought the principle laid down with so much strictness liable to strong objections on a ballot for a committee to report a constitution conformable to the resolutions passed by the convention the members chosen were mr rutlidge mr randolph mr ghorum mr elseworth mr wilson— on motion to discharge the come of the whole from the propositions submitted to the convention by mr c pinkney as the basis of a constitution and to refer them to the committee of detail just appointed it was agd to nem con a like motion was then made  agreed to nem con with respect to the propositions of mr patterson adjourned    wednesday july    in convention clause relating to the executive being again under consideration  mr elseworth moved that the executive be appointed by the legislature except when the magistrate last chosen shall have continued in office the whole term for which he was chosen  be reeligible in which case the choice shall be by electors appointed by the legislatures of the states for that purpose by this means a deserving magistrate may be reelected without making him dependent on the legislature mr gerry repeated his remark that an election at all by the natl legislature was radically and incurably wrong and moved that the executive be appointed by the governours  presidents of the states with advice of their councils and where there are no councils by electors chosen by the legislatures the executives to vote in the following proportions viz — mr madison there are objections agst every mode that has been or perhaps can be proposed the election must be made either by some existing authority under the natl or state constitutions—or by some special authority derived from the people—or by the  0 people themselves—the two existing authorities under the natl constitution wd be the legislative  judiciary the latter he presumed was out of the question the former was in his judgment liable to insuperable objections besides the general influence of that mode on the independence of the executive   the election of the chief magistrate would agitate  divide the legislature so much that the public interest would materially suffer by it public bodies are always apt to be thrown into contentions but into more violent ones by such occasions than by any others   the candidate would intrigue with the legislature would derive his appointment from the predominant faction and be apt to render his administration subservient to its views   the ministers of foreign powers would have and would make use of the opportunity to mix their intrigues  influence with the election limited as the powers of the executive are it will be an object of great moment with the great rival powers of europe who have american possessions to have at the head of our governmt a man attached to their respective politics  interests no pains nor perhaps expence will be spared to gain from the legislature an appointmt favorable to their wishes germany  poland are witnesses of this danger in the former the election of the head of the empire till it became in a manner hereditary interested all europe and was much influenced by foreign interference in the latter altho the elective magistrate has very little real power his election has at all times    produced the most eager interference of forign princes and has in fact at length slid entirely into foreign hands the existing authorities in the states are the legislative executive  judiciary the appointment of the natl executive by the first was objectionable in many points of view some of which had been already mentioned he would mention one which of itself would decide his opinion the legislatures of the states had betrayed a strong propensity to a variety of pernicious measures one object of the natl legislre was to controul this propensity one object of the natl executive so far as it would have a negative on the laws was to controul the natl legislature so far as it might be infected with a similar propensity refer the appointmt of the natl executive to the state legislatures and this controuling purpose may be defeated the legislatures can  will act with some kind of regular plan and will promote the appointmt of a man who will not oppose himself to a favorite object should a majority of the legislatures at the time of election have the same object or different objects of the same kind the natl executive would be rendered subservient to them—an appointment by the state executives was liable among other objections to this insuperable one that being standing bodies they could  would be courted and intrigued with by the candidates by their partizans and by the ministers of foreign powers the state judiciary had not  he presumed wd not be proposed as a proper source of appointment the option before us then lay    between an appointment by electors chosen by the people—and an immediate appointment by the people he thought the former mode free from many of the objections which had been urged agst it and greatly preferable to an appointment by the natl legislature as the electors would be chosen for the occasion would meet at once  proceed immediately to an appointment there would be very little opportunity for cabal or corruption as a further precaution it might be required that they should meet at some place distinct from the seat of govt and even that no person within a certain distance of the place at the time shd be eligible this mode however had been rejected so recently  by so great a majority that it probably would not be proposed anew the remaining mode was an election by the people or rather by the qualified part of them at large with all its imperfections he liked this best he would not repeat either the general argumts for or the objections agst this mode he would only take notice of two difficulties which he admitted to have weight the first arose from the disposition in the people to prefer a citizen of their own state and the disadvantage this wd throw on the smaller states great as this objection might be he did not think it equal to such as lay agst every other mode which had been proposed he thought too that some expedient might be hit upon that would obviate it the second difficulty arose from the disproportion of qualified voters in the n  s states and the disadvantages which this mode would throw on the latter the    answer to this objection was   that this disproportion would be continually decreasing under the influence of the republican laws introduced in the s states and the more rapid increase of their population   that local considerations must give way to the general interest as an individual from the s states he was willing to make the sacrifice mr elseworth the objection drawn from the different sizes of the states is unanswerable the citizens of the largest states would invariably prefer the candidate within the state and the largest states wd invariably have the man question on mr elseworths motion as above n h ay mass no ct ay n j no pa ay del no md ay va no n c no s c no geo no mr pinkney moved that the election by the legislature be qualified with a proviso that no person be eligible for more than   years in any twelve years he thought this would have all the advantage  at the same time avoid in some degree the inconveniency of an absolute ineligibility a  d time col mason approved the idea it had the sanction of experience in the instance of congs and some of the executives of the states it rendered the executive as effectually independent as an ineligibility after his first election and opened the way at the same time for the advantage of his future services he preferred on the whole the election by the natl legislature tho candor obliged him to admit that there was great danger of foreign influence    as had been suggested this was the most serious objection with him that had been urged mr butler the two great evils to be avoided are cabal at home  influence from abroad it will be difficult to avoid either if the election be made by the natl legislature on the other hand the govt should not be made so complex  unwieldy as to disgust the states this would be the case if the election shd be referred to the people he liked best an election by electors chosen by the legislatures of the states he was agst a reeligibility at all events he was also agst a ratio of votes in the states an equality should prevail in this case the reasons for departing from it do not hold in the case of the executive as in that of the legislature mr gerry approved of mr pinkneys motion as lessening the evil mr govr morris was agst a rotation in every case it formed a political school in wch we were always governed by the scholars and not by the masters the evils to be guarded agst in this case are   the undue influence of the legislature   instability of councils   misconduct in office to guard agst the first we run into the second evil we adopt a rotation which produces instability of councils to avoid sylla we fall into charibdis a change of men is ever followed by a change of measures we see this fully exemplified in the vicissitudes among ourselves particularly in the state of pena the selfsufficiency of a victorious party scorns to tread in the paths of their predecessors rehoboam will not    imitate soloman   the rotation in office will not prevent intrigue and dependence on the legislature the man in office will look forward to the period at which he will become reeligible the distance of the period the improbability of such a protraction of his life will be no obstacle such is the nature of man formed by his benevolent author no doubt for wise ends that altho he knows his existence to be limited to a span he takes his measures as if he were to live for ever but taking another supposition the inefficacy of the expedient will be manifest if the magistrate does not look forward to his reelection to the executive he will be pretty sure to keep in view the opportunity of his going into the legislature itself he will have little objection then to an extension of power on a theatre where he expects to act a distinguished part and will be very unwilling to take any step that may endanger his popularity with the legislature on his influence over which the figure he is to make will depend   to avoid the third evil impeachments will be essential and hence an additional reason agst an election by the legislature he considered an election by the people as the best by the legislature as the worst mode putting both these aside he could not but favor the idea of mr wilson of introducing a mixture of lot it will diminish if not destroy both cabal  dependence mr williamson was sensible that strong objections lay agst an election of the executive by the legislature and that it opened a door for foreign influence    the principal objection agst an election by the people seemed to be the disadvantage under which it would place the smaller states he suggested as a cure for this difficulty that each man should vote for   candidates one of them he observed would be probably of his own state the other   of some other states and as probably of a small as a large one mr govr morris liked the idea suggesting as an amendment that each man should vote for two persons one of whom at least should not be of his own state mr madison also thought something valuable might be made of the suggestion with the proposed amendment of it the second best man in this case would probably be the first in fact the only objection which occurred was that each citizen after havg given his vote for his favorite fellow citizen wd throw away his second on some obscure citizen of another state in order to ensure the object of his first choice but it could hardly be supposed that the citizens of many states would be so sanguine of having their favorite elected as not to give their second vote with sincerity to the next object of their choice it might moreover be provided in favor of the smaller states that the executive should not be eligible more than — times in — years from the same state mr gerry a popular election in this case is radically vicious the ignorance of the people would put it in the power of some one set of men dispersed through the union  acting in concert to delude    them into any appointment he observed that such a society of men existed in the order of the cincinnati they are respectable united and influential they will in fact elect the chief magistrate in every instance if the election be referred to the people his respect for the characters composing this society could not blind him to the danger  impropriety of throwing such a power into their hands mr dickinson as far as he could judge from the discussions which had taken place during his attendance insuperable objections lay agst an election of the executive by the natl legislature as also by the legislatures or executives of the states he had long leaned towards an election by the people which he regarded as the best  purest source objections he was aware lay agst this mode but not so great he thought as agst the other modes the greatest difficulty in the opinion of the house seemed to arise from the partiality of the states to their respective citizens but might not this very partiality be turned to a useful purpose let the people of each state chuse its best citizen the people will know the most eminent characters of their own states and the people of different states will feel an emulation in selecting those of which they will have the greatest reason to be proud out of the thirteen names thus selected an executive magistrate may be chosen either by the natl legislature or by electors appointed by it on a question which was moved for postponing mr pinkneys motion in

resolution relating to the executive except the clause making it consist of a single person to the com̃ittee of detail mr wilson hoped that so important a branch of the system wd not be committed untill a general principle shd be fixed by a vote of the house mr langdon was for the commitment—adjd    thursday july    in convention  col mason in every stage of the question relative to the executive the difficulty of the subject and the diversity of the opinions concerning it have appeared nor have any of the modes of constituting that department been satisfactory   it has been proposed that the election should be made by the people at large that is that an act which ought to be performed by those who know most of eminent characters  qualifications should be performed by those who know least   that the election should be made by the legislatures of the states   by the executives of the states agst these modes also strong objections have been urged   it has been proposed that the election should be made by electors chosen by the people for that purpose this was at first agreed to but on further consideration has been rejected   since which the mode of mr williamson requiring each freeholder to vote for several candidates has been proposed this seemed like many other propositions to carry a plausible face but on closer inspection is liable to  0 fatal objections a popular election in any form as mr gerry has observed would throw the appointment into the hands of the cincinnati a society for the members of which he had a great respect but which he never wished to have a preponderating influence in the govt   another expedient was proposed by mr dickinson which is liable to so palpable  material an inconvenience that he had little doubt of its being by this time rejected by himself it would exclude every man who happened not to be popular within his own state tho the causes of his local unpopularity might be of such a nature as to recommend him to the states at large   among other expedients a lottery has been introduced but as the tickets do not appear to be in much demand it will probably not be carried on and nothing therefore need be said on that subject after reviewing all these various modes he was led to conclude that an election by the natl legislature as originally proposed was the best if it was liable to objections it was liable to fewer than any other he conceived at the same time that a second election ought to be absolutely prohibited having for his primary object for the polestar of his political conduct the preservation of the rights of the people he held it as an essential point as the very palladium of civil liberty that the great officers of state and particularly the executive should at fixed periods return to that mass from which they were at first taken in order that they may feel  respect those rights  interests which are again to be personally valuable to    them he concluded with moving that the constitution of the executive as reported by the come of the whole be reinstated viz that the executive be appointed for seven years  be ineligible a  d time mr davie seconded the motion docr franklin it seems to have been imagined by some that the returning to the mass of the people was degrading the magistrate this he thought was contrary to republican principles in free governments the rulers are the servants and the people their superiors  sovereigns for the former therefore to return among the latter was not to degrade but to promote them and it would be imposing an unreasonable burden on them to keep them always in a state of servitude and not allow them to become again one of the masters question on col masons motion as above which passed in the affirmative n h ay massts not on floor ct no n j ay pa no del no md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr govr morris was now agst the whole paragraph in answer to col masons position that a periodical return of the great officers of the state into the mass of the people was the palladium of civil liberty he wd observe that on the same principle the judiciary ought to be periodically degraded certain it was that the legislature ought on every principle yet no one had proposed or conceived that the members of it should not be reeligible in answer to docr franklin that a return into the mass of the people    would be a promotion instead of a degradation he had no doubt that our executive like most others would have too much patriotism to shrink from the burthen of his office and too much modesty not to be willing to decline the promotion on the question on the whole resolution as amended in the words following—that a national executive be instituted—to consist of a single person—to be chosen by the natl legislature—for the term of seven years—to be ineligible a  d time—with power to carry into execution the natl laws—to appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for—to be removable on impeachment  conviction of malpractice or neglect of duty—to receive a fixt compensation for the devotion of his time to the public service to be paid out of the natl treasury—it passed in the affirmative n h ay mass not on floor ct ay n j ay pa no del no md no va divd mr blair  col mason ay genl washington  mr madison no mr randolph happened to be out of the house n c ay s c ay geo ay mr mason moved that the com̃ittee of detail be instructed to receive a clause requiring certain qualifications of landed property  citizenship of the u states in members of the legislature and disqualifying persons having unsettled accts with or being indebted to the u s from being members of the natl legislature—he observed that persons of the latter descriptions had frequently got into the state legislatures in order to promote laws that might    shelter their delinquencies and that this evil had crept into congs if report was to be regarded mr pinckney seconded the motion mr govr morris if qualifications are proper he wd prefer them in the electors rather than the elected as to debtors of the u s they are but few as to persons having unsettled accounts he believed them to be pretty many he thought however that such a discrimination would be both odious  useless and in many instances unjust  cruel the delay of settlemt had been more the fault of the public than of the individuals what will be done with those patriotic citizens who have lent money or services or property to their country without having been yet able to obtain a liquidation of their claims are they to be excluded mr ghorum was for leaving to the legislature the providing agst such abuses as had been mentioned col mason mentioned the parliamentary qualifications adopted in the reign of queen anne which he said had met with universal approbation mr madison had witnessed the zeal of men having accts with the public to get into the legislatures for sinister purposes he thought however that if any precaution were taken for excluding them the one proposed by col mason ought to be new modelled it might be well to limit the exclusion to persons who had recd money from the public and had not accounted for it mr govr morris it was a precept of great antiquity as well as of high authority that we should    not be righteous overmuch he thought we ought to be equally on our guard agst being wise overmuch the proposed regulation would enable the governt to exclude particular persons from office as long as they pleased he mentioned the case of the com̃ander in chiefs presenting his account for secret services which he said was so moderate that every one was astonished at it and so simple that no doubt could arise on it yet had the auditor been disposed to delay the settlement how easily he might have effected it  how cruel wd it be in such a case to keep a distinguished  meritorious citizen under a temporary disability  disfranchisement he mentioned this case merely to illustrate the objectionable nature of the proposition he was opposed to such minutious regulations in a constitution the parliamentary qualifications quoted by col mason had been disregarded in practice and was but a scheme of the landed agst the monied interest mr pinckney  genl pinckney moved to insert by way of amendmt the words judiciary  executive so as to extend the qualifications to those departments which was agreed to nem con mr gerry thought the inconveniency of excluding a few worthy individuals who might be public debtors or have unsettled accts ought not to be put in the scale agst the public advantages of the regulation and that the motion did not go far enough mr king observed that there might be great danger in requiring landed property as a qualification since it would exclude the monied interest    whose aids may be essential in particular emergencies to the public safety mr dickinson was agst any recital of qualifications in the constitution it was impossible to make a compleat one and a partial one wd by implication tie up the hands of the legislature from supplying the omissions the best defence lay in the freeholders who were to elect the legislature whilst this source should remain pure the public interest would be safe if it ever should be corrupt no little expedients would repel the danger he doubted the policy of interweaving into a republican constitution a veneration for wealth he had always understood that a veneration for poverty  virtue were the objects of republican encouragement it seemed improper that any man of merit should be subjected to disabilities in a republic where merit was understood to form the great title to public trust honors  rewards mr gerry if property be one object of government provisions to secure it cannot be improper mr madison moved to strike out the word landed before the word qualifications if the proposition sd be agreed to he wished the committee to be at liberty to report the best criterion they could devise landed possessions were no certain evidence of real wealth many enjoyed them to a great extent who were more in debt than they were worth the unjust laws of the states had proceeded more from this class of men than any others it had often happened that men who had acquired landed property    on credit got into the legislatures with a view of promoting an unjust protection agst their creditors in the next place if a small quantity of land should be made the standard it would be no security if a large one it would exclude the proper representatives of those classes of citizens who were not landholders it was politic as well as just that the interests  rights of every class should be duly represented  understood in the public councils it was a provision every where established that the country should be divided into districts  representatives taken from each in order that the legislative assembly might equally understand  sympathize with the rights of the people in every part of the community it was not less proper that every class of citizens should have an opportunity of making their rights be felt  understood in the public councils the three principal classes into which our citizens were divisible were the landed the commercial  the manufacturing the  d   d class bear as yet a small proportion to the first the proportion however will daily increase we see in the populous countries in europe now what we shall be hereafter these classes understand much less of each others interests  affairs than men of the same class inhabiting different districts it is particularly requisite therefore that the interests of one or two of them should not be left entirely to the care or impartiality of the third this must be the case if landed qualifications should be required few of the mercantile  scarcely any of the manufacturing class chusing    whilst they continue in business to turn any part of their stock into landed property for these reasons he wished if it were possible that some other criterion than the mere possession of land should be devised he concurred with mr govr morris in thinking that qualifications in the electors would be much more effectual than in the elected the former would discriminate between real  ostensible property in the latter but he was aware of the difficulty of forming any uniform standard that would suit the different circumstances  opinions prevailing in the different states mr govr morris  ded the motion on the question for striking out landed n h ay mass ay ct ay n j ay pa ay del ay md no va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay on question on  st

debtors and persons having unsettled accounts being under consideration mr carrol moved to strike out having unsettled accounts mr ghorum seconded the motion observing that it would put the commercial  manufacturing part of the people on a worse footing than others as they    would be most likely to have dealings with the public mr l martin if these words should be struck out and the remaining words concerning debtors retained it will be the interest of the latter class to keep their accounts unsettled as long as possible mr wilson was for striking them out they put too much power in the hands of the auditors who might combine with rivals in delaying settlements in order to prolong the disqualifications of particular men we should consider that we are providing a constitution for future generations and not merely for the peculiar circumstances of the moment the time has been and will again be when the public safety may depend on the voluntary aids of individuals which will necessarily open accts with the public and when such accts will be a characteristic of patriotism besides a partial enumeration of cases will disable the legislature from disqualifying odious  dangerous characters mr langdon  was for striking out the whole clause for the reasons given by mr wilson so many exclusions he thought too would render the system unacceptable to the people mr gerry if the argumts used today were to prevail we might have a legislature composed of public debtors pensioners placemen  contractors he thought the proposed qualifications would be pleasing    to the people they will be considered as a security agst unnecessary or undue burdens being imposed on them he moved to add pensioners to the disqualified characters which was negatived n h no mas ay con no

much as possible from trade duties of course will be bonded and the merchts will remain debtors to the public he repeated that it had not been so much the fault of individuals as of the public that transactions between them had not been more generally liquidated  adjusted at all events to draw from our short  scanty experience rules that are to operate through succeeding ages does not savour much of real wisdom on question for striking out persons having unsettled accounts with the u states n h ay mass ay ct ay n j no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo no mr elseworth was for disagreeing to the remainder of the clause disqualifying public debtors and for leaving to the wisdom of the legislature and the virtue of the citizens the task of providing agst such evils is the smallest as well as the largest debtor to be excluded then every arrear of taxes will disqualify besides how is it to be known to the people when they elect who are or are not public  0 debtors the exclusion of pensioners  placemen in engld is founded on a consideration not existing here as persons of that sort are dependent on the crown they tend to increase its influence mr pinkney sd he was at first a friend to the proposition for the sake of the clause relating to qualifications of property but he disliked the exclusion of public debtors it went too far it wd exclude persons who had purchased confiscated property or should purchase western territory of the public and might be some obstacle to the sale of the latter on the question for agreeing to the clause disqualifying public debtors n h no mass no ct no n j no pa no del no md no va no n c ay s c no geo ay col mason observed that it would be proper as he thought that some provision should be made in the constitution agst choosing for the seat of the genl govt the city or place at which the seat of any state govt might be fixt there were   objections agst having them at the same place which without mentioning others required some precaution on the subject the  st was that it tended to produce disputes concerning jurisdiction the  d  principal one was that the intermixture of the two legislatures tended to give a provincial tincture to ye natl deliberations he moved that the come be instructed to receive a clause to prevent the seat of the natl govt being in the same city or town with the seat of the govt of any state longer than untill the necessary public buildings could be erected    mr alex martin  ded the motion mr govr morris did not dislike the idea but was apprehensive that such a clause might make enemies of philada  n york which had expectations of becoming the seat of the genl govt mr langdon approved the idea also but suggested the case of a state moving its seat of govt to the natl seat after the erection of the public buildings mr ghorum the precaution may be evaded by the natl legislre by delaying to erect the public buildings mr gerry conceived it to be the genl sense of america that neither the seat of a state govt nor any large commercial city should be the seat of the genl govt mr williamson liked the idea but knowing how much the passions of men were agitated by this matter was apprehensive of turning them agst the system he apprehended also that an evasion might be practised in the way hinted by mr ghorum mr pinkney thought the seat of a state govt ought to be avoided but that a large town or its vicinity would be proper for the seat of the genl govt col mason did not mean to press the motion at this time nor to excite any hostile passions agst the system he was content to withdraw the motion for the present mr butler was for fixing by the constitution the place  a central one for the seat of the natl govt    the proceedings since monday last

states and proceed to execute this constitution a motion was made to adjourn till wednesday in order to give leisure to examine the report which passed in the negative—n h no mas no ct no pa ay md ay virg ay n c no s c no the house then adjourned till tomorrow    oc tuesday august  th  in convention the report of the committee of detail being taken up mr pinkney moved that it be referred to a committee of the whole this was strongly opposed by   0 mr ghorum  several others as likely to produce unnecessary delay and was negatived delaware maryd  virga only being in the affirmative the preamble of the report was agreed to nem con so were art i  ii art iii considered col mason doubted the propriety of giving each branch a negative on the other in all cases there were some cases in which it was he supposed not intended to be given as in the case of balloting for appointments mr govr morris moved to insert legislative acts instead of all cases mr williamson  ds him mr sherman this will restrain the operation of the clause too much it will particularly exclude a mutual negative in the case of ballots which he hoped would take place mr ghorum contended that elections ought to be made by joint ballot if separate ballots should be made for the president and the two branches should be each attached to a favorite great delay contention  confusion may ensue these inconveniences have been felt in masts in the election of officers of little importance compared with the executive of     the u states the only objection agst a joint ballot is that it may deprive the senate of their due weight but this ought not to prevail over the respect due to the public tranquility  welfare mr wilson was for a joint ballot in several cases at least particularly in the choice of the president and was therefore for the amendment disputes between the two houses during  concerng the vacancy of the executive might have dangerous consequences col mason thought the amendment of mr govr morris extended too far treaties are in a subsequent part declared to be laws they will therefore be subjected to a negative altho they are to be made as proposed by the senate alone he proposed that the mutual negative should be restrained to cases requiring the distinct assent of the two houses mr govr morris thought this but a repetition of the same thing the mutual negative and distinct assent being equivalent expressions treaties he thought were not laws mr madison moved to strike out the words each of which shall in all cases have a negative on the other the idea being sufficiently expressed in the preceding member of the article vesting the legislative power in distinct bodies especially as the respective powers and mode of exercising them were fully delineated in a subsequent article genl pinkney  ded the motion on question for inserting legislative acts as moved by mr govr morris     n h ay mas ay ct ay pa ay del no md no va no n c ay s c no geo no on question for agreeing to mr ms motion to strike out c— n h ay mas ay ct no pa ay del ay md no va ay n c no s c ay geo ay mr madison wished to know the reasons of the come for fixing by ye constitution the time of meeting for the legislature and suggested that it be required only that one meeting at least should be held every year leaving the time to be fixed or varied by law mr govr morris moved to strike out the sentence it was improper to tie down the legislature to a particular time or even to require a meeting every year the public business might not require it mr pinkney concurred with mr madison mr ghorum if the time be not fixed by the constitution disputes will arise in the legislature and the states will be at a loss to adjust thereto the times of their elections in the n england states the annual time of meeting had been long fixed by their charters  constitutions and no inconveniencey had resulted he thought it necessary that there should be one meeting at least every year as a check on the executive department mr elseworth was agst striking out the words the legislature will not know till they are met whether the public interest required their meeting or not he could see no impropriety in fixing the day as the convention could judge of it as well as the legislature     mr wilson thought on the whole it would be best to fix the day mr king could not think there would be a necessity for a meeting every year a great vice in our system was that of legislating too much the most numerous objects of legislation belong to the states those of the natl legislature were but few the chief of them were commerce  revenue when these should be once settled alterations would be rarely necessary  easily made mr madison thought if the time of meeting should be fixed by a law it wd be sufficiently fixed  there would be no difficulty then as had been suggested on the part of the states in adjusting their elections to it one consideration appeared to him to militate strongly agst fixing a time by the constitution it might happen that the legislature might be called together by the public exigencies  finish their session but a short time before the annual period in this case it would be extremely inconvenient to reassemble so quickly  without the least necessity he thought one annual meeting ought to be required but did not wish to make two unavoidable col mason thought the objections against fixing the time insuperable but that an annual meeting ought to be required as essential to the preservation of the constitution the extent of the country will supply business and if it should not the legislature besides legislative is to have inquisitorial powers which cannot safely be long kept in a state of suspension     mr sherman was decided for fixing the time as well as for frequent meetings of the legislative body disputes and difficulties will arise between the two houses  between both  the states if the time be changeable—frequent meetings of parliament were required at the revolution in england as an essential safeguard of liberty so also are annual meetings in most of the american charters  constitutions there will be business eno to require it the western country and the great extent and varying state of our affairs in general will supply objects mr randolph was agst fixing any day irrevocably but as there was no provision made any where in the constitution for regulating the periods of meeting and some precise time must be fixed untill the legislature shall make provision he could not agree to strike out the words altogether instead of which he moved to add the words following—unless a different day shall be appointed by law mr madison  ded the motion  on the question n h no mass ay ct no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr govr morris moved to strike out decr  insert may it might frequently happen that our measures ought to be influenced by those in europe which were generally planned during the winter and of which intelligence would arrive in the spring mr madison  ded the motion he preferred may to decr because the latter would require the travelling to  from the seat of govt in the most inconvenient seasons of the year     mr wilson the winter is the most convenient season for business mr elseworth the summer will interfere too much with private business that of almost all the probable members of the legislature being more or less connected with agriculture mr randolph the time is of no great moment now as the legislature can vary it on looking into the constitutions of the states he found that the times of their elections with which the election of the natl representatives would no doubt be made to coincide would suit better with decr than may and it was advisable to render our innovations as little incommodious as possible on the question for may instead of decr n h no mass no ct no pa no del no md no va no n c no s c ay geo ay mr read moved to insert after the word senate the words subject to the negative to be hereafter provided his object was to give an absolute negative to the executive—he considered this as so essential to the constitution to the preservation of liberty  to the public welfare that his duty compelled him to make the motion mr govr morris  ded him and on the question n h no mass no ct no pa no del ay md no va no n c no s c no geo no mr rutlidge altho it is agreed on all hands that an annual meeting of the legislature should be made necessary yet that point seems not to be free from doubt as the clause stands on this suggestion     once at least in every year were inserted nem con art iii with the foregoing alterations was agd to nem con and is as follows the legislative power shall be vested in a congress to consist of   separate  distinct bodies of men a house of reps  a senate the legislature shall meet at least once in every year and such meeting shall be on the  st monday in decr unless a different day shall be appointed by law article iv sect   taken up mr govr morris moved to strike out the last member of the section beginning with the words qualifications of electors in order that some other provision might be substituted which wd restrain the right of suffrage to freeholders mr fitzsimons  ded the motion mr williamson was opposed to it mr wilson this part of the report was well considered by the committee and he did not think it could be changed for the better it was difficult to form any uniform rule of qualifications for all the states unnecessary innovations he thought too should be avoided it would be very hard  disagreeable for the same persons at the same time to vote for representatives in the state legislature and to be excluded from a vote for those in the natl legislature mr govr morris such a hardship would be neither great nor novel the people are accustomed to it and not dissatisfied with it in several of the states     in some the qualifications are different for the choice of the govr  representatives in others for different houses of the legislature another objection agst the clause as it stands is that it makes the qualifications of the natl legislature depend on the will of the states which he thought not proper mr elseworth thought the qualifications of the electors stood on the most proper footing the right of suffrage was a tender point and strongly guarded by most of the state constitutions the people will not readily subscribe to the natl constitution if it should subject them to be disfranchised the states are the best judges of the circumstances  temper of their own people col mason the force of habit is certainly not attended to by those gentlemen who wish for innovations on this point eight or nine states have extended the right of suffrage beyond the freeholders what will the people there say if they should be disfranchised a power to alter the qualifications would be a dangerous power in the hands of the legislature mr butler there is no right of which the people are more jealous than that of suffrage abridgments of it tend to the same revolution as in holland where they have at length thrown all power into the hands of the senates who fill up vacancies themselves and form a rank aristocracy mr dickinson had a very different idea of the tendency of vesting the right of suffrage in the freeholders of the country he considered them as the     best guardians of liberty and the restriction of the right to them as a necessary defence agst the dangerous influence of those multitudes without property  without principle with which our country like all others will in time abound as to the unpopularity of the innovation it was in his opinion chimerical the great mass of our citizens is composed at this time of freeholders and will be pleased with it mr elseworth how shall the freehold be defined ought not every man who pays a tax to vote for the representative who is to levy  dispose of his money shall the wealthy merchants  manufacturers who will bear a full share of the public burthens be not allowed a voice in the imposition of them taxation  representation ought to go together mr govr morris he had long learned not to be the dupe of words the sound of aristocracy therefore had no effect on him it was the thing not the name to which he was opposed and one of his principal objections to the constitution as it is now before us is that it threatens this country with an aristocracy the aristocracy will grow out of the house of representatives give the votes to people who have no property and they will sell them to the rich who will be able to buy them we should not confine our attention to the present moment the time is not distant when this country will abound with mechanics  manufacturers who will receive their bread from their employers will such men be     the secure  faithful guardians of liberty will they be the impregnable barrier agst aristocracy—he was as little duped by the association of the words taxation  representation the man who does not give his vote freely is not represented it is the man who dictates the vote children do not vote why because they want prudence because they have no will of their own the ignorant  the dependent can be as little trusted with the public interest he did not conceive the difficulty of defining freeholders to be insuperable still less that the restriction could be unpopular   0 of the people are at present freeholders and these will certainly be pleased with it as to merchts c if they have wealth  value the right they can acquire it if not they dont deserve it col mason we all feel too strongly the remains of antient prejudices and view things too much through a british medium a freehold is the qualification in england  hence it is imagined to be the only proper one the true idea in his opinion was that every man having evidence of attachment to  permanent common interest with the society ought to share in all its rights  privileges was this qualification restrained to freeholders does no other kind of property but land evidence a common interest in the proprietor does nothing besides property mark a permanent attachment ought the merchant the monied man the parent of a number of children whose fortunes are to be pursued in his own country to be viewed as suspicious characters   0 and unworthy to be trusted with the common rights of their fellow citizens mr madison the right of suffrage is certainly one of the fundamental articles of republican government and ought not to be left to be regulated by the legislature a gradual abridgment of this right has been the mode in which aristocracies have been built on the ruins of popular forms whether the constitutional qualification ought to be a freehold would with him depend much on the probable reception such a change would meet with in states where the right was now exercised by every description of people in several of the states a freehold was now the qualification viewing the subject in its merits alone the freeholders of the country would be the safest depositories of republican liberty in future times a great majority of the people will not only be without landed but any other sort of property these will either combine under the influence of their common situation in which case the rights of property  the public liberty will not be secure in their hands or which is more probable they will become the tools of opulence  ambition in which case there will be equal danger on another side the example of england has been misconceived by col mason a very small proportion of the representatives are there chosen by freeholders the greatest part are chosen by the cities  boroughs in many of which the qualification of suffrage is as low as it is in any one of the u s and it was in the boroughs  cities rather than the     counties that bribery most prevailed  the influence of the crown on elections was most dangerously exerted  docr franklin it is of great consequence that we shd not depress the virtue  public spirit of our     common people of which they displayed a great deal during the war and which contributed principally to the favorable issue of it he related the honorable     refusal of the american seamen who were carried in great numbers into the british prisons during the war to redeem themselves from misery or to seek their fortunes by entering on board the ships of the     enemies to their country contrasting their patriotism with a contemporary instance in which the british seamen made prisoners by the americans readily entered on the ships of the latter on being     promised a share of the prizes that might be made out of their own country this proceeded he said from the different manner in which the common people were treated in america  g britain he     did not think that the elected had any right in any case to narrow the privileges of the electors he quoted as arbitrary the british statute setting forth the danger of tumultuous meetings and under that pretext narrowing the right of suffrage to persons having freeholds of a certain value observing that this statute was soon followed by another under the succeeding parliamt subjecting the people who had no votes to peculiar labors  hardships he was persuaded also that such a restriction as was proposed would give great uneasiness in the populous states the sons of a substantial farmer not being themselves freeholders would not be pleased at being disfranchised and there are a great many persons of that description     mr mercer the constitution is objectionable in many points but in none more than the present he objected to the footing on which the qualification was put but particularly to the mode of election by the people the people can not know  judge of the characters of candidates the worse possible choice will be made he quoted the case of the senate in virga as an example in point the people in towns can unite their votes in favor of one favorite  by that means always prevail over the people of the country who being dispersed will scatter their votes among a variety of candidates mr rutlidge thought the idea of restraining the right of suffrage to the freeholders a very unadvised one it would create division among the people

mr ghorum he had never seen any inconveniency from allowing such as were not freeholders to vote though it had long been tried the elections in phila n york  boston where the merchants  mechanics vote are at least as good as those made by freeholders only the case in england was not accurately stated yesterday by mr madison the cities  large towns are not the seat of crown influence  corruption these prevail in the boroughs and not on account of the right which those who are not freeholders have to vote but of the smallness of the number who vote the people have been long accustomed to this right in various parts of america and will never allow it to be abridged we must consult their rooted prejudices if we expect their concurrence in our propositions mr mercer did not object so much to an election     by the people at large including such as were not freeholders as to their being left to make their choice without any guidance he hinted that candidates ought to be nominated by the state legislatures on the question for agreeing to art iv—sect   it passd nem con art iv sect   taken up col mason was for opening a wide door for emigrants but did not chuse to let foreigners and adventurers make laws for us  govern us citizenship for three years was not enough for ensuring that local knowledge which ought to be possessed by the representative this was the principal ground of his objection to so short a term it might also happen that a rich foreign nation for example great britain might send over her tools who might bribe their way into the legislature for insidious purposes he moved that seven years instead of three be inserted mr govr morris  ded the motion  on the question all the states agreed to it except connecticut mr sherman moved to strike out the word resident and insert inhabitant as less liable to misconstruction mr madison  ded the motion both were vague but the latter least so in common acceptation and would not exclude persons absent occasionally for a considerable time on public or private business great disputes had been raised in virga concerning the meaning of residence as a qualification of representatives which were determined more according to   0 the affection or dislike to the man in question than to any fixt interpretation of the word mr wilson preferred inhabitant mr govr morris was opposed to both and for requiring nothing more than a freehold he quoted great disputes in n york occasioned by these terms which were decided by the arbitrary will of the majority such a regulation is not necessary people rarely chuse a nonresident—it is improper as in the  st branch the people at large not the states are represented mr rutlidge urged  moved that a residence of   years shd be required in the state wherein the member shd be elected an emigrant from n england to s c or georgia would know little of its affairs and could not be supposed to acquire a thorough knowledge in less time mr read reminded him that we were now forming a natl govt and such a regulation would correspond little with the idea that we were one people mr wilson enforced the same consideration mr madison suggested the case of new states in the west which could have perhaps no representation on that plan mr mercer such a regulation would present a greater alienship among the states than existed under the old federal system it would interweave local prejudices  state distinctions in the very constitution which is meant to cure them he mentioned instances of violent disputes raised in maryland concerning the term residence     mr elseworth thought seven years of residence was by far too long a term but that some fixt term of previous residence would be proper he thought one year would be sufficient but seemed to have no objection to three years mr dickinson proposed that it should read inhabitant actually resident for — years this would render the meaning less indeterminate mr wilson if a short term should be inserted in the blank so strict an expression might be construed to exclude the members of the legislature who could not be said to be actual residents in their states whilst at the seat of the genl government mr mercer it would certainly exclude men who had once been inhabitants and returning from residence elsewhere to resettle in their original state although a want of the necessary knowledge could not in such cases be presumed mr mason thought   years too long but would never agree to part with the principle it is a valuable principle he thought it a defect in the plan that the representatives would be too few to bring with them all the local knowledge necessary if residence be not required rich men of neighbouring states may employ with success the means of corruption in some particular district and thereby get into the public councils after having failed in their own state this is the practice in the boroughs of england on the question for postponing in order to

of the report concerning the admission of slaves into the rule of representation he could not reconcile his mind to the article if it was to prevent objections to the latter part the admission of slaves was a most grating circumstance to his mind  he believed would be so to a great part of the people of america he had not made a strenuous opposition to it heretofore because he had hoped that this concession would have produced a readiness which had not been manifested to strengthen the genl govt and to mark a full confidence in it the report under consideration had by the tenor of it put an end to all those hopes in two great points the hands of the legislature were absolutely tied the importation of slaves could not be prohibited—exports could not be taxed is this reasonable what are the great objects of the genl system   defence agst foreign invasion   agst internal sedition     shall all the states then be bound to defend each  shall each be at liberty to introduce a weakness which will render defence more difficult shall one part of the u s be bound to defend another part and that other part be at liberty not only to increase its own danger but to withhold the compensation for the burden if slaves are to be imported shall not the exports produced by their labor supply a revenue the better to enable the genl govt to defend their masters there was so much inequality  unreasonableness in all this that the people of the northern states could never be reconciled to it no candid man could undertake to justify it to them he had hoped that some accommodation wd have taken place on this subject that at least a time wd have been limited for the importation of slaves he never could agree to let them be imported without limitation  then be represented in the natl legislature indeed he could so little persuade himself of the rectitude of such a practice that he was not sure he could assent to it under any circumstances at all events either slaves should not be represented or exports should be taxable mr sherman regarded the slave trade as iniquitous but the point of representation having been settled after much difficulty  deliberation he did not think himself bound to make opposition especially as the present article as amended did not preclude any arrangement whatever on that point in another place of the report mr madison objected to   for every  0000 inhabitants     as a perpetual rule the future increase of population if the union shd be permanent will render the number of representatives excessive mr ghorum it is not to be supposed that the govt will last so long as to produce this effect can it be supposed that this vast country including the western territory will   0 years hence remain one nation mr elseworth if the govt should continue so long alterations may be made in the constitution in the manner proposed in a subsequent article mr sherman  mr madison moved to insert the words not exceeding before the words   for every  0000 which was agreed to nem con mr govr morris moved to insert free before the word inhabitants much he said would depend on this point he never would concur in upholding domestic slavery it was a nefarious institution it was the curse of heaven on the states where it prevailed compare the free regions of the middle states where a rich  noble cultivation marks the prosperity  happiness of the people with the misery  poverty which overspread the barren wastes of va mayrd  the other states having slaves travel thro ye whole continent  you behold the prospect continually varying with the appearance  disappearance of slavery the moment you leave ye e states  enter n york the effects of the institution become visible passing thro the jerseys  entering pa every criterion of superior improvement witnesses the change proceed southwdly  every     step you take thro ye great regions of slaves presents a desert increasing with ye increasing word is illegible proportion of these wretched beings upon what principle is it that the slaves shall be computed in the representation are they men then make them citizens and let them vote are they property why then is no other property included the houses in this city philada are worth more than all the wretched slaves which cover the rice swamps of south carolina the admission of slaves into the representation when fairly explained comes to this that the inhabitant of georgia and s c who goes to the coast of africa and in defiance of the most sacred laws of humanity tears away his fellow creatures from their dearest connections  damns them to the most cruel bondages shall have more votes in a govt instituted for protection of the rights of mankind than the citizen of pa or n jersey who views with a laudable horror so nefarious a practice he would add that domestic slavery is the most prominent feature in the aristocratic countenance of the proposed constitution the vassalage of the poor has ever been the favorite offspring of aristocracy and what is the proposed compensation to the northern states for a sacrifice of every principle of right of every impulse of humanity they are to bind themselves to march their militia for the defence of the s states for their defence agst those very slaves of whom they complain they must supply vessels  seamen in case of foreign attack the legislature will have indefinite power to tax     them by excises and duties on imports both of which will fall heavier on them than on the southern inhabitants for the bohae tea used by a northern freeman will pay more tax than the whole consumption of the miserable slave which consists of nothing more than his physical subsistence and the rag that covers his nakedness on the other side the southern states are not to be restrained from importing fresh supplies of wretched africans at once to increase the danger of attack and the difficulty of defence nay they are to be encouraged to it by an assurance of having their votes in the natl govt increased in proportion and are at the same time to have their exports  their slaves exempt from all contributions for the public service let it not be said that direct taxation is to be proportioned to representation it is idle to suppose that the genl govt can stretch its hand directly into the pockets of the people scattered over so vast a country they can only do it through the medium of exports imports  excises for what then are all the sacrifices to be made he would sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for all the negroes in the u states than saddle posterity with such a constitution mr dayton  ded the motion he did it he said that his sentiments on the subject might appear whatever might be the fate of the amendment mr sherman did not regard the admission of the negroes into the ratio of representation as liable to such insuperable objections it was the freemen of the southn states who were in fact to be represented     according to the taxes paid by them and the negroes are only included in the estimate of the taxes this was his idea of the matter mr pinkney considered the fisheries  the western frontier as more burthensome to the u s

the senate to originate but only to amend mr govr morris it is particularly proper that the senate shd have the right of originating money bills     they will sit constantly will consist of a smaller number and will be able to prepare such bills with due correctness and so as to prevent delay of business in the other house col mason was unwilling to travel over this ground again to strike out the section was to unhinge the compromise of which it made a part the duration of the senate made it improper he does not object to that duration on the contrary he approved of it but joined with the smallness of the number it was an argument against adding this to the other great powers vested in that body his idea of an aristocracy was that it was the governt of the few over the many an aristocratic body like the screw in mechanics workg its way by slow degrees and holding fast whatever it gains should ever be suspected of an encroaching tendency the purse strings should never be put into its hands mr mercer considered the exclusive power of originating money bills as so great an advantage that it rendered the equality of votes in the senate ideal  of no consequence mr butler was for adhering to the principle which had been settled mr wilson was opposed to it on its merits without regard to the compromise mr elseworth did not think the clause of any consequence but as it was thought of consequence by some members from the larger states he was willing it should stand mr madison was for striking it out considering it   0 as of no advantage to the large states as fettering

wilson objected to vacancies in the senate being supplied by the executives of the states it was unnecessary as the legislatures will meet so frequently it removes the appointment too far from the people the executives in most of the states being elected by the legislatures as he had always thought the appointment of the executives by the     legislative department wrong so it was still more so that the executive should elect into the legislative department mr randolph thought it necessary in order to prevent inconvenient chasms in the senate in some states the legislatures meet but once a year as the senate will have more power  consist of a smaller number than the other house vacancies there will be of more consequence the executives might be safely trusted he thought with the appointment for so short a time mr elseworth it is only said that the executive may supply vacancies when the legislative meeting happens to be near the power will not be exerted as there will be but

appointing a man a senator agst his consent to deprive the u s of his services the motion of mr madison was agreed to nem con mr randolph called for division of the section so as to leave a distinct question on the last words each member shall have one vote he wished this last sentence to be postponed until the reconsideration should have taken place on sect   art iv concerning money bills if that section should not be reinstated his plan would be to vary the representation in the senate mr strong concurred in mr randolphs ideas on this point mr read did not consider the section as to money bills of any advantage to the larger states and had     voted for striking it out as being viewed in the same light by the larger states if it was considered by them as of any value and as a condition of the equality of votes in the senate he had no objection to its being reinstated mr wilson—mr elseworth  mr madison urged that it was of no advantage to the larger states and that it might be a dangerous source of contention between the two houses all the principal powers of the natl legislature had some relation to money docr franklin considered the two clauses the originating of money bills and the equality of votes in the senate as essentially connected by the compromise which had been agreed to col mason said this was not the time for discussing this point when the originating of money bills shall be reconsidered he thought it could be demonstrated that it was of essential importance to restrain the right to the house of representatives the immediate choice of the people mr williamson the state of n c had agreed to an equality in the senate merely in consideration that money bills should be confined to the other house and he was surprised to see the smaller states forsaking the condition on which they had received their equality question on the section   down to the last sentence n h ay mass no ct ay n j ay pa  no     del ay md ay virga ay n c no s c divd geo ay mr randolph moved that the last sentence each member shall have one vote be postponed it was observed that this could not be necessary as in case the sanction as to originating money bills should not be reinstated and a revision of the constitution should ensue it wd still be proper that the members should vote per capita a postponement of the preceding sentence allowing to each state   members wd have been more proper mr mason did not mean to propose a change of this mode of voting per capita in any event but as there might be other modes proposed he saw no impropriety in postponing the sentence each state may have two members and yet may have unequal votes he said that unless the exclusive originating of money bills should be restored to the house of representatives he should not from obstinacy but duty and conscience oppose throughout the equality of representation in the senate mr govr morris such declarations were he supposed addressed to the smaller states in order to alarm them for their equality in the senate and induce them agst their judgments to concur in restoring the section concerning money bills he would declare in his turn that as he saw no prospect of amending the constitution of the senate  considered the section relating to money bills as intrinsically bad he would adhere to the section establishing the equality at all events     mr wilson it seems to have been supposed by some that the section concerning money bills is desirable to the large states the fact was that two of those states pa  va had uniformly voted agst it without reference to any other part of the system mr randolph urged as col mason had done that the sentence under consideration was connected with that relating to money bills and might possibly be affected by the result of the motion for reconsidering the latter that the postponement was therefore not improper question for postponing each member shall have one vote n h divd mass no ct no n j no pa no del no md

admitting strangers into our public councils mr pinkney  d him     mr elseworth was opposed to the motion as discouraging meritorious aliens from emigrating to this country mr pinkney as the senate is to have the power of making treaties  managing our foreign affairs there is peculiar danger and impropriety in opening its door to those who have foreign attachments he quoted the jealousy of the athenians on this subject who made it death for any stranger to intrude his voice into their legislative proceedings col mason highly approved of the policy of the motion were it not that many not natives of this country had acquired great merit during the revolution he should be for restraining the eligibility into the senate to natives mr madison was not averse to some restrictions on this subject but could never agree to the proposed amendment he thought any restriction however in the constitution unnecessary and improper unnecessary because the natl legislre is to have the right of regulating naturalization and can by virtue thereof fix different periods of residence or conditions of enjoying different privileges of citizenship improper because it will give a tincture of illiberality to the constitution because it will put it out of the power of the natl legislature even by special acts of naturalization to confer the full rank of citizens on meritorious strangers  because it will discourage the most desirable class of people from emigrating to the u s should the proposed constitution have the intended effect of giving stability  reputation to     our govts great numbers of respectable europeans men who love liberty and wish to partake its blessings will be ready to transfer their fortunes hither all such would feel the mortification of being marked with suspicious incapacitations though they sd not covet the public honors he was not apprehensive that any dangerous number of strangers would be appointed by the state legislatures if they were left at liberty to do so nor that foreign powers would make use of strangers as instruments for their purposes their bribes would be expended on men whose circumstances would rather stifle than excite jealousy  watchfulness in the public mr butler was decidedly opposed to the admission of foreigners without a long residence in the country they bring with them not only attachments to other countries but ideas of govt so distinct from ours that in every point of view they are dangerous he acknowledged that if he himself had been called into public life within a short time after his coming to america his foreign habits opinions  attachments would have rendered him an improper agent in public affairs he mentioned the great strictness observed in great britain on this subject docr franklin was not against a reasonable time but should be very sorry to see any thing like illiberality inserted in the constitution the people in europe are friendly to this country even in the country with which we have been lately at war we have now  had during the war a great many friends not only among the people at large but in     both houses of parliament in every other country in europe all the people are our friends we found in the course of the revolution that many strangers served us faithfully and that many natives took part agst their country when foreigners after looking about for some other country in which they can obtain more happiness give a preference to ours it is a proof of attachment which ought to excite our confidence  affection mr randolph did not know but it might be problematical whether emigrations to this country were on the whole useful or not but he could never agree to the motion for disabling them for    years to participate in the public honours he reminded the convention of the language held by our patriots during the revolution and the principles laid down in all our american constitutions many foreigners may have fixed their fortunes among us under the faith of these invitations all persons under this description with all others who would be affected by such a regulation would enlist themselves under the banners of hostility to the proposed system he would go as far as seven years but no further mr wilson said he rose with feelings which were perhaps peculiar mentioning the circumstance of his not being a native and the possibility if the ideas of some gentlemen should be pursued of his being incapacitated from holding a place under the very constitution which he had shared in the trust of making he remarked the illiberal complexion which the motion would give to the system  the     effect which a good system would have in inviting meritorious foreigners among us and the discouragement  mortification they must feel from the degrading discrimination now proposed he had himself experienced this mortification on his removal into maryland he found himself from defect of residence under certain legal incapacities which never ceased to produce chagrin though he assuredly did not desire  would not have accepted the offices to which they related to be appointed to a place may be matter of indifference to be incapable of being appointed in a circumstance grating and mortifying mr govr morris the lesson we are taught is that we should be governed as much by our reason and as little by our feelings as possible what is the language of reason on this subject that we should not be polite at the expence of prudence there was a moderation in all things it is said that some tribes of indians carried their hospitality so far as to offer to strangers their wives  daughters was this a proper model for us he would admit them to his house he would invite them to his table would provide for them comfortable lodgings but would not carry the complaisance so far as to bed them with his wife he would let them worship at the same altar but did not choose to make priests of them he ran over the privileges which emigrants would enjoy among us though they should be deprived of that of being eligible to the great offices of government observing that they exceeded the   0 privileges allowed to foreigners in any part of the world and that as every society from a great nation down to a club had the right of declaring the conditions on which new members should be admitted there could be no room for complaint as to those philosophical gentlemen those citizens of the world as they called themselves he owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public councils he would not trust them the men who can shake off their attachments to their own country can never love any other these attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all governments admit a frenchman into your senate and he will study to increase the commerce of france an englishman he will feel an equal bias in favor of that of england it has been said that the legislatures will not chuse foreigners at least improper ones there was no knowing what legislatures would do some appointments made by them proved that every thing ought to be apprehended from the cabals practised on such occasions he

in the choice of the senate which is to be made by the legislatures composed of a few men than of the house of represents who will be chosen by the people mr randolph will agree to   years with the

provisions concerning c the first part was agreed to nem con mr pinkney  mr rutlidge moved to strike out the remaining part viz but their provisions concerning them may at any time be altered by the legislature of the united states the states they contended could  must be relied on in such cases mr ghorum it would be as improper take this power from the natl legislature as to restrain the british parliament from regulating the circumstances of elections leaving this business to the counties themselves— mr madison the necessity of a genl govt supposes     that the state legislatures will sometimes fail or refuse to consult the common interest at the expence of their local conveniency or prejudices the policy of referring the appointment of the house of representatives to the people and not to the legislatures of the states supposes that the result will be somewhat influenced by the mode this view of the question seems to decide that the legislatures of the states ought not to have the uncontrouled right of regulating the times places  manner of holding elections these were words of great latitude it was impossible to foresee all the abuses that might be made of the discretionary power whether the electors should vote by ballot or viva voce should assemble at this place or that place should be divided into districts or all meet at one place shd all vote for all the representatives or all in a district vote for a number allotted to the district these  many other points would depend on the legislatures and might materially affect the appointments whenever the state legislatures had a favorite measure to carry they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed besides the inequality of the representation in the legislatures of particular states would produce a like inequality in their representation in the natl legislature as it was presumable that the counties having the power in the former     case would secure it to themselves in the latter what danger could there be in giving a controuling power to the natl legislature of whom was it to consist   of a senate to be chosen by the state legislatures if the latter therefore could be trusted their representatives could not be dangerous   of representatives elected by the same people who elect the state legislatures surely then if confidence is due to the latter it must be due to the former it seemed as improper in principle though it might be less inconvenient in practice to give to the state legislatures this great authority over the election of the representatives of the people in the genl legislature as it would be to give to the latter a like power over the election of their representatives in the state legislatures mr king if this power be not given to the natl legislature their right of judging of the returns of their members may be frustrated no probability has been suggested of its being abused by them altho this scheme of erecting the genl govt on the authority of the state legislatures has been fatal to the federal establishment it would seem as if many gentlemen still foster the dangerous idea mr govr morris observed that the states might make false returns and then make no provisions for new elections mr sherman did not know but it might be best to retain the clause though he had himself sufficient confidence in the state legislatures the motion of mr p  mr r did not prevail     the word respectively was inserted after the word state on the motion of mr read the word their was struck

qualifications of property for the members of the natl legislature instead of which they have referred the task to the natl legislature itself should it be left on this footing the first legislature will meet without any particular qualifications of property and if it should happen to consist of rich men they might fix such qualifications as may be too favorable to the rich if of poor men an opposite extreme might be run into he was opposed to the establishment of an undue aristocratic influence in the constitution     but he thought it essential that the members of the legislature the executive and the judges should be possessed of competent property to make them independent  respectable it was prudent when such great powers were to be trusted to connect the tie of property with that of reputation in securing a faithful administration the legislature would have the fate of the nation put into their hands the president would also have a very great influence on it the judges would have not only important causes between citizen  citizen but also where foreigners are concerned they will even be the umpires between the u states and individual states as well as between one state  another were he to fix the quantum of property which should be required he should not think of less than one hundred thousand dollars for the president half of that sum for each of the judges and in like proportion for the members of the natl legislature he would however leave the sums blank his motion was that the president of the u s the judges and members of the legislature should be required to swear that they were respectively possessed of a cleared unincumbered estate to the amount of — in the case of the president c c mr rutlidge seconded the motion observing that the committee had reported no qualifications because they could not agree on any among themselves being embarrassed by the danger on one side of displeasing the people by making them high and on the other of rendering them nugatory by making them low     mr elseworth the different circumstances of different parts of the u s and the probable difference between the present and future circumstances of the whole render it improper to have either uniform or fixed qualifications make them so high as to be useful in the s states and they will be inapplicable to the e states suit them to the latter and they will serve no purpose in the former in like manner what may be accommodated to the existing state of things among us may be very inconvenient in some future state of them he thought for these reasons that it was better to leave this matter to the legislative discretion than to attempt a provision for it in the constitution doctr franklin expressed his dislike of every thing that tended to debase the spirit of the common people if honesty was often the companion of wealth and if poverty was exposed to peculiar temptation it was not less true that the possession of property increased the desire of more property some of the greatest rogues he was ever acquainted with were the richest rogues we should remember the character which the scripture requires in rulers that they should be men hating covetousness this constitution will be much read and attended to in europe and if it should betray a great partiality to the rich will not only hurt us in the esteem of the most liberal and enlightened men there but discourage the common people from removing to this country the motion of mr pinkney was rejected by so general a no that the states were not called     mr madison was opposed to the section as vesting an improper  dangerous power in the legislature the qualifications of electors and elected were fundamental articles in a republican govt and ought to be fixed by the constitution if the legislature could regulate those of either it can by degrees subvert the constitution a republic may be converted into an aristocracy or oligarchy as well by limiting the number capable of being elected as the number authorized to elect in all cases where the representatives of the people will have a personal interest distinct from that of their constituents there was the same reason for being jealous of them as there was for relying on them with full confidence when they had a common interest this was one of the former cases it was as improper as to allow them to fix their own wages or their own privileges it was a power also which might be made subservient to the views of one faction agst another qualifications founded on artificial distinctions may be devised by the stronger in order to keep out partizans of a weaker faction mr elseworth admitted that the power was not unexceptionable but he could not view it as dangerous such a power with regard to the electors would be dangerous because it would be much more liable to abuse mr govr morris moved to strike out with regard to property in order to leave the legislature entirely at large mr williamson this would surely never be admitted     should a majority of the legislature be composed of any particular description of men of lawyers for example which is no improbable supposition the future elections might be secured to their own body mr madison observed that the british parliamt possessed the power of regulating the qualifications both of the electors and the elected and the abuse they had made of it was a lesson worthy of our attention they had made the changes in both cases subservient to their own views or to the views of political or religious parties question on the motion to strike out with regard to property n h no mass no ct ay n j ay pa ay del  no md no va no n c no s c no geo ay mr rutlidge was opposed to leaving the power to the legislature—he proposed that the

taken up mr ghorum contended that less than a majority in each house should be made a quorum otherwise great delay might happen in business and great inconvenience from the future increase of numbers mr mercer was also for less than a majority so great a number will put it in the power of a few by seceding at a critical moment to introduce convulsions and endanger the governmt examples of secession have already happened in some of the states he was for leaving it to the legislature to fix the quorum as in great britain where the requisite number is small  no inconveniency has been experienced col mason this is a valuable  necessary part of the plan in this extended country embracing so great a diversity of interests it would be dangerous to the distant parts to allow a small number of members of the two houses to make laws the central states could always take care to be on the spot and by meeting earlier than the distant ones or wearying their patience and outstaying them     could carry such measures as they pleased he admitted that inconveniences might spring from the secession of a small number but he had also known good produced by an apprehension of it he had known a paper emission prevented by that cause in virginia he thought the constitution as now moulded was founded on sound principles and was disposed to put into it extensive powers at the same time he wished to guard agst abuses as much as possible if the legislature should be able to reduce the number at all it might reduce it as low as it pleased  the u states might be governed by a juncto—a majority of the number which had been agreed on was so few that he feared it would be made an objection agst the plan mr king admitted there might be some danger of giving an advantage to the central states but he was of opinion that the public inconveniency on the other side was more to be dreaded mr govr morris moved to fix the quorum at    members in the h of reps     in the senate this is a majority of the present number and will be a bar to the legislature fix the number low and they will generally attend knowing that advantage may be taken of their absence the secession of a small number ought not to be suffered to break a quorum such events in the states may have been of little consequence in the national councils they may be fatal besides other mischiefs if a few can break up a quorum they may seize a moment when a particular part of the continent may be in need of immediate     aid to extort by threatening a secession some unjust  selfish measure mr mercer  ded the motion mr king said he had just prepared a motion which instead of fixing the numbers proposed by mr govr morris as quorums made those the lowest numbers leaving the legislature at liberty to increase them or not he thought the future increase of members would render a majority of the whole extremely cumbersome mr mercer agreed to substitute mr kings motion in place of mr morriss mr elseworth was opposed to it it would be a pleasing ground of confidence to the people that no law or burden could be imposed on them by a few men he reminded the movers that the constitution proposed to give such a discretion with regard to the number of representatives that a very inconvenient number was not to be apprehended the inconveniency of secessions may be guarded agst by giving to each house an authority to require the attendance of absent members mr wilson concurred in the sentiments of mr elseworth mr gerry seemed to think that some further precautions than merely fixing the quorum might be necessary he observed that as    wd be a majority of a quorum of    and   of    questions might by possibility be carried in the h of reps by   large states and in the senate by the same states with the aid of two small ones—he proposed that the number     for a quorum in the h of reps should not exceed  0 nor be less than    leaving the intermediate discretion to the legislature mr king as the quorum could not be altered witht the concurrence of the president by less than ⅔ of each house he thought there could be no danger in trusting the legislature mr carrol this would be no security agst a continuance of the quorums at        when they ought to be increased on question on mr kings motion that not less than    in the h of reps nor less than    in the senate shd constitute a quroum which may be increased by a law on additions of the members in either house n h no mass ay ct no n j no pa no del ay md no va no n c no s c no geo no mr randolph  mr madison moved to add to the end of

emergencies of faction might be dangerously abused he moved     that with the concurrence of ⅔ might be inserted between may  expel mr randolph  mr mason approved the idea mr govr morris this power may be safely trusted to a majority to require more may produce abuses on the side of the minority a few men from factious motives may keep in a member who ought to be expelled mr carrol thought that

they never have done any good and have done much mischief they are not proper as the reasons governing the voter never appear along with them mr elseworth was of the same opinion     col mason liked the section as it stood it was a middle way between two extremes mr ghorum was opposed to the motion for allowing a single member to call the yeas  nays and recited the abuses of it in massts   in stuffing the journals with them on frivolous occasions   in misleading the people who never know the reasons determing the votes the motion for allowing a single member to call the yeas  nays was disagd to nem con mr carrol  mr randolph moved to strike out the words each house and to insert the words the house of representatives in sect   art   and to add to the section the words and any member of the senate shall be at liberty to enter his dissent mr govr morris  mr wilson observed that if the minority were to have a right to enter their votes  reasons the other side would have a right to complain if it were not extended to them  to allow it to both would fill the journals like the records of a court with replications rejoinders c question on mr carrols motion to allow a

striking out the words when acting in its legislative capacity n h divd mass ay ct no n j no pa no del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay adjourned saturday augst    in convention mr madison  mr rutlidge moved that each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings  shall publish the same from time to time except such part of the proceedings of the senate when acting not in its legislative capacity as may be judged by that house to require secrecy mr mercer this implies that other powers than legislative will be given to the senate which he hoped would not be given mr madison  mr rs motion was disagd to by all the states except virga mr gerry  mr sharman moved to insert after the words publish them the following except such as relate to treaties  military operations their object was to give each house a discretion in such cases—on this question     n h no mass ay ct ay n j no pa no del no va no n c no s c no geo no mr elseworth as the clause is objectionable in so many shapes it may as well be struck out altogether the legislature will not fail to publish their proceedings from time to time the people will call for it if it should be improperly omitted mr wilson thought the expunging of the clause would be very improper the people have a right to know what their agents are doing or have done and it should not be in the option of the legislature to conceal their proceedings besides as this is a clause in the existing confederation the not retaining it would furnish the adversaries of the reform with a pretext by which weak  suspicious minds may be easily misled mr mason thought it would give a just alarm to the people to make a conclave of their legislature mr sherman thought the legislature might be trusted in this case if in any question on  st part of the section down to publish them inclusive agreed to nem con question on the words to follow to wit except such parts thereof as may in their judgment require secrecy n h divd mass ay ct ay n j ay

new place he thought this inconvenient the mutability of place had dishonored the federal govt and would require as strong a cure as we could devise he thought a law at least should be made necessary to a removal of the seat of govt mr madison viewed the subject in the same light and joined with mr king in a motion requiring a law mr governr morris proposed the additional alteration by inserting the words during the session c mr spaight this will fix the seat of govt at n y the present congress will convene them there in the first instance and they will never be able to remove especially if the presidt should be a northern man mr govr morris such a distrust is inconsistent with all govt mr madison supposed that a central place for the seat of govt was so just and wd be so much insisted on by the h of representatives that though a law should be made requisite for the purpose it could  would be obtained the necessity of a central residence of the govt wd be much greater under the new than old govt the members of the new govt wd be more numerous they would be taken more from the interior parts of the states they wd not like members of ye present congs come so often from the distant states by water as the powers  objects of the new govt would be far greater yn heretofore more private individuals wd have business calling them to the seat of it and it was more necessary     that the govt should be in that position from which it could contemplate with the most equal eye and sympathize most equally with every part of the nation these considerations he supposed would extort a removal even if a law were made necessary but in order to quiet suspicions both within  without doors it might not be amiss to authorize the   houses by a concurrent vote to adjourn at their first meeting to the most proper place and to require thereafter the sanction of a law to their removal the motion was accordingly moulded into the following form the legislature shall at their first assembling determine on a place at which their future sessions shall be held neither house shall afterwards during the session of the house of reps without the consent of the other adjourn for more than three days nor shall they adjourn to any other place than such as shall have been fixt by law mr gerry thought it would be wrong to let the presidt check the will of the   houses on this subject at all mr williamson supported the ideas of mr spaight mr carrol was actuated by the same apprehensions mr mercer it will serve no purpose to require the two houses at their first meeting to fix on a place they will never agree after some further expressions from others denoting an apprehension that the seat of govt might be continued at an improper place if a law should be made necessary to a removal and the motion above   0 stated with another for recommitting the section had been negatived the section was left in the shape it which it was reported as to this point the words during the session of the legislature were prefixed to the  th section—and the last sentence but this regulation shall not extend to the senate when it shall exercise the powers mentioned in the — article struck out the  th section as amended was then agreed to mr randolph moved according to notice to reconsider art iv sect   concerning money bills which had been struck out he argued   that he had not wished for this privilege whilst a proportional representation in the senate was in contemplation but since an equality had been fixed in that house the large states would require this compensation at least   that it would make the plan more acceptable to the people because they will consider the senate as the more aristocratic body and will expect that the usual guards agst its influence be provided according to the example in g britain   the privilege will give some advantage to the house of reps if it extends to the originating only—but still more if it restrains the senate from amendg   he called on the smaller states to concur in the measure as the condition by which alone the compromise had entitled them to an equality in the senate he signified that he should propose instead of the original section a clause specifying that the bills in question should be for the purpose of revenue in order to repel ye objection agst the extent of the words raising     money which might happen incidentally and that the senate should not so amend or alter as to increase or diminish the sum in order to obviate the inconveniences urged agst a restriction of the senate to a simple affirmation or negative mr williamson  ded the motion mr pinkney was sorry to oppose the opportunity gentlemen asked to have the question again opened for discussion but as he considered it a mere waste of time he could not bring himself to consent to it he said that notwithstanding what had been said as to the compromise he always considered this section as making no part of it the rule of representation in the  st branch was the true condition of that in the  d branch—several others spoke for  agst the reconsideration but without going into the merits—on the question to reconsider n h ay mass ay ct ay n j  ay pa ay del ay md no va ay n c ay s c divd geo ay—monday was then assigned— adjd      monday augst    in convention art iv sect   reconsidered— mr wilson  mr randolph moved to strike out   years and insert   years as the requisite term of citizenship to qualify for the house of reps mr wilson said it was very proper the electors should govern themselves by this consideration but unnecessary  improper that the constitution should chain them down to it mr gerry wished that in future the eligibility might be confined to natives foreign powers will intermeddle in our affairs and spare no expence to influence them persons having foreign attachments     will be sent among us  insinuated into our councils in order to be made instruments for their purposes every one knows the vast sums laid out in europe for secret services he was not singular in these ideas a great many of the most influential men in massts reasoned in the same manner mr williamson moved to insert   years instead of seven he wished this country to acquire as fast as possible national habits wealthy emigrants do more harm by their luxurious examples than good by the money they bring with them col hamilton was in general agst embarrassing the govt with minute restrictions there was on one     side the possible danger that had been suggested on the other side the advantage of encouraging foreigners was obvious  admitted persons in europe of moderate fortunes will be fond of coming here where they will be on a level with the first citizens he moved that the section be so altered as to require merely citizenship  inhabitancy the right of determining the rule of naturalization will then leave a discretion to the legislature on this subject which will answer every purpose mr madison seconded the motion he wished to maintain the character of liberality which had been professed in all the constitutions  publications of america he wished to invite foreigners of merit  republican principles among us america was indebted to emigration for her settlement  prosperity that part of america which had encouraged them most had advanced most rapidly in population agriculture  the arts there was a possible danger he admitted that men with foreign predilections might obtain appointments but it was by no means probable that it would happen in any dangerous degree for the same reason that they would be attached to their native country our own people wd prefer natives of this country to them experience proved this to be the case instances were rare of a foreigner being elected by the people within any short space after his coming among us if bribery was to be practised by foreign powers it would not be attempted among the electors but among the elected and among natives having full confidence     of the people not among strangers who would be regarded with a jealous eye mr wilson cited pennsylva as a proof of the advantage of encouraging emigrations it was perhaps the youngest except georgia settlemt on the atlantic yet it was at least among the foremost in population  prosperity he remarked that almost all the genl officers of the pena line of the late army were foreigners and no complaint had ever been made against their fidelity or merit three of her deputies to the convention mr r morris mr fitzsimons  himself were also not natives he had no objection to col

a proviso that the limitation of seven years should not affect the rights of any person now a citizen mr mercer  ded the motion it was necessary he said to prevent a disfranchisement of persons who had become citizens under and on the faith  according to the laws  constitution from being on a level in all respects with natives mr rutlidge it might as well be said that all qualifications are disfranchisemts and that to require the age of    years was a disfranchisement the policy of the precaution was as great with regard to foreigners now citizens as to those who are to be naturalized in future mr sherman the u states have not invited foreigners nor pledged their faith that they should enjoy equal privileges with native citizens the individual states alone have done this the former therefore are at liberty to make any discriminations they may judge requisite mr ghorum when foreigners are naturalized it wd seem as if they stand on an equal footing with natives he doubted then the propriety of giving a retrospective force to the restriction mr madison animadverted on the peculiarity of the doctrine of mr sharman it was a subtilty by which every national engagement might be evaded by parity of reason whenever our public debts or foreign treaties become inconvenient nothing more would be necessary to relieve us from them than to new model the constitution it was said that the     u s as such have not pledged their faith to the naturalized foreigners  therefore are not bound be it so  that the states alone are bound who are to form the new constitution by which the condition of that class of citizens is to be made worse than the other class are not the states ye agents will they not be the members of it did they not appoint this convention are not they to ratify its proceedings will not the new constitution be their act if the new constitution then violates the faith pledged to any description of people will not the makers of it will not the states be the violaters to justify the doctrine it must be said that the states can get rid of their obligation by revising the constitution though they could not do it by repealing the law under which foreigners held their privileges he considered this a matter of real importance it would expose us to the reproaches of all those who should be affected by it reproaches which wd soon be echoed from the other side of the atlantic and would unnecessarily enlist among the adversaries of the reform a very considerable body of citizens we should moreover reduce every state to the dilemma of rejecting it or of violating the faith pledged to a part of its citizens mr govr morris considered the case of persons under    years as very different from that of foreigners no faith could be pleaded by the former in bar of the regulation no assurance had ever been given that persons under that age should be in all cases on a level with those above it but with     regard to foreigners among us the faith had been pledged that they should enjoy the privileges of citizens if the restriction as to age had been confined to natives  had left foreigners under    years eligible in this case the discrimination wd have been an equal injustice on the other side mr pinkney remarked that the laws of the states had varied much the terms of naturalization in different parts of america and contended that the u s could not be bound to respect them on such an occasion as the present it was a sort of recurrence to first principles col mason was truck not like mr madison with the peculiarity but the propriety of the doctrine of mr sharman the states have formed different qualifications themselves for enjoying different rights of citizenship greater caution wd be necessary in the outset of the govt than afterwards all the great objects wd then be provided for every thing would be then set in motion if persons among us attached to g b should work themselves into our councils a turn might be given to our affairs  particularly to our commercial regulations which might have pernicious consequences the great houses of british merchants will spare no pains to insinuate the instruments of their views into the govt mr wilson read the clause in the constitution of pena giving to foreigners after two years residence all the rights whatsoever of citizens combined it with the article of confederation making the citizens     of one state citizens of all inferred the obligation pena was under to maintain the faith thus pledged to her citizens of foreign birth and the just complaints which her failure would authorize he observed likewise that the princes  states of europe would avail themselves of such breach of faith to deter their subjects from emigration to the u s mr mercer enforced the same idea of a breach of faith mr baldwin could not enter into the force of the arguments agst extending the disqualification to foreigners now citizens the discrimination of the place of birth was not more objectionable than that of age which all had concurred in the propriety of question on the proviso of mr govr morris in favor of foreigners now citizens n h no mass no ct ay n j ay pa ay del no maryd

revenue or for appropriating the same shall originate in the house of representatives and shall not be so amended or altered by the senate as to increase or diminish the sum to be raised or change the mode of levying it or the object of its appropriation—he would not repeat his reasons but barely remind the members from the smaller states of the compromise by which the larger states were entitled to this privilege col mason this amendment removes all the objections urged agst the section as it stood at first by specifying purposes of revenue it obviated the objection that the section extended to all bills under which money might incidentally arise by authorizing amendments in the senate it got rid of the objections that the senate could not correct errors of any sort  that it would introduce into the house of reps the practice of tacking foreign matter to money bills these objections being removed the arguments in favor of the proposed restraint on the senate ought to have their full force   the senate did not represent the people but the states in their political character it was improper therefore that it should tax the people the reason was the same agst their doing it as it had been agst congs doing it nor was it in any respect necessary in order to cure the evils of our republican system he admitted that notwithstanding the superiority of the republican     form over every other it had its evils the chief ones were the danger of the majority oppressing the minority and the mischievous influence of demagogues the genl government of itself will cure them as the states will not concur at the same time in their unjust  oppressive plans the general govt will be able to check  defeat them whether they result from the wickedness of the majority or from the misguidance of demagogues again the senate is not like the h of reps chosen frequently and obliged to return frequently among the people they are to be chosen by the sts for   years will probably settle themselves at the seat of govt will pursue schemes for their own aggrandisement—will be able by wearyg out the h of reps and taking advantage of their impatience at the close of a long session to extort measures for that purpose if they should be paid as he expected would be yet determined  wished to be so out of the natl treasury they will particularly extort an increase of their wages a bare negative was a very different thing from that of originating bills the practice in engld was in point the house of lords does not represent nor tax the people because not elected by the people if the senate can originate they will in the recess of the legislative sessions hatch their mischievous projects for their own purposes and have their money bills ready cut  dried to use a common phrase for the meeting of the h of reps he compared the case to poynings law—and signified that the house of reps might be rendered by degrees like     the parliament of paris the mere depository of the decrees of the senate as to the compromise so much had passed on that subject that he would say nothing about it he did not mean by what he had said to oppose the permanency of the senate on the contrary he had no repugnance to an increase of it—nor to allowing it a negative though the senate was not by its present constitution entitled to it but in all events he would contend that the pursestrings should be in the hands of the representatives of the people mr wilson was himself directly opposed to the equality of votes granted to the senate by its present constitution at the same time he wished not to multiply the vices of the system he did not mean to enlarge on a subject which had been so much canvassed but would remark that as an insuperable objection agst the proposed restriction of money bills to the h of reps that it would be a source of perpetual contentions where there was no mediator to decide them the presidt here could not like the executive magistrate in england interpose by a prorogation or dissolution this restriction had been found pregnant with altercation in every state where the constitution had established it the house of reps will insert other things in money bills and by making them conditions of each other destroy the deliberate liberty of the senate he stated the case of a preamble to a money bill sent up by the house of commons in the reign of queen anne to the h of lords in which the conduct of the displaced ministry     who were to be impeached before the lords was condemned the com̃ons thus extorting a premature judgmt without any hearing of the parties to be tried and the h of lords being thus reduced to the poor  disgraceful expedient of opposing to the authority of a law a protest on their journals agst its being drawn into precedent if there was any thing like poynings law in the present case it was in the attempt to vest the exclusive right of originating in the h of reps and so far he was agst it he should be equally so if the right were to be exclusively vested in the senate with regard to the purse strings it was to be observed that the purse was to have two strings one of which was in the hands of the h of reps the other in those of the senate both houses must concur in untying and of what importance could it be which untied first which last he could not conceive it to be any objection to the senates preparing the bills that they would have leisure for that purpose and would be in the habits of business war commerce  revenue were the great objects of the genl government all of them are connected with money the restriction in favor of the h of represents would exclude the senate from originating any important bills whatever— mr gerry considered this as a part of the plan that would be much scrutinized taxation  representation are strongly associated in the minds of the people and they will not agree that any but their immediate representatives shall meddle with their purses in short the acceptance of the plan will     inevitably fail if the senate be not restrained from originating money bills mr governr morris all the arguments suppose the right to originate  to tax to be exclusively vested in the senate—the effects commented on may be produced by a negative only in the senate they can tire out the other house and extort their concurrence in favorite measures as well by withholding their negative as by adhering to a bill introduced by themselves mr madison thought if the substitute offered by mr randolph for the original section is to be adopted it would be proper to allow the senate at least so to amend as to diminish the sums to be raised why should they be restrained from checking the extravagance of the other house one of the greatest evils incident to republican govt was the spirit of contention  faction the proposed substitute which in some respects lessened the objections agst the section had a contrary effect with respect to this particular it laid a foundation for new difficulties and disputes between the two houses the word revenue was ambiguous in many acts particularly in the regulation of trade the object would be twofold the raising of revenue would be one of them how could it be determined which was the primary or predominant one or whether it was necessary that revenue shd be the sole object in exclusion even of other incidental effects when the contest was first opened with g b their power to regulate trade was admitted their power to raise revenue rejected     an accurate investigation of the subject afterwards proved that no line could be drawn between the two cases the words amend or alter form an equal source of doubt  altercation when an obnoxious paragraph shall be sent down from the senate to the house of reps it will be called an origination under the name of an amendment the senate may actually couch extraneous matter under that name in these cases the question will turn on the degree of connection between the matter  object of the bill and the alteration or amendment offered to it can there be a more fruitful source of dispute or a kind of dispute more difficult to be settled his apprehensions on this point were not conjectural disputes had actually flowed from this source in virga where the senate can originate no bill the words so as to increase or diminish the sum to be raised were liable to the same objections in levying indirect taxes which it seemed to be understood were to form the principal revenue of the new govt the sum to be raised would be increased or diminished by a variety of collateral circumstances influencing the consumption in general the consumption of foreign or of domestic articles—of this or that particular species of articles and even by the mode of collection which may be closely connected with the productiveness of a tax—the friends of the section had argued its necessity from the permanency of the senate he could not see how this argumt applied the senate was not more permanent now than in the form it bore in the original propositions of mr     randolph and at the time when no objection whatever was hinted agst its originating money bills or if in consequence of a loss of the present question a proportional vote in the senate should be reinstated as has been urged as the indemnification the permanency of the senate will remain the same—if the right to originate be vested exclusively in the house of reps either the senate must yield agst its judgment to that house in which case the utility of the check will be lost—or the senate will be inflexible  the h of reps must adapt its money bill to the views of the senate in which case the exclusive right will be of no avail—as to the compromise of which so much had been said he would make a single observation there were   states which had opposed the equality of votes in the senate viz massts penna virga n carolina  south carola as a compensation for the sacrifice extorted from them on this head the exclusive origination of money bills in the other house had been tendered of the five states a majority viz penna virga  s carola have uniformly voted agst the proposed compensation on its own merits as rendering the plan of govt still more objectionable massts has been divided n carolina alone has set a value on the compensation and voted on that principle what obligation then can the small states be under to concur agst their judgments in reinstating the section mr dickenson experience must be our only guide reason may mislead us it was not reason that discovered the singular  admirable mechanism     of the english constitution it was not reason that discovered or ever could have discovered the odd  in the eye of those who are governed by reason the absurd mode of trial by jury accidents probably produced these discoveries and experience has given a sanction to them this is then our guide and has not experience verified the utility of restraining money bills to the immediate representatives of the people whence the effect may have proceeded he could not say whether from the respect with which this privilege inspired the other branches of govt to the h of com̃ons or from the turn of thinking it gave to the people at large with regard to their rights but the effect was visible  could not be doubted—shall we oppose to this long experience the short experience of    years which we had ourselves on this subject as to disputes they could not be avoided any way if both houses should originate each would have a different bill to which it would be attached and for which it would contend—he observed that all the prejudices of the people would be offended by refusing this exclusive privilege to the h of repress and these prejudices shd never be disregarded by us when no essential purpose was to be served when this plan goes forth it will be attacked by the popular leaders aristocracy will be the watchword the shiboleth among its adversaries eight states have inserted in their constitutions the exclusive right of originating money bills in favor of the popular branch of the legislature most of them however allowed the other branch to     amend this he thought would be proper for us to do mr randolph regarded this point as of such consequence that as he valued the peace of this country he would press the adoption of it we had numerous  monstrous difficulties to combat surely we ought not to increase them when the people behold in the senate the countenance of an aristocracy and in the president the form at least of a little monarch will not their alarms be sufficiently raised without taking from their immediate representatives a right which has been so long appropriated to them—the executive will have more influence over the senate than over the h of reps allow the senate to originate in this case  that influence will be sure to mix itself in their deliberations  plans the declaration of war he conceived ought not to be in the senate composed of    men only but rather in the other house in the other house ought to be placed the origination of the means of war as to commercial regulations which may involve revenue the difficulty may be avoided by restraining the definition to bills for the mere or sole purpose of raising revenue the senate will be more likely to be corrupt than the h of reps and should therefore have less to do with money matters his principal object however was to prevent popular objections against the plan and to secure its adoption mr rutlidge the friends of this motion are not consistent in their reasoning they tell us that we     ought to be guided by the long experience of g b  not our own experience of    years and yet they themselves propose to depart from it the h of com̃ons not only have the exclusive right of originating but the lords are not allowed to alter or amend a money bill will not the people say that this restriction is but a mere tub to the whale they cannot but see that it is of no real consequence and will be more likely to be displeased with it as an attempt to bubble them than to impute it to a watchfulness over their rights for his part he would prefer giving the exclusive right to the senate if it was to be given exclusively at all the senate being more conversant in business and having more leisure will digest the bills much better and as they are to have no effect till examined  approved by the h of reps there can be no possible danger these clauses in the constitutions of the states had been put in through a blind adherence to the british model if the work was to be done over now they would be omitted the experiment in s carolina where the senate can originate or amend money bills has shewn that it answers no good purpose and produces the very bad one of continually dividing  heating the two houses sometimes indeed if the matter of the amendment of the senate is pleasing to the other house they wink at the encroachment if it be displeasing then the constitution is appealed to every session is distracted by altercations on this subject the practice now becoming frequent is for the senate not to make   0 formal amendments but to send down a schedule of the alterations which will procure the bill their assent mr carrol the most ingenious men in maryd are puzzled to define the case of money bills or explain the constitution on that point tho it seemed to be worded with all possible plainness  precision it is a source of continual difficulty  squabble between the two houses mr mchenry  mentioned an instance of extraordinary subterfuge to get rid of the apparent force of the constitution on question on the first part of the motion as to the exclusive originating of money

no adjd tuesday aug     in convention article vi sect   taken up mr pinkney argued that the making the members ineligible to offices was degrading to them and the more improper as their election into the legislature implied that they had the confidence of the people that it was inconvenient because the senate might be supposed to contain the fittest men he hoped     to see that body become a school of public ministers a nursery of statesmen that it was impolitic because the legislature would cease to be a magnet to the first talents and abilities he moved to postpone the section in order to take up the following proposition viz—the members of each house shall be incapable of holding any office under the u s for which they or any of others for their benefit receive any salary fees or emoluments of any kind—and the acceptance of such office shall vacate their seats respectively genl mifflin   ded the motion col mason ironically proposed to strike out the whole section as a more effectual expedient for encouraging     that exotic corruption which might not otherwise thrive so well in the american soil—for compleating that aristocrary which was probably in the contemplation of some among us and for inviting into the legislative service those generous  benevolent characters who will do justice to each others merit by carving out offices  rewards for it in the present state of american morals  manners few friends it may be thought will be lost to the plan by the opportunity of giving premiums to a mercenary  depraved ambition mr mercer it is a first principle in political science that whenever the rights of property are secured an aristocracy will grow out of it elective governments also necessarily become aristocratic because the rulers being few can  will draw emoluments for themselves from the many the governments of america will become aristocracies they are so already the public measures are calculated for the benefit of the governors not of the people the people are dissatisfied  complain they change their rulers and the public measures are changed but it is only a change of one scheme of emolument to the rulers for another the people gain nothing by it but an addition of instability  uncertainty to their other evils—governmts can only be maintained by force or influence the executive has not force deprive him of influence by rendering the members of the legislature ineligible to executive offices and he becomes a mere phantom of authority the aristocratic part will not even let him     in for a share of the plunder the legislature must  will be composed of wealth  abilities and the people will be governed by a junto the executive ought to have a council being members of both houses without such an influence the war will be between the aristocracy  the people he wished it to be between the aristocracy  the executive nothing else can protect the people agst those speculating legislatures which are now plundering them throughout the u states mr gerry read a resolution of the legislature of massts passed before the act of congs recommending the convention in which her deputies were instructed not to depart from the rotation established in the  th art of confederation nor to agree in any case to give to the members of congs a capacity to hold offices under the government this he said was repealed in consequence of the act of congs with which the state thought it proper to comply in an unqualified manner the sense of the state however was still the same he could not think with mr pinkney that the disqualification was degrading confidence is the road to tyranny as to ministers  ambassadors few of them were necessary it is the opinion of a great many that they ought to be discontinued on our part that none may be sent among us  that source of influence be shut up if the senate were to appoint ambassadors as seemed to be intended they will multiply embassies for their own sakes he was not so fond of those productions as to wish to establish nurseries for them if they     are once appointed the house of reps will be obliged to provide salaries for them whether they approve of the measures or not if men will not serve in the legislature without a prospect of such offices our situation is deplorable indeed if our best citizens are actuated by such mercenary views we had better chuse a single despot at once it will be more easy to satisfy the rapacity of one than of many according to the idea of one gentleman mr mercer our government it seems is to be a govt of plunder in that case it certainly would be prudent to have but one rather than many to be employed in it we cannot be too circumspect in the formation of this system it will be examined on all sides and with a very suspicious eye the people who have been so lately in arms agst g b for their liberties will not easily give them up he lamented the evils existing at present under our governments but imputed them to the faults of those in office not to the people the misdeeds of the former will produce a critical attention to the opportunities afforded by the new system to like or greater abuses as it now stands it is as compleat an aristocracy as ever was framed if great powers should be given to the senate we shall be governed in reality by a junto as has been apprehended he remarked that it would be very differently constituted from congs   there will be but   deputies from each state in congs there may be   and are generally  —  they are chosen for six years those of congress annually   they are not subject to recall those of congs are   in congress       states are necessary for all great purposes here   persons will suffice is it to be presumed that the people will ever agree to such a system he moved to render the members of the h of reps as well as of the senate ineligible not only during but for one year after the expiration of their terms—if it should be thought that this will injure the legislature by keeping out of it men of abilities who are willing to serve in other offices it may be required as a qualification for other offices that the candidate shall have served a certain time in the legislature mr govr morris exclude the officers of the army  navy and you form a band having a different interest from  opposed to the civil power you stimulate them to despise  reproach those talking lords who dare not face the foe let this spirit be roused at the end of a war before your troops shall have laid down their arms and though the civil authority be intrenched in parchment to the teeth they will cut their way to it he was agst rendering the members of the legislature ineligible to offices he was for rendering them eligible agn after having vacated their seats by accepting office why should we not avail ourselves of their services if the people chuse to give them their confidence there can be little danger of corruption either among the people or the legislatures who are to be the electors if they say we see their merits we honor the men we chuse to renew our confidence in them have they not a right to give them a preference and can they be properly abridged of it     mr williamson introduced his opposition to the motion by referring to the question concerning money bills that clause he said was dead its ghost he was afraid would notwithstanding haunt us it had been a matter of conscience with him to insist upon it as long as there was hope of retaining it he had swallowed the vote of rejection with reluctance he could not digest it all that was said on the other side was that the restriction was not convenient we have now got a house of lords which is to originate moneybills—to avoid another inconveniency we are to have a whole legislature at liberty to cut out offices for one another he thought a selfdenying ordinance for ourselves would be more proper bad as the constitution has been made by expunging the restriction on the senate concerning money bills he did not wish to make it worse by expunging the present section he had scarcely seen a single corrupt measure in the legislature of n carolina which could not be traced up to office hunting mr sherman the constitution shd lay as few temptations as possible in the way of those in power men of abilities will increase as the country grows more populous and as the means of education are more diffused mr pinkney no state has rendered the members of the legislature ineligible to offices in s carolina the judges are eligible into the legislature it cannot be supposed then that the motion will be offensive to the people if the state constitutions     should be revised he believed restrictions of this sort wd be rather diminished than multiplied mr wilson could not approve of the section as it stood and could not give up his judgment to any supposed objections that might arise among the people he considered himself as acting  responsible for the welfare of millions not immediately represented in this house he had also asked himself the serious question what he should say to his constituents in case they should call upon him to tell them why he sacrificed his own judgment in a case where they authorized him to exercise it were he to own to them that he sacrificed it in order to flatter their prejudices he should dread the retort did you suppose the people of penna had not good sense enough to receive a good government under this impression he should certainly follow his own judgment which disapproved of the section he would remark in addition to the objections urged agst it that as one branch of the legislature was to be appointed by the legislatures of the states the other by the people of the states as both are to be paid by the states and to be appointable to state offices nothing seemed to be wanting to prostrate the natl legislature but to render its members ineligible to natl offices  by that means take away its power of attracting those talents which were necessary to give weight to the governt and to render it useful to the people he was far from thinking the ambition which aspired to offices of dignity and trust an ignoble or culpable one he was sure     it was not politic to regard it in that light or to withhold from it the prospect of those rewards which might engage it in the career of public service he observed that the state of penna which had gone as far as any state into the policy of fettering power had not rendered the members of the legislature ineligible to offices of govt mr elsworth did not think the mere postponement of the reward would be any material discouragement of merit ambitious minds will serve   years or   years in the legislature for the sake of qualifying themselves for other offices this he thought a sufficient security for obtaining the services of the ablest men in the legislature although whilst members they should be ineligible to public offices besides merit will be most encouraged when most impartially rewarded if rewards are to circulate only within the legislature merit out of it will be discouraged mr mercer was extremely anxious on this point what led to the appointment of this convention the corruption  mutability of the legislative councils of the states if the plan does not remedy these it will not recommend itself and we shall not be able in our private capacities to support  enforce it nor will the best part of our citizens exert themselves for the purpose—it is a great mistake to suppose that the paper we are to propose will govern the u states it is the men whom it will bring into the governt and interest in maintaining it that is to govern them the paper will only mark out the  00 mode  the form men are the substance and must do the business all govt must be by force or influence it is not the king of france—but  00000 janisaries of power that govern that kingdom there will be no such force here influence then must be substituted and he would ask whether this could be done if the members of the legislature should be ineligible to offices of state whether such a disqualification would not determine all the most influential men to stay at home  prefer appointments within their respective states mr wilson was by no means satisfied with the answer given by mr elseworth to the argument as to the discouragement of merit the members must either go a second time into the legislature and disqualify themselves—or say to their constituents we served you before only from the mercenary view of qualifying ourselves for offices and haveg answered this purpose we do not chuse to be again elected mr govr morris put the case of a war and the citizen the most capable of conducting it happening to be a member of the legislature what might have been the consequence of such a regulation at the commencement or even in the course of the late contest for our liberties on question for postponing in order to take up mr pinkneys motion it was lost n h ay mas no ct no n j no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c no s c no geo divd  0  mr govr morris moved to insert after office except offices in the army or navy but in that case their offices shall be vacated mr broom  ds him mr randolph had been  should continue uniformly opposed to the striking out of the clause as opening a door for influence  corruption no arguments had made any impression on him but those which related to the case of war and a coexisting incapacity of the fittest commanders to be employed he admitted great weight in these and would agree to the exception proposed by mr govr morris mr butler  mr pinkney urged a general postponemt of   sect art vi till it should be seen what powers would be vested in the senate when it would be more easy to judge of the expediency of allowing the officers of state to be chosen out of that body—a general postponement was agreed to nem con art vi sect  0 taken up—that members be paid by their respective states mr elseworth said that in reflecting on this subject he had been satisfied that too much dependence on the states would be produced by this mode of payment he moved to strike it out and insert that they should be paid out of the treasury of the u s an allowance not exceeding  dollars per day or the present value thereof mr govr morris remarked that if the members were to be paid by the states it would throw an unequal burden on the distant states which would be unjust as the legislature was to be a national  0  assembly he moved that the payment be out of the natl treasury leaving the quantum to the discretion of the natl legislature there could be no reason to fear that they would overpay themselves mr butler contended for payment by the states particularly in the case of the senate who will be so long out of their respective states that they will lose sight of their constituents unless dependent on them for their support mr langdon was agst payment by the states there would be some difficulty in fixing the sum but it would be unjust to oblige the distant states to bear the expence of their members in travelling to and from the seat of govt mr madison if the h of reps is to be chosen biennially—and the senate to be constantly dependent on the legislatures which are chosen annually he could not see any chance for that stability in the genl govt the want of which was a principal evil in the state govts his fear was that the organization of the govt supposing the senate to be really independt for six years would not effect our purpose it was nothing more than a combination of the peculiarities of two of the state govts which separately had been found insufficient the senate was formed on the model of that of maryld the revisionary check on that of n york what the effect of a union of these provisions might be could not be foreseen the enlargement of the sphere of the government was indeed a circumstance which he thought would be favorable as he had on several  0  occasions undertaken to show he was however for fixing at least two extremes not to be exceeded by the natl legislre in the payment of themselves mr gerry there are difficulties on both sides the observation of mr butler has weight in it on the other side the state legislatures may turn out the senators by reducing their salaries such things have been practised col mason it has not yet been noticed that the clause as it now stands makes the house of represents also dependent on the state legislatures so that both houses will be made the instruments of the politics of the states whatever they may be mr broom could see no danger in trusting the genl legislature with the payment of themselves the state legislatures had this power and no complaint had been made of it mr sherman was not afraid that the legislature would make their own wages too high but too low so that men ever so fit could not serve unless they were at the same time rich he thought the best plan would be to fix a moderate allowance to be paid out of the natl treasy and let the states make such additions as they might judge fit he moved that   dollars per day be the sum any further emoluments to be added by the states mr carrol had been much surprised at seeing this clause in the report the dependence of both houses on the state legislatures is compleat especially as the members of the former are eligible to state offices the states can now say if you do  0  not comply with our wishes we will starve you if you do we will reward you the new govt in this form was nothing more than a second edition of congress in two volumes instead of one and perhaps with very few amendments— mr dickenson took it for granted that all were convinced of the necessity of making the genl govt independent of the prejudices passions and improper views of the state legislatures the contrary of this was effected by the section as it stands on the other hand there were objections agst taking a permanent standard as wheat which had been suggested on a former occasion as well as against leaving the matter to the pleasure of the natl legislature he proposed that an act should be passed every    years by the natl legislre settling the quantum of their wages if the genl govt should be left dependent on the state legislatures it would be happy for us if we had never met in this room mr elseworth was not unwilling himself to trust the legislature with authority to regulate their own wages but well knew that an unlimited discretion for that purpose would produce strong tho perhaps not insuperable objections he thought changes in the value of money provided for by his motion in the words or the present value thereof mr l martin as the senate is to represent the states the members of it ought to be paid by the states mr carrol the senate was to represent  manage  0  the affairs of the whole and not to be the advocates of state interests they ought then not to be dependent on nor paid by the states on the question for paying the members of the legislature out of the natl treasury n h ay mass no ct ay n j ay pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay

proposed that the wages of the members of both houses sd be required to be the same mr broome seconded him mr ghorum this would be unreasonable the senate will be detained longer from home will be

other house mr dickenson withdrew his motion it was moved  agreed to amend the section by adding—to be ascertained by law  0  the section art vi sect  0 as amended agreed to nem con adjd wednesday august    in convention art vi sect    agreed to nem con art vi sect    taken up mr strong moved to amend the article so as to read—each house shall possess the right of originating all bills except bills for raising money for the purposes of revenue or for appropriating the same and for fixing the salaries of the officers of the govt which shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as in other cases col mason  ds the motion he was extremely earnest to take this power from the senate who he said could already sell the whole country by means of treaties mr ghorum urged the amendment as of great importance the senate will first acquire the habit of preparing money bills and then the practice will grow into an exclusive right of preparing them mr governr morris opposed it as unnecessary and inconvenient mr williamson some think this restriction on the senate essential to liberty others think it of no importance why should not the former be indulged  0  he was for an efficient and stable govt but many would not strengthen the senate if not restricted in the case of money bills the friends of the senate would therefore lose more than they would gain by refusing to gratify the other side he moved to postpone the subject till the powers of the senate should be gone over mr rutlidge  ds the motion mr mercer should hereafter be agst returning to a reconsideration of this section he contended alluding to mr masons observations that the senate ought not to have the power of treaties this power belonged to the executive department adding that treaties would not be final so as to alter the laws of the land till ratified by legislative authority this was the case of treaties in great britain particularly the late treaty of com̃erce with france col mason did not say that a treaty would repeal a law but that the senate by means of treaty might alienate territory c without legislative sanction the cessions of the british islands in w indies by treaty alone were an example if spain should possess herself of georgia therefore the senate might by treaty dismember the union he wished the motion to be decided now that the friends of it might know how to conduct themselves on the question for postponing sect    it passed in the affirmative n h ay mass ay ct no n j no pena no del no maryd no va ay n c ay s c ay

both should object ¾ of each house should be necessary to overrule the objections and give to the acts the force of law  mr wilson seconds the motion mr pinkney opposed the interference of the judges in the legislative business it will involve them in parties and give a previous tincture to their opinions mr mercer heartily approved the motion it is an axiom that the judiciary ought to be separate from the legislative but equally so that it ought to be independent of that department the true policy of the axiom is that legislative usurpation and oppression may be obviated he disapproved of the doctrine  0  that the judges as expositors of the constitution should have authority to declare a law void he thought laws ought to be well and cautiously made and then to be uncontroulable mr gerry this motion comes to the same thing with what has been already negatived question on the motion of mr madison n h no mass no ct no n j no pa no del ay maryd ay virga ay n c no s c no geo no mr govr morris regretted that something like the proposed check could not be agreed to he dwelt on the importance of public credit and the difficulty of supporting it without some strong barrier against the instability of legislative assemblies he suggested the idea of requiring three fourths of each house to repeal laws where the president should not concur he had no great reliance on the revisionary power as the executive was now to be constituted elected by congress the legislature will contrive to soften down the president he recited the history of paper emissions and the perseverance of the legislative assemblies in repeating them with all the distressing effects of such measures before their eyes were the national legislature formed and a war was now to break out this ruinous expedient would be again resorted to if not guarded against the requiring ¾ to repeal would though not a compleat remedy prevent the hasty passage of laws and the frequency of those repeals which destroy faith in the public and which are among our greatest calamities   0 mr dickenson was strongly impressed with the remark of mr mercer as to the power of the judges to set aside the law he thought no such power ought to exist he was at the same time at a loss what expedient to substitute the justiciary of arragon he observed became by degrees the lawgiver mr govr morris suggested the expedient of an absolute negative in the executive he could not agree that the judiciary which was part of the executive should be bound to say that a direct violation of the constitution was law a controul over the legislature might have its inconveniences but view the danger on the other side the most virtuous citizens will often as members of a legislative body concur in measures which afterwards in their private capacity they will be ashamed of encroachments of the popular branch of the government ought to be guarded agst the ephori at sparta became in the end absolute the report of the council of censors in pennsylva points out the many invasions of the legislative department on the executive numerous as the latter  is within the short term of seven years and in a state where a strong party is opposed to the constitution and watching every occasion of turning the public resentments agst it if the executive be overturned by the popular branch as happened in england the tyranny of one man will ensue in rome where the aristocracy overturned the throne     the consequence was different he enlarged on the tendency of the legislative authority to usurp on the executive and wished the section to be postponed in order to consider of some more effectual check than requiring ⅔ only to overrule the negative of the executive mr sharman can one man be trusted better than all the others if they all agree this was neither wise nor safe he disapproved of judges meddling in politics and parties we have gone far enough in forming the negative as it now stands mr carrol when the negative to be overruled by ⅔ only was agreed to the quorum was not fixed he remarked that as a majority was now to be the quorum    in the larger and   in the smaller house might carry points the advantage that might be taken of this seemed to call for greater impediments to improper laws he thought the controuling power however of the executive could not be well decided till it was seen how the formation of that department would be finally regulated he wished the consideration of the matter to be postponed mr ghorum saw no end to these difficulties and postponements some could not agree to the form of government before the powers were defined others could not agree to the powers till it was seen how the government was to be formed he thought a majority as large a quorum as was necessary it was the quorum almost every where fixt in the u states mr wilson after viewing the subject with all the     coolness and attention possible was most apprehensive of a dissolution of the govt from the legislature swallowing up all the other powers he remarked that the prejudices agst the executive resulted from a misapplication of the adage that the parliament was the palladium of liberty where the executive was really formidable king and tyrant were naturally associated in the minds of people not legislature and tyranny but where the executive was not formidable the two last were most properly associated after the destruction of the king in great britain a more pure and unmixed tyranny sprang up in the parliament than had been exercised by the monarch he insisted that we had not guarded agst the danger on this side by a sufficient selfdefensive power either to the executive or judiciary department mr rutlidge was strenuous agst postponing and complained much of the tediousness of the proceedings mr elseworth held the same language we grow more  more sceptical as we proceed if we do not decide soon we shall be unable to come to any decision the question for postponement passed in the negative del  maryd only being in the affirmative mr williamson moved to change ⅔ of each house into ¾ as requisite to overrule the dissent of the president he saw no danger in this and preferred giving the power to the presidt alone to admitting the judges into the business of legislation     mr wilson  ds the motion referring to and repeating the ideas of mr carroll on

convention of the great difference of interests among the states and doubts     the propriety in that point of view of letting a majority be a quorum mr mason urged the necessity of connecting with the power of levying taxes duties c the prohibition in sect   art vi that no tax should be laid on exports he was unwilling to trust to its being done in a future article he hoped the northn states did not mean to deny the southern this security it would hereafter be as desirable to the former when the latter should become the most populous he professed his jealousy for the productions of the southern or as he called them the staple states he moved to insert the following amendment provided that no tax duty or imposition shall be laid by the legislature of the u states on articles exported from any state mr sherman had no objection to the proviso here other than it would derange the parts of the report as made by the committee to take them in such an order mr rutlidge it being of no consequence in what order points are decided he should vote for the clause as it stood but on condition that the subsequent part relating to negroes should also be agreed to mr governeur morris considered such a proviso as inadmissible any where it was so radically objectionable that it might cost the whole system the support of some members he contended that it would not in some cases be equitable to tax imports without taxing exports and that taxes on exports would be often the most easy and proper of the two     mr madison   the power of laying taxes on exports is proper in itself and as the states cannot with propriety exercise it separately it ought to be vested in them collectively   it might with particular advantage be exercised with regard to articles in which america was not rivalled in foreign markets as tobo c the contract between the french farmers genl and mr morris stipulating that if taxes sd be laid in america on the export of tobo they sd be paid by the farmers shewed that it was understood by them that the price would be thereby raised in america and consequently the taxes be paid by the european consumer   it would be unjust to the states whose produce was exported by their neighbours to leave it subject to be taxed by the latter this was a grievance which had already filled n h cont n jery del and n carolina with loud complaints as it related to imports and they would be equally authorized by taxes by the states on exports   the southn states being most in danger and most needing naval protection could the less complain if the burthen should be somewhat heaviest on them   we are not providing for the present moment only and time will equalize the situation of the states in this matter he was for these reasons agst the motion mr williamson considered the clause proposed agst taxes on exports as reasonable and necessary mr elseworth was agst taxing exports but thought the prohibition stood in the most proper place and was agst deranging the order reported by the committee     mr wilson was decidedly agst prohibiting general taxes on exports he dwelt on the injustice and impolicy of leaving n jersey connecticut c any longer subject to the exactions of their commercial neighbours mr gerry thought the legislature could not be trusted with such a power it might ruin the country it might be exercised partially raising one and depressing another part of it mr govr morris however the legislative power may be formed it will if disposed be able to ruin the country he considered the taxing of exports to be in many cases highly politic virginia has found her account in taxing tobacco all countries having peculiar articles tax the exportation of them as france her wines and brandies a tax here on lumber would fall on the w indies  punish their restrictions on our trade the same is true of live stock and in some degree of flour in case of a dearth in the west indies we may extort what we please taxes on exports are a necessary source of revenue for a long time the people of america will not have money to pay direct taxes seize and sell their effects and you push them into revolts mr mercer was strenuous against giving congress power to tax exports such taxes are impolitic as encouraging the raising of articles not meant for exportation the states had now a right where their situation permitted to tax both the imports and the exports of their uncommercial neighbours it was     enough for them to sacrifice one half of it it had been said the southern states had most need of naval protection the reverse was the case were it not for promoting the carrying trade of the northn states the southn states could let the trade go into foreign bottoms where it would not need our protection virginia by taxing her tobacco had given an advantage to that of maryland mr sherman to examine and compare the states in relation to imports and exports will be opening a boundless field he thought the matter had been adjusted and that imports were to be subject and exports not to be taxed he thought it wrong to tax exports except it might be such articles as ought not to be exported the complexity of the business in america would render an equal tax on exports impracticable the oppression of the uncommercial states was guarded agst by the power to regulate trade between the states as to compelling foreigners that might be done by regulating trade in general the government would not be trusted with such a power objections are most likely to be excited by considerations relating to taxes  money a power to tax exports would shipwreck the whole mr carrol was surprised that any objection should be made to an exception of exports from the power of taxation it was finally agreed that the question concerning exports shd lie over for the place in which the exception stood in the report maryd alone voting agst it     sect   art vii agreed to mr gerry alone answering no

prohibit the making them a tender this will remove the temptation to emit them with unjust views and promissory notes in that shape may in some emergencies be best mr govr morris striking out the words will leave room still for notes of a responsible minister which will do all the good without the mischief the monied interest will oppose the plan of government if paper emissions be not prohibited mr ghorum was for striking out without inserting any prohibition if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure   0 col mason had doubts on the subject congs he thought would not have the power unless it were expressed though he had a mortal hatred to paper money yet as he could not forsee all emergencies he was unwilling to tie the hands of the legislature he observed that the late war could not have been carried on had such a prohibition existed mr ghorum the power as far as it will be necessary or safe is involved in that of borrowing mr mercer was a friend to paper money though in the present state  temper of america he should neither propose nor approve of such a measure he was consequently opposed to a prohibition of it altogether it will stamp suspicion on the government to deny it a discretion on this point it was impolitic also to excite the opposition of all those who were friends to paper money the people of property would be sure to be on the side of the plan and it was impolitic to purchase their further attachment with the loss of the opposite class of citizens mr elseworth thought this a favorable moment to shut and bar the door against paper money the mischiefs of the various experiments which had been made were now fresh in the public mind and had excited the disgust of all the respectable part of america by withholding the power from the new governt more friends of influence would be gained to it than by almost any thing else paper money can in no case be necessary give the government     credit and other resources will offer the power may do harm never good mr randolph notwithstanding his antipathy to paper money could not agree to strike out the words as he could not foresee all the occasions that might arise mr wilson it will have a most salutary influence on the credit of the u states to remove the possibility of paper money this expedient can never succeed whilst its mischiefs are remembered and as long as it can be resorted to it will be a bar to other resources mr butler remarked that paper was a legal tender in no country in europe he was urgent for disarming the government of such a power mr mason was still averse to tying the hands of the legislature altogether if there was no example in europe as just remarked it might be observed on the other side that there was none in which the government was restrained on this head mr read thought the words if not struck out would be as alarming as the mark of the beast in revelations mr langdon had rather reject the whole plan than retain the three words

counterfeited by citizens and that it might be politic to provide by national authority for the punishment of it mr randolph did not conceive that expunging the punishment would be a constructive

defective one defect is supplied by stat of anne as to running away with vessels which at com̃on law was a breach of trust only besides no foreign law should be a standard farther than is expressly adopted if the laws of the states were to prevail on this subject the citizens of different states would be subject to different punishments for the same offence at sea there would be neither uniformity nor stability in the law—the proper remedy for all these difficulties was to vest the power proposed by the term define in the natl legislature     mr govr morris would prefer designate to define the latter being as he conceived limited to the preexisting meaning it was said by others to be applicable to the creating of offences also and therefore suited the case both of felonies  of piracies the motion of mr m  mr r was agreed to mr elseworth enlarged the motion so as to read to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas counterfeiting the securities and

so as to read or without it when the legislature cannot meet mr gerry was agst letting loose the myrmidons of the u states on a state without its own consent the states will be the best judges in such cases more blood would have been spilt in massts in the late insurrection if the genl authority had intermeddled mr langdon was for striking out as moved by mr pinkney the apprehension of the national

objectionable as the motion of mr pinkney mr govr morris we are acting a very strange part we first form a strong man to protect us and at the same time wish to tie his hands behind him the

this power in the legislature its proceedings were too slow it wd meet but once a year the hs of reps would be too numerous for such deliberations the senate would be the best depository being more acquainted with foreign affairs and most capable of proper resolutions if the states are equally represented in the senate so as to give no advantage to the large states the power will notwithstanding be safe as the small have their all at stake in such cases as well as the large states it would be singular for one authority to make war and another peace mr butler the objections agst the legislature lie in a great degree agst the senate he was for vesting the power in the president who will have all the requisite qualities and will not make war but when the nation will support it mr madison and mr gerry moved to insert declare striking out make war leaving to the executive the power to repel sudden attacks mr sharman thought it stood very well the executive shd be able to repel

elsworth there is a material difference between the cases of making war and making peace it shd be more easy to get out of war than into it war also is a simple and overt declaration peace attended with intricate  secret negociations mr mason was agst giving the power of war to the executive because not safely to be trusted with it or to the senate because not so constructed as to be entitled to

august    in convention mr madison submitted in order to be referred to the committee of detail the following powers as proper to be added to those of the general legislature to dispose of the unappropriated lands of the u states to institute temporary governments for new states arising therein to regulate affairs with the indians as well within as without the limits of the u states to exercise exclusively legislative authority at the seat of the general government and over a district around the same not exceeding — square miles the consent of the legislature of the state or states comprising the same being first obtained to grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them and the authority of a single state may be incompetent to secure to literary authors their copy rights for a limited time to establish an university to encourage by premiums  provisions the advancement of useful knowledge and discoveries to authorize the executive to procure and hold   0 for the use of the u s landed property for the erection of forts magazines and other necessary buildings these propositions were referred to the committee of detail which had prepared the report and at the same time the following which were moved by mr pinkney—in both cases unanimously to fix and permanently establish the seat of government of the u s in which they shall possess the exclusive right of soil  jurisdiction to establish seminaries for the promotion of literature and the arts  sciences to grant charters of incorporation to grant patents for useful inventions to secure to authors exclusive rights for a certain time to establish public institutions rewards and immunities for the promotion of agriculture commerce trades and manufactures that funds which shall be appropriated for the payment of public creditors shall not during the time of such appropriation be diverted or applied to any other purpose and that the committee prepare a clause or clauses for restraining the legislature of the u s from establishing a perpetual revenue to secure the payment of the public debt to secure all creditors under the new constitution from a violation of the public faith when pledged by the authority of the legislature to grant letters of mark and reprisal to regulate stages on the post roads     mr mason introduced the subject of regulating the militia he thought such a power necessary to be given to the genl government he hoped there would be no standing army in time of peace unless it might be for a few garrisons the militia ought therefore to be the more effectually prepared for the public defence thirteen states will never concur in any one system if the disciplining of the militia be left in their hands if they will not give up the power over the whole they probably will over a part as a select militia he moved as an addition to the propositions just referred to the comittee of detail  to be referred in like manner a power to regulate the militia mr gerry remarked that some provision ought to be made in favor of public securities and something inserted concerning letters of marque which he thought not included in the power of war he proposed that these subjects should also go to a committee mr rutlidge moved to refer a clause that funds appropriated to public creditors should not be diverted to other purposes mr mason was much attached to the principle but was afraid such a fetter might be dangerous in time of war he suggested the necessity of preventing the danger of perpetual revenue which must of necessity subvert the liberty of any country if it be objected to on the principle of mr rutlidges motion that public credit may require perpetual provisions that case might be excepted it being declared that in other cases no taxes should be laid for a longer     term than — years he considered the caution observed in great britain on this point as the paladium of public liberty mr rutlidges motion was referred—he then moved that a grand committee be appointed to consider the necessity and expediency of the u states assuming all the state debts—a regular settlement between the union  the several states would never take place the assumption would be just as the state debts were contracted in the common defence it was necessary as the taxes on imports the only sure source of revenue were to be given up to the union it was politic as by disburdening the people of the state debts it would conciliate them to the plan mr king and mr pinkney seconded the motion col mason interposed a motion that the committee prepare a clause for restraining perpetual revenue which was agreed to nem con mr sherman thought it would be better to authorize the legislature to assume the state debts than to say positively it should be done he considered the measure as just and that it would have a good effect to say something about the matter mr elseworth differed from mr sherman as far as the state debts ought in equity to be assumed he conceived that they might and would be so mr pinkney observed that a great part of the state debts were of such a nature that although in point of policy and true equity they ought yet would they not be viewed in the light of federal expenditures     mr king thought the matter of more consequence than mr elseworth seemed to do and that it was well worthy of commitment besides the considerations of justice and policy which had been mentioned it might be remarked that the state creditors an active and formidable party would otherwise be opposed to a plan which transferred to the union the best resources of the states without transferring the state debts at the same time the state creditors had generally been the strongest foes to the impostplan the state debts probably were of greater amount than the federal he would not say that it was practicable to consolidate the debts but he thought it would be prudent to have the subject considered by a committee on mr rutlidges motion that a come be appointed to consider of the assumption c n h no mass ay ct ay n j no pa divd del no md no va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr gerrys motion to provide for

williamson mr c c pinkney mr baldwin mr rutlidge remarked on the length of the session     the probable impatience of the public and the extreme anxiety of many members of the convention to bring the business to an end concluding with a motion that the convention meet henceforward precisely at  0 oc a m and that precisely at   oc p m the president adjourn the house without motion for the purpose and that no motion to adjourn sooner be allowed on this question n h ay mass ay ct ay n j ay pa no del ay md no va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr elseworth observed that a council had not yet been provided for the president he conceived there ought to be one his proposition was that it should be composed of the president of the senate the chief justice and the ministers as they might be estabd for the departments of foreign  domestic affairs war finance and marine who should advise but not conclude the president mr pinkney wished the proposition to lie over as notice had been given for a like purpose by mr govr morris who was not then on the floor his own idea was that the president shd be authorized to call for advice or not as he might chuse given him an able council and it will thwart him a weak one and he will shelter himself under their sanction mr gerry was agst letting the heads of the departments particularly of finance have any thing to do in business connected with legislation he mentioned the chief justice also as particularly exceptionable     these men will also be so taken up with other matters as to neglect their own proper duties mr dickenson urged that the great appointments should be made by the legislature in which case they might properly be consulted by the executive but not if made by the executive himself—this subject by general consent lay over  the house proceeded to the clause to raise armies mr ghorum moved to add and support after raise agreed to nem con and then the clause was agreed to nem con as amended mr gerry took notice that there was no check here agst standing armies in time of peace the existing congs is so constructed that it cannot of itself maintain an army this wd not be the case under the new system the people were jealous on this head and great opposition to the plan would spring from such an omission he suspected that preparations of force were now making agst it he seemed to allude to the activity of the govr of n york at this crisis in disciplining the militia of that state he thought an army dangerous in time of peace  could never consent to a power to keep up an indefinite number he proposed that there shall not be kept up in time of peace more than — thousand troops his idea was that the blank should be filled with two or three thousand instead of to build and equip fleets—to provide and maintain a navy agreed to nem con as a more convenient definition of the power     to make rules for the government and regulation of the land  naval forces added from the existing articles of confederation mr l martin and mr gerry now regularly moved provided that in time of peace the army shall not consist of more than — thousand men genl pinkney asked whether no troops were ever to be raised untill an attack should be made on us mr gerry if there be no restriction a few states may establish a military govt mr williamson reminded him of mr masons motion for limiting the appropriation of revenue as the best guard in this case mr langdon saw no room for mr gerrys distrust of the representatives of the people mr dayton preparations for war are generally made in peace and a standing force of some sort may for ought we know become unavoidable he should object to no restrictions consistent with these ideas the motion of mr martin and mr gerry was disagreed to nem con mr mason moved as an additional power to make laws for the regulation and discipline of the militia of the several states reserving to the states the appointment of the officers he considered uniformity as necessary in the regulation of the militia throughout the union genl pinkney mentioned a case during the war in which a dissimilarity in the militia of different states had produced the most serious mischiefs uniformity     was essential the states would never keep up a proper discipline of their militia mr elseworth was for going as far in submitting the militia to the genl government as might be necessary but thought the motion of mr mason went too far he moved that the militia should have the same arms  exercise and be under rules established by the genl govt when in actual service of the u states and when states neglect to provide regulations for militia it shd be regulated  established by the legislature of u s the whole authority over the militia ought by no means to be taken away from the states whose consequence would pine away to nothing after such a sacrifice of power he thought the genl authority could not sufficiently pervade the union for such a purpose nor could it accommodate itself to the local genius of the people it must be vain to ask the states to give the militia out of their hands mr sherman  ds the motion mr dickenson we are come now to a most important matter that of the sword his opinion was that the states never would nor ought to give up all authority over the militia he proposed to restrain the general power to one fourth part at a time which by rotation would discipline the whole militia mr butler urged the necessity of submitting the whole militia to the general authority which had the care of the general defence mr mason had suggested the idea of a select militia he was led to think that would be in fact as much as     the genl govt could advantageously be charged with he was afraid of creating insuperable objections to the plan he withdrew his original motion and moved a power to make laws for regulating and disciplining the militia not exceeding one tenth part in any one year and reserving the appointment of officers to the states genl pinkney renewed mr masons original motion for a part to be under the genl and a part under the state govts wd be an incurable evil he saw no room for such distrust of the genl govt mr langdon  ds general pinkneys renewal he saw no more reason to be afraid of the genl govt than of the state govts he was more apprehensive of the confusion of the different authorities on this subject than of either mr madison thought the regulation of the militia naturally appertaining to the authority charged with the public defence it did not seem in its nature to be divisible between two distinct authorities if the states would trust the genl govt with a power over the public treasure they would from the same consideration of necessity grant it the direction of the public force those who had a full view of the public situation wd from a sense of the danger guard agst it the states would not be separately impressed with the general situation nor have the due confidence in the concurrent exertions of each other mr elseworth considered the idea of a select militia as impracticable  if it were not it would be followed by a ruinous declension of the great body     of the militia the states would never submit to the same militia laws three or four shillings as a penalty will enforce better obedience in new england than forty lashes in some other places mr pinkney thought the power such an one as could not be abused and that the states would see the necessity of surrendering it he had however but a scanty faith in militia there must be also a real military force this alone can effectually answer the purpose the united states had been making an experiment without it and we see the consequence in their rapid approaches toward anarchy  mr sherman took notice that the states might want their militia for defence agst invasions and insurrections and for enforcing obedience to their laws they will not give up this point in giving up that of taxation they retain a concurrent power of raising money for their own use mr gerry thought this the last point remaining to be surrendered if it be agreed to by the convention the plan will have as black a mark as was set on cain he had no such confidence in the genl govt as some gentlemen possessed and believed it would be found that the states have not col mason thought there was great weight in the remarks of mr sherman and moved an exception to his motion of such part of the militia as might be required by the states for their own use   0 mr read doubted the propriety of leaving the appointment of the militia officers in the states in some states they are elected by the legislatures in others by the people themselves he thought at least an appointment by the state executives ought to be insisted on on committing to the grand committee last appointed the latter motion of col mason  the original one revived by gel pinkney n h ay mas ay ct no n j no pa ay del ay md divd va

not as he may think proper and every officer above mentioned shall be responsible for his opinion on the affairs relating to his particular department each of the officers above mentioned shall be liable to impeachment  removal from office for neglect of duty malversation or corruption mr gerry moved that the committee be instructed to report proper qualifications for the president and a mode of trying the supreme judges in cases of impeachment the clause to call forth the aid of the militia c was postponed till report should be made as to the power over the militia referred yesterday to the grand committee of eleven mr mason moved to enable congress to enact sumptuary laws no government can be maintained     unless the manners be made consonant to it such a discretionary power may do good and can do no harm a proper regulation of excises  of trade may do a great deal but it is best to have an express provision it was objected to sumptuary laws that they were contrary to nature this was a vulgar error the love of distinction it is true is natural but the object of sumptuary laws is not to extinguish this principle but to give it a proper direction mr elseworth the best remedy is to enforce taxes  debts as far as the regulation of eating  drinking can be reasonable it is provided for in the power of taxation mr govr morris argued that sumptuary laws tended to create a landed nobility by fixing in the greatlandholders and their posterity their present possessions mr gerry the law of necessity is the best sumptuary law on motion of mr mason as to sumptuary laws n h no mas no ct no n j no pa no del ay md ay va no n c no s c no geo ay and to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the u s or any department or officer thereof mr madison and mr pinkney moved to insert between laws and necessary and establish all offices it appearing to them liable to cavil that the latter was not included in the former     mr govr morris mr wilson mr rutlidge and mr elseworth urged that the amendment could not be necessary on the motion for inserting and establish all offices n h no mass ay ct no n j no pa no del no md ay va no n c no s c no geo no the clause as reported was then agreed to nem con art vii sect   concerning treason which see mr madison thought the definition too narrow it did not appear to go as far as the stat of edwd iii he did not see why more latitude might not be left to the legislature it wd be as safe as in the hands of state legislatures and it was inconvenient to bar a discretion which experience might enlighten and which might be applied to good purposes as well as be abused mr mason was for pursuing the stat of edwd iii mr govr morris was for giving to the union an exclusive right to declare what shd be treason in case of a contest between the u s and a particular state the people of the latter must under the disjunctive terms of the clause be traitors to one or other authority mr randolph thought the clause defective in adopting the words in adhering only the british stat adds giving them aid and comfort which had a more extensive meaning mr elseworth considered the definition as the same in fact with that of the statute     mr govr morris adhering does not go so far as giving aid and comfort or the latter words may be restrictive of adhering in either case the statute is not pursued mr wilson held giving aid and comfort to be explanatory not operative words and that it was better to omit them mr dickenson thought the addition of giving aid and comfort unnecessary  improper being too vague and extending too far he wished to know what was meant by the testimony of two witnesses whether they were to be witnesses to the same overt act or to different overt acts he thought also that proof of an overt act ought to be expressed as essential in the case docr johnson considered giving aid  comfort as explanatory of adhering  that something should be inserted in the definition concerning overt acts he contended that treason could not be both agst the u states—and individual states being an offence agst the sovereignty which can be but one in the same community mr madison remarked that and before in adhering should be changed into or otherwise both offences viz of levying war  of adhering to the enemy might be necessary to constitute treason he added that as the definition here was of treason against the u s it would seem that the individual states wd be left in possession of a concurrent power so far as to define  punish treason particularly agst themselves which might involve double punishmt     it was moved that the whole clause be recommitted which was lost the votes being equally divided n h no mas no ct no n j ay pa ay del no md ay va ay n c divd s c no geo ay mr wilson  docr johnson moved that or any of them after united states be struck out in order to remove the embarrassment which was agreed to nem con mr madison this has not removed the embarrassment the same act might be treason agst the united states as here defined—and agst a particular state according to its laws mr elseworth there can be no danger to the genl authority from this as the laws of the u states are to be paramount docr johnson was still of opinion there could be no treason agst a particular state it could not even at present as the confederation now stands the sovereignty being in the union much less can it be under the proposed system col mason the united states will have a qualified sovereignty only the individual states will retain a part of the sovereignty an act may be treason agst a particular state which is not so agst the u states he cited the rebellion of bacon in virginia as an illustration of the doctrine docr johnson that case would amount to treason agst the sovereign the supreme sovereign the united states mr king observed that the controversy relating to     treason might be of less magnitude than was supposed as the legislature might punish capitally under other names than treason mr govr morris and mr randolph wished to substitute the words of the british statute and moved to postpone sect   art vii in order to consider the following substitute—whereas it is essential to the preservation of liberty to define precisely and exclusively what shall constitute the crime of treason it is therefore ordained declared  established that if a man do levy war agst the u s within their territories or be adherent to the enemies of the u s within the said territories giving them aid and comfort within their territories or elsewhere and thereof be provably attainted of open deed by the people of his condition he shall be adjudged guilty of treason on this question n h—mas no ct no n j ay pa no del no md no va ay n c no s c no geo no it was then moved to strike out agst united states after treason so as to define treason

this amendment to take place prosecutions for treason were generally virulent and perjury too easily made use of against innocence   0 mr wilson much may be said on both sides treason may sometimes be practised in such a manner as to render proof extremely difficult—as in a traitorous correspondence with an enemy on the question—as to some overt act n h ay mass ay ct ay n j no pa ay del ay md ay va no n c no s c ay geo ay mr king moved to insert before the word power the word sole giving the u states the exclusive right to declare the punishment of treason mr broom  ds the motion mr wilson in cases of a general nature treason can only be agst the u— states and in such they shd have the sole right to declare the punishment—yet in many cases it may be otherwise the subject was however intricate and he distrusted his present judgment on it mr king this amendment results from the vote defining treason generally by striking out agst the u states which excludes any treason agst particular states these may however punish offences as high misdemesnors on inserting the word sole it passed in the negative n h ay mas ay ct no n j no pa ay del ay md no va no n c no s c ay geo no— mr wilson the clause is ambiguous now sole ought either to have been inserted or against the u s to be reinstated     mr king no line can be drawn between levying war and adhering to enemy agst the u states and agst an individual state—treason agst the latter must be so agst the former mr sherman resistance agst the laws of the u states as distinguished from resistance agst the laws of a particular state forms the line mr elseworth the u s are sovereign on one side of the line dividing the jurisdictions—the states on the other—each ought to have power to defend their respective sovereignties mr dickenson war or insurrection agst a member of the union must be so agst the whole body but the constitution should be made clear on this point the clause was reconsidered nem con— then mr wilson  mr elseworth moved to reinstate agst the u s after treason— on which question n h no mass no ct ay n j ay pa no del no md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo ay mr madison was not satisfied with the footing on which the clause now stood as treason agst the u states involves treason agst particular states and vice versa the same act may be twice tried  punished by the different authorities mr govr morris viewed the matter in the same light— it was moved   ded to amend the sentence to read—treason agst the u s shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies which was agreed to col mason moved to insert the words giving     them aid and comfort as restrictive of adhering to their enemies c the latter he thought would be otherwise too indefinite—this motion was agreed to cont del  georgia only being in the negative mr l martin moved to insert after conviction c—or on confession in open court—and on the question the negative states thinking the words superfluous it was agreed to n h ay mass no ct ay n j ay p ay del ay md ay va ay n c divd s c no geo no art vii sect   as amended was then agreed to nem con sect   taken up white

clause that from the first meeting of the legislature of the u s until a census shall be taken all monies for supplying the public treasury by direct taxation shall be raised from the several states according to the number of their representatives respectively in the first branch     mr langdon this would bear unreasonably hard on n h and he must be agst it mr carrol opposed it the number of reps did not admit of a proportion exact enough for a rule of taxation before any question the house adjourned tuesday august    in convention governour livingston  from the committee of eleven to whom was referred the propositions respecting the debts of the several states and also the militia entered on the   th inst delivered the following report the legislature of the u s shall have power to fulfil the engagements which have been entered into by congress and to discharge as well the debts of the u s as the debts incurred by the several states during the late war for the common defence and general welfare to make laws for organizing arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the u s reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the     officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by the u states mr gerry considered giving the power only without adopting the obligation as destroying the security now enjoyed by the public creditors of the u— states he enlarged on the merit of this class of citizens and the solemn faith which had been pledged under the existing confederation if their situation should be changed as here proposed great opposition would be excited agst the plan he urged also that as the states had made different degrees of exertion to sink their respective debts those who had done most would be alarmed if they were now to be saddled with a share of the debts of states which had done least mr sharman it means neither more nor less than the confederation as it relates to this subject mr elseworth moved that the report delivered in by govr livingston should lie on the table—agreed to nem con art vii sect   resumed—mr dickinson moved to postpone this in order to reconsider art iv sect   and to limit the number of representatives to be allowed to the large states unless this were done the small states would be reduced to entire insignificancy and encouragement given to the importation of slaves mr sherman would agree to such a reconsideration but did not see the necessity of postponing the section before the house—mr dickenson withdrew his motion     art vii sect   then agreed to  0 ays delaware alone being no mr sherman moved to add to sect   the following clause and all accounts of supplies furnished services performed and monies advanced by the several states to the u states or by the u s to the several states shall be adjusted by the same rule mr governr morris  ds the motion mr ghorum thought it wrong to insert this in the constitution the legislature will no doubt do what is right the present congress have such a power and are now exercising it mr sherman unless some rule be expressly given none will exist under the new system mr elseworth though the contracts of congress will be binding there will be no rule for executing them on the states and one ought to be provided mr sherman withdrew his motion to make way for one of mr williamson to add to sect   by this rule the several quotas of the states shall be determined in settling the expences of the late war mr carrol brought into view the difficulty that might arise on this subject from the establishment of the constitution as intended without the unanimous consent of the states mr williamsons motion was postponed nem con art vi sect    which had been postponed of aug    was now called for by col mason who wished to know how the proposed amendment as to money bills would be decided before he agreed to any further points     mr gerrys motion of yesterday that previous to a census direct taxation be proportioned on the states according to the number of representatives was taken up he observed that the principal acts of government would probably take place within that period and it was but reasonable that the states should pay in proportion to their share in them mr elseworth thought such a rule unjust there was a great difference between the number of represents and the number of inhabitants as a rule in this case even if the former were proportioned as nearly as possible to the latter it would be a very inaccurate rule a state might have one representative only that had inhabitants enough for  ½ or more if fractions could be applied c— he proposed to amend the motion by adding the words subject to a final liquidation by the foregoing rule when a census shall have been taken mr madison the last appointment of congs on which the number of representatives was founded was conjectural and meant only as a temporary rule till a census should be established mr read the requisitions of congs had been accommodated to the impoverishment produced by the war and to other local and temporary circumstances mr williamson opposed mr gerrys motion mr langdon was not here when n h was allowed three members if it was more than her share he did not wish for them     mr butler contended warmly for mr gerrys motion as founded in reason and equity mr elseworths proviso to mr gerrys motion was agreed to nem con mr king thought the power of taxation given to the legislature rendered the motion of mr gerry

taxation is most likely to be critcisied by the public direct taxation should not be used but in cases of absolute necessity and then the states will be the best judges of the mode he therefore moved the following addition to sect   art vii and whenever the legislature of the u s shall find it necessary that revenue should be raised by direct taxation having apportioned the same according to the above rule on the several states requisitions shall be made of the respective states to pay into the continental treasury their respective quotas within a time in the said requisitions specified and in case of any of the states     failing to comply with such requisitions then and then only to devise and pass acts directing the mode and authorizing the collection of the same mr mc henry  ded the motion—there was no debate and on the question n h no ct no n j ay pena no del no md divd jenifer  carol no va no n c no s c no geo no art vii sect  —mr langdon by this section the states are left at liberty to tax exports n h therefore with other nonexporting states will be subject to be taxed by the states exporting its produce this could not be admitted it seems to be feared that the northern states will oppress the trade of the southn this may be guarded agst by requiring the concurrence of ⅔ or ¾ of the legislature in such cases mr elseworth it is best as it stands the power of regulating trade between the states will protect them agst each other should this not be the case the attempts of one to tax the produce of another passing through its hands will force a direct exportation and defeat themselves there are solid reasons agst congs taxing exports   it will discourage industry as taxes on imports discourage luxury   the produce of different states is such as to prevent uniformity in such taxes there are indeed but a few articles that could be taxed at all as tobo rice  indigo and a tax on these alone would be partial  unjust   the taxing of exports would engender incurable jealousies     mr williamson tho n c has been taxed by virga by a duty on   000 hhs of her tobo exported thro virga yet he would never agree to this power should it take place it would destroy the last hope of an adoption of the plan mr govr morris these local considerations ought not to impede the general interest there is great weight in the argument that the exporting states will tax the produce of their uncommercial neighbours the power of regulating the trade between pa  n jersey will never prevent the former from taxing the latter nor will such a tax force a direct exportation from n jersey the advantages possessed by a large trading city outweigh the disadvantage of a moderate duty and will retain the trade in that channel if no tax can be laid on exports an embargo cannot be laid though in time of war such a measure may be of critical importance tobacco lumber and livestock are three objects belonging to different states of which great advantage might be made by a power to tax exports to these may be added genseng and masts for ships by which a tax might be thrown on other nations the idea of supplying the west indies with lumber from nova scotia is one of the many follies of lord sheffields pamphlets the state of the country also will change and render duties on exports as skins beaver  other peculiar raw materials politic in the view of encouraging american manufactures mr butler was strenuously opposed to a power over exports as unjust and alarming to the staple states   0 mr langdon suggested a prohibition on the states from taxing the produce of other states exported from their harbours mr dickenson the power of taxing exports may be inconvenient at present but it must be of dangerous consequence to prohibit it with respect to all articles and for ever he thought it would be better to except particular articles from the power mr sherman it is best to prohibit the national legislature in all cases the states will never give up all power over trade an enumeration of particular articles would be difficult invidious and improper mr madison as we ought to be governed by national and permanent views it is a sufficient argument for giving ye power over exports that a tax tho it may not be expedient at present may be so hereafter a porper regulation of exports may  probably will be necessary hereafter and for the same purposes as the regulation of imports viz for revenue—domestic manufactures—and procuring equitable regulations from other nations an embargo may be of absolute necessity and can alone be effectuated by the genl authority the regulation of trade between state and state cannot effect more than indirectly to hinder a state from taxing its own exports by authorizing its citizens to carry their commodities freely into a neighbouring state which might decline taxing exports in order to draw into its channel the trade of its neighbours as to the fear of disproportionate burthens on the more exporting states it might be remarked that it was     agreed on all hands that the revenue wd principally be drawn from trade and as only a given revenue would be needed it was not material whether all should be drawn wholly from imports—or half from those and half from exports the imports and exports must be pretty nearly equal in every state—and relatively the same among the different states mr elseworth did not conceive an embargo by the congress interdicted by this section mr mchenry conceived that power to be included in the power of war mr wilson pennsylvania exports the produce of maryd n jersey delaware  will by  by when the river delaware is opened export for n york in favoring the general power over exports therefore he opposed the particular interest of his state he remarked that the power had been attacked by reasoning which could only have held good in case the genl govt had been compelled instead of authorized to lay duties on exports to deny this power is to take from the common govt half the regulation of trade it was his opinion that a power over exports might be more effectual than that over imports in obtaining beneficial treaties of commerce mr gerry was strenuously opposed to the power over exports it might be made use of to compel the states to comply with the will of the genl government and to grant it any new powers which might be demanded we have given it more power already than we know how will be exercised     it will enable the genl govt to oppress the states as much as ireland is oppressed by great britain mr fitzimmons  would be agst a tax on exports to be laid immediately but was for giving a power of laying the tax when a proper time may call for it this would certainly be the case when america should become a manufacturing country he illustrated his argument by the duties in g britain on wool c col mason if he were for reducing the states to mere corporations as seemed to be the tendency of some arguments he should be for subjecting their exports as well as imports to a power of general taxation he went on a principle often advanced  in which he concurred that a majority when interested will oppress the minority this maxim had been verified by our own legislature of virginia if we compare the states in this point of view the   northern states have an interest different from the five southn states and have in one branch of the legislature    votes agst    and in the other in the proportion of   agst   the southern states had therefore ground for their suspicions the case of exports was not the same with that of imports the latter were the same throughout the states the former very different as to tobacco other nations do raise it and are capable of raising it as well as virga c the impolicy of taxing that article had been demonstrated by the experiment of virginia     mr clymer  remarked that every state might reason with regard to its particular productions in the same manner as the southern states the middle states may apprehend an oppression of their wheat flour provisions c and with more reason as these articles were exposed to a competition in foreign markets not incident to tobo rice c they may apprehend also combinations agst them between the eastern  southern states as much as the latter can apprehend them between the eastern  middle he moved as a qualification of the power of taxing exports that it should be restrained to regulations of trade by inserting after the word duty sect   art vii the words for the purpose of revenue on question on mr clymers motion n h no mass no ct no n j ay pa ay del ay md no va no n c no s c no geo no mr madison in order to require ⅔ of each house to tax exports as a lesser evil than a total prohibition moved to insert the words

genl w  j m no n c ay s c ay geo ay mr l martin proposed to vary the sect   art vii so as to allow a prohibition or tax on the importation of slaves   as five slaves are to be counted as   free men in the apportionment of representatives such a clause would leave an encouragement to this trafic   slaves weakened one part of the union which the other parts were bound to protect the privilege of importing them was therefore unreasonable   it was inconsistent with the principles of the revolution and dishonorable to the american character to have such a feature in the constitution mr rutlidge did not see how the importation of slaves could be encouraged by this section he was not apprehensive of insurrections and would readily exempt the other states from the obligation to protect the southern against them religion  humanity had nothing to do with this question interest alone is the governing principle with nations the true question at present is whether the southn states shall or shall not be parties to the union if the northern states consult their interest they will not oppose the increase of slaves which will increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers mr elseworth was for leaving the clause as it stands let every state import what it pleases the     morality or wisdom of slavery are considerations belonging to the states themselves what enriches a part enriches the whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest the old confederation had not meddled with this point and he did not see any greater necessity for bringing it within the policy of the new one mr pinkney south carolina can never receive the plan if it prohibits the slave trade in every proposed extension of the powers of congress that state has expressly  watchfully excepted that of meddling with the importation of negroes if the states be all left at liberty on this subject s carolina may perhaps by degrees do of herself what is wished as virginia  maryland already have done adjourned wednesday august    in convention art vii sect   resumed mr sherman was for leaving the clause as it stands he disapproved of the slave trade yet as the states were now possessed of the right to import slaves as the public good did not require it to be taken from them  as it was expedient to have as few objections as possible to the proposed scheme of government he thought it best to leave the matter as we find it he observed that the abolition of slavery seemed to be going on in the u s  that the good sense of the several states would probably by degrees compleat     it he urged on the convention the necessity of despatching its business col mason this infernal traffic originated in the avarice of british merchants the british govt constantly checked the attempts of virginia to put a stop to it the present question concerns not the importing states alone but the whole union the evil of having slaves was experienced during the late war had slaves been treated as they might have been by the enemy they would have proved dangerous instruments in their hands but their folly dealt by the slaves as it did by the tories he mentioned the dangerous insurrections of the slaves in greece and sicily and the instructions given by cromwell to the commissioners sent to virginia to arm the servants  slaves in case other means of obtaining its submission should fail maryland  virginia he said had already prohibited the importation of slaves expressly n carolina had done the same in substance all this would be in vain if s carolina  georgia be at liberty to import the western people are already calling out for slaves for their new lands and will fill that country with slaves if they can be got thro s carolina  georgia slavery discourages arts  manufactures the poor despise labor when performed by slaves they prevent the immigration of whites who really enrich  strengthen a country they produce the most pernicious effect on manners every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant they bring the judgment of heaven on a country as nations can not     be rewarded or punished in the next world they must be in this by an inevitable chain of causes  effects providence punishes national sins by national calamities he lamented that some of our eastern brethren had from a lust of gain embarked in this nefarious traffic as to the states being in possession of the right to import this was the case with many other rights now to be properly given up he held it essential in every point of view that the genl govt should have power to prevent the increase of slavery mr elseworth as he had never owned a slave could not judge of the effects of slavery on character he said however that if it was to be considered in a moral light we ought to go farther and free those already in the country—as slaves also multiply so fast in virginia  maryland that it is cheaper to raise than import them whilst in the sickly rice swamps foreign supplies are necessary if we go no farther than is urged we shall be unjust towards s carolina  georgia let us not intermeddle as population increases poor laborers will be so plenty as to render slaves useless slavery in time will not be a speck in our country provision is already made in connecticut for abolishing it and the abolition has already taken place in massachusetts as to the danger of insurrections from foreign influence that will become a motive to kind treatment of the slaves mr pinkney if slavery be wrong it is justified by the example of all the world he cited the case     of greece rome  other antient states the sanction given by france england holland  other modern states in all ages one half of mankind have been slaves if the s states were let alone they will probably of themselves stop importations he wd himself as a citizen of s carolina vote for it an attempt to take away the right as proposed will produce serious objections to the constitution which he wished to see adopted general pinkney declared it to be his firm opinion that if himself  all his colleagues were to sign the constitution  use their personal influence it would be of no avail towards obtaining the assent of their constituents s carolina  georgia cannot do without slaves as to virginia she will gain by stopping the importations her slaves will rise in value  she has more than she wants it would be unequal to require s c  georgia to confederate on such unequal terms he said the royal assent before the revolution had never been refused to s carolina as to virginia he contended that the importation of slaves would be for the interest of the whole union the more slaves the more produce to employ the carrying trade the more consumption also and the more of this the more revenue for the common treasury he admitted it to be reasonable that slaves should be dutied like other imports but should consider a rejection of the clause as an exclusion of s carola from the union mr baldwin had conceived national objects alone to be before the convention not such as like the     present were of a local nature georgia was decided on this point that state has always hitherto supposed a genl governmt to be the pursuit of the central states who wished to have a vortex for every thing—that her distance would preclude her from equal advantage— that she could not prudently purchase it by yielding national powers from this it might be understood in what light she would view an attempt to abridge one of her favorite prerogatives if left to herself she may probably put a stop to the evil as one ground for this conjecture he took notice of the sect of — which he said was a respectable class of people who carried their ethics beyond the mere equality of men extending their humanity to the claims of the whole animal creation mr wilson observed that if s c  georgia were themselves disposed to get rid of the importation of slaves in a short time as had been suggested they would never refuse to unite because the importation might be prohibited as the section now stands all articles imported are to be taxed slaves alone are exempt this is in fact a bounty on that article mr gerry thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the states as to slaves but ought to be careful not to give any sanction to it mr dickenson considered it as inadmissible on every principle of honor  safety that the importation of slaves should be authorized to the states by the constitution the true question was whether   0 the national happiness would be promoted or impeded by the importation and this question ought to be left to the national govt not to the states particularly interested if engd  france permit slavery slaves are at the same time excluded from both those kingdoms greece and rome were made unhappy by their slaves he could not believe that the southn states would refuse to confederate on the account apprehended especially as the power was not likely to be immediately exercised by the genl government mr williamson stated the law of n carolina on the subject towit that it did not directly prohibit the importation of slaves it imposed a duty of £  on each slave imported from africa £ 0 on each from elsewhere  £ 0 on each from a state licensing manumission he thought the s states could not be members of the union if the clause shd be rejected and that it was wrong to force any thing down not absolutely necessary and which any state must disagree to mr king thought the subject should be considered in a political light only if two states will not agree to the constitution as stated on one side he could affirm with equal belief on the other that great  equal opposition would be experienced from the other states he remarked on the exemption of slaves from duty whilst every other import was subjected to it as an inequality that could not fail to strike the commercial sagacity of the northn  middle states     mr langdon was strenuous for giving the power to the genl govt he cd not with a good conscience leave it with the states who could then go on with the traffic without being restrained by the opinions here given that they will themselves cease to import slaves genl pinkney thought himself bound to declare candidly that he did not think s carolina would stop her importations of slaves in any short time but only stop them occasionally as she now does he moved to commit the clause that slaves might be made liable to an equal tax with other imports which he thought right  wch wd remove one difficulty that had been started mr rutlidge if the convention thinks that n c s c  georgia will ever agree to the plan unless their right to import slaves be untouched the expectation is vain the people of those states will never be such fools as to give up so important an interest he was strenuous agst striking out the section and seconded the motion of genl pinkney for a commitment mr govr morris wished the whole subject to be committed including the clauses relating to taxes on exports  to a navigation act these things may form a bargain among the northern  southern states mr butler declared that he never would agree to the power of taxing exports mr sherman said it was better to let the s states import slaves than to part with them if they made     that a sine qua non he was opposed to a tax on slaves imported as making the matter worse because it implied they were property he acknowledged that if the power of prohibiting the importation should be given to the genl government that it would be exercised he thought it would be its duty to exercise the power mr read was for the commitment provided the clause concerning taxes on exports should also be committed mr sherman observed that that clause had been agreed to  therefore could not be committed mr randolph was for committing in order that some middle ground might if possible be found he could never agree to the clause as it stands he wd sooner risk the constitution he dwelt on the dilemma to which the convention was exposed by agreeing to the clause it would revolt the quakers the methodists and many others in the states having no slaves on the other hand two states might be lost to the union let us then he said try the chance of a commitment on the question for committing the remaining part of sect      of art   n h no mass

of it is it meant to require a greater proportion of votes he desired it to be remembered that the eastern states     had no motive to union but a commercial one they were able to protect themselves they were not afraid of external danger and did not need the aid of the southn states mr wilson wished for a commitment in order to reduce the proportion of votes required mr elseworth was for taking the plan as it is this widening of opinions has a threatening aspect if we do not agree on this middle  moderate ground he was afraid we should lose two states with such others as may be disposed to stand aloof should fly into a variety of shapes  directions and most probably into several confederations and not without bloodshed on question for committing   sect as to navigation act to a member

at the end of the first clause of the first section of the seventh article add for payment of the debts and necessary expenses of the united states provided that no law for raising any branch of revenue except what may be specially appropriated for the payment of interest on debts or loans shall continue in force for more than — years at the end of the second clause second section seventh

necessary from time to time for the well managing and securing the common property and general interests and welfare of the united states in such manner as shall not interfere with the governments of individual states in matters which respect only their internal police or for which their individual authority may be competent at the end of the first section tenth article add he shall be of the age

section  the president of the united states shall have a privy council which shall consist of the president of the senate the speaker of the house of representatives     the chief justice of the supreme court and the principal officer in the respective departments of foreign affairs domestic affairs war marine and finance as such departments of office shall from time to time be established

house of representatives between the fourth and fifth lines of the third section of the eleventh article after the word controversies insert between the united states and an individual state or the

and mr mchenry moved to insert after the  d sect art   the clause following to wit the legislature shall pass no bill of attainder nor any ex post facto law  mr gerry urged the necessity of this prohibition     which he said was greater in the national than the state legislature because the number of members in the former being fewer they were on that account the more to be feared mr govr morris thought the precaution as to ex post facto laws unnecessary but essential as to bills of attainder mr elseworth contended that there was no lawyer no civilian who would not say that ex post facto laws were void of themselves it cannot then be necessary to prohibit them mr wilson was against inserting any thing in the constitution as to ex post facto laws it will bring reflextions on the constitution—and proclaim that we are ignorant of the first principles of legislation or are constituting a government that will be so the question being divided the first part of the motion relating to bills of attainder was agreed to nem contradicente on the second part relating to ex post facto laws— mr carrol remarked that experience overruled all other calculations it had proved that in whatever light they might be viewed by civilians or others the state legislatures had passed them and they had taken effect mr wilson if these prohibitions in the state constitutions have no effect it will be useless to insert them in this constitution besides both sides will agree to the principle and will differ as to its application mr williamson such a prohibitory clause is in     the constitution of n carolina and tho it has been violated it has done good there  may do good here because the judges can take hold of it docr johnson thought the clause unnecessary and implying an improper suspicion of the national legislature mr rutlidge was in favor of the clause on the question for inserting the prohibition of ex post facto laws n h ay mas ay cont no n j no pa no del ay md

of eleven delivered in  entered on the journal of the   st inst was then taken up and the first clause containing the words the legislature of the u s shall have power to fulfil the engagements which have been entered into by congress being under consideration mr elseworth argued that they were unnecessary the u s heretofore entered into engagements by congs who were their agents they will hereafter be bound to fulfil them by their new agents mr randolph thought such a provision necessary for though the u states will be bound the new govt will have no authority in the case unless it be given to them mr madison thought it necessary to give the authority in order to prevent misconstruction he     mentioned the attempts made by the debtors to british subjects to shew that contracts under the old government were dissolved by the revolution which destroyed the political identity of the society mr gerry thought it essential that some explicit provision should be made on this subject so that no pretext might remain for getting rid of the public engagements mr govr morris moved by way of amendment to substitute—the legislature shall discharge the debts  fulfil the engagements of the u states it was moved to vary the amendment by striking out discharge the debts  to insert liquidate the claims which being negatived the amendment moved by mr govr morris was agreed to all the states being in the affirmative it was moved   ded to strike the following words out of the  d clause of the report and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by the u s before a question was taken the house adjourned thursday in convention aug         the report of the committee of eleven made aug    being taken up and the following clause being under consideration to wit to make laws for organizing arming  disciplining the militia and for governing such parts of them as may be employed     in the service of the u s reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed mr sherman moved to strike out the last member and authority of training c he thought it unnecessary the states will have this authority of course if not given up mr elseworth doubted the propriety of striking out the sentence the reason assigned applies as well to the other reservation of the appointment to offices he remarked at the same time that the term discipline was of vast extent and might be so expounded as to include all power on the subject mr king by way of explanation said that by organizing the committee meant proportioning the officers  men—by arming specifying the kind size  caliber of arms— by disciplining prescribing the manual exercise evolutions c mr sherman withdrew his motion mr gerry this power in the u s as explained is making the states drillsergeants he had as lief let the citizens of massachusetts be disarmed as to take the command from the states and subject them to the genl legislature it would be regarded as a system of despotism mr madison observed that arming as explained did not extend to furnishing arms nor the term disciplining to penalties  courts martial for enforcing them mr king added to his former explanation that   0 arming meant not only to provide for uniformity of arms but included the authority to regulate the modes of furnishing either by the militia themselves the state governments or the national treasury that laws for disciplining must involve penalties and every thing necessary for enforcing penalties mr dayton moved to postpone the paragraph in order to take up the following proposition to establish an uniform  general system of discipline for the militia of these states and to make laws for organizing arming disciplining  governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the u s reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and all authority over the militia not herein given to the general government on the question to postpone in favor of this proposition it passed in the negative n h no mas no ct no n j ay p no del no maryd ay va no n c no s c no geo ay mr elseworth  mr sherman moved to postpone the  d clause in favor of the following to establish an uniformity of arms exercise  organization for the militia and to provide for the government of them when called into the service of the u states the object of this proposition was to refer the plan for the militia to the general govt but to leave the execution of it to the state govts     mr langdon said he could not understand the jealousy expressed by some gentlemen the general  state govts were not enemies to each other but different institutions for the good of the people of america as one of the people he could say the national govt is mine the state govt is mine in transferring power from one to the other i only take out of my left hand what it cannot so well use and put it into my right hand where it can be better used mr gerry thought it was rather taking out of the right hand  putting it into the left will any man say that liberty will be as safe in the hands of eighty or a hundred men taken from the whole continent as in the hands of two or three hundred taken from a single state mr dayton was against so absolute a uniformity in some states there ought to be a greater proportion of cavalry than in others in some places rifles would be most proper in others muskets c genl pinkney preferred the clause reported by the committee extending the meaning of it to the case of fines c mr madison the primary object is to secure an effectual discipline of the militia this will no more be done if left to the states separately than the requisitions have been hitherto paid by them the states neglect their militia now and the more they are consolidated into one nation the less each will rely on its own interior provisions for its safety  the less prepare its militia for that purpose in like     manner as the militia of a state would have been still more neglected than it has been if each county had been independently charged with the care of its militia the discipline of the militia is evidently a national concern and ought to be provided for in the national constitution mr l martin was confident that the states would never give up the power over the militia and that if they were to do so the militia would be less attended to by the genl than by the state governments mr randolph asked what danger there could be that the militia could be brought into the field and made to commit suicide on themselves this is a power that cannot from its nature be abused unless indeed the whole mass should be corrupted he was for trammelling the genl govt whenever there was danger but here there could be none he urged this as an essential point observing that the militia were every where neglected by the state legislatures the members of which courted popularity too much to enforce a proper discipline leaving the appointment of officers to the states protects the people agst every apprehension that could produce murmur on question on mr elsworths motion n h no mass no ct ay n j no pa no del no md no va no n c no s c no geo no a motion was then made to recommit the  d clause which was negatived     on the question to agree to the

ay del ay md no va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr madison moved to amend the next part of the clause so as to read reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers under the rank of general officers mr sherman considered this as absolutely inadmissible he said that if the people should be so far asleep as to allow the most influential officers of the militia to be appointed by the genl government every man of discernment would rouse them by sounding the alarm to them mr gerry let us at once destroy the state govts have an executive for life or hereditary and a proper senate and then there would be some consistency in giving full powers to the genl govt but as the states are not to be abolished he wondered at the attempts that were made to give powers inconsistent with their existence he warned the convention agst pushing the experiment too far some people will support a plan of vigorous government at every risk others of a more democratic cast will oppose it with equal determination and a civil war may be produced by the conflict mr madison as the greatest danger is that of     disunion of the states it is necessary to guard agst it by sufficient powers to the common govt and as the greatest danger to liberty is from large standing armies it is best to prevent them by an effectual provision for a good militia on the question to agree to mr madisons motion n

office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state which passed nem contrad     mr rutlidge moved to amend art viii to read as follows this constitution  the laws of the u s made in pursuance thereof and all the treaties made under the authority of the u s shall be the supreme law of the several states and of their citizens and inhabitants and the judges in the several states shall be bound thereby in their decisions any thing in the constitutions or laws of the several states to the contrary notwithstanding which was agreed to nem contrad art ix being next for consideration mr govr morris argued agst the appointment of officers by the senate he considered the body as too numerous for the purpose as subject to cabal and as devoid of responsibility if judges were to be tried by the senate according to a late report of a committee it was particularly wrong to let the senate have the filling of vacancies which its own decrees were to create mr wilson was of the same opinion  for like reasons the art ix being waved and art vii sect   resumed mr govr morris moved to strike the following words out of the    clause enforce treaties as being superfluous since treaties were to be laws—which was agreed to nem contrad mr govr morris moved to alter  st part of    clause sect   art vii so as to read to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the     union suppress insurrections and repel invasions—which was agreed to nem contrad on the question then to agree to the    clause of sect   art   as amended it passed in the affirmative nem contrad mr c pinkney moved to add as an additional power to be vested in the legislature of the u s to negative all laws passed by the several states interfering in the opinion of the legislature with the general interests and harmony of the union provided that two thirds of the members of each house assent to the same this principle he observed had formerly been agreed to he considered the precaution as essentially necessary the objection drawn from the predominance of the large states had been removed by the equality established in the senate  mr broome  ded the proposition mr sherman thought it unnecessary the laws of the general government being supreme  paramount to the state laws according to the plan as it now stands mr madison proposed that it should be committed he had been from the beginning a friend to the principle     but thought the modification might be made better mr mason wished to know how the power was to be exercised are all laws whatever to be brought up is no road nor bridge to be established without the sanction of the general legislature is this to sit constantly in order to receive  revise the state laws—he did not mean by these remarks to condemn the expedient but he was apprehensive that great objections would lie agst it mr williamson thought it unnecessary having been already decided a revival of the question was a waste of time mr wilson considered this as the keystone wanted to compleat the wide arch of government we are raising the power of selfdefence had been urged as necessary for the state governments it was equally necessary for the general government the firmness of judges is not of itself sufficient something further is requisite it will be better to prevent the passage of an improper law than to declare it void when passed mr rutlidge if nothing else this alone would damn and ought to damn the constitution will any state ever agree to be bound hand  foot in this manner it is worse than making mere corporations of them whose bye laws would not be subject to this shackle mr elseworth observed that the power contended for wd require either that all laws of the state legislatures should previously to their taking effect be     transmitted to the genl legislature or be repealable by the latter or that the state executives should be appointed by the genl government and have a controul over the state laws if the last was meditated let it be declared mr pinkney declared that he thought the state executives ought to be so appointed with such a controul  that it would be so provided if another convention should take place mr governr morris did not see the utility or practicability of the proposition of mr pinkney but wished it to be referred to the consideration of a committee mr langdon was in favor of the proposition he considered it as resolvable into the question whether the extent of the national constitution was to be judged of by the genl or the state governments on the question for commitment it passed in the negative n h ay massts no cont no n j no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c no s c no geo no mr pinkney then withdrew his proposition the  st sect of art vii being so amended as to read the legislature shall fulfil the engagements and discharge the debts of the u s  shall have the power to lay  collect taxes duties imposts  excises was agreed to mr butler expressed his dissatisfaction lest it should compel payment as well to the bloodsuckers who had speculated on the distresses of others as to     those who had fought  bled for their country he would be ready he said tomorrow to vote for a discrimination between those classes of people and gave notice that he should move for a reconsideration art ix sect   being resumed to wit the senate of the u s shall have power to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and judges of the supreme court mr madison observed that the senate represented the states alone and that for this as well as other obvious reasons it was proper that the president should be an agent in treaties mr govr morris did not know that he should agree to refer the making of treaties to the senate at all but for the present wd move to add as an amendment to the section after treaties—but no treaty shall be binding on the u s which is not ratified by a law mr madison suggested the inconvenience of requiring a legal ratification of treaties of alliance for the purposes of war c c mr ghorum many other disadvantages must be experienced if treaties of peace  all negotiations are to be previously ratified—and if not previously the ministers would be at a loss how to proceed what would be the case in g britain if the king were to proceed in this manner american ministers must go abroad not instructed by the same authority as will be the case with other ministers which is to ratify their proceedings   0 mr govr morris as to treaties of alliance they will oblige foreign powers to send their ministers here the very thing we should wish for such treaties could not be otherwise made if his amendment shd succeed in general he was not solicitious to multiply  facilitate treaties he wished none to be made with g britain till she should be at war then a good bargain might be made with her so with other foreign powers the more difficulty in making treaties the more value will be set on them mr wilson in the most important treaties the king of g britain being obliged to resort to parliament for the execution of them is under the same fetters as the amendment of mr morris will impose on the senate it was refused yesterday to permit even the legisature to lay duties on exports under the clause without the amendment the senate alone can make a treaty requiring all the rice of s carolina to be sent to some one particular port mr dickinson concurred in the amendment as most safe and proper tho he was sensible it was unfavorable to the little states wch would otherwise have an equal share in making treaties docr johnson thought there was something of solecism in saying that the acts of a minister with plenipotentiary powers from one body should depend for ratification on another body the example of the king of g b was not parallel full  compleat power was vested in him if the parliament should fail to provide the necessary means of execution the treaty would be violated     mr ghorum in answer to mr govr morris said that negotiations on the spot were not to be desired by us especially if the whole legislature is to have any thing to do with treaties it will be generally influenced by two or three men who will be corrupted by the ambassadors here in such a government as ours it is necessary to guard against the government itself being seduced mr randolph observing that almost every speaker had made objections to the clause as it stood moved in order to a further consideration of the subject that the motion of mr govr morris should be postponed and on this question it was lost the states being equally divided massts no cont no n j ay pena ay del ay md ay va ay n c no s c no geo no on mr govr morris motion massts no cont no n j no pa ay del no md no va no n c divd s c no geo no the several clauses

different sorts of treaties—allowing the president  senate to make treaties eventual and of alliance for limited terms—and requiring the concurrence of the whole legislature in other treaties the  st sect art ix was finally referred nem con to the committee of five and the house then adjourned     friday august         in convention governour livingston from the committee of eleven to whom were

notice moved that clause  st sect   of art vii as to the discharge of debts be reconsidered tomorrow he dwelt on the division of opinion concerning the domestic debts and the different pretensions of

mr rutlidge said this provision for deciding controversies     between the states was necessary under the confederation but will be rendered unnecessary by the national judiciary now to be established and moved to strike it out docr johnson  ded the motion mr sherman concurred so did mr dayton mr williamson was for postponing instead of striking out in order to consider whether this might not be a good provision in cases where the judiciary were interested or too closely connected with the parties mr ghorum had doubts as to striking out the judges might be connected with the states being parties—he was inclined to think the mode proposed in the clause would be more satisfactory than to refer such cases to the judiciary on the question for postponing the  d   d section it passed in the

elected a second time on the question for vesting the power in a single person—it was agreed to nem con so also on the stile and title mr rutlidge moved to insert joint before the word ballot as the most convenient mode of electing mr sherman objected to it as depriving the states represented in the senate of the negative intended them in that house mr ghorum said it was wrong to be considering at every turn whom the senate would represent the public good was the true object to be kept in view great delay and confusion would ensue if the two houses shd vote separately each having a negative on the choice of the other mr dayton it might be well for those not to consider how the senate was constituted whose interest it was to keep it out of sight—if the amendment should be agreed to a joint ballot would in fact give the appointment to one house he could never agree to the clause with such an amendment there could be no doubt of the two houses separately concurring in the same person for president the importance  necessity of the case would ensure a concurrence mr carrol moved to strike out by the legislature and insert by the people mr wilson  ded him  on the question

hands into the pockets of the large ones did not apply in this case mr wilson urged the reasonableness of giving the larger states a larger share of the appointment and the danger of delay from a disagreement of the two houses he remarked also that the senate had peculiar powers balancing the advantage given by a joint ballot in this case to the other branch of the legislature mr langdon this general officer ought to be elected by the joint  general voice in n hampshire the mode of separate votes by the two houses was productive of great difficulties the negative of the senate would hurt the feelings of the man elected by the votes of the other branch he was for inserting joint tho unfavorable to n hampshire as a small state mr wilson remarked that as the president of the senate was to be the president of the u s that body in cases of vacancy might have an interest in throwing dilatory obstacles in the way if its separate concurrence should be required mr madison if the amendment be agreed to the rule of voting will give to the largest state compared with the smallest an influence as   to   only altho the population is as  0 to   this surely cannot     be unreasonable as the president is to act for the people not for the states the president of the senate also is to be occasionally president of the u s and by his negative alone can make ¾ of the other branch necessary to

on the danger of rendering the executive uninterested in maintaining the rights of his station as leading to legislative tyranny if the legislature have the executive dependent on them they can perpetuate  support their usurpations by the influence of taxgatherers  other officers by fleets armies c cabal  corruption are attached to that mode of election so also is ineligibility a second time hence the executive is interested in courting popularity in the legislature by sacrificing his executive rights  then he can go into that body after the expiration of his executive office and enjoy there the fruits of his policy to these considerations he added that rivals would be continually intriguing to oust the president from his place to guard against all these evils he moved that the

with it the creditors should be kept in the same plight they will in one respect be necessarily and properly in a better the government will be more able to pay them the use of the term shall will beget speculations and increase the pestilent practice of stockjobbing there was a great distinction between original creditors  those who purchased fraudulently of the ignorant and distressed he did not mean to include those who have bought stock in open market he was sensible of the difficulty of drawing the line in this case but he did not  0  wish to preclude the attempt even fair purchasers at         for   did not stand on the same footing with the first holders supposing them not to be blameable the interest they receive even in paper is equal to their purchase money what he particularly wished was to leave the door open for buying up the securities which he thought would be precluded by the term shall as requiring nominal payment  which was not inconsistent with his ideas of public faith he was afraid also the word shall might extend to all the old continental paper mr langdon wished to do no more than leave the creditors in statu quo mr gerry said that for himself he had no interest in the question being not possessed of more of the securities than would by the interest pay his taxes he would observe however that as the public had received the value of the literal amount they ought to pay that value to some body the frauds on the soldiers ought to have been foreseen these poor  ignorant people could not but part with their securities there are other creditors who will part with any thing rather than be cheated of the capital of their advances the interest of the states he observed was different on this point some having more others less than their proportion of the paper hence the idea of a scale for reducing its value had arisen if the public faith would admit of which he was not clear he would not object to a revision of the debt so far as to compel restitution to the ignorant  distressed who have been defrauded as to  0  stockjobbers he saw no reason for the censures thrown on them they keep up the value of the paper without them there would be no market mr butler said he meant neither to increase nor diminish the security of the creditors mr randolph moved to postpone the clause in favor of the following all debts contracted  engagements entered into by or under the authority of congs shall be as valid agst the u states under this constitution as under the confederation docr johnson the debts are debts of the u s of the great body of america changing the government cannot change the obligation of the u s which devolves of course on the new government nothing was in his opinion necessary to be said if any thing it should be a mere declaration as moved by mr randolph mr govr morris said he never had become a public creditor that he might urge with more propriety the compliance with public faith he had always done so and always would and preferrd the term shall as the most explicit as to buying up the debt the term shall was not inconsistent with it if provision be first made for paying the interest if not such an expedient was a mere evasion he was content to say nothing as the new government would be bound of course but would prefer the clause with the term shall because it would create many friends

mr ghorum  ded the motion mr madison twenty years will produce all the mischief that can be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves so long a term will be more dishonourable to the national character than to say nothing about it in the constitution on the motion which passed in the affirmative n h ay mas ay ct ay n j no pa no del no md ay va no n c ay s c ay geo ay mr govr morris was for making the clause read at once the importation of slaves into n carolina s carolina  georgia shall not be prohibited c this he said would be most fair and would avoid the  0  ambiguity by which under the power with regard to naturalization the liberty reserved to the states might be defeated he wished it to be known also that this part of the constitution was a compliance with those states if the change of language however should be objected to by the members from those states he should not urge it col mason was not against using the term slaves but agst naming n c s c  georgia lest it should give offence to the people of those states mr sherman liked a description better than the terms proposed which had been declined by the old congs  were not pleasing to some people mr clymer concurred with mr sherman mr williamson said that both in opinion  practice he was against slavery but thought it more in favor of humanity from a view of all circumstances to let in s c  georgia on those terms than to exclude them from the union mr govr morris withdrew his motion mr dickenson wished the clause to be confined to the states which had not themselves prohibited the importation of slaves and for that purpose moved to amend the clause so as to read the importation of slaves into such of the states as shall permit the same shall not be prohibited by the legislature of the u s until the year   0

part as acknowledging men to be property by taxing them as such under the character of slaves mr king  mr langdon considered this as the price of the  st part genl pinkney admitted that it was so col mason not to tax will be equivalent to a bounty on the importation of slaves mr ghorum thought that mr sherman should consider the duty not as implying that slaves are property but as a discouragement to the importation of them mr govr morris remarked that as the clause now stands it implies that the legislature may tax freemen imported mr sherman in answer to mr ghorum observed that the smallness of the duty shewed revenue to be the object not the discouragement of the importation mr madison thought it wrong to admit in the  0  constitution the idea that there could be property in men the reason of duties did not hold as slaves are not like merchandize consumed c col mason in answr to govr morris the provision as it stands was necessary for the case of convicts in order to prevent the introduction of them it was finally agreed nem contrad to make the clause read but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person and then the  d part as

the words all treaties made were inserted nem con the words or which shall be made this insertion was meant to obviate all doubt concerning the force of treaties preexisting by making the words all treaties made to refer to them as the words inserted would refer to future treaties mr carrol and mr l martin expressed their apprehensions and the probable apprehensions of their constituents that under the power of regulating trade the general legislature might favor the ports of particular states by requiring vessels destined to or from other states to enter  clear thereat as vessels belonging or bound to baltimore to enter  clear at norfolk c they moved the following proposition  0  the legislature of the u s shall not oblige vessels belonging to citizens thereof or to foreigners to enter or pay duties or imposts in any other state than in that to which they may be bound or to clear out in any other than the state in which their cargoes may be laden on board nor shall any privilege or immunity be granted to any vessel on entering or clearing out or paying duties or imposts in one state in preference to another mr ghorum thought such a precaution unnecessary  that the revenue might be defeated if vessels could run up long rivers through the jurisdiction of different states without being required to enter with the opportunity of landing  selling their cargoes by the way mr mchenry  genl pinkney made the following propositions should it be judged expedient by the legislature of the u s that one or more port for collecting duties or imposts other than those ports of entrance  clearance already established by the respective states should be established the legislature of the u s shall signify the same to the executives of the respective states ascertaining the number of such ports judged necessary to be laid by the said executives before the legislatures of the states at their next session and the legislature of the u s shall not have the power of fixing or establishing the particular ports for collecting duties or imposts in any state except the legislature of such state shall neglect to fix and establish the same during their first session to be  0

president and suggested a designation of the chief justice mr madison added as a ground of objection that the senate might retard the appointment of a president in order to carry points whilst the revisionary power was in the president of their own body but suggested that the executive powers during a vacancy be administered by the persons composing the council to the president mr williamson suggested that the legislature ought to have power to provide for occasional successors  moved that the last clause of   sect x art relating to a provisional successor to the president be postponed mr

offices during good behavior and yet be removeable without a trial besides it was fundamentally wrong to subject judges to so arbitrary an authority mr sherman saw no contradiction or impropriety if this were made a part of the constitutional regulation of the judiciary establishment he observed that a like provision was contained in the british statutes mr rutlidge if the supreme court is to judge between the u s and particular states this alone is an insuperable objection to the motion mr wilson considered such a provision in the british government as less dangerous than here the house of lords  house of commons being less likely to concur on the same occasions chief justice holt he remarked had successively offended by his independent conduct both houses of parliament had this happened at the same time he would have been ousted the judges would be in a bad situation if made to depend on any gust of faction which might prevail in the two branches of our govt mr randolph opposed the motion as weakening too much the independence of the judges mr dickinson was not apprehensive that the legislature composed of different branches constructed on such different principles

contended strenuously for the motion there was no weight he said in the argument drawn from changes in the value of the metals because this might be provided for by an increase of salaries so made as not to affect persons in office and this was the only argument on which much stress seemed to have been laid genl pinkney the importance of the judiciary will require men of the first talents large salaries will therefore be necessary larger than the u s can allow in the first instance he was not satisfied with the expedient mentioned by col mason he did not think it would have a good effect or a good appearance for new judges to come in with higher salaries than the old ones mr govr morris said the expedient might be evaded  therefore amounted to nothing judges might resign  then be

the object of this amendment was to provide for trial by jury of offences committed out of any state mr pinkney urged the propriety of securing the benefit of the habeas corpus in the most ample manner moved that it should not be suspended but on the most urgent occasions  then only for a limited time not exceeding twelve months mr rutlidge was for declaring the habeas corpus inviolable he did not conceive that a suspension could ever be necessary at the same time through all the states mr govr morris moved that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless where in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it mr wilson doubted whether in any case a suspension could be necessary as the discretion now exists with judges in most

mr ghorum thought the purpose would be as well secured by the provisions of art xiii which makes the consent of the genl legislature necessary and that in that mode no opposition would be excited whereas an absolute prohibition of paper money would rouse the most desperate opposition from its partizans mr sherman thought this a favorable crisis for crushing paper money if the consent of the legislature could authorize emissions of it the friends of paper money would make every exertion to get into the legislature in order to license it the question being divided on the  st part—nor emit

in the ordinance of congr establishing new states a prohibition on the states to interfere in private contracts mr govr morris this would be going too far there are a thousand laws relating to bringing actions—limitations of actions  which affect contracts the judicial power of the u s will be a protection in cases within their jurisdiction and within the state itself a majority must rule whatever may be the mischief done among themselves mr sherman why then prohibit bills of credit mr wilson was in favor of mr kings motion mr madison admitted that inconveniences might arise from such a prohibition but thought on the whole it would be overbalanced by the utility of it he conceived however that a negative on the state laws could alone secure the effect evasions might and would be devised by the ingenuity of the legislatures col mason this is carrying the restraint too far cases will happen that cannot be foreseen where some kind of interference will be proper  essential he mentioned the case of limiting the period for bringing actions on open account—that of bonds after a certain lapse of time—asking whether it was proper to tie the hands of the states from making provision in such cases mr wilson the answer to these objections is that retrospective interferences only are to be prohibited mr madison is not that already done by the   0 prohibition of ex post facto laws which will oblige the judges to declare such interferences null  void mr rutlidge moved instead of mr kings motion to insert —nor pass bills of attainder nor retrospective  laws on which motion n h ay ct no n j ay pa ay del ay md no virga no n c ay s c ay geo ay mr madison moved to insert after the word reprisal art xii the words nor lay embargoes he urged that such acts by the states would be unnecessary—impolitic—and unjust mr sherman thought the states ought to retain this power in order to prevent suffering  injury to their poor col mason thought the amendment would be not only improper but dangerous as the genl legislature would not sit constantly and therefore could not interpose at the necessary moments he enforced his objection by appealing to the necessity of sudden embargoes during the war to prevent exports particularly in the case of a blockade mr govr morris considered the provision as unnecessary the power of regulating trade between state  state already vested in the genl legislature being sufficient on the question n h no mas ay ct no n j no pa no del ay md no va no n c no s c ay geo no mr madison moved that the words nor lay imposts     or duties on imports be transferred from art xiii where the consent of the genl legislature may license the act—into art xii which will make the prohibition of the states absolute he observed that as the states interested in this power by which they could tax the imports of their neighbors passing thro their markets were a majority they could give the consent of the legislature to the injury of n jersey n carolina c mr williamson  ded the motion mr sherman thought the power might safely be left to the legislature of the u states col mason observed that particular states might wish to encourage by impost duties certain manufactures for which they enjoyed natural advantages as virginia the manufacture of hemp c mr madison the encouragement of manufactures in that mode requires duties not only on imports directly from foreign countries but from the other states in the union which would revive all the mischiefs experienced from the want of a genl government over commerce  on the question n h ay

preventing all state imposts—but lamented the complexity we were giving to the commercial system mr govr morris thought the regulation necessary to prevent the atlantic states from endeavoring to tax the western states— promote their interest by opposing the navigation of the mississippi which would drive the western people into the arms of g britain mr clymer thought the encouragement of the western country was suicide on the old states if the states have such different interests that they cannot be left to regulate their own manufactures without encountering the interests of other states it is a proof that they are not fit to compose one nation mr king was afraid that the regulation moved by     mr sherman would too much interfere with the policy of states respecting their

horse mr butler withdrew his proposition in order that     some particular provision might be made apart from this article art xv as amended was then agreed to nem con adjourned wednesday august   th      in convention art xvi taken up mr williamson moved to substitute in place of it the words of the articles of confederation on the same subject he did not understand precisely the meaning of the article mr wilson and docr johnson supposed the meaning to be that judgments in one state should be the ground of actions in other states  that acts of the legislatures should be included for the sake of acts of insolvency c mr pinkney moved to commit art xvi with the following proposition to establish uniform laws upon the subject of bankruptcies and respecting the damages arising on the protest of foreign bills of exchange mr ghorum was for agreeing to the article and committing the proposition mr madison was for committing both he wished the legislature might be authorized to provide for the execution of judgments in other states under such regulations as might be expedient he thought that this might be safely done and was justified by the nature of the union mr randolph said there was no instance of one     nation executing judgments of the courts of another nation he moved the following proposition whenever the act of any state whether legislative executive or judiciary shall be attested  exemplified under the seal thereof such attestation and exemplification shall be deemed in other states as full proof of the existence of that act—and its operation shall be binding in every other state in all cases to which it may relate and which are within the cognizance and jurisdiction of the state wherein the said act was done on the question for committing art xvi with mr

the proof and effect of such acts records and proceedings and it was committed nem contrad the committee appointed for these references were mr rutlidge mr randolph mr gorham mr wilson  mr johnson mr dickenson mentioned to the house that on examining blackstones commentaries he found that the term ex post facto related to criminal     cases only that they would not consequently restrain the states from retrospective laws in civil cases and that some further provision for this purpose would be requisite art vii sect   by ye com̃ittee of eleven reported to be struck out see the    instant being now taken up mr pinkney moved to postpone the report in favor of the following proposition—that no act of the legislature for the purpose of regulating the commerce of the u s with foreign powers among the several states shall be passed without the assent of two thirds of the members of each house he remarked that there were five distinct commercial interests   the fisheries  w india trade which belonged to the n england states   the interest of n york lay in a free trade   wheat  flour the staples of the two middle states n j  penna   tobo the staple of maryld  virginia  partly of n carolina   rice  indigo the staples of s carolina  georgia these different interests would be a source of oppressive regulations if no check to a bare majority should be provided states pursue their interests with less scruple than individuals the power of regulating commerce was a pure concession on the part of the s states they did not need the protection of the n states at present mr martin  ded the motion genl pinkney said it was the true interest of the s states to have no regulation of commerce but     considering the loss brought on the commerce of the eastern states by the revolution their liberal conduct towards the views  of south carolina and the interest the weak southn states had in being united with the strong eastern states he thought it proper that no fetters should be imposed on the power of making commercial regulations and that his constituents though prejudiced against the eastern states would be reconciled to this liberality he had himself he said prejudices agst the eastern states before he came here but would acknowledge that he had found them as liberal and candid as any men whatever mr clymer the diversity of commercial interests of necessity creates difficulties which ought not to be increased by unnecessary restrictions the northern  middle states will be ruined if not enabled to defend themselves against foreign regulations mr sherman alluding to mr pinkneys enumeration of particular interests as requiring a security agst abuse of the power observed that the diversity was of itself a security adding that to require more than a majority to decide a question was always embarrassing as had been experienced in cases requiring the votes of nine states in congress mr pinkney replied that his enumeration meant     the five minute interests it still left the two great divisions of northern  southern interests mr govr morris opposed the object of the motion as highly injurious preferences to american ships will multiply them till they can carry the southern produce cheaper than it is now carried—a navy was essential to security particularly of the s states and can only be had by a navigation act encouraging american bottoms  seamen in those points of view then alone it is the interest of the s states that navigation acts should be facilitated shipping he said was the worst  most precarious kind of property and stood in need of public patronage mr williamson was in favor of making two thirds instead of a majority requisite as more satisfactory to the southern people no useful measure he believed had been lost in congress for want of nine votes as to the weakness of the southern states he was not alarmed on that account the sickliness of their climate for invaders would prevent their being made an object he acknowledged that he did not think the motion requiring ⅔ necessary in itself because if a majority of the northern states should push their regulations too far the s states would build ships for themselves but he knew the southern people were apprehensive on this subject and would be pleased with the precaution mr spaight was against the motion the southern states could at any time save themselves from oppression by building ships for their own use mr butler differed from those who considered the     rejection of the motion as no concession on the part of the s states he considered the interest of these and of the eastern states to be as different as the interests of russia and turkey being notwithstanding desirous of conciliating the affections of the east states he should vote agst requiring ⅔ instead of a majority col mason if the govt is to be lasting it must be founded in the confidence  affections of the people and must be so constructed as to obtain these the majority will be governed by their interests the southern states are the minority in both houses is it to be expected that they will deliver themselves bound hand  foot to the eastern states and enable them to exclaim in the words of cromwell on a certain occasion—the lord hath delivered them into our hands mr wilson took notice of the several objections and remarked that if every peculiar interest was to be secured unanimity ought to be required the majority he said would be no more governed by interest than the minority it was surely better to let the latter be bound hand and foot than the former great inconveniences had he contended been experienced in congress from the article of confederation requiring nine votes in certain cases mr madison went into a pretty full view of the subject he observed that the disadvantage to the s states from a navigation act lay chiefly in a temporary rise of freight attended however with an increase of southn as well as northern shipping—with   0 the emigration of northern seamen  merchants to the southern states— with a removal of the existing  injurious retaliations among the states on each other the power of foreign nations to obstruct our retaliating measures on them by a corrupt influence would also be less if a majority shd be made competent than if ⅔ of each house shd be required to legislative acts in this case an abuse of the power would be qualified with all these good effects but he thought an abuse was rendered improbable by the provision of   branches—by the independence of the senate by the negative of the executive by the interest of connecticut  n jersey which were agricultural not commercial states by the interior interest which was also agricultural in the most commercial states by the accession of western states which wd be altogether agricultural he added that the southern states would derive an essential advantage in the general security afforded by the increase of our maritime strength he stated the vulnerable situation of them all and of virginia in particular the increase of the coasting trade and of seamen would also be favorable to the s states by increasing the consumption of their produce if the wealth of the eastern should in a still greater proportion be augmented that wealth wd contribute the more to the public wants and be otherwise a national benefit mr rutlidge was agst the motion of his colleague it did not follow from a grant of the power to regulate trade that it would be abused at the worst a     navigation act could bear hard a little while only on the s states as we are laying the foundation for a great empire we ought to take a permanent view of the subject and not look at the present moment only he reminded the house of the necessity of securing the west india trade to this country that was the great object and a navigation act was necessary for obtaining it mr randolph said that there were features so odious in the constitution as it now stands that he doubted whether he should be able to agree to it a rejection of the motion would compleat the deformity of the system he took notice of the argument in favor of giving the power over trade to a majority drawn from the opportunity foreign powers would have of obstructing retaliatory measures if two thirds were made requisite he did not think there was weight in that consideration the difference between a majority  two thirds did not afford room for such an opportunity foreign influence would also be more likely to be exerted on the president who could require three fourths by his negative he did not mean however to enter into the merits what he had in view was merely to pave the way for a declaration which he might be hereafter obliged to make if an accumulation of obnoxious ingredients should take place that he could not give his assent to the plan mr gorham if the government is to be so fettered as to be unable to relieve the eastern states what motive can they have to join in it and thereby tie     their own hands from measures which they could otherwise take for themselves the eastern states were not led to strengthen the union by fear for their own safety he deprecated the consequences of disunion but if it should take place it was the southern part of the continent that had most reason to dread them he urged the improbability of a combination against the interest of the southern states the different situations of the northern  middle states being a security against it it was moreover certain that foreign ships would never be altogether excluded especially those of nations in treaty with us on the question to postpone in order to take up mr pinkneys motion n h no mass no ct no n j no pa no del no md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo ay the report of the committee for striking out sect   requiring two thirds of each house to pass a navigation act was then agreed to nem con mr butler moved to insert after art xv if any person bound to service or labor in any of the u states shall escape into another state he or she shall not be discharged from such service or labor in consequence of any regulations subsisting in the state to which they escape but shall be delivered up to the person justly claiming their service or labor which was agreed to nem con art xvii being taken up mr govr morris moved to strike out the two last sentences to wit if the admission be consented to the new states shall be     admitted on the same terms with the original states but the legislature may make conditions with the new states concerning the public debt which shall be then subsisting—he did not wish to bind down the legislature to admit western states on the terms here stated mr madison opposed the motion insisting that the western states neither would nor ought to submit to a union which degraded them from an equal rank with the other states col mason if it were possible by just means to prevent emigrations to the western country it might be good policy but go the people will as they find it for their interest and the best policy is to treat them with that equality which will make them friends not enemies mr govr morris did not mean to discourage the growth of the western country he knew that to be impossible he did not wish however to throw the power into their hands mr sherman was agst the motion  for fixing an equality of privileges by the constitution mr langdon was in favor of the motion he did not know but circumstances might arise which would render it inconvenient to admit new states on terms of equality mr williamson was for leaving the legislature free the existing small states enjoy an equality now and for that reason are admitted to it in the senate this reason is not applicable to new western states on mr govr morriss motion for striking out     n h ay mas ay ct ay n j ay pa ay del ay md no va no n c ay s c ay geo ay mr l martin  mr govr morris moved to strike out of art xvii but to such admission the consent of two thirds of the members present shall be necessary before any question was taken on this motion mr govr morris moved the following proposition as a substitute for the xvii art new states may be admitted by the legislature into this union but no new state shall be erected within the limits of any of the present states without the consent of the legislature of such state as well as of the genl legislature the first part to union inclusive was agreed to nem con mr l martin opposed the latter part nothing he said would so alarm the limited states as to make the consent of the large states claiming the western lands necessary to the establishment of new states within their limits it is proposed to guarantee the states shall vermont be reduced by force in favor of the states claiming it frankland  the western county of virginia were in a like situation on mr govr morriss motion to substitute c it was agreed to n h no mass ay ct no n j no pa ay del no md no va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay art xvii—before the house as amended mr sherman was against it he thought it unnecessity     the union cannot dismember a state without its consent mr langdon thought there was great weight in the argument of mr luther martin and that the proposition substituted by mr govr morris would excite a dangerous opposition to the plan mr govr morris thought on the contrary that the small states would be pleased with the regulation as it holds up the idea of dismembering the large states mr butler if new states were to be erected without the consent of the dismembered states nothing but confusion would ensue whenever taxes should press on the people demagogues would set up their schemes of new states docr johnson agreed in general with the ideas of mr sherman but was afraid that as the clause stood vermont would be subjected to n york contrary to the faith pledged by congress he was of opinion that vermont ought to be compelled to come into the union mr langdon said his objections were connected with the case of vermont if they are not taken in  remain exempt from taxes it would prove of great injury to n hampshire and the other neighbouring states mr dickinson hoped the article would not be agreed to he dwelt on the impropriety of requiring the small states to secure the large ones in their extensive claims of territory mr wilson when the majority of a state wish to     divided they can do so the aim of those in opposition to the article he perceived was that the genl government should abet the minority  by that means divide a state against its own consent mr govr morris if the forced division of the states is the object of the new system and is to be pointed agst one or two states he expected the gentlemen from these would pretty quickly leave us adjourned thursday august  0th      in convention art xvii resumed for a question on it as amended by mr govr morriss substitutes mr carrol moved to strike out so much of the article as requires the consent of the state to its being divided he was aware that the object of this prerequisite might be to prevent domestic disturbances but such was our situation with regard to the crown lands and the sentiments of maryland on that subject that he perceived we should again be at sea if no guard was provided for the right of the u states to the back lands he suggested that it might be proper to provide that nothing in the constitution should affect the right of the u s to lands ceded by g britain in the treaty of peace and proposed a committment to a member from each state he assured the house that this was a point of a most serious nature it was desirable above all things that the act of the convention might be agreed to unanimously but should this point be disregarded     he believed that all risks would be run by a considerable minority sooner than give their concurrence mr l martin  ded the motion for a commitment mr rutlidge is it to be supposed that the states are to be cut up without their own consent the case of vermont will probably be particularly provided for there could be no room to fear that virginia or n carolina would call on the u states to maintain their government over the mountains mr williamson said that n carolina was well disposed to give up her western lands but attempts at compulsion was not the policy of the u s he was for doing nothing in the constitution in the present case and for leaving the whole matter in statu quo mr wilson was against the commitment unanimity was of great importance but not to be purchased by the majoritys yielding to the minority he should have no objection to leaving the case of the new states as heretofore he knew nothing that would give greater or juster alarm than the doctrine that a political society is to be torn assunder without its own consent on mr carrols motion for commitment n h no mas no ct no n j ay pa no del ay md ay va no n c no s c no geo no mr sherman moved to postpone the substitute for art xvii agreed to yesterday in order to take up the following amendment the legislature shall have power to admit other states into the union and new states to be formed     by the division or junction of states now in the union with the consent of the legislature of such states the first part was meant for the case of vermont to secure its admission on the question it passed in the negative n h ay mas ay ct ay n j no pa ay del no md no va no n c no s c ay geo no docr johnson moved to insert the words hereafter formed or after the words shall be in the substitute for art xvii the more clearly to save vermont as being already formed into a state from a dependence on the consent of n york for her admission the motion was agreed to del  md only dissenting mr govr morris moved to strike out the word limits in the substitute and insert the word jurisdiction this also was meant to guard the case of vermont the jurisdiction of n york not extending over vermont which was in the exercise of sovereignty tho vermont was within the asserted limits of new york on this question n h ay mas ay ct ay n j no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c no s c no geo no mr l martin urged the unreasonableness of forcing  guaranteeing the people of virginia beyond the mountains the western people of n carolina  of georgia  the people of maine to continue under the states now governing them without the consent     of those states to their separation even if they should become the majority the majority of counties as in virginia may still hold fast the dominion over them again the majority may place the seat of government entirely among themselves  for their own conveniency and still keep the injured parts of the states in subjection under the guarantee of the genl government agst domestic violence he wished mr wilson had thought a little sooner of the value of political bodies in the beginning when the rights of the small states were in question they were phantoms ideal beings now when the great states were to be affected political societies were of a sacred nature he repeated and enlarged on the unreasonableness of requiring the small states to guarantee the western claims of the large ones—it was said yesterday by mr govr morris that if the large states were to be split to pieces without their consent their representatives here would take their leave if the small states are to be required to guarantee them in this manner it will be found that the representatives of other states will with equal firmness take their leave of the constitution on the table it was moved by mr l martin to postpone the substituted article in order to take up the following the legislature of the u s shall have power to erect new states within as well as without the territory claimed by the several states or either of them and admit the same into the union provided that nothing in this constitution shall be construed to   0 affect the claim of the u s to vacant lands ceded to them by the late treaty of peace which passed in the negative n j del  md only ay on the question to agree to mr govr morriss substituted article as amended in the words following new states may be admitted by the legislature into the union but no new state shall be hereafter formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any of the present states without the consent of the legislature of such state as well as of the general legislature n h ay mas ay ct ay n j no pa ay del no md no va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr dickinson moved to add the following clause to the last— nor shall any state be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts thereof without the consent of the legislature of such states as well as of the legislature of the u states which was agreed to without a count of the votes mr carrol moved to add—provided nevertheless that nothing in this constitution shall be construed to affect the claim of the u s to vacant lands ceded to them by the treaty of peace this he said might be understood as relating to lands not claimed by any particular states but he had in view also some of the claims of particular states mr wilson was agst the motion there was nothing in the constitution affecting one way or the other the claims of the u s  it was best to insert     nothing leaving every thing on that litigated subject in statu quo mr madison considered the claim of the u s as in fact favored by the jurisdiction of the judicial power of the u s over controversies to which they should be parties he thought it best on the whole to be silent on the subject he did not view the proviso of mr carrol as dangerous but to make it neutral  fair it ought to go further  declare that the claims of particular states also should not be affected mr sherman thought the proviso harmless especially with the addition suggested by mr madison in favor of the claims of particular states mr baldwin did not wish any undue advantage to be given to georgia he thought the proviso proper with the addition proposed it should be remembered that if georgia has gained much by the cession in the treaty of peace she was in danger during the war of a uti possidetis mr rutlidge thought it wrong to insert a proviso where there was nothing which it could restrain or on which it could operate mr carrol withdrew his motion and moved the following nothing in this constitution shall be construed to alter the claims of the u s or of the individual states to the western territory but all such claims shall be examined into  decided upon by the supreme court of the u states mr govr morris moved to postpone this in order to take up the following     the legislature shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the u states and nothing in this constitution contained shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims either of the u s or of any particular state—the postponemt agd to nem con mr l martin moved to amend the proposition of mr govr morris by adding—but all such claims may be examined into  decided upon by the supreme court of the u states mr govr morris this is unnecessary as all suits to which the u s are parties are already to be decided by the supreme court mr l martin it is proper in order to remove all doubts on this point question on mr l martins amendatory motion n h no mas no ct no n j ay pa no del no md ay va no—states not farther called the negatives being sufficient  the point given up the motion of mr govr morris was then agreed to md alone dissenting art xviii being taken up—the word foreign was struck out nem con as superfluous being implied in the term invasion mr dickinson moved to strike out on the application of its legislature against he thought it of essential importance to the tranquility of the u s that they should in all cases suppress domestic violence which may proceed from the state legislature     itself or from disputes between the two branches where such exist mr dayton mentioned the conduct of rho island as shewing the necessity of giving latitude to the power of the u s on this subject on the

sherman thought it unnecessary the prevailing liberality being a sufficient security agst such tests mr govr morris  genl pinkney approved the motion the motion was agreed to nem con and then the whole article n c only no—and md divided art xxi taken up viz the ratifications of the conventions of — states shall be sufficient for organizing this constitution mr wilson proposed to fill the blank with seven that being a majority of the whole number  sufficient for the commencement of the plan mr carrol moved to postpone the article in order to take up the report of the committee of eleven see tuesday augst   — and on the question n h no mas no ct no n j ay pa no del ay md ay va no n c no s c no geo no mr govr morris thought the blank ought to be filled in a twofold way so as to provide for the event of the ratifying states being contiguous which would     render a smaller number sufficient and the event of their being dispersed which wd require a greater number for the introduction of the government mr sherman observed that the states being now confederated by articles which require unanimity in changes he thought the ratification in this case of ten states at least ought to be made necessary mr randolph was for filling the blank with nine that being a respectable majority of the whole and being a number made familiar by the constitution of the existing congress mr wilson mentioned eight as preferable mr dickinson asked whether the concurrence of congress is to be essential to the establishment of the system whether the refusing states in the confederacy could be deserted—and whether congress could concur in contravening the system under which they acted mr madison remarked that if the blank should be filled with seven eight or nine the constitution as it stands might be put in force over the whole body of the people tho less than a majority of them should ratify it mr wilson as the constitution stands the states only which ratify can be bound we must he said in this case go to the original powers of society the house on fire must be extinguished without a scrupulous regard to ordinary rights mr butler was in favor of nine he revolted at the idea that one or two states should restrain the rest from consulting their safety     mr carrol moved to fill the blank with the thirteen unanimity being necessary to dissolve the existing confederacy which had been unanimously established mr king thought this amendt necessary otherwise as the constitution now stands it will operate on the whole though ratified by a part only adjourned friday august   st      in convention mr king moved to add to the end of art xxi the words between the said states so as to confine the operation of the govt to the states ratifying it on the question n h ay

of representatives according to the allotment made in the   sect of art   this he said would require the concurrence of a majority of both the states and the people mr sherman doubted the propriety of authorizing less than all the states to execute the constitution considering the nature of the existing confederation perhaps all the states may concur and on that supposition it is needless to hold out a breach of faith mr clymer and mr carrol moved to postpone the consideration of art xxi in order to take up the reports of committees not yet acted on on this question the states were equally divided n h ay     mas no ct divd n j no pa ay del ay md ay va no n c no s c no g ay mr govr morris moved to strike out conventions of the after ratifications leaving the states to pursue their own modes of ratification mr carrol mentioned the mode of altering the constitution of maryland pointed out therein and that no other mode could be pursued in that state mr king thought that striking out conventions as the requisite mode was equivalent to giving up the business altogether conventions alone which will avoid all the obstacles from the complicated formation of the legislatures will succeed and if not positively required by the plan its enemies will oppose that mode mr govr morris said he meant to facilitate the adoption of the plan by leaving the modes approved by the several state constitutions to be followed mr madison considered it best to require conventions among other reasons for this that the powers given to the genl govt being taken from the state govts the legislatures would be more disinclined than conventions composed in part at least of other men and if disinclined they could devise modes apparently promoting but really thwarting the ratification the difficulty in maryland was no greater than in other states where no mode of change was pointed out by the constitution and all officers were under oath to support it the people were in fact the fountain of all power and by resorting to them all difficulties were got over they could alter     constitutions as they pleased it was a principle in the bills of rights that first principles might be resorted to mr mchenry said that the officers of govt in maryland were under oath to support the mode of alteration prescribed by the constitution mr ghorum urged the expediency of conventions also mr pinkney for reasons formerly urged on a discussion of this question mr l martin insisted on a reference to the state legislatures he urged the danger of commotions from a resort to the people  to first principles in which the governments might be on one side and the people on the other he was apprehensive of no such consequences however in maryland whether the legislature or the people should be appealed to both of them would be generally against the constitution he repeated also the peculiarity in the maryland constitution mr king observed that the constitution of massachusetts was made unalterable till the year    0 yet this was no difficulty with him the state must have contemplated a recurrence to first principles before they sent deputies to this convention mr sherman moved to

to amend the art so as to read this constitution shall be laid before the u s in congress assembled and it is the opinion of this convention that it should afterwards be submitted to a convention chosen in each state in order to receive the ratification of such convention to which end the several legislatures ought to provide for the calling conventions within their respective states as speedily as circumstances will permit mr govr morris said his object was to impress in stronger terms the necessity of calling conventions in order to prevent enemies to the plan from giving it the go by when it first appears with the sanction of this convention the people will be favorable to it by degrees the state officers  those interested in the state govts will intrigue  turn the popular current against it mr l martin believed mr morris to be right that after a while the people would be agst it but for a different reason from that alledged he believed they would not ratify it unless hurried into it by surprize mr gerry enlarged on the idea of mr l martin in     which he concurred represented the system as full of vices and dwelt on the impropriety of destroying the existing

brought to a decision before being compelled to give a final opinion on this article should these points be improperly settled his wish would then be to bring the whole subject before another general convention mr govr morris was ready for a postponement he had long wished for another convention that will have the firmness to provide a vigorous government which we are afraid to do mr randolph stated his idea to be in case the final form of the constitution should not permit him to accede to it that the state conventions should be at liberty to propose amendments to be submitted to another

over those of another agreed to nem con     on the clause or oblige vessels bound to or from any state to enter clear or pay duties in another mr madison thought the restriction wd be inconvenient as in the river delaware if a vessel cannot be required to make entry below the jurisdiction of pennsylvania mr fitzimmons admitted that it might be inconvenient but thought it would be a greater inconvenience to require vessels bound to philada to enter below the jurisdiction of the state mr ghorum  mr langdon contended that the govt would be so fettered by this clause as to defeat the good purpose of the plan they mentioned the situation of the trade of mas  n hampshire the case of sandy hook which is in the state of n jersey but where precautions agst smuggling into n york ought to be established by the genl government mr mchenry said the clause would not screen a vessel from being obliged to take an officer on board as a security for due entry c mr carrol was anxious that the

house during his continuance in office mr rutlidge from the committee to whom were     referred sundry propositions see aug    together with art xvi reported that the following additions be made to

xvi viz full faith and credit ought to be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state and the legislature shall by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records  proceedings shall be proved and the effect which judgments obtained in one state shall have in another after receiving these reports the house adjourned to  0oc on monday next monday sepr        in convention mr govr morris moved to amend the report concerning the respect to be paid to acts records c of one state in other states see sepr   by striking out judgments obtained in one state shall have in another and to insert the word thereof after the word effect col mason favored the motion particularly if the effect was to be restrained to judgments  judicial proceedings mr wilson remarked that if the legislature were     not allowed to declare the effect the provision would amount to nothing more than what now takes place among all independent nations docr johnson thought the amendment as worded would authorize the genl legislature to declare the effect of legislative acts of one state in another state mr randolph considered it as strengthening the general objection agst the plan that its definition of the powers of the government was so loose as to give it opportunities of usurping all the state powers he was for not going farther than the report which enables the legislature to provide for the effect of judgments on the amendment as moved by mr govr morris mas ay ct ay n j ay pa ay md no va no n c ay s c ay geo no on motion of mr madison ought to

in     some cases punishable with death by the laws of england  he did not chuse to grant a power by which that might be done here mr govr morris said this was an extensive  delicate subject he would agree to it because he saw no danger of abuse of the power by the legislature of the u s on the question to agree to the clause n h ay mas ay ct no n j ay pa ay md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr

they or any other for their benefit receive any salary fees or emoluments of any kind and the acceptance of such office shall vacate their seats respectively he was strenuously opposed to an ineligibility of members to office and therefore wished to restrain the proposition to a mere incompatibility he considered the eligibility of members of the legislature to the honourable offices of government as resembling the policy of the romans in making the temple of virtue the road to the temple of fame on this question n h no mas no ct no n j no pa ay md no va no n c ay s c no geo no mr king moved to insert the word created before the word during in the report of the committee this he said would exclude the members of     the first legislature under the constitution as most of the offices wd then be created mr williamson  ded the motion he did not see why members of the legislature should be ineligible to vacancies happening during the term of their election mr sherman was for entirely incapacitating members of the legislature he thought their eligibility to offices would give too much influence to the executive he said the incapacity ought at least to be extended to cases where salaries should be increased as well as created during the term of the member he mentioned also the expedient by which the restriction could be evaded to wit an existing officer might be translated to an office created and a member of the legislature be then put into the office vacated mr govr morris contended that the eligibility of members to office wd lessen the influence of the executive if they cannot be appointed themselves the executive will appoint their relations  friends retaining the service  votes of the members for his purposes in the legislature whereas the appointment of the members deprives him of such an advantage mr gerry thought the eligibility of members would have the effect of opening batteries agst good officers in order to drive them out  make way for members of the legislature mr gorham was in favor of the amendment without it we go further than has been done in any of the     states or indeed any other country the experience of the state governments where there was no such ineligibility proved that it was not necessary on the contrary that the eligibility was among the inducements for fit men to enter into the legislative service mr randolph was inflexibly fixed against inviting men into the legislature by the prospect of being appointed to offices mr baldwin remarked that the example of the states was not applicable the legislatures there are so numerous that an exclusion of their members would not leave proper men for offices the case would be otherwise in the general government col mason instead of excluding merit the ineligibility will keep out corruption by excluding officehunters mr wilson considered the exclusion of members of the legislature as increasing the influence of the executive as observed by mr govr morris at the same time that it would diminish the general energy of the government he said that the legal disqualification for office would be odious to those who did not wish for office but did not wish either to be marked by so degrading a distinction mr pinkney the first legislature will be composed of the ablest men to be found the states will select such to put the government into operation should the report of the committee or even the amendment be agreed to the great offices even those of the judiciary department which are to   0 continue for life must be filled while those

legislature shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts  excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence  general welfare of the u s   at the end of the  d clause of sect   art   add and with the indian tribes   in the place of the  th art sect   to be inserted the senate of the u s shall have power to try all impeachments but no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present   after the word excellency in sect   art  0 to be inserted he shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the vicepresident chosen for the same term be elected in the following manner viz each state shall appoint in such manner as its legislature may direct a number     of electors equal to the whole number of senators and members of the house of representatives to which the state may be entitled in the legislature the electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for two persons of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves and they shall make a list of all the persons voted for and of the number of votes for each which list they shall sign and certify and transmit sealed to the seat of the genl government directed to the president of the senate—the president of the senate shall in that house open all the certificates and the votes shall be then  there counted the person having the greatest number of votes shall be the president if such number be a majority of that of the electors and if there be more than one who have such a majority and have an equal number of votes then the senate shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president but if no person have a majority then from the five highest on the list the senate shall choose by ballot the president and in every case after the choice of the president the person having the greatest number of votes shall be vicepresident but if there should remain two or more who have equal votes the senate shall choose from them the vicepresident the legislature may determine the time of choosing and assembling the electors and the manner of certifying and transmitting their votes   sect   no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the u s at the time of the     adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president nor shall any person be elected to that office who shall be under the age of thirty five years and who has not been in the whole at least fourteen years a resident within the u s   sect   the vicepresident shall be ex officio president of the senate except when they sit to try the impeachment of the president in which case the chief justice shall preside and excepting also when he shall exercise the powers and duties of president in which case  in case of his absence the senate shall chuse a president pro tempore—the vice president when acting as president of the senate shall not have a vote unless the house be equally divided   sect   the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall have power to make treaties and he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors and other public ministers judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the u s whose appointments are not otherwise herein provided for but no treaty shall be made without the consent of two thirds of the members present   after the words—into the service of the u s in sect   art  0 add and may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices the latter part of sect   art  0 to read as follows   he shall be removed from his office on     impeachment by the house of representatives and conviction by the senate for treason or bribery and in case of his removal as aforesaid death absence resignation or inability to discharge the powers or duties of his office the vicepresident shall exercise those powers and duties until another president be chosen or until the inability of the president be removed the  st clause of the report was agreed to nem con the   clause was also agreed to nem con the   clause was postponed in order to decide previously on the mode of electing the president the   clause was accordingly taken up mr gorham disapproved of making the next highest after the president the vicepresident without referring the decision to the senate in case the next highest should have less than a majority of votes as the regulation stands a very obscure man with very few votes may arrive at that appointment mr sherman said the object of this clause of the report of the committee was to get rid of the ineligibility which was attached to the mode of election by the legislature  to render the executive independent of the legislature as the choice of the president was to be made out of the five highest obscure characters were sufficiently guarded against in that case and he had no objection to requiring the vicepresident to be chosen in like manner where the choice was not decided by a majority in the first instance     mr madison was apprehensive that by requiring both the president  vice president to be chosen out of the five highest candidates the attention of the electors would be turned too much to making candidates instead of giving their votes in order to a definitive choice should this turn be given to the business the election would in fact be consigned to the senate altogether it would have the effect at the same time he observed of giving the nomination of the candidates to the largest states mr govr morris concurred in  enforced the remarks of mr madison mr randolph  mr pinkney wished for a particular explanation  discussion of the reasons for changing the mode of electing the executive mr govr morris said he would give the reasons of the committee and his own the  st was the danger of intrigue  faction if the appointmt should be made by the legislature   the inconveniency of an ineligibility required by that mode in order to lessen its evils   the difficulty of establishing a court of impeachments other than the senate which would not be so proper for the trial nor the other branch for the impeachment of the president if appointed by the legislature   nobody had appeared to be satisfied with an appointment by the legislature   many were anxious even for an immediate choice by the people   the indispensable necessity of making the executive independent of the legislature—as the electors would vote at the same time throughout the u s and at so great a distance from each other     the great evil of cabal was avoided it would be impossible also to corrupt them a conclusive reason for making the senate instead of the supreme court the judge of impeachments was that the latter was to try the president after the trial of the impeachment col mason confessed that the plan of the committee had removed some capital objections particularly the danger of cabal and corruption it was liable however to this strong objection that nineteen times in twenty the president would be chosen by the senate an improper body for the purpose mr butler thought the mode not free from objections but much more so than an election by the legislature where as in elective monarchies cabal faction  violence would be sure to prevail mr pinkney stated as objections to the mode   that it threw the whole appointment in fact into the hands of the senate   the electors will be strangers to the several candidates and of course unable to decide on their comparative merits   it makes the executive reeligible which will endanger the public liberty   it makes the same body of men which will in fact elect the president his judges in case of an impeachment mr williamson had great doubts whether the advantage of reeligibility would balance the objection to such a dependence of the president on the senate for his reappointment he thought at least the senate ought to be restrained to the two highest on the list     mr govr morris said the principal advantage aimed at was that of taking away the opportunity for cabal the president may be made if thought necessary ineligible on this as well as on any other mode of election other inconveniences may be no less redressed on this plan than any other mr baldwin thought the plan not so objectionable when well considered as at first view the increasing intercourse among the people of the states would render important characters less  less unknown and the senate would consequently be less  less likely to have the eventual appointment thrown into their hands mr wilson this subject has greatly divided the house and will also divide the people out of doors it is in truth the most difficult of all on which we have had to decide he had never made up an opinion on it entirely to his own satisfaction he thought the plan on the whole a valuable improvement on the former it gets rid of one great evil that of cabal  corruption  continental characters will multiply as we more  more coalesce so as to enable the electors in every part of the union to know  judge of them it clears the way also for a discussion of the question of reeligibility on its own merits which the former mode of election seemed to forbid he thought it might be better however to refer the eventual appointment to the legislature than to the senate and to confine it to a smaller number than five of the candidates the eventual election by the legislature wd not open cabal anew     as it would be restrained to certain designated objects of choice and as these must have had the previous sanction of a number of the states and if the election be made as it ought as soon as the votes of the electors are opened  it is known that no one has a majority of the whole there can be little danger of corruption another reason for preferring the legislature to the senate in this business was that the house of reps will be so often changed as to be free from the influence  faction to which the permanence of the senate may subject that branch mr randolph preferred the former mode of constituting the executive but if the change was to be made he wished to know why the eventual election was referred to the senate and not to the legislature he saw no necessity for this and many objections to it he was apprehensive also that the advantage of the eventual appointment would fall into the hands of the states near the seat of government mr govr morris said the senate was preferred because fewer could then say to the president you owe your appointment to us he thought the president would not depend so much on the senate for his reappointment as on his general good conduct the further consideration of the report was postponed that each member might take a copy of the remainder of it the following motion was referred to the committee of eleven—to wit—to prepare  report a plan for defraying the expences of the convention      mr pinkney moved a clause declaring that each house should be judge of the privilege of its own members mr govr morris  ded the motion mr randolph  mr madison expressed doubts as to the propriety of giving such a power  wished for a postponement mr govr morris thought it so plain a case that no postponement could be necessary mr wilson thought the power involved and the express insertion of it needless it might beget doubts as to the power of other public bodies as courts c every court is the judge of its own privileges mr madison distinguished between the power of judging of privileges previously  duly established and the effect of the motion which would give a discretion to each house as to the extent of its own privileges he suggested that it would be better to make provision for ascertaining by law the privileges of each house than to allow each house to decide for itself he suggested also the necessity of considering what privileges ought to be allowed to the executive adjourned wednesday sepr        in convention mr brearley from the committee of eleven made a farther report as follows   to add to the clause to declare war the words and grant letters of marque and reprisal   0   to add to the clause to raise and support armies the words but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years   instead of sect    art   say—all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives and shall be subject to alterations and amendments by the senate no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law   immediately before the last clause of sect   art   insert to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of the legislature become the seat of the government of the u s and to exercise like authority over all places purchased for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dock yards and other needful buildings   to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors  inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries this report being taken up—the   clause was agreed to nem con to the   clause mr gerry objected that it admitted of appropriations to an army for two years instead of one for which he could not conceive a reason that it implied that there was to be a standing army which he inveighed against as dangerous to liberty as unnecessary even for so great an extent of country as this and if necessary some restriction     on the number  duration ought to be provided nor was this a proper time for such an innovation the people would not bear it mr sherman remarked that the appropriations were permitted only not required to be for two years as the legislature is to be biennally elected it would be inconvenient to require appropriations to be for one year as there might be no session within the time necessary to renew them he should himself he said like a reasonable restriction on the number and continuance of an army in time of peace the   clause was then agreed to nem con the   clause mr govr morris moved to postpone it had been agreed to in the committee on the ground of compromise and he should feel himself at liberty to dissent to it if on the whole he should not be satisfied with certain other parts to be settled—mr pinkney  ded the motion mr sherman was for giving immediate ease to those who looked on this clause as of great moment and for trusting to their concurrence in other proper measures on the question for postponing n h ay mas no ct ay n j ay pa ay del ay md ay va no n c ay s c ay geo ay so much of the   clause as related to the seat of government was agreed to nem con on the residue to wit to exercise like authority over all places purchased for forts c mr gerry contended that this power might be made     use of to enslave any particular state by buying up its territory and that the strongholds proposed would be a means of awing the state into an undue obedience to the genl government mr king thought himself the provision unnecessary the power being already involved but would move to insert after the word purchased the words by the consent of the legislature of the state this would certainly make the power safe mr govr morris  ded the motion which was agreed to nem con as was then the residue of the clause as amended the   clause was agreed to nem con the following resolution  order being reported from the committee of eleven to wit resolved that the u s in congress be requested to allow and cause to be paid to the secretary and other officers of this convention such sums in proportion to their respective times of service as are allowed to the secretary  similar officers of congress ordered that the secretary make out  transmit to the treasury office of the u s an account for the said services  for the incidental expences of this convention the resolution  order were separately agreed to nem con mr gerry gave notice that he should move to reconsider articles xix xx xxi xxii mr williamson gave like notice as to the article fixing the number of representatives which he     thought too small he wished also to allow rho island more than one as due to her probable number of people and as proper to stifle any pretext arising from her absence on the occasion the report made yesterday as to the appointment of the executive being then taken up mr pinkney renewed his opposition to the mode arguing   that the electors will not have sufficient knowledge of the fittest men  will be swayed by an attachment to the eminent men of their respective states hence  dly the dispersion of the votes would leave the appointment with the senate and as the presidents reappointment will thus depend on the senate he will be the mere creature of that body   he will combine with the senate agst the house of representatives   this change in the mode of election was meant to get rid of the ineligibility of the president a second time whereby he will become fixed for life under the auspices of the senate mr gerry did not object to this plan of constituting the executive in itself but should be governed in his final vote by the powers that may be given to the president mr rutlidge was much opposed to the plan reported by the committee it would throw the whole power into the senate he was also against a reeligibility he moved to postpone the report under consideration  take up the original plan of appointment by the legislature to wit he shall be elected by joint ballot by the legislature to which election a majority of the votes of the members     present shall be required he shall hold his office during the term of seven years but shall not be elected a second time on this motion to postpone n h divd mas no ct no n j no pa no del no md no va no n c ay s c ay geo no col mason admitted that there were objections to an appointment by the legislature as originally planned he had not yet made up his mind but would state his objections to the mode proposed by the committee   it puts the appointment in fact into the hands of the senate as it will rarely happen that a majority of the whole votes will fall on any one candidate and as the existing president will always be one of the   highest his reappointment will of course depend on the senate   considering the powers of the president  those of the senate if a coalition should be established between these two branches they will be able to subvert the constitution — the great objection with him would be removed by depriving the senate of the eventual election he accordingly moved to strike out the words if such number be a majority of that of the electors mr williamson  ded the motion he could not agree to the clause without some such modification he preferred making the highest tho not having a majority of the votes president to a reference of the matter to the senate referring the appointment to the senate lays a certain foundation for corruption  aristocracy     mr govr morris thought the point of less consequence than it was supposed on both sides it is probable that a majority of the votes will fall on the same man as each elector is to give two votes more than ¼ will give a majority besides as one vote is to be given to a man out of the state and as this vote will not be thrown away ½ the votes will fall on characters eminent  generally known again if the president shall have given satisfaction the votes will turn on him of course and a majority of them will reappoint him without resort to the senate if he should be disliked all disliking him would take care to unite their votes so as to ensure his being supplanted col mason those who think there is no danger of there not being a majority for the same person in the first instance ought to give up the point to those who think otherwise mr sherman reminded the opponents of the new mode proposed that if the small states had the advantage in the senates deciding among the five highest candidates the large states would have in fact the nomination of these candidates on the motion of col mason n h no mas no ct no n j no pa no del no md ay  va no n c ay s c no geo no mr wilson moved to strike out senate and insert the word legislature mr madison considered it as a primary object to     render an eventual resort to any part of the legislature improbable he was apprehensive that the proposed alteration would turn the attention of the large states too much to the appointment of candidates instead of aiming at an effectual appointment of the officer as the large states would predominate in the legislature which would have the final choice out of the candidates whereas if the senate in which the small states predominate should have the final choice the concerted effort of the large states would be to make the appointment in the first instance conclusive mr randolph we have in some revolutions of this plan made a bold stroke for monarchy we are now doing the same for an aristocracy he dwelt on the tendency of such an influence in the senate over the election of the president in addition to its other powers to convert that body into a real  dangerous aristocracy mr dickinson was in favor of giving the eventual election to the legislature instead of the senate it was too much influence to be superadded to that body on the question moved by mr wilson n h divd mas no ct no n j no pa ay del no md no va ay n c no s c ay geo no mr madison  mr williamson moved to strike out the word majority and insert onethird so that the eventual power might not be exercised if less than a majority but not less than ⅓ of the electors should vote for the same person     mr gerry objected that this would put it in the power of three or four states to put in whom they pleased mr williamson there are seven states which do not contain one third of the people if the senate are to appoint less than one sixth of the people will have the power on the question n h no mas no ct no n j no pa no del no md no va ay n c ay s c no geo no mr gerry suggested that the eventual election should be made by six senators and seven representatives chosen by joint ballot of both houses mr king observed that the influence of the small states in the senate was somewhat balanced by the influence of the large states in bringing forward the candidates  and also by the concurrence of the small states in the committee in the clause vesting the exclusive origination of money bills in the house of representatives col mason moved to strike out the word five and insert the word three as the highest candidates for the senate to choose out of     mr gerry  ded the motion mr sherman would sooner give up the plan he would prefer seven or thirteen on the question moved by col mason  mr gerry n h no mas no ct no n j no pa no delaware and md no va ay n c ay s c no geo no mr spaight and mr rutlidge moved to strike out five and insert thirteen — to which all the states disagreed—except n c  s c mr madison  mr williamson moved to insert after electors the words who shall have balloted so that the non voting electors not being counted might not increase the number necessary as a majority of the whole to decide the choice without the agency of the senate on this question n h no mas no ct no n j no pa ay del no md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo no mr dickinson moved in order to remove ambiguity from the intention of the clause as explained by the vote to add after the words if such number be a majority of the whole number of the electors the word appointed on this motion n h ay mas ay con ay n j ay pa ay delaware and md ay va no n c no s c ay geo ay col mason as the mode of appointment is now     regulated he could not forbear expressing his opinion that it is utterly inadmissible he would prefer the government of prussia to one which will put all power into the hands of seven or eight men and fix an aristocracy worse than absolute monarchy the words and of their giving their votes being inserted on motion for that purpose after the words the legislature may determine the time of chusing and assembling the electors the house adjourned thursday sepr        in convention mr king and mr gerry moved to insert in the    clause of the report see sepr   after the words may be entitled in the legislature the words following—but no person shall be appointed an elector who is a member of the legislature of the u s or who holds any office of profit or trust under the u s which passed nem con mr gerry proposed as the president was to be elected by the senate out of the five highest candidates that if he should not at the end of his term be reelected by a majority of the electors and no other candidate should have a majority the eventual election should be made by the legislature this he said would relieve the president from his particular dependence on the senate for his continuance in office   0 mr king liked the idea as calculated to satisfy particular members and promote unanimity  as likely to operate but seldom mr read opposed it remarking that if individual members were to be indulged alterations would be necessary to satisfy most of them mr williamson espoused it as a reasonable precaution against the undue influence of the senate mr sherman liked the arrangement as it stood though he should not be averse to some amendments he thought he said that if the legislature were to have the eventual appointment instead of the senate it ought to vote in the case by states in favor of the small states as the large states would have so great an advantage in nominating the candidates mr govr morris thought favorably of mr gerrys proposition it would free the president from being tempted in naming to offices to conform to the will of the senate  thereby virtually give the appointments to office to the senate mr wilson said that he had weighed carefully the report of the committee for remodelling the constitution of the executive and on combining it with other parts of the plan he was obliged to consider the whole as having a dangerous tendency to aristocracy as throwing a dangerous power into the hands of the senate they will have in fact the appointment of the president and through his dependence on them the virtual appointment to offices among others the officers of the judiciary department they are to make treaties and they are to     try all impeachments in allowing them thus to make the executive  judiciary appointments to be the court of impeachments and to make treaties which are to be laws of the land the legislative executive  judiciary powers are all blended in one branch of the government the power of making treaties involves the case of subsidies and here as an additional evil foreign influence is to be dreaded according to the plan as it now stands the president will not be the man of the people as he ought to be but the minion of the senate he cannot even appoint a tidewaiter without the senate he had always thought the senate too numerous a body for making appointments to office the senate will moreover in all probability be in constant session they will have high salaries and with all those powers and the president in their interest they will depress the other branch of the legislature and aggrandize themselves in proportion add to all this that the senate sitting in conclave can by holding up to their respective states various and improbable candidates contrive so to scatter their votes as to bring the appointment of the president ultimately before themselves upon the whole he thought the new mode of appointing the president with some amendments a valuable improvement but he could never agree to purchase it at the price of the ensuing parts of the report nor befriend a system of which they make a part mr govr morris expressed his wonder at the observations of mr wilson so far as they preferred the     plan in the printed report to the new modification of it before the house and entered into a comparative view of the two with an eye to the nature of mr wilsons objections to the last by the first the senate he observed had a voice in appointing the president out of all the citizens of the u s by this they were limited to five candidates previously nominated to them with a probability of being barred altogether by the successful ballot of the electors here surely was no increase of power they are now to appoint judges nominated to them by the president before they had the appointment without any agency whatever of the president here again was surely no additional power if they are to make treaties as the plan now stands the power was the same in the printed plan if they are to try impeachments the judges must have been triable by them before wherein then lay the dangerous tendency of the innovations to establish an aristocracy in the senate as to the appointment of officers the weight of sentiment in the house was opposed to the exercise of it by the president alone though it was not the case with himself if the senate would act as was suspected in misleading the states into a fallacious disposition of their votes for a president they would if the appointment were withdrawn wholly from them make such representations in their several states where they have influence as would favor the object of their partiality mr williamson replying to mr morris observed that the aristocratic complexion proceeds from the     change in the mode of appointing the president which makes him dependent on the senate mr clymer said that the aristocratic part to which he could never accede was that in the printed plan which gave the senate the power of appointing to offices mr hamilton said that he had been restrained from entering into the discussions by his dislike of the scheme of govt in general but as he meant to support the plan to be recommended as better than nothing he wished in this place to offer a few remarks he liked the new modification on the whole better than that in the printed report in this the president was a monster elected for seven years and ineligible afterwards having great powers in appointments to office  continually tempted by this constitutional disqualification to abuse them in order to subvert the government although he should be made reeligible still if appointed by the legislature he would be tempted to make use of corrupt influence to be continued in office it seemed peculiarly desirable therefore that some other mode of election should be devised considering the different views of different states  the different districts northern middle  southern he concurred with those who thought that the votes would not be concentered and that the appointment would consequently in the present mode devolve on the senate the nomination to offices will give great weight to the president here then is a mutual connexion  influence that will perpetuate the president and     aggrandize both him  the senate what is to be the remedy he saw none better than to let the highest number of ballots whether a majority or not appoint the president what was the objection to this merely that too small a number might appoint but as the plan stands the senate may take the candidate having the smallest number of votes and make him president mr spaight  mr williamson moved to insert seven instead of four years for the term of the president — on this motion n h ay mas no ct no n j no pa no del no md no va ay n c ay s c no geo no mr spaight  mr williamson then moved to insert six instead of four on which motion n h no mas no ct no n j no pa no

insert the words and who shall have given their votes after the word appointed in the  th clause of the report as added yesterday on motion of mr dickinson on several motions the words in presence of the senate and house of representatives were inserted after the word counted and the word immediately before the word choose and the words of the electors after the word votes mr spaight said if the election by electors is to be crammed down he would prefer their meeting altogether and deciding finally without any reference to the senate and moved that the electors meet at the seat of the general government mr williamson  ded the motion on which all the states were in the negative except n carolina on motion the words but the election shall be on the same day throughout the u s were added

gorham thought it a wrong principle to require more than a majority in any case in the present case it might prevent for a long time any choice of a president on the question moved by mr m and mr p n h ay mas abst ct no n j no pa no del no md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr williamson suggested as better than an eventual choice by the senate that this choice should be made by the legislature voting by states and not per capita mr sherman suggested the house of reps as preferable to the legislature and moved accordingly to strike out the words the senate shall immediately choose c and insert the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president the members from each state having one vote col mason liked the latter mode best as lessening the aristocratic influence of the senate on the motion of mr sherman n h ay mas ay ct ay n j ay pa ay     del no md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr govr morris suggested the idea of providing that in all cases the president in office should not be one of the five candidates but be only reeligible in case a majority of the electors should vote for him this was another expedient for rendering the president independent of the legislative body for his continuance in office mr madison remarked that as a majority of members wd make a quorum in the h of reps it would follow from the amendment of mr sherman giving the election to a majority of states that the president might be elected by two states only virga  pena which have    members if these states alone should be present on a motion that the eventual election of presidt in case of an equality of the votes of the electors be referred to the house of reps n h ay mas ay n j no pa ay del no md no va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr king moved to add to the amendment of mr sherman but a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states and also of a majority of the whole number of the house of representatives col mason liked it as obviating the remark of mr madison—the motion as far as states inclusive was agd to on the residue to wit and also of a majority of the whole number of the house of repss it passed in the negative     n h no mas ay ct ay n j no pa ay del no md no va ay n c ay s c no geo no the report relating to the appointment of the executive stands as amended as follows he

legislature may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and members of the house of representatives to which the state may be entitled in the legislature but no person shall be appointed an elector who is a member of the legislature of the u s or who holds any office of profit or trust under the u s the electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for two persons of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves and they shall make a list of all the persons voted for and of the number of votes for each which list they shall sign and certify and transmit sealed to the seat of the general government directed to the president of the senate the president of the senate shall in the presence of the senate and house of representatives open all the certificates  the votes shall then be counted the person having the greatest number of votes shall be the president if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed and if     there be more than one who have such majority and have an equal number of votes then the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president the representation from each state having one vote but if no person have a majority then from the five highest on the list the house of representatives shall in like manner choose by ballot the president in the choice of a president by the house of representatives a quorum shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states   and the concurrence of a majority of all the states shall be necessary to such choice—and in every case after the choice of the president the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vicepresident but if there should remain two or more who have equal votes the senate shall choose from them the vicepresident    0 the legislature may determine the time of choosing the electors and of their giving their votes and the manner of certifying and transmitting their votes—but     the election shall be on the same day throughout the u states adjourned friday sepr         in convention the mode of constituting the executive being resumed mr randolph moved to insert in the first section of the report made yesterday     the legislature may declare by law what officer of the u s shall act as president in case of the death resignation or disability of the president and vicepresident and such officer shall act accordingly until the time of electing a president shall arrive mr madison observed that this as worded would prevent a supply of the vacancy by an intermediate     election of the president and moved to substitute—until such disability be removed or a president shall be elected  mr govr morris  ded the motion which was agreed to it seemed to be an objection to the provision with some that according to the process established for chusing the executive there would be difficulty in effecting it at other than the fixed periods with others that the legislature was restrained in the temporary appointment to officers of the u s     they wished it to be at liberty to appoint others than such on the motion of mr randolph as amended it passed in the affirmative n h divided mas no ct no n j ay pa ay del no md ay va ay n c no s c ay geo ay mr gerry moved that in the election of president by the house of representatives no state shall vote by less than three members and where that number may not be allotted to a state it shall be made up by its senators and a concurrence of a majority of all the states shall be necessary to make such choice without some such provision five individuals might possibly be competent to an election these being a majority of two thirds of the existing number of states and two thirds being a quorum for this business mr madison  ded the motion mr read observed that the states having but one member only in the house of reps would be in danger of having no vote at all in the election the sickness or absence either of the representative or one of the senators would have that effect mr madison replied that if one member of the house of representatives should be left capable of voting for the state the states having one representative only would still be subject to that danger he thought it an evil that so small a number at any rate should be authorized to elect corruption would be greatly facilitated by it the mode itself was     liable to this further weighty objection that the representatives of a minority of the people might reverse the choice of a majority of the states and of the people he wished some cure for this inconveniency might yet be provided mr gerry withdrew the first part of his motion and on the question on the  d part viz and a concurrence of a majority of all the states shall be necessary to make such choice to follow the words a member or members from two thirds of the states—it was agreed to nem con the section   see sepr   requiring that the president should be a naturalborn citizen c  have been resident for fourteen years  be thirty five years of age was agreed to nem con section   see sepr   the vice president shall be exofficio president of the senate mr gerry opposed this regulation we might as well put the president himself at the head of the legislature the close intimacy that must subsist between the president  vicepresident makes it absolutely improper he was agst having any vice president mr govr morris the vice president then will be the first heir apparent that ever loved his father if there should be no vice president the president of the senate would be temporary successor which would amount to the same thing mr sherman saw no danger in the case if the vicepresident were not to be president of the senate he would be without employment and some     member by being made president must be deprived of his vote unless when an equal division of votes might happen in the senate which would be but seldom mr randolph concurred in the opposition to the clause mr williamson observed that such an officer as vicepresident was not wanted he was introduced only for the sake of a valuable mode of election which required two to be chosen at the same time col mason thought the office of vicepresident an encroachment on the rights of the senate and that it mixed too much the legislative  executive which as well as the judiciary departments ought to be kept as separate as possible he took occasion to express his dislike of any reference whatever of the power to make appointments to either branch of the legislature on the other hand he was averse to vest so dangerous a power in the president alone as a method for avoiding both he suggested that a privy council of six members to the president should be established to be chosen for six years by the senate two out of the eastern two out of the middle and two out of the southern quarters of the union  to go out in rotation two every second year the concurrence of the senate to be required only in the appointment of ambassadors and in making treaties which are more of a legislative nature this would prevent the constant sitting of the senate which he thought dangerous as well as keep the departments separate  distinct     it would also save the expence of constant sessions of the senate he had he said always considered the senate as too unwieldy  expensive for appointing officers especially the smallest such as tide waiters c he had not reduced his idea to writing but it could be easily done if it should be found acceptable on the question shall the vice president be ex officio president of the senate n h ay mas ay ct ay n j no pa ay del ay mar no va ay n c abst s c ay geo ay the other parts of the same section   were then agreed to the section  —to wit the president by  with the advice and consent of the senate shall have power to make treaties c mr wilson moved to add after the word senate the words and house of representatives as treaties he said are to have the operation of laws they ought to have the sanction of laws also the circumstance of secrecy in the business of treaties formed the only objection but this he thought so far as it was inconsistent with obtaining the legislative sanction was outweighed by the necessity of the latter mr sherman thought the only question that could be made was whether the power could be safely trusted to the senate he thought it could and that the necessity of secrecy in the case of treaties forbade a reference of them to the whole legislature mr fitzimmons  ded the motion of mr wilson      on the question n h no mas no ct no n j no pa ay del no md no va ay n c no s c no geo no the first sentence as to making treaties was then agreed to nem con he shall nominate c appoint ambassadors c mr wilson objected to the mode of appointing as blending a branch of the legislature with the executive good laws are of no effect without a good executive and there can be no good executive without a responsible appointment of officers to execute responsibility is in a manner destroyed by such an agency of the senate he would prefer the council proposed by col mason provided its advice should not be made obligatory on the president mr pinkney was against joining the senate in these appointments except in the instances of ambassadors who he thought ought not to be appointed by the president mr govr morris said that as the president was to nominate there would be responsibility and as the senate was to concur there would be security as congress now make appointments there is no responsibility mr gerry the idea of responsibility in the nomination to offices is chimerical the president cannot know all characters and can therefore always plead ignorance mr king as the idea of a council proposed by     col mason has been supported by mr wilson he would remark that most of the inconveniences charged on the senate are incident to a council of advice he differed from those who thought the senate would sit constantly he did not suppose it was meant that all the minute officers were to be appointed by the senate or any other original source but by the higher officers of the departments to which they belong he was of opinion also that the people would be alarmed at an unnecessary creation of new corps which must increase the expence as well as influence of the government on the question on these words in the clause viz—he shall nominate  by  with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors and other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court agreed to nem con the insertion of and consuls having first taken place on the question on the following words and all other officers

shall have power to make treaties—but no treaty shall be made without  00 the consent of two thirds of the members present—this last clause being before the house mr wilson thought it objectionable to require the concurrence of ⅔ which puts it into the power of a minority to controul the will of a majority mr king concurred in the objection remarking that as the executive was here joined in the business there was a check which did not exist in congress where the concurrence of ⅔ was required mr madison moved to insert after the word treaty the words except treaties of peace allowing these to be made with less difficulty than other treaties—it was agreed to nem con mr madison then moved to authorize a concurrence of two thirds of the senate to make treaties of peace without the concurrence of the president—the president he said would necessarily derive so much power and importance from a state of war that he might be tempted if authorized to impede a treaty of peace mr butler  ded the motion mr gorham thought the precaution unnecessary as the means of carrying on the war would not be in the hands of the president but of the legislature mr govr morris thought the power of the president in this case harmless and that no peace ought to be made without the concurrence of the president who was the general guardian of the national interests mr butler was strenuous for the motion as a necessary security against ambitious  corrupt presidents he mentioned the late perfidious policy of the statholder in holland and the artifices of the duke of  0  marlbro to prolong the war of which he had the management mr gerry was of opinion that in treaties of peace a greater rather than less proportion of votes was necessary than in other treaties in treaties of peace the dearest interests will be at stake as the fisheries territory c in treaties of peace also there is more danger to the extremities of the continent of being sacrificed than on any other occasions mr williamson thought that treaties of peace should be guarded at least by requiring the same concurrence as in other treaties on the motion of mr madison  mr butler n h no mas no ct no n j no pa no del

no and may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices being before the house col mason  said that in rejecting a council to the president we were about to try an experiment on which the most despotic government had never ventured the grand signor himself had his divan  0  he moved to postpone the consideration of the clause in order to take up the following that it be an instruction to the committee of the states to prepare a clause or clauses for establishing an executive council as a council of state for the president of the u states to consist of six members two of which from the eastern two from the middle and two from the southern states with a rotation and duration of office similar to those of the senate such council to be appointed by the legislature or by the senate doctor franklin  ded the motion we seemed he said too much to fear cabals in appointments by a number and to have too much confidence in those of single persons experience shewed that caprice the intrigues of favorites  mistresses were nevertheless the means most prevalent in monarchies among instances of abuse in such modes of appointment he mentioned the many bad governors appointed in g b for the colonies he thought a council would not only be a check on a bad president but be a relief to a good one mr govr morris the question of a council was considered in the committee where it was judged that the presidt by persuading his council to concur in his wrong measures would acquire their protection for them mr wilson approved of a council in preference to making the senate a party to appointmts mr dickinson was for a council it wd be a singular thing if the measures of the executive were  0  not to undergo some previous discussion before the president mr madison was in favor of the instruction to the committee proposed by col mason the motion of mr mason

concurrence of two thirds of the members of the senate present mr king it will be necessary to look out for securities for some other rights if this principle be established he moved to extend the motion—to all present rights of the u states adjourned saturday september  th in convention the last report of the committee of eleven see sepr   was resumed mr king moved to strike out the exception of  0  treaties of peace from the general clause requiring two thirds of the senate for making treaties mr wilson wished the requisition of two thirds to be struck out altogether if the majority cannot be trusted it was a proof as observed by mr ghorum that we were not fit for one society a reconsideration of the whole clause was agreed to mr govr morris was agst striking out the exception of treaties of peace if two thirds of the senate should be required for peace the legislature will be unwilling to make war for that reason on account of the fisheries or the mississippi the two great objects of the union besides if a majority of the senate be for peace and are not allowed to make it they will be apt to effect their purpose in the more disagreeable mode of negativing the supplies for the war mr williamson remarked that treaties are to be made in the branch of the govt where there may be a majority of the states without a majority of the people eight men may be a majority of a quorum  should not have the power to decide the conditions of peace there would be no danger that the exposed states as s carolina or georgia would urge an improper war for the western territory mr wilson if two thirds are necessary to make peace the minority may perpetuate war against the sense of the majority mr gerry enlarged on the danger of putting the essential rights of the union in the hands of so small  0  a number as a majority of the senate representing perhaps not one fifth of the people the senate will be corrupted by foreign influence mr sherman was agst leaving the rights established by the treaty of peace to the senate  moved to annex a proviso that no such rights shd be ceded without the sanction of the legislature mr govr morris seconded the ideas of mr sherman mr

misdemesnor the president under these circumstances was made improperly dependent he would prefer the supreme court for the trial of impeachments or rather a tribunal of which that should form a part mr govr morris thought no other tribunal than the senate could be trusted the supreme court were too few in number and might be warped or corrupted he was agst a dependence of the executive on the legislature considering the legislative tyranny the great danger to be apprehended but there could be no danger that the senate would say untruly on their oaths that the president was guilty of crimes or facts especially as in four years he can be turned out mr pinkney disapproved of making the senate the court of impeachments as rendering the president too dependent on the legislature if he opposes a favorite law the two houses will combine agst him and under the influence of heat and faction throw him out of office mr williamson thought there was more danger of too much lenity than of too much rigour towards the president considering the number of cases in which the senate was associated with the president mr sherman regarded the supreme court as improper to try the president

question n h ay mas no ct ay n j ay pa no del ay md ay va no n c ay s c no geo ay a committee was then appointed by ballot to revise the stile of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house the committee consisted of mr johnson mr hamilton mr govr morris mr madison and mr king mr williamson moved that previous to this work of the committee the clause relating to the number of the house of representatives shd be reconsidered for the purpose of increasing the number mr madison  ded the motion mr sherman opposed it he thought the provision on that subject amply sufficient col hamilton expressed himself with great earnestness and anxiety in favor of the motion he avowed himself a friend to a vigorous government but would declare at the same time that he held it essential that the popular branch of it should be on a broad foundation he was seriously of opinion that the house of representatives was on so narrow a scale as to be really dangerous and to warrant a jealousy in the people for their liberties he remarked that the connection between the president  senate would tend to perpetuate him by corrupt influence it was the more necessary on this account that a numerous representation in the other branch of the legislature should be established     on the motion of mr williamson to reconsider it was negatived  n h no mas no ct no n j no pa ay del ay md ay va

amendment of this constitution the legislature of the u s shall call a convention for that purpose see aug   this constitution he said is to be paramount to the state constitutions it follows hence from this article that two thirds of the states may obtain a convention a majority of which can bind the union to innovations that may subvert the state constitutions altogether he asked whether this was a situation proper to be run into mr hamilton  ded the motion but he said with a different view from mr gerry he did not object     to the consequences stated by mr gerry there was no greater evil in subjecting the people of the u s to the major voice than the people of a particular state it had been wished by many and was much to have been desired that an easier mode of introducing amendments had been provided by the articles of the confederation it was equally desirable now that an easy mode should be established for supplying defects which will probably appear in the new system the mode proposed was not adequate the state legislatures will not apply for alterations but with a view to increase their own powers the national legislature will be the first to perceive and will be most sensible to the necessity of amendments and ought also to be empowered whenever two thirds of each branch should concur to call a convention there could be no danger in giving this power as the people would finally decide in the case mr madison remarked on the vagueness of the terms call a convention for the purpose as sufficient reason for reconsidering the article how was a convention to be formed by what rule decide what the force of its acts on the motion of mr gerry to reconsider n h divd mas ay ct ay n j no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr sherman moved to add to the

mr wilson moved to insert two thirds of before the words several states—on which amendment to the motion of mr sherman n h ay mas no ct no n j no pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c no s c no geo no mr wilson then moved to insert three fourths of before the several sts which was agreed to nem con mr madison moved to postpone the consideration of the amended proposition in order to take up the following the legislature of the u s whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem necessary or on the application of two thirds of the legislatures of the several states shall propose amendments to this constitution which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part thereof when the same shall have been ratified by three fourths at least of the legislatures of the several states or by conventions in three fourths thereof as one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the legislature of the u s mr hamilton  ded the motion mr rutlidge said he never could agree to give a power by which the articles relating to slaves might be altered by the states not interested in that property and prejudiced against it in order to obviate     this objection these words were added to the proposition  provided that no amendments which may be made prior to the year   0  shall in any manner affect the      sections of the vii article—the postponement being agreed to on the question on the proposition of mr madison  mr hamilton as amended n h divd mas ay ct ay n j ay pa ay del no md ay va ay n c ay s c ay geo ay mr gerry moved to reconsider art xxi and xxii from the latter of which for the approbation of congs had been struck out he objected to proceeding to change the government without the approbation of congress as being improper and giving just umbrage to that body he repeated his objections also to an annulment of the confederation with so little scruple or formality mr hamilton concurred with mr gerry as to the indecorum of not requiring the approbation of congress he considered this as a necessary ingredient in the transaction he thought it wrong also to allow nine states as provided by art xxi to institute a new government on the ruins of the existing one he wd propose as a better modification of the two articles xxi  xxii that the plan should be sent to congress in order that the same if approved by them may be communicated to     the state legislatures to the end that they may refer it to state conventions each legislature declaring that if the convention of the state should think the plan ought to take effect among nine ratifying states the same shd take effect accordingly mr gorham some states will say that nine states shall be sufficient to establish the plan others will require unanimity for the purpose and the different and conditional ratifications will defeat the plan altogether mr hamilton no convention convinced of the necessity of the plan will refuse to give it effect on the adoption by nine states he thought this mode less exceptionable than the one proposed in the article while it would attain the same end mr fitzimmons remarked that the words for their approbation had been struck out in order to save congress from the necessity of an act inconsistent with the articles of confederation under which they held their authority mr randolph declared if no change should be made in this part of the plan he should be obliged to dissent from the whole of it he had from the beginning he said been convinced that radical changes in the system of the union were necessary under this conviction he had brought forward a set of republican propositions as the basis and outline of a reform these republican propositions had however much to his regret been widely and in his opinion irreconcileably departed from in this state of things it was his idea and he accordingly     meant to propose that the state conventions shd be at liberty to offer amendments to the plan and that these should be submitted to a second general convention with full power to settle the constitution finally he did not expect to succeed in this proposition but the discharge of his duty in making the attempt would give quiet to his own mind mr wilson was against a reconsideration for any of the purposes which had been mentioned mr king thought it would be more respectful to congress to submit the plan generally to them than in such a form as expressly and necessarily to require their approbation or disapprobation the assent of nine states he considered as sufficient and that it was more proper to make this a part of the constitution itself than to provide for it by a supplemental or distinct recommendation mr gerry urged the indecency and pernicious tendency of dissolving in so slight a manner the solemn obligations of the articles of confederation if nine out of thirteen can dissolve the compact six out of nine will be just as able to dissolve the new one hereafter mr sherman was in favor of mr kings idea of submitting the plan generally to congress he thought nine states ought to be made sufficient but that it would be best to make it a separate act and in some such form as that intimated by col hamilton than to make it a particular article of the constitution on the question for reconsidering the two articles xxi  xxii—     n h divd mas no ct ay n j ay pa no del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c no geo ay mr hamilton then moved to postpone art xxi in order to take up the following containing the ideas he had above expressed viz resolved that the foregoing plan of a constitution be transmitted to the u s in congress assembled in order that if the same shall be agreed to by them it may be communicated to the legislatures of the several states to the end that they may provide for its final ratification by referring the same to the consideration of a convention of deputies in each state to be chosen by the people thereof and that it be recommended to the said legislatures in their respective acts for organizing such convention to declare that if the said convention shall approve of the said constitution such approbation shall be binding and conclusive upon the state and further that if the said convention should be of opinion that the same upon the assent of any nine states thereto ought to take effect between the states so assenting such opinion shall thereupon be also binding upon such a state and the said constitution shall take effect between the states assenting thereto mr gerry  ded the motion mr wilson this motion being seconded it is necessary now to speak freely he expressed in strong terms his disapprobation of the expedient proposed particularly the suspending the plan of the convention on the approbation of congress he     declared it to be worse than folly to rely on the concurrence of the rhode island members of congs in the plan maryland has voted on this floor for requiring the unanimous assent of the    states to the proposed change in the federal system n york has not been represented for a long time past in the convention many individual deputies from other states have spoken much against the plan under these circumstances can it be safe to make the assent of congress necessary after spending four or five months in the laborious  arduous task of forming a government for our country we are ourselves at the close throwing insuperable obstacles in the way of its success mr clymer thought that the mode proposed by mr hamilton would fetter  embarrass congs as much as the original one since it equally involved a breach of the articles of confederation mr king concurred with mr clymer if congress can accede to one mode they can to the other if the approbation of congress be made necessary and they should not approve the state legislatures will not propose the plan to conventions or if the states themselves are to provide that nine states shall suffice to establish the system that provision will be omitted every thing will go into confusion and all our labor be lost mr rutlidge viewed the matter in the same light with mr king on the question to postpone in order to take up col hamiltons motion   0 n h no mas no ct ay n j no pa no del no md no va no n c no s c no geo no a question being then taken on the article xxi it was agreed to unanimously col hamilton withdrew the remainder of the motion to postpone art xxii observing that his purpose was defeated by the vote just given mr williamson  mr gerry moved to reinstate the words for the approbation of congress in art xxii which was disagreed to nem con mr randolph took this opportunity to state his objections to the system they turned on the senates being made the court of impeachment for trying the executive—on the necessity of ¾ instead of ⅔ of each house to overrule the negative of the president—on the smallness of the number of the representative branch—on the want of limitation to a standing army—on the general clause concerning necessary and proper laws—on the want of some particular restraint on navigation acts—on the power to lay duties on exports—on the authority of the general legislature to interpose on the application of the executives of the states—on the want of a more definite boundary between the general  state legislatures—and between the general and state judiciaries—on the unqualified power of the president to pardon treasons—on the want of some limit to the power of the legislature in regulating their own compensations with these difficulties in his mind what course he asked was he to pursue     was he to promote the establishment of a plan which he verily believed would end in tyranny he was unwilling he said to impede the wishes and judgment of the convention but he must keep himself free in case he should be honored with a seat in the convention of his state to act according to the dictates of his judgment the only mode in which his embarrassments could be removed was that of submitting the plan to congs to go from them to the state legislatures and from these to state conventions having power to adopt reject or amend the process to close with another general convention with full power to adopt or reject the alterations proposed by the state conventions and to establish finally the government he accordingly proposed a resolution to this effect docr franklin  ded the motion col mason urged  obtained that the motion should lie on the table for a day or two to see what steps might be taken with regard to the parts of the system objected to by mr randolph mr pinkney moved that it be an

of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same     governer morris september    letter  we have now the honor to submit to the consideration of the united states in congress assembled that constitution which has appeared to us the most advisable the friends of our country have long seen and desired that the power of making war peace and treaties that of levying money  regulating commerce and the correspondent executive and judicial authorities should be fully and effectually vested in the general government of the union but the impropriety of delegating such extensive trust to one body of men is evident hence results the necessity of a different organization it is obviously impracticable in the fœderal government of these states to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each and yet provide for the interest and safety of all individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest the magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circumstances as on the object to be obtained it is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered and those which may be reserved and on the present occasion this difficulty was increased by a difference among the several states as to their situation extent habits and particular interests in all our deliberations on this subject we kept steadily in     our view that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true american the consolidation of our union in which is involved our prosperity felicity safety perhaps our national existence this important consideration seriously and deeply impressed on our minds led each state in the convention to be less rigid in points of inferior magnitude than might have been otherwise expected and thus the constitution which we now present is the result of a spirit of amity and of that mutual deference  concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable that it will meet the full and entire approbation of every state is not perhaps to be expected but each will doubtless consider that had her interests been alone consulted the consequences might have been particularly disagreable or injurious to others that it is liable to as few exceptions as could reasonably have been expected we hope and believe that it may promote the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all and secure her freedom and happiness is our most ardent wish— mr williamson moved to reconsider the clause requiring three fourths of each house to overrule the negative of the president in order to strike out ¾ and insert ⅔ he had he remarked himself proposed ¾ instead of ⅔ but he had since been convinced that the latter proportion was the best the former puts too much in the power of the president mr sherman was of the same opinion adding that the states would not like to see so small a minority and the president prevailing over the general voice in making laws regard should be had to the sense of the people who are to be bound by them and it was more probable that a single man should mistake or betray this sense than the legislature     mr govr morris considering the difference between the two proportions numerically it amounts in one house to two members only and in the others to not more than five according to the numbers of which the legislature is at first to be composed it is the interest moreover of the distant states to prefer ¾ as they will be oftenest absent and need the interposing check of the president the excess rather than the deficiency of laws was to be dreaded the example of n york shews that ⅔ is not sufficient to answer the purpose mr hamilton added his testimony to the fact that ⅔ in n york had been ineffectual either where a popular object or a legislative faction operated of which he mentioned some instances mr gerry it is necessary to consider the danger on the other side also ⅔ will be a considerable perhaps a proper security ¾ puts too much in the power of a few men the primary object of the revisionary check in the president is not to protect the general interest but to defend his own department if ¾ be required a few senators having hopes from the nomination of the president to offices will combine with him and impede proper laws making the vicepresident speaker increases the danger mr williamson was less afraid of too few than of too many laws he was most of all afraid that the repeal of bad laws might be rendered too difficult by requiring ¾ to overcome the dissent of the president col mason had always considered this as one of the most exceptionable parts of the system as to   0 the numerical argument of mr govr morris little arithmetic was necessary to understand that ¾ was more than ⅔ whatever the numbers of the legislature might be the example of new york depended on the real merits of the laws the gentlemen citing it had no doubt given their own opinions but perhaps there were others of opposite opinions who could equally paint the abuses on the other side his leading view was to guard against too great an impediment to the repeal of laws mr govr morris dwelt on the danger to the public interest from the instability of laws as the most to be guarded against on the other side there could be little danger if one man in office will not consent where he ought every fourth year another can be substituted this term was not too long for fair experiments many good laws are not tried long enough to prove their merit this is often the case with new laws opposed to old habits the inspection laws of virginia  maryland to which all are now so much attached were unpopular at first mr pinkney was warmly in opposition to ¾ as putting a dangerous power in the hands of a few senators headed by the president mr madison when ¾ was agreed to the president was to be elected by the legislature and for seven years he is now to be elected by the people and for four years the object of the revisionary power is two fold   to defend the executive rights   to prevent popular or factious injustice it was     an important principle in this  in the state constitutions to check legislative injustice and encroachments the experience of the states had demonstrated that their checks are insufficient we must compare the danger from the weakness of ⅔ with the danger from the strength of ¾ he thought on the whole the former was the greater as to the difficulty of repeals it was probable that in doubtful cases the policy would soon take place of limiting the duration of laws so as to require renewal instead of repeal the reconsideration being agreed to on the question to insert ⅔ in place of ¾ n h

provision was yet made for juries in civil cases and suggested the necessity of it mr gorham it is not possible to discriminate equity cases from those in which juries are proper the representatives of the people may be safely trusted in this matter mr gerry urged the necessity of juries to guard agst corrupt judges he proposed that the committee last appointed should be directed to provide a clause for securing the trial by juries col mason perceived the difficulty mentioned by mr gorham the jury cases cannot be specified a general principle laid down on this and some other     points would be sufficient he wished the plan had been prefaced with a bill of rights  would second a motion if made for the purpose it would give great quiet to the people and with the aid of the state declarations a bill might be prepared in a few hours mr gerry concurred in the idea  moved for a committee to prepare a bill of rights col mason  ded the motion mr sherman was for securing the rights of the people where requisite the state declarations of rights are not repealed by this constitution and being in force are sufficient there are many cases where juries are proper which cannot be discriminated the legislature may be safely trusted col mason the laws of the u s are to be paramount to state bills of rights on the question for a come to prepare a bill of rights n h no mas abst ct no n j no pa no del no md no va no n c no s c no geo no the clause relating to exports being reconsidered at the instance of col mason who urged that the restriction on the states would prevent the incidental duties necessary for the inspection  safekeeping of their produce and be ruinous to the staple states as he called the five southern states he moved as follows—provided nothing herein contained shall be construed to restrain any state from laying duties upon exports for the sole purpose of defraying the charges of inspecting packing storing     and indemnifying the losses in keeping the commodities in the care of public officers before exportation in answer to a remark which he anticipated to wit that the states could provide for these expences by a tax in some other way he stated the inconveniency of requiring the planters to pay a tax before the actual delivery for exportation mr madison  ded the motion it would at least be harmless and might have the good effect of restraining the states to bona fide duties for the purpose as well as of authorizing explicitly such duties tho perhaps the best guard against an abuse of the power of the states on this subject was the right in the genl government to regulate trade between state  state mr govr morris saw no objection to the motion he did not consider the dollar per hhd laid on tobo in virga as a duty on exportation as no drawback would be allowed on tobo taken out of the warehouse for internal consumption mr dayton was afraid the proviso wd enable pennsylva to tax n jersey under the idea of inspection duties of which pena would judge mr gorham  mr langdon thought there would be no security if the proviso shd be agreed to for the states exporting thro other states agst these oppressions of the latter how was redress to be obtained in case duties should be laid beyond the purpose expressed mr madison there will be the same security as in other cases the jurisdiction of the supreme     court must be the source of redress so far only had provision been made by the plan agst injurious acts of the states his own opinion was that this was sufficient a negative on the state laws alone could meet all the shapes which these could assume but this had been overruled mr fitzimmons incidental duties on tobo  flour never have been  never can be considered as duties on exports mr dickinson nothing will save the states in the situation of n hampshire n jersey delaware c from being oppressed by their neighbors but requiring the assent of congs to inspection duties he moved that this assent shd accordingly be required mr butler  ded the motion adjourned thursday sepr         in convention col mason  he had moved without success for a power to make sumptuary regulations he had not

provided that no state shall be restrained from imposing the usual duties on produce exported from such state for the sole purpose of defraying the charges of inspecting packing storing and indemnifying the losses on such produce while in the custody of public officers but all such regulations shall in case of abuse be subject to the revision and controul of congress there was no debate

which would be created not increased by congs at their first session the members of the first congs consequently might evade the disqualification in this instance—he was neither seconded nor opposed

same manner with other officers mr gorham  mr king said that the motion if agreed to would have a mischievous tendency the     people are accustomed  attached to that mode of appointing treasurers and the innovation will multiply objections to the system mr govr morris remarked that if the treasurer be not appointed by the legislature he will be more narrowly watched and more readily impeached mr sherman as the two houses appropriate money it is best for them to appoint the officer who is to keep it and to appoint him as they make the appropriation not by joint but several votes genl pinkney the treasurer is appointed by joint ballot in south carolina the consequence is that bad appointments are made and the legislature will not listen to the faults of their own officer on the motion to

the law of nations which depended on the authority of all the     civilized nations of the world would have a look of arrogance that would make us ridiculous mr govr morris the word define is proper

may be made a source of revenue mr madison suggested an enlargement of the motion into a power to grant charters of incorporation where the interest of the u s might require  the legislative provisions of individual states may be incompetent his primary object was however to secure an easy communication between the states which the free intercourse now to be opened seemed to call for the political obstacles being removed a removal of the natural ones as far as possible ought to follow mr randolph  ded the proposition     mr king thought the power unnecessary mr wilson it is necessary to prevent a state from obstructing the general welfare mr king the states will be prejudiced and divided into parties by it in philada  new york it will be referred to the establishment of a bank which has been a subject of contention in those cities in other places it will be referred to mercantile monopolies mr wilson mentioned the importance of facilitating by canals the communication with the western settlements as to banks he did not think with mr king that the power in that point of view would excite the prejudices  parties apprehended as to mercantile monopolies they are already included in the power to regulate trade col mason was for limiting the power to the single case of canals he was afraid of monopolies of every sort which he did not think were by any means already

time of peace mr randolph  ded the motion mr madison was in favor of it it did not restrain congress from establishing a military force in time of peace if found necessary and as armies in time of peace are allowed on all hands to be an evil it is well to discountenance them by the constitution as far as will consist with the essential power of the govt on that head mr govr morris opposed the

prepared he considered it of great importance that such an one should accompany the constitution the people had been accustomed to such on great occasions and would expect it on this he moved that a committee be appointed for the special purpose of preparing an address mr rutlidge objected on account of the delay it would produce and the impropriety of addressing the people before it was known whether congress would approve and support the plan congress if an address be thought proper can prepare as good a one the members of the convention can also explain the reasons of what has been done

state shall be restrained from laying duties of tonnage for the purpose of clearing harbours and erecting lighthouses     col mason in support of this explained and urged the situation of the chesapeak which peculiarly required expences of this sort mr govr morris the states are not restrained from laying tonnage as the constitution now stands the exception proposed will imply the contrary and will put the states in a worse condition than the gentleman col mason wishes mr madison whether the states are now restrained from laying tonnage duties depends on the extent of the power to regulate commerce these terms are vague but seem to exclude this power of the states they may certainly be restrained by treaty he observed that there were other objects for tonnage duties as the support of seamen c he was more  more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority mr sherman the power of the u states to regulate trade being supreme can controul interferences of the state regulations when such interferences happen so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction mr langdon

instruments col mason supported the motion mr govr morris had rather there should be no pardon for treason than let the power devolve on the legislature     mr wilson pardon is necessary for cases of treason and is best placed in the hands of the executive if he be himself a party to the guilt he can be impeached and prosecuted mr king thought it would be inconsistent with the constitutional separation of the executive  legislative powers to let the prerogative be exercised by the latter a legislative body is utterly unfit for the purpose they are governed too much by the passions of the moment in massachusetts one assembly would have hung all the insurgents in that state the next was equally disposed to pardon them all he suggested the expedient of requiring the concurrence of the senate in acts of pardon mr madison admitted the force of objections to the legislature but the pardon of treasons was so peculiarly improper for the president that he should acquiesce in the transfer of it to the former rather than leave it altogether in the hands of the latter he would prefer to either an association of the senate as a council of advice with the president mr randolph could not admit the senate into a share of the power the great danger to liberty lay in a combination between the president  that body col mason the senate has already too much power there can be no danger of

conventions in three fourths thereof as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the congress provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year   0  shall in any manner affect the      clauses in the   section of article   mr sherman expressed his fears that three fourths of the states might be brought to do things fatal to particular states as abolishing them altogether or depriving them of their equality in the senate he thought it reasonable that the proviso in favor of the states importing slaves should be extended so as to provide that no state should be affected in its internal police or deprived of its equality in the senate col mason thought the plan of amending the constitution exceptionable  dangerous as the proposing of amendments is in both the modes to depend in the first immediately and in the second ultimately on congress no amendments of the proper kind would ever be obtained by the people     if the government should become oppressive as he verily believed would be the case mr govr morris  mr gerry moved to amend the article so as to require a convention on application of ⅔ of the sts mr madison did not see why congress would not be as much bound to propose amendments applied for by two thirds of the states as to call a convention on the like application he saw no objection however against providing for a convention for the purpose of amendments except only that difficulties might arise as to the form the quorum c which in constitutional regulations ought to be as much as possible avoided the motion of mr govr

should this proposition be disregarded it would he said be impossible for him to put his name to the instrument whether he should oppose it afterwards he would not then decide but he would not deprive himself of the freedom to do so in his own state if that course should be prescribed by his final judgment col mason  ded  followed mr randolph in animadversions on the dangerous power and structure of the government concluding that it would end either in monarchy or a tyrannical aristocracy which he was in doubt but one or other he was     sure this constitution had been formed without the knowledge or idea of the people a second convention will know more of the sense of the people and be able to provide a system more consonant to it it was improper to say to the people take this or nothing as the constitution now stands he could neither give it his support or vote in virginia and he could not sign here what he could not support there with the expedient of another convention as proposed he could sign mr pinkney these declarations from members so respectable at the close of this important scene give a peculiar solemnity to the present moment he descanted on the consequences of calling forth the deliberations  amendments of the different states on the subject of government at large nothing but confusion  contrariety could spring from the experiment the states will never agree in their plans and the deputies to a second convention coming together under the discordant impressions of their constituents will never agree conventions are serious things and ought not to be repeated he was not without objections as well as others to the plan he objected to the contemptible weakness  dependence of the executive he objected to the power of a majority only of congs over commerce but apprehending the danger of a general confusion and an ultimate decision by the sword he should give the plan his support mr gerry stated the objections which determined him to withhold his name from the constitution       the duration and reeligibility of the senate   the power of the house of representatives to conceal their journals   the power of congress over the places of election   the unlimited power of congress over their own compensation   massachusetts has not a due share of representatives allotted to her   ⅗ of the blacks are to be represented as if they were freemen   under the power over commerce monopolies may be established   the vice president being made head of the senate he could however he said get over all these if the rights of the citizens were not rendered insecure   by the general power of the legislature to make what laws they may please to call necessary and proper   raise armies and money without limit   to establish a tribunal without juries which will be a starchamber as to civil cases under such a view of the constitution the best that could be done he conceived was to provide for a second general convention on the question on the proposition of mr randolph all the states answered no on the question to agree to the constitution as amended all the states ay the constitution was then ordered to be engrossed and the house adjourned monday sepr         in convention the engrossed constitution being read docr franklin rose with a speech in his hand which     he had reduced to writing for his own conveniency and which mr wilson read in the words following mr president i confess that there are several parts of this constitution which i do not at present approve but i am not sure i shall never approve them for having lived long i have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration to change opinions even on important subjects which i once thought right but found to be otherwise it is therefore that the older i grow the more apt i am to doubt my own judgment and to pay more respect to the judgment of others most men indeed as well as most sects in religion think themselves in possession of all truth and that wherever others differ from them it is so far error steele a protestant in a dedication tells the pope that the only difference between our churches in their opinions of the certainty of their doctrines is the church of rome is infallible and the church of england is never in the wrong but though many private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of their sect few express it so naturally as a certain french lady who in a dispute with her sister said i dont know how it happens sister but i meet with nobody but myself that is always in the right—il ny a que moi qui a toujours raison in these sentiments sir i agree to this constitution with all its faults if they are such because i think a general government necessary for us and there is no form of government but what may be a     blessing to the people if well administered and believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years and can only end in despotism as other forms have done before it when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government being incapable of any other i doubt too whether any other convention we can obtain may be able to make a better constitution for when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble with those men all their prejudices their passions their errors of opinion their local interests and their selfish views from such an assembly can a perfect production be expected it therefore astonishes me sir to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does and i think it will astonish our enemies who are waiting with confidence to hear that our councils are confounded like those of the builders of babel and that our states are on the point of separation only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting one anothers throats thus i consent sir to this constitution because i expect no better and because i am not sure that it is not the best the opinions i have had of its errors i sacrifice to the public good i have never whispered a syllable of them abroad within these walls they were born and here they shall die if every one of us in returning to our constituents were to report the objections he has had to it and endeavor to gain partizans in support of them we might prevent its being generally received and thereby lose all the     salutary effects  great advantages resulting naturally in our favor among foreign nations as well as among ourselves from our real or apparent unanimity much of the strength  efficiency of any government in procuring and securing happiness to the people depends on opinion on the general opinion of the goodness of the government as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors i hope therefore that for our own sakes as a part of the people and for the sake of posterity we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this constitution if approved by congress  confirmed by the conventions wherever our influence may extend and turn our future thoughts  endeavors to the means of having it well administered on the whole sir i cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the convention who may still have objections to it would with me on this occasion doubt a little of his own infallibility and to make manifest our unanimity put his name to this instrument—he then moved that the constitution be signed by the members and offered the following as a convenient form viz done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present the   th of sepr c—in witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names this ambiguous form had been drawn up by mr g m in order to gain the dissenting members and put into the hands of docr franklin that it might have the better chance of success mr gorham said if it was not too late he could     wish for the purpose of lessening objections to the constitution that the clause declaring the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every forty thousand which had produced so much discussion might be yet reconsidered in order to strike out  0000  insert thirty thousand this would not he remarked establish that as an absolute rule but only give congress a greater latitude which could not be thought unreasonable mr king  mr carrol seconded  supported the ideas of mr gorham when the president rose for the purpose of putting the question he said that although his situation had hitherto restrained him from offering his sentiments on questions depending in the house and it might be thought ought now to impose silence on him yet he could not forbear expressing his wish that the alteration proposed might take place it was much to be desired that the objections to the plan recommended might be made as few as possible the smallness of the proportion of representatives had been considered by many members of the convention an insufficient security for the rights  interests of the people he acknowledged that it had always appeared to himself among the exceptionable parts of the plan and late as the present moment was for admitting amendments he thought this of so much consequence that it would give much satisfaction to see it adopted      no opposition was made to the proposition of mr gorham and it was agreed to unanimously on the question to agree to the constitution enrolled in order to be signed it was agreed to all the states answering ay mr randolph then rose and with an allusion to the observations of docr franklin apologized for his refusing to sign the constitution notwithstanding the vast majority  venerable names that would give sanction to its wisdom and its worth he said however that he did not mean by this refusal to decide that he should oppose the constitution without doors he meant only to keep himself free to be governed by his duty as it should be prescribed by his future judgment he refused to sign because he thought the object of the convention would be frustrated by the alternative which it presented to the people nine states will fail to ratify the plan and confusion must ensue with such a view of the subject he ought not he could not by pledging himself to support the plan restrain himself from taking such steps as might appear to him most consistent with the public good mr govr morris said that he too had objections but considering the present plan as the best that was to be attained he should take it with all its faults the majority had determined in its favor and by that determination he should abide the moment this plan goes forth all other considerations will be laid aside and the great question will be shall there be a national government or not and this must take     place or a general anarchy will be the alternative he remarked that the signing in the form proposed related only to the fact that the states present were unanimous mr williamson suggested that the signing should be confined to the letter accompanying the constitution to congress which might perhaps do nearly as well and would be found satisfactory to some members  who disliked the constitution for himself he did not think a better plan was to be expected and had no scruples against putting his name to it mr hamilton expressed his anxiety that every member should sign a few characters of consequence by opposing or even refusing to sign the constitution might do infinite mischief by kindling the latent sparks which lurk under an enthusiasm in favor of the convention which may soon subside no mans ideas were more remote from the plan than his own were known to be but is it possible to deliberate between anarchy and convulsion on one side and the chance of good to be expected from the plan on the other mr blount  said he had declared that he would not sign so as to pledge himself in support of the plan but he was relieved by the form proposed and would     without committing himself attest the fact that the plan was the unanimous act of the states in convention docr franklin expressed his fears from what mr randolph had said that he thought himself alluded to in the remarks offered this morning to the house he declared that when drawing up that paper he did not know that any particular member would refuse to sign his name to the instrument and hoped to be so understood he possessed a high sense of obligation to mr randolph for having brought forward the plan in the first instance and for the assistance he had given in its progress and hoped that he would yet lay aside his objections and by concurring with his brethren prevent the great mischief which the refusal of his name might produce mr randolph could not but regard the signing in the proposed form as the same with signing the constitution the change of form therefore could make no difference with him he repeated that in refusing to sign the constitution he took a step which might be the most awful of his life but it was dictated by his conscience and it was not possible for him to hesitate much less to change he repeated also his persuasion that the holding out this plan with a final alternative to the people of accepting or rejecting it in toto would really produce the anarchy  civil convulsions which were apprehended from the refusal of individuals to sign it mr gerry described the painful feelings of his situation and the embarrassments under which he rose   0 to offer any further observations on the subject wch had been finally decided whilst the plan was depending he had treated it with all the freedom he thought it deserved he now felt himself bound as he was disposed to treat it with the respect due to the act of the convention he hoped he should not violate that respect in declaring on this occasion his fears that a civil war may result from the present crisis of the u s in massachusetts particularly he saw the danger of this calamitous event—in that state there are two parties one devoted to democracy the worst he thought of all political evils the other as violent in the opposite extreme from the collision of these in opposing and resisting the constitution confusion was greatly to be feared he had thought it necessary for this  other reasons that the plan should have been proposed in a more mediating shape in order to abate the heat and opposition of parties as it had been passed by the convention he was persuaded it would have a contrary effect he could not therefore by signing the constitution pledge himself to abide by it at all events the proposed form made no difference with him but if it were not otherwise apparent the refusals to sign should never be known from him alluding to the remarks of docr franklin he could not he said but view them as levelled at himself and the other gentlemen who meant not to sign genl pinkney we are not likely to gain many converts by the ambiguity of the proposed form of signing he thought it best to be candid and let the     form speak the substance if the meaning of the signers be left in doubt his purpose would not be answered he should sign the constitution with a view to support it with all his influence and wished to pledge himself accordingly docr franklin it is too soon to pledge ourselves before congress and our constituents shall have approved the plan mr ingersol  did not consider the signing either as a mere attestation of the fact or as pledging the signers to support the constitution at all events but as a recommendation of what all things considered was the most eligible on the motion of docr franklin n h ay mas ay ct ay n j ay pa ay del ay md ay va ay n c ay s c divd  geo ay mr king suggested that the journals of the convention should be either destroyed or deposited in the custody of the president he thought if suffered to be made public a bad use would be made of them by those who would wish to prevent the adoption of the constitution mr wilson preferd the second expedient he had at one time liked the first best but as false suggestions     may be propagated it should not be made impossible to contradict them a question was then put on depositing the journals and other papers of the convention in the hands of the president on which n h ay mtts ay ct ay n j ay pena ay del ay md no  va ay n c

he retain the journal and other papers subject to the order of congress if ever formed under the constitution the members then proceeded to sign the instrument whilst the last members were signing it doctr franklin looking towards the presidents chair at the back of which a rising sun happened to be painted observed to a few members near him that painters     had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun i have said he often and often in the course of the session and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue looked at that behind the president without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting but now at length i have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun the constitution being signed by all the members

monroe august        monroe mss cf kings account of the debate confirming the accuracy of madisons report kings life and correspondence of rufus king i       note to speech of j m in convention of      august  th as appointments for the general government here contemplated will in part be made by the state govts all the citizens in states where the right of suffrage is not limited to the holders of property will have an indirect share of representation in the general government but this does not satisfy the fundamental principle that men cannot be justly bound by laws in making which they have no part persons  property being both essential objects of government the most that either can claim is such a structure of it as will leave a reasonable security for the other and the most obvious provision of this double character seems to be that of confining to the holders of property the object deemed least secure in popular govts the right of suffrage for one of the two legislative branches this is not without example among us as well as other constitutional modifications favouring the influence of property in the government but the u s have not reached the stage of society in which conflicting feelings of the class with and the class without property have the operation natural to them in countries fully peopled the most difficult of all political arrangements is that of so adjusting the claims of the two classes as to give security to each and to promote the welfare of all the federal principle—which enlarges the sphere of power without departing from the elective basis of it and controuls in various ways the propensity in small republics to rash measures  the facility of forming  executing them will be found the best expedient yet tried for solving the problem—madisons note note to the speech of j m on the  th day of august these observations in the speech of j m see debates in the convention of      on the  th day of august do not convey the speakers more full  matured view of the subject which is subjoined he felt too much at the time the example of virginia the right of suffrage is a fundamental article in republican constitutions the regulation of it is at the same time a task of peculiar delicacy allow the right exclusively to property and the rights of persons may be oppressed the feudal polity alone sufficiently proves it extend it equally to all and the rights of property or the claims of justice may be overruled by a majority without property or interested in measures of injustice of this abundant proof is afforded by other popular govts and is not without examples in our own particularly in the laws impairing the obligation of contracts in civilized communities property as well as personal rights is an essential object of the laws which encourage industry by securing the enjoyment of its fruits that industry from which property results  that enjoyment which consists not merely in its immediate use but in its posthumous destination to objects of choice and of kindred affection in a just  a free government therefore the rights both of property  of persons ought to be effectually guarded will the former be so in case of a universal  equal suffrage will the latter be so in case of a suffrage confined to the holders of property as the holders of property have at stake all the other rights common to those without property they may be the more restrained from infringing as well as the less tempted to infringe the rights of the latter it is nevertheless certain that there are various ways in which the rich may oppress the poor in which property may oppress liberty and that the world is filled with examples it is necessary that the poor should have a defence against the danger on the other hand the danger to the holders of property cannot be disguised if they be undefended against a majority without property bodies of men are not less swayed by interest than individuals and are less controlled by the dread of reproach and the other motives felt by individuals hence the liability of the rights of property and of the impartiality of laws affecting it to be violated by legislative majorities having an interest real or supposed in the injustice hence agrarian laws and other leveling schemes hence the cancelling or evading of debts and other violations of contracts we must not shut our eyes to the nature of man nor to the light of experience who would rely on a fair decision from three individuals if two had an interest in the case opposed to the rights of the third make the number as great as you please the impartiality will not be increased nor any further security against injustice be obtained than what may result from the greater difficulty of uniting the wills of a greater number in all govts there is a power which is capable of oppressive exercise in monarchies and aristocracies oppression proceeds from a want of sympathy  responsibility in the govt towards the people in popular governments the danger lies in an undue sympathy among individuals composing a majority and a want of responsibility in the majority to the minority the characteristic excellence of the political system of the u s arises from a distribution and organization of its powers which at the same time that they secure the dependence of the govt on the will of the nation provides better guards than are found in any other popular govt against interested combinations of a majority against the rights of a minority the u states have a precious advantage also in the actual distribution of property particularly the landed property and in the universal hope of acquiring property this latter peculiarity is among the happiest contrasts in their situation to that of the old world where no anticipated change in this respect can generally inspire a like sympathy with the rights of property there may be at present a majority of the nation who are even freeholders or the heirs or aspirants to freeholds and the day may not be very near when such will cease to make up a majority of the community but they cannot always so continue with every admissible subdivision of the arable lands a populousness not greater than that of england or france will reduce the holders to a minority and whenever the majority shall be without landed or other equivalent property and without the means or hope of acquiring it what is to secure the rights of property agts the danger from an equality  universality of suffrage vesting compleat power over property in hands without a share in it not to speak of a danger in the meantime from a dependence of an increasing number on the wealth of a few in other countries this dependence results in some from the relations between landlords  tenants in others both from that source  from the relations between wealthy capitalists and indigent labourers in the u s the occurrence must happen from the last source from the connection between the great capitalists in manufactures  commerce and the numbers employed by them nor will accumulations of capital for a certain time be precluded by our laws of descent  of distribution such being the enterprise inspired by free institutions that great wealth in the hands of individuals and associations may not be unfrequent but it may be observed that the opportunities may be diminished and the permanency defeated by the equalizing tendency of our laws no free country has ever been without parties which are a natural offspring of freedom an obvious and permanent division of every people is into the owners of the soil and the other inhabitants in a certain sense the country may be said to belong to the former if each landholder has an exclusive property in his share the body of landholders have an exclusive property in the whole as the soil becomes subdivided and actually cultivated by the owners this view of the subject derives force from the principle of natural law which vests in individuals an exclusive right to the portions of ground with which he has incorporated his labour  improvements whatever may be the rights of others derived from their birth in the country from their interest in the highways  other parcels left open for common use as well as in the national edifices and monuments from their share in the public defence and from their concurrent support of the govt it would seem unreasonable to extend the right so far as to give them when become the majority a power of legislation over the landed property without the consent of the proprietors some barrier agst the invasion of their rights would not be out of place in a just and provident system of govt the principle of such an arrangement has prevailed in all govts where peculiar privileges or interests held by a part were to be secured agst violation and in the various associations where pecuniary or other property forms the stake in the former case a defensive right has been allowed and if the arrangement be wrong it is not in the defense but in the kind of privilege to be defended in the latter case the shares of suffrage allotted to individuals have been with acknowledged justice apportioned more or less to their respective interests in the common stock these reflections suggest the expediency of such a modification of govt as would give security to the part of the society having most at stake and being most exposed to danger three modifications present themselves   confining the right of suffrage to freeholders  to such as hold an equivalent property convertible of course into freeholds the objection to this regulation is obvious it violates the vital principle of free govt that those who are to be bound by laws ought to have a voice in making them and the violation wd be more strikingly unjust as the law makers become the minority the regulation would be as unpropitious also as it would be unjust it would engage the numerical  physical force in a constant struggle agst the public authority unless kept down by a standing army fatal to all parties   confining the right of suffrage for one branch to the holders of property and for the other branch to those without property this arrangement which wd give a mutual defence where there might be mutual danger of encroachment has an aspect of equality  fairness but it wd not be in fact either equal or fair because the rights to be defended would be unequal being on one side those of property as well as of persons and on the other those of persons only the temptation also to encroach tho in a certain degree mutual wd be felt more strongly on one side than on the other it would be more likely to beget an abuse of the legislative negative in extorting concessions at the expence of property than the reverse the division of the state into two classes with distinct  independt organs of power and without any intermingled agency whatever might lead to contests  antipathies not dissimilar to those between the patricians  plebeians at rome   confining the right of electing one branch of the legislature to freeholders and admitting all others to a common right with holders of property in electing the other branch this wd give a defensive power to holders of property and to the class also without property when becoming a majority of electors without depriving them in the meantime of a participation in the public councils if the holders of property would thus have a twofold share of representation they wd have at the same time a twofold stake in it the rights of property as well as of persons the twofold object of political institutions and if no exact  safe equilibrium can be introduced it is more reasonable that a preponderating weight shd be allowed to the greater interest than to the lesser experience alone can decide how far the practice in this case would correspond with the theory such a distribution of the right of suffrage was tried in n york and has been abandoned whether from experienced evils or party calculations may possibly be a question it is still on trial in n carolina with what practical indications is not known it is certain that the trial to be satisfactory ought to be continued for no inconsiderable period untill in fact the nonfreeholders should be the majority   should experience or public opinion require an equal  universal suffrage for each branch of the govt such as prevails generally in the u s a resource favorable to the rights of the landed  other property when its possessors become the minority may be found in an enlargement of the election districts for one branch of the legislature and an extension of its period of service large districts are manifestly favorable to the election of persons of general respectability and of probable attachment to the rights of property over competitors depending on the personal solicitation practicable on a contracted theatre and altho an ambitious candidate of personal distinction might occasionally recommend himself to popular choice by espousing a popular though unjust object it might rarely happen to many districts at the same time the tendency of a longer period of service would be to render the body more stable in its policy and more capable of stemming popular currents taking a wrong direction till reason  justice could regain their ascendancy   should even such a modification as the last be deemed inadmissible and universal suffrage and very short periods of elections within contracted spheres be required for each branch of the govt the security for the holders of property when the minority can only be derived from the ordinary influence possessed by property  the superior information incident to its holders from the popular sense of justice enlightened  enlarged by a diffusive education and from the difficulty of combining  effectuating unjust purposes throughout an extensive country a difficulty essentially distinguishing the u s  even most of the individual states from the small communities where a mistaken interest or contagious passion could readily unite a majority of the whole under a factious leader in trampling on the rights of the minor party under every view of the subject it seems indispensable that the mass of citizens should not be without a voice in making the laws which they are to obey  in chusing the magistrates who are to administer them and if the only alternative be between an equal  universal right of suffrage for each branch of the govt and a confinement of the entire right to a part of the citizens it is better that those having the greater interest at stake namely that of property  persons both should be deprived of half their share in the govt than that those having the lesser interest that of personal rights only should be deprived of the whole—madisons note   in the printed journal pennsylvania ay—madisons note   madison wrote to jefferson july    i have taken lengthy

are excluded from the legislatures—the business would be taken up unclogged with any other—and it would effectually call the attention of all the people to the object as seriously affecting them all

the liberty to indulge myself in communicating with you although i frankly confess that the existence of the state governments is an insuperable evil in a national point of view yet i do not well see how in this stage of the business they could be annihilated—and perhaps while they continue the frame of government could not with propriety be much higher toned than the one proposed it is so

acknowledge the scriptures of the old and new testement to be given by a devine inspiration—to swear and believe that the new testement was given by devine inspiration is absolutly against the religious principle of a jew and is against his conscience to take any such oath—by the above law a jew is deprived of holding any publick office or place of government which is a contridectory to the bill of right sect   viz that all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship almighty god according to the dectates of their own conscience and understanding and that no man aught or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship or erect or support any place of worship or maintain any minister contrary to or against his own free will and consent nor can any man who acknowledges the being of a god be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen on account of his religious sentiments or peculiar mode of religious worship and that no authority can or aught to be vested in or assumed by any power what ever that shall in any case interfere or in any manner controul the right of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship— it is well known among all the citizens of the    united states that the jews have been true and faithfull whigs and during the late contest with england they have been foremost in aiding and assisting the states with their lifes
