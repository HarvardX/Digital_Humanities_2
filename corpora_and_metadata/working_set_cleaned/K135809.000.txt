an examination of the principles contained in the age of reason  in ten discourses  by james muir d d minister of the presbyterian church alexandria  baltimore printed by s and j adams for the author and sold by clarke and keddie booksellers in marketstreet  mdccxcv bound by henry keainge  to the members of the presbyterian church residing at alexandria my dear friends and brethren discourses immediately for your use naturally claim your protection any publication in the form of sermons may be laid aside by many without examination with the name something forbidding is connected my sentiments on this interesting subject might have been conveyed under another form this is the most familiar it also admits great variety sober minds do not reject a dress which is decent and fit for the season because it is not altogether fashionable  the propriety of discussing a subject which has already been fully repeatedly and in the most masterly manner discussed may be doubted the season seemed to require it if infidelity triumph the triumph must be stopped i offer nothing entirely new neither do i offer a compilation i have examined the subject carefully you have my own reflections on it nor have i refused the reflections of others assistance from any quarter was cheerfully received  the age of reason discovers great ignorance of the subject which it pretends to illustrate and an utter contempt for revelation and for all its advocates it would be very easy to take the book page by page and to establish fully all these charges a disputatious spirit had led to such a tract for disputation i have no taste my only wish is to promote the truth to oppose scorn to scorn appears to me very improper on so serious a subject i lay down certain principles and show how these may be applied either this vain book is full of groundless assertions and blasphemous boasting or the principles which i have attempted to establish are entirely false i can for my own part as soon doubt my own existence as these princeples i am not singular in this many to whom i address myself have the same conviction and few can bring themselves to believe that that conviction is illusive if the faith of the one be confirmed and the doubts of the other removed i shall not think my labor has been lost  inelegancies might have been avoided by omitting observations suggested by the state of my immediate charge and the occurrences of the moment but as my aim is usefulness rather than elegance i have ventured the following discourses abroad in their native dress without any attempt to modernize them  i offer them to my pastoral charge as an evidence of my concern for their welfare  should some copies of these discourses find their way among those in the island of burmuda for whom i once labored let my old friends know the tender desire which i still entertain for their welfare and the satisfaction which i should feel in being still able to promote that in any way  i think myself entitled to the prayers of my people that this work through the divine blessing may be accepted by the public and useful to the christian cause  christianity proceeding from god must stand no weapon formed for its destruction shall prosper boldly therefore i leave my own charge and the christian church in general on the guardian care and the enriching blessing of our divine redeemer  your servant in the gospel of jesus christ james muir alexandria november   th      discourse i the subject introduced proverbs i  0          wisdom cries without she utters her voice in the streets she cries in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she utters her words saying how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge turn ye at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known my words unto you   solomon expostulates in these words with irreligious persons on their conduct their conduct is spoken of as simple scornful and foolish it is opposed to the dictates of wisdom delivered in the most articulate the most public the most commanding manner it has nothing to recommend it no reason therefore can justify persisting therein renouncing it has immediate and great advantages i shall through divine assistance attempt the illustration of each of these particulars  expostulating with the irreligious on their conduct solomon speaks of it   st as simple scornful and foolish  the conduct of irreligious persons is declared to be simple ye simple ones sadly they impose upon themselves others fear god and are directed and restrained by his law they cast off this fear and will submit neither to its direction nor restraint let vulgar minds act under such influence they are more discerning their own reason is a sufficient guide the world has hitherto been misled discovering the error they are for the future to think and act for themselves no doubt these are the people and wisdom shall die with them they deny what others firmly believe deride what others venerate throw off the yoke which others know has been imposed by the creator in this there is a boldness of a singular kind it is the boldness of the child who handles unwarily the keenedgedinstrument who seizes undaunted the envenomed viper or who walks heedless on the dangerous precipice that religion has been mistaken and abused is not to be denied impute not this to religion but to human weakness and degeneracy use it as an inducement to be more deligent in investigating the subject but let it not drop neglected and contemned there is in the heart such enmity to god that men avail themselves of whatever appears able to justify them in casting off his fear and service such conduct is spoken of in my text as very contemptible men act not in so simple a manner in the affairs of this world they weigh worldly matters well and decide prudently but in religion a superficial attention only is given and conclusions of a most erroneous kind are drawn scornful is the conduct of the irreligious as well as the simple there is a gradual progress in a sinful course men proceed not at once to extremes from walking in the counsel of the ungodly from standing in the way of sinners they venture to sit in the chair of the scornful religion is turned into ridicule it is attacked by scoffs and jeers at hours the most unguarded it is called for as sampson was to increase mens mirth making a mock at sin as nothing new sinners have often treated gods threatenings and judgments with contempt look back o scorners to him who introduced this practice and boast of it if you think well the devil heads the wretched band he first turned gods word into ridicule darkning very plain words by arguments of a more subtle kind he effectually deceived our first parents and betrayed them into a conduct the most fatal to themselves and to their decendants to this source the sophistry in succeeding ages which has proved so prejudicial to religion may be traced the most degenerate natures are the most given to use this vile artifice in order to discredit and if possible to undermine religion the narrations the doctrines the characters found in scripture are viewed with a jaundiced eye and falsehood being substituted for truth ignorance for knowledge a superficial glance for an accurate examination what is most sacred most venenerable and most useful is exposed in a fools coat to the derision of the inconsiderate i cannot conceive what satisfaction can be derived from such a practice yet alas it is too common and its baneful influence severely felt  foolish is the conduct of irreligious persons as well as simple and scornful the fool hates knowledge the ear of the wise is open to instruction its voice from any quarter is attended unto confirmed indeed must he be in wickedness who will not listen to the dictates of wisdom to this men proceed by the steps already pointed out it is the summit of degeneracy there is hope as long as men are teachable hating knowledge the symptoms are of the very worst kind rich were the laodiceans in their own conceit in a religious view and increased with goods and having need of nothing whilst infinite wisdom knew them to be wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked rich is the infidel if we take his word for it and increased with goods and having need of nothing he is settled in his opinion and believes the foundation on which he rests firm as the everlasting hills but god knows that he is wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked he is sporting on a precipice he is the prisoner of justice the sentence is incurred it shall pass it shall be executed to his surprise and ruin such act under a judicial blindness nothing can be more infatuated persuade the madman fettered down in his cell of his situation  it cannot be done he believes himself a prince invested with the insignia of royalty having at his command all the pleasures of a court such the infidel he is sunk into a fatal security from which he cannot be roused  as the conduct of irreligious persons is represented by solomon in his expostulations with them as simple scornful and foolish it is also represented  ii as opposed to the dictates of wisdom delivered in the most articulate the most public the most commanding manner wisdom cries without she utters her voice in the streets she cries in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she utters her words  wisdom here is expressive of these prudent counsels which men repeatedly have from conscience from providence and from scripture their language is distinct and faithful it is heard amidst the noise of business and the crowd of company it sounds in our ears in the streets or at the gate at home or abroad the cry of wisdom cannot be suppressed folly seeks the shade and lurks in darkness it whispers in the ear its impiety and communicates secretly its poison to the heart wisdom is open and importunate no noise can drown its voice no business private or public restrain its reproof let the sinner fly it follows him let him step to the right hand or to the left the voice behind him cannot be silenced it proclaims distinctly this is the way walk ye in it it teaches and reproves it gives correction and instruction in righteousness alarming was it to adam when he had disobeyed god it disturbed him in his unsafe retreat and brought him to judgment judas could not bear its terrors it made felix tremble on the bench it filled bellshazzar and his nobles with consternation when rioting at an impious festival and rendered even herod pensive and uneasy in the exercise of arbitrary and unjust authority when a secret intimation awakes a dread that the unbeliever may be wrong or the unholy be subjected to punishment when overwhelmed with distress they are unhappy having no anchor by which they may weather out the storm no hope to buoy them up when the word of truth pierces their hearts and leaves this impression that being out of the way they are greatly exposed in either in all of these cases we have a specimen of the exertions of wisdom to draw mankind from error and thereby to prevent their ruin  the conduct of irreligious persons being simple scornful and foolish  being opposed to the dictates of wisdom delivered in the most articulate public and commanding manner having nothing to recommend it there is  iii no reason which can justify the persisting therein how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge by interrogations we may assert in the strongest manner they leave the matter on the conscience the answer is implied and being supposed to come from the guilty person is the more conclusive the language of my text is thus forcible it represents the unaccountable folly and stupidity of sinners of which a moments reflection must convince them is it not abundantly verified that such men deceive themselves  and will you continue the cheat have you not acted long enough against reason and conscience  why play the fool any longer what pleasure is there in scoffing at religion what wisdom in turning from a prudent monitor what praise in continuing in ignorance  deceitful as the heart is and desperately wicked few i believe are able altogether to throw off religion even those who have it in derision have it so because it makes them uneasy reprobating their wicked practices seek relief in making as light of it as possible as the afflicted sometimes seek relief in intoxication thought may hereby be absorbed for the moment but it recurs with more severity such the relief which infidels experience in their unwarrantable practices they impose silence upon conscience but it will speak and thunder terrors into their ears religion is adapted to make us happy and is congenial to the soul rejecting it men determine that it shall be the subject of their thoughts and the rule of their lives at some future period the young will think of it when they are old the busy when it may be convenient the robust when reduced by sickness no determination can be more unwise to act upon it is to act in a manner highly infatuated let us reason the same way in other cases i am sick but refuse medicine or advice i shall persist in the course which aggravates the disease and roots it in my constitution here the disease becomes desperate and i must die i shall hasten to the physician and exhaust the drugs in the apothecarys shop i have stepped aside from the way i will not yet turn back but go on and still go on entering one winding after another until there be no hope of recovering the path which i had left my house is in flames  i will not stir  the flames rise more forcibly and spread around i am still immovable the possibility of escape is at last excluded now i will arise  i will fly  i will escape  but i cannot the flames are on all sides i am undone could any conduct be more infatuated yes it is more infatuated to put off the thoughts of religion how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge  you are to lay it to heart at some future period this was the determination of felix it was not then convenient for him to repent and to reform and the convenient season never arrived speak of a future moment to become religious you speak against your own souls the scripture says to day if you will hear his voice behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth seek the lord while he may be found do you know certainly that you shall be alive tomorrow has not death seized many as young as healthy as promissing as any hearing me has not the grave opened to receive them are you more secure than they were why boast of life it is a vapor if any thing be done it must be done now or the opportunity of doing it may never occur delay not how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge let your hearts this moment rise to god retire to your closets anxiously enquiring lord what would thou have me to do what shall i do to be saved  the uncertainty of life is not the only danger attending delay in a penitent believing and holy conduct is all your hope if this be necessary today it will also tomorrow or at any future period god will not alter his demand but complying will by delay become more difficult there is a progress in sin habits are found to be inveterate can the ethiopean change his skin or the leopard his spots then may they do good who have been accustomed to do evil as god will always insist on repentence faith and new obedience in order to salvation and as the continuance in an evil course occasions a growing incapacity for these exercises and even distaste nothing can exceed the madness of venturing our eternal welfare on such a hazard how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scornings and fools hate knowledge  let not men deceive themselves god will not be mocked if they forget him if they disobey him he may command cut down these cumberers of the ground they set at naught all my counsel they would none of my reproof i also will laugh at their calamity and mock when their fear comes let them fall into desolation let them be consumed with terrors let their names be written in the dust and their image be despised could any command my brethren be more terrible yes it would be still more terrible were the command let these continue on earth let them enjoy a faithful ministry let them have line upon line and precept upon precept let them have every degree of worldly prosperity let them proceed in profaning my name abusing my ordinances deriding my word let them be proof against the voice of conscience and providence let them resist my spirit and harden themselves in wickedness that at a future day ripe for destruction they may fall drawing down tenfold vengeance on their devoted heads what an intolerable situation yet perhaps it is not singular those who abuse great advantages are punished being left to themselves to believe a lie and to grow worse and worse that in their fall providence may warn others and rouse them to considerate and religious lives  renouncing an irreligious life has  iv immediate and great advantages turn ye at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known my words unto you no doctrine more convincingly established both from scripture and experience than the utter inability of man to will or to do of gods good pleasure at the same time it must be evident that none who use their natural powers to the utmost in returning to god have ever yet been or for the future ever shall be disappointed on this principle proceeds the exhortations addressed in scripture to those who are wicked and the judgments denounced when they hold out against these exhortations of all characters simon majus appears to be the most abandoned yet even he was commanded repent and pray god if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee steps for this purpose are required of every sinner which when taken are attended with an influence every way efficacious if at any time the heart of sinners relent if now some relentness be experienced cherish the opportunity it is highly favorable or should a sad hardness and unrelenting disposition be discriptive of your present state reflect on the unreasonableness of this of its present and future danger break off open vice forsake that company lay aside those books which confirm you in infidelity look up for mercy persist knowing that life and death are suspended on the issue you are assured of success on the word of him who cannot lie light shall break in upon your mind you shall feel new vigor what before was doubtful shall be plain difficulties in your way like impassable mountains shall be removed you shall run in the ways of gods commandments men at last shall undoubtedly be condemned if destitute of faith of repentance and of new obedience there is as little doubt of our obtaining faith repentance and new obedience if we take such steps to obtain these as god requires us to take if you perish o sinner your blood shall be on your own head for you may now return to god and he will pour out his spirit upon you and make known his words unto you  discourse ii the nature of inspiration stated   timothy iii    all scripture is given by inspiration of god   of the old testament the apostle here speaks for the new when timothy was a child did not yet exist that volume was in high veneration among the jews they inculcated upon their children the same veneration from the first dawn of reason they made them acquainted with the scripture had the example been universally followed many roots of bitterness which sprang up to the ruin of the church had long before now been extirpated the example is praiseworthy better for our children that they be ignorant of every thing beside than ignorant of the scripture all scripture is given by inspiration of god  discoursing from these words the possibility of such inspiration the necessity and the nature shall through divine assistance be illustrated i am  i to illustrate the possibility of such inspiration  the mind is a spiritual substance perfectly distinct from what is gross and material its capacity is great it is a flame of fire nothing so active nor penetrating kindled in heaven it cannot be extinguished in this consists our superiority over the beast of the field and the fowls of heaven on this was impressed the image of god in which we were originally created  at present the soul is united to matter the body was organized for its service this is not a state in which its native powers can be fully unfolded its exertions however even now are astonishing i confine myself to the impression which we make upon one another some souls are congenial whenever they meet they act upon one another they unite and friendships of an indissolvable nature are formed the pure and gentle more naturally unite with those who are pure and gentle the depraved and rough with those who are depraved and rough how souls insinuate themselves into each other and unite is inexplicable the fact we know and it may be of use in the present discussion  the soul is not the only spiritual nature in the universe god is a spirit celestials are spirits and infernals are human spirits alone capable of acting upon each other or may this action and reaction be mutual to spirits in general it may certainly be mutual suggestions often arise  we know not how they proceed from a secret quarter to these many ascribe great part of their knowledge by these they have been induced to undertake the most brilliant actions impressions also are often acknowledged which forewarn men of danger or presage happiness so far our experience carries us the jews were of opinion that we had intimate communion with the world of spirits and might receive from thence either good or bad impressions the opinion was certainly just this world cannot be detached it is connected with the other if the connection at all subsist it must with the father of our spirits this cannot reasonably be denied he who formed the mind must know well all its qualities and be able to affect it in any manner and to any degree  the possibility of gods communicating the knowledge of his will to men being allowed it is of importance to enquire  ii whether this be necessary realize that moment when adam first came into existence suppose him placed in eden i see him cast his eye above and below on the right hand and the left on himself and on all around he would immediately conclude the existence of a first cause infinitely wise powerful and good but he would not have found out for what purpose he was made nor what service he must do he could not have known whether he could continue in existence or again fall into the state from whence he had just awaked he must have lost himself even in the labyrinth of delights and languished in vain conjecture was his happiness incomplete without the intercourse with a fellow creature how much more so without intercourse with his maker the book of nature indeed instructed him with respect to the existence of god and some striking perfections there it rested he found himself a creature among myriads of creatures his distance from god and ignorance of his origin his duty or destination must have involved an uncertainty inconsistent with happiness the mosaic account therefore of mans formation is what we would have expected the creator revealed himself to his new made creature introduced him to eden gave him it in gift instructed him in his duty and left his blessing with him all this is so natural and even necessary that i cannot conceive how it could have been otherwise if the knowledge of gods will was necessary for men from the first it was more so afterward if in the right way he could not go on with certainty and satisfaction without divine communications much less could he have recovered it after he had stepped aside degraded and fallen the book of nature could give him no advice not the least hint whether he might be forgiven or in what manner in thunder it proclaimed the terrors of that power which he had provoked it left him in awful suspense in what a situation then are we left if we lay aside our bibles  the possibility of gods communicating his will to mankind being established and its necessity we may safely conclude that he has done so and in the scripture which my text says has been given by inspiration of god  the nature of this inspiration is  iii the discussion to which i proposed to call your attention  each of you have a clear idea of what inspiration means our mental powers are capable of gradual improvement but were they to arrive at such improvement instantaneously this must be in consequence of something supernatural were i immediately furnished with a full acquaintance with the languages used by the indian tribes so as to speak them fluently this must be by inspiration although i might arrive at the same attainment in a natural way through time and attention or could i discern and circumstantially relate what is doing at this moment in france or britain it must be by inspiration although without inspiration the person on the spot may discern these things with equal clearness and relate them as circumstantially  supernatural influence may be distinguished both in kind and degree  were a person discoursing or writing more secured through a supernatural influence upon his mind from any error in what he said or wrote than he could otherwise be i should pronounce him inspired should there even be no marks of genius in his production or should another without this advantage discourse or write with equal precision or were there a book compiled under such supernatural influence that what is related and taught could not possibly have any mixture of error no doubt this is an inspired book should the writers relate many things which they saw and heard as well as what was miraculously communicated consistent with this idea of inspiration as a great variety of phraseology i shall even allow that more elegant expressions might have been used this is no objection were the scripture indeed declared to be a standard of oratory every defect of this kind might be urged with reason but it is a standard of truth if all be true then the phraseology is not so important a superintending influence over the minds of all the writers securing them absolutely from any degree of error in relating even what fell within their own knowledge is included in that inspiration with which the scriptures were given had this been considered it might have prevented a great torrent of abuse as if revelation had nothing to do with facts which the writer might relate as any of us can what we see and hear  beside this superintending influence which secured the writers of scripture from any degree of error in what they wrote a higher influence was sometimes enjoyed raising the mind to a degree of noble ardour and sublimity at which it would not have arrived in a natural way this appears in the song of moses in many psalms and in different passages in the epistles of paul i see no evidence however of its being the design of providence to mark out those who speak in gods name by such elevation of sentiment and style since such frequently deliver their message in the plainest and simplest manner  the most extraordinary degree of inspiration is where the natural faculties of the prophet were suspended and he became merely an organ through whom god communicated his will to men dictating both the matter and the language by immediate suggestion this happened in foretelling future events of which they otherwise could have no idea but even here a superintending influence was necessary that the prophecy might be delivered to others exactly as it was received from god  what therefore is asserted in my text and what i must insist upon is this that all the writers of scripture uniformly in these writings were under such a supernatural influence that they delivered the whole truth of god without any degree of mixture or error  it appears evidently that christ and his apostles believed the old testament to have been written in this manner  it is mentioned as a high honor conferred upon the jews that unto them were committed the oracles of god god had dictated and given authenticity to these scriptures of which the jews were the guardians we have says peter speaking of the scriptures a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shines in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spoke as they were moved by the holy ghost  these words intimate that the prophets did not work themselves up into such agitations as led them to utter the predictions and oracles which are recorded but were borne on by the holy ghost declaring as his organ what he disposed them to declare or what he suggested for the benefit of mankind in a conversation with the jews our savior insisted is it not written in your law i said ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father has sanctioned and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god  here not the truth only of the old testament is asserted but what is more it is asserted that these writings cannot be charged with any impropriety of expression their direction in every instance is safe and their decision infallible the declaration of my text is positive and universal all scripture is given by inspiration of god  the writers of the new testament believed themselves under a divine influence and delivered their message as the ambassadors of god writing to the thessalonians the apostle is express he that despises despises not man but god who has also given unto us his holy spirit speaking of the ordinance of the supper he says i received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you  his assertions to the ephesians include his fellow apostles and brethren as well as himself ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote before in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets  peter allows the commandment of the apostles equal weight with the words spoken before by the holy prophets and particularly gives the epistles of paul the same authenticity with other scriptures this was perfectly agreeable to their saviors assurance that the spirit should abide with them to guide them into all truth and to bring his instructions to their remembrance  to this doctrine which i have been insisting upon several passages have heen objected particularly when the apostle says unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother has a wife that believes not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that has obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god  inspired writers say objectors would not have spoken thus the objection here as generally arises from inattention to the passage the laws of christianity with respect to persons in a single or married life are here stated some cases had been taken notice of by our savior during his personal ministry and decided upon he had said nothing of other cases these were reserved for his servant speaking in his name the apostle points out the cases which had been decided upon by our savior in person and the cases also which not yet decided upon received now the decision of the apostle the apostle was writing to those who questioned his apostleship his expressions in this view appear very suitable i think i have the spirit of god  i give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy which expressions in this connection assert in very intelligible and proper language his being in these dcisions divinely inspired other objections of a similar kind appear on examination to be equally futile  the most extraordinary objection against revelation which i recollect to have seen urged is admit that a thing is revealed to me the moment i communicate it to others it cannot with them have the weight of revelation but becomes hearsay which they may treat as they please this strikes at the root of all human testimony nay it declares it impossible for god to make known his will through any medium  it must be immediately or not at all the objection goes farther than those by whom it is made intend it strikes at every medium of communication even the heavens and the earth as instructors these are opaque bodies introduced between the creature and the creator and must not be admitted  it is absurd to say that god may communicate the knowledge of himself to mankind through the imperfect medium of the inanimate creation and yet the more perfect medium of the rational creation be rejected i know not that i ever met a weaker or more irrational assertion indeed i would not take it merely on the word of any man that god had spoken to him i must have some evidence thereof this i would require in any testimony in which i am nearly concerned but satisfied of this evidence i could no more disbelieve the testimony in the one case than in the other  in the darkness with which we are invested in this world is it not desirable to have a light for our direction on which we can depend is it not reasonable to follow that light even when it lays open a view which in many respects astonishes our finite capacities because somethings are more difficult shall i refuse to avail myself of what is useful and easy no reason can justify such conduct the scripture is our only guide improve it as such let it be the light to your feet and the lamp to your way meditate on it day and night let it dwell in you let it be your delight and your counselor you shall find it perfect converting the soul sure making wise the simple right rejoicing the heart pure enlightening the eyes it will warn you against transgression it will reward your obedience  having gods commandments in your heart you will no doubt find it your duty and you will think it your pleasure to teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sit in thine house and when thou walk by the way and when thou lie down and when thou risest up  when men neither read their bibles nor follow their direction when children are brought up like heathens having no knowledge of the scriptures nor reverence for them it is no wonder if these be despised and every trifler however ignorant of the scripture and palpably wrong in the most known facts who chooses notwithstanding to laugh at them be listened to as an oracle and be circulated through many nations i see nothing reasonable in this if we be in an error make it appear substantiate assertions with proper evidence but scorn is no argument it may amuse the inconsiderate it can never have any weight with those who think for themselves such attempts against christianity are to me an evidence of its truth men never use such weapons when better ones are in their power  thus circumstanced it is for the credit as well as the comfort of christians not only to believe but also to be able to give a reason for their faith to know that they do not follow a cunningly divised fable and also to convince others of this  for this purpose i have entered on the present series of discourses the times appeared to demand it your comfort demands it and your establishment it has been demanded by duty in season we are to preach to make full proof of the ministry to be zealous for the truth particularly since those perilous times have commenced when men will not endure sound doctrine but renouncing the truth are turned unto fables  having at present stated the possibility the necessity and nature of inspiration i shall god willing look into the scriptures themselves and see what evidence they give of being inspired writings i am aware of the arduous nature of that work which i have undertaken i feel also the delicacy of my situation from the various lights in which this undertaking may appear to those for whose benefit i labor all this i have weighed and all is counterbalanced from a desire to do my duty in the execution of which let me have your countenance and your prayers the success of the ministry depends as much on the hearer as on the speaker for your own sake for the gospels sake  brethren pray for us  discourse iii inspiration argued from the scriptures themselves psalms cxix    open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law   this psalm was written by david it has something curious in the texture it contains as many parts as there are letters in the hebrew alphabet each part consists of eight verses and begins with the latter wherewith it is particularly distinguished the design of the whole is to discover the great advantages which may be derived from studying the scriptures especially when divine illumination attends that study  i have already illustrated the apostles assertion that all scripture is given by inspiration of god insisting upon the possibility the necessity and nature of such inspiration the same influence under which the scripture was written is in its measure necessary that we may read with judgment and advantage under this influence wondrous discoveries may be expected from gods law let us depending thereon attend to these discoveries  what is it a reasonable person would expect from revelation no doubt some account of the world and of that power by which it has been produced the origin of mankind their character their duties their prospects all this is found in the scripture i shall enquire first what the old testament says of these things and then what the new  the old testament opens with an account of creation nothing can be conceived more astonishing a pompous description is no doubt expected which unfolds the powers of nature and leaves nothing doubtful in the system of astronomy such the composition had it been human but its case and simplicity argues it divine room is left for philosophic researches the laws of nature which common minds cannot penetrate may be sought after with such researches religion has no immediate concern it is accommodated to all the instruction is not above the dullest capacity nor unworthy of the most brilliant things are spoken of as they appear to every one nor is any thing said contradictory to the most astonishing discoveries the simple truth intelligible to all and of chief importance is clearly stated at the very opening of scripture in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and afterward god created man in his own image this is the foundation of all religion the subject unfolds as our acquaintance with the scripture increases leaving the mind impressed with the necessity of loving the lord our god with all our heart and all our soul and all our minds as a first and indispensable duty the foundation also for the other branch of duties is thus early laid when we see all nations springing from the same root and from this circumstance having reason to love their neighbors as they love themselves the first chapter of genesis therefore not only discovers the origin of this world but also lays the foundation for all the duties of a religious or moral kind which we owe either to god or to each other here we have the ground work of the whole scripture a light breaks upon us which becomes more evident obligations are felt which every page enforces the language is as admirable as the subject to this the best and most unexceptionable judges bear witness longinus whose good taste has been the admiration of ages who also was a heathen from mere conviction gives the highest character of the writings of moses the jewish legislator says he in his treatise on the sublime no ordinary person having conceived a just idea of the power of god has nobly expressed it in the beginning of his law and god said  what  let there be light and there was light let the earth be and the earth was  i have been the more particular in this statement to show the propriety of revelations opening as it does that moses did write this account and it was communicated to him will be examined afterward in the mean time it must strike every one that a better introduction to the knowledge of god and of our duty cannot be conceived it has been urged that the mosaic account of the creation contradicts the truth and discourages all philosophical investigations i must contend that no such contradiction is found therein and that it discourages no such investigations persons indeed of influence in the church may have taken unwarrantable steps which have had such a tendency carefully distinguish the actions of men from the principles which ought to regulate these actions revert to the scriptures themselves they contain no such contradictions they bring forth none of the discouragements mentioned an objection of this kind from the man too who has made it his business to fix our attention to principles is the more invidious it shows something worse than ignorance he takes things for granted which cannot be proved and then builds an airy fabric spacious indeed but unsubstantial is such an investigation worthy of notice is it rational or even just nothing can be more unfair nor contradictory to his own principles in other instances  as the scripture gives us an account of the origin of the world it also exposes the character of mankind which is not now what it was once man was made innocent but fell from his innocence the mosaic account of this has employed the wit of deistical writers time immemorial upon this they have exhausted their obliquy irony flashes from every page of their writings the best way of dealing with such opposers is simply to state the truth let light enter darkness of itself will go away  if adam was indebted to god for existence for paradise for enjoyments of an intellectual as well as animal nature had not such a benefactor every right to command and dispose of him if his authority was absolute could not his wisdom decide on that command which was the proper test of obedience an indifferent action is fixed upon this tree i retain the rest are yours neither look upon what i withhold nor touch it nor eat of its fruit  was not this a reasonable command if all belonged to god might he not give any part or retain any part and if he was pleased to interpose his command shall a disputing thought arise a murmuring word be heard obedience was acknowledging gods right in all and honoring his authority disobedience was to dispute his right to throw off his authority it included every crime highly aggravated adam therefore was guarded against it by severe penalties creatures even the highest and most pure have been made changeable it was in their power to stand or to fall some stood some fell adam was put on an equal footing with others there was no necessity upon him to be disobedient nay every thing encouraged his obedience still his will was free  think for a moment of his temptations eve was first deceived but how in innocence angels were probably very familiar with our first parents their conversation was welcome as it was instructive they became visible in different shapes the human no doubt was the most common but not exclusive of others sometimes it was a cherub or beautiful flying ox at other times a seraph or winged shining serpent in this last shape the fallen spirit might have introduced himself to eve referring probably to which the apostles says satan himself is transformed into an angel of light eve believing herself talking with an angel might easily be persuaded that she had misunderstood the divine command or that it had been altered under such deceit she eat and had influence enough with her husband to involve him in the same transgression i need not expatiate on the attrocity of the crime this must strike every reasonable person it incurred severe punishment all this appears natural it might have been expected that god would exact of men some test of obedience a possibility of their falling was inseparable from the condition of creatures the whole transaction is solemn and suitable if obedience would have transmitted benefits of the most important nature to distant ages why should not disobedience extend the calamity as far as obedience would the benefit that such calamity is endured is matter of fact felt by men in all ages and the account of it herein given is as satisfactory as any which has ever been given it is easy to laugh and by blending truth and fable in one story as a late writer has done to produce a ridiculous scene such attempts in a matter of so much moment is highly censurable let such writers rejecting the mosaic account give us a better one which none of them pretend to do whereby they may resolve our enquiries with respect to the general depravity of mankind and the ills which every where prevail or keeping exactly to the mosaic account without any foreign mixture let them show its absurdity neither have they done this i must then insist that such persons trifle with mankind and deserve rather their pity as madmen than their ear as prudent counselors  after mans defection from his duty is unfolded the old testament proceeds to discover the consequence it drew depravity and ruin not on adam and eve only but on all their descendants but how can this be proved by the most unanswerable of all arguments plain universal and wellauthenticated facts individuals families and nations are brought in view cain grew a monster for his impiety and murderous designs his descendants trod too exactly in his footsteps lamach was particularly notorious nay impiety cruelty and bloodshed became so common that it was necessary that the divine displeasure be discovered bringing upon such a race a general deluge it is not probable that wickedness since the flood has ever risen so universally to such an height yet the general tendency to wickedness is too evident noah although eminent for his piety was overtaken with intoxication ham one of his children discovered by disgraceful conduct the utter depravity of his disposition the building of babel proceeded from an ill view it seems to have been noahs design to divide the earth among his sons and to dismiss each to his respective allotment they were not compliant babel probably was built to enable them effectually to thwart noahs design it however only hastened the dispersion removed from the eye of noah they paid little attention to religion which soon lost its original simplicity abraham and his family are brought in view that god in his dealings with them might awaken men to a sense of their duty although persons of distinguished piety arose from this family in all we observe great blemishes jacob by no means acted the fair part with esau simeon and levi were guilty of wanton cruelty ever under oppression in egypt the treatment of the israelites to each other cannot be justified a stronger picture of an irreligious inconsiderate stuffnecked disposion cannot be drawn than what we have of the wanderers in the wilderness sampson whose strength of body could repress the force of armies fell a victim to his own passions davids mind tender under affliction enfeebled through repose was hardened to commit a complicated and attrocious crime solomons wisdom toward the conclusion of his reign was disgraced with an egregious act of folly abrahams faith by unbelief the scripture relates fathfully these facts the inference is left for the reader human nature has been the same from the beginning that it is now it is desperately wicked no species of folly of debauchery of crimes of which it is not capable the scripture here is a faithful witness if a different account been given it had been false this circumstance which speaks most distinctly the authenticity of scripture has been used as a weapon for its overthrow no perversion is so insufferable what can a late writer mean by saying when we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheris the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of god this is a strange passage were i to relate the death of the king of france and insist on some preceding severities am i because i relate these things any ways accountable for that death or these severities if i paint any crime in its native deformity in order to deter all from the commission thereof is this the work of a deamon does it not rather deserve praise than blame the scripture draws a distorted character the character indeed deserves the highest detestation it transforms men into brutes or devils  but the scripture has no blame it acts the office of a friend it would convince men of their wickedness that it might turn them from it and lead them in the right way were this considered unbelievers would not allow themselves to snarle and carp as they do at the scripture representations when these discovered the folly inconsistency and wickedness of human nature every thought would be absorbed in this one ah that is my picture were it not for restraining grace  shall i detest the book that perpetuates this picture and places it before me rather let me detest the heart capable of such depravity i must as a sinner be as odious to god as i am hateful to myself o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death  but does the old testament present us with the gloomy view only no it also introduces light prospects open to awaken to comfort and direct the sons of men  the exclusion after the fall from the tree of life whatever derision this circumstance has occasioned was in pity to mankind the fruit of that tree contained a juice which tended to immortalize the body a life of misery and change protracted during endless ages had been a dreadful curse although death be a state of degradation and punishment still it is desirable in our present circumstances adam soon found that all was not lost a victory is promised over the serpent the mischief which his wiles had occasioned to mankind should be removed man might yet be happy the honor of the divine law secured and his nature renovated it should still be possible for him to walk with god on earth and dwell with him in heaven he must be indebted to another sacrifics in use from the first and the jewish ritual established afterward at sinai were appointed of god to impress this upon the mind reason could not have dictated such a practice its origin and universal adoption must have proceeded from revelation only  obstacles in the way of mans acceptance with god being removed the renovation of his nature was also provided for the agent here is the holy spirit often is he mentioned in the old testament the saints ascribe their holiness to his influence taking from sinners the stony heart he causes them to walk in gods statutes to keep his judgments and to do them besides this influence proper motives are placed before them in the judgments which fall on the wicked and the mercies with which the righteous were visited the book of ecclesiastes dissuades men from earthly and sensual conduct the book of psalms encourages a devout and heavenly spirit the proverbs afford a variety of maxims of a moral and religious kind for our conduct in life and all the prophets in their instruction address equally the hopes and fears of mankind  there is no doubt but the belief of a future state was cherished by the old testament this doctrine was known to adam he often conversed with the inhabitants of the spiritual world and was certain that he possessed an immortal principle enoch was removed before the flood from earth to heaven in a visible manner elijah after the flood abraham had his eye fixed upon a heavenly country the martyrs in the days of maccabeus believed in a better resurrection all the saints possessed this faith and received therefrom great encouragement  the old testament was written at different times by persons of various capacities and in places exceedingly remote yet they harmonize in a wonderful degree every where we find the same doctrines and precepts all is unison  their credibility is further established when sacred is viewed in connection with profane history the tradition of the golden age is derived from the state of innocence the nectar and ambrosia which the heathens supposed preserved their gods in immortality from the tree of life hence also the idea of the great panacea or universal medicine so much celebrated by the poets what the poets say of the giants evidently alludes to the state of things before the destruction of the old world deucalionss story as related by ovid is the tradition concerning the flood i only mention these things now they will again occur and be discussed in their proper place  if we really wish to be satisfied whether the scriptures be indeed the word of god in perusing them be serious and unbiassed depend also in doing so on that spirit by which they have been dictated to give us a considerate discerning mind it shall not be in vain multitudes have found this volume an inestimable treasure it has made them acquainted with god and with themselves with their duty of a moral and religious kind with their business on earth and their way to heaven the direction which this book has given the comfort which it has inspired the restraints which it has laid and the encouragements which it has afforded have obliged men to confess that it is more to be desired than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honey comb  my observations on the new testament shall be very short if even in the old testament we have such traces of a divine revelation they are more evident in the new in both we see the same system the first elements of religion are given us in the one in the other religion is brought to perfection  the four evangilists and the acts of the apostles give us the history of our savior and of his apostles what in our saviors birth was supernatural might have been expected a virgin says the prophet shall bring forth a son was there in this any thing above creative power or was that power ever exerted on a more noble occasion than in producing the holy thing denominated the son of god in the ordinary course of things human nature would have had an original taint it in this instance must be perfectly pure to effect which god steps out of his ordinary way and shall we object if his way be in the sea and his path in the deep waters if his counsels be unsearchable this might have been expected with the simplicity of children with the tractability of scholars let us listen let us believe the matter of fact indeed fell under the cognizance of few witnesses but these were very credible the character both of mary and joseph was reputable their story was thoroughly weighed by zacharias and elizabeth it was credible from former prophecy the future events in the life of jesus added to its credibility the man so ready to say with thomas unless i see i will not believe ought with equal readiness to yield to those convictions which overcame in joseph the strongest suspicions of which the human mind is capable  the disciples who were jews in ordinary life without the advantages of learning and of general converse with the world were not attached to the systems of other nations nay were probably unacquainted with them and so far as these were known had insuperable objections against them besides they neither possessed inclination nor capacity to form any system which could command general attention they were merely agents jesus instructed them and sent them forth in his name of their divine commission they produced full evidence it was not material whether our savior was pleased himself to write what was for the instruction of the church in future ages or furnished his disciples to do so and placed them under such a superintending influence that they could commit no mistake it is far from being true that employing these as agents was absolutely necessary our savior might himself have written the christian system and left it as his last legacy to the church we find him writing on a memorable occasion it is not for us to dictate infiinte wisdom has regulated this matter so as is most conducive to promote the designs of the gospel meek and humble minds have perfect satisfaction it was perhaps fit that infidels have something on which to vent the rancor of their perverted besotted minds  the doctrines of the new testament are spiritual and sublime their luster blends the prejudiced who not perceiving their nature speak of them with contempt the incarnation and death of the son of god as an atonement for mankind give particular offense it is observable that this has been the uniform doctrine of scripture it was taught our first parents in eden it was believed by abel it was illustrated by all the institutions of the jewish church it produced in the patriarchs and prophets confidence and joy it breeds admiration in angels the redeemed above cease not to celebrate his praise who loved them and washed them from their sins in his blood these considerations may well outweigh the insulting surmises of a presumptuous man the dispensation itself is astonishing we see the plan only in an imperfect state it may be founded in reasons which we cannot now penetrate we may dispute to our ruin but it is most prudent as well as safe to believe  the deity is represented in the most amiable and worthy light he is proposed as our pattern the precepts deduced from the christian system are so suitable that practiced they would change this wilderness into paradise earth into heaven the tumult of war and contention into a desirable and lasting calm whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if their be any praise they are proposed to our attentive consideration and enforced by striking examples  if you read the word prejudiced against it and determined to turn it into ridicule you cannot expect that god will open your eyes and discover to you the wondrous things found in his law he will rather leave you to believe a lie and allow your hearts to be hardened by that fire which softens others to your utter ruin  you will easily perceive and i hope you will keep in mind the method which i have proposed to myself in the defense which depending on divine assistance i have undertaken of our holy religion against the levels of infidels and the sneer of fools  i have stated the possibility the necessity and nature of inspiration and have shown that the writers of scripture claim our attention as writing under such inspiration i have now adduced my first proof looking into the scriptures we find every thing there we would expect from a revelation it was necessary to begin with this for if as the enemies of revelation say scripture contains any thing unworthy of god or ruinous to man no further proof is necessary the bible ought to be rejected as a spurious production nothing however of this kind has appeared but the very reverse every thing is worthy of god and beneficial to men  after speaking of the old and the new testaments i shall next show the confirmation which revelation receives from prophecy and miracle shall speak of the use of reason in religion and then prove the antiquity of scripture taking notice of its writers of its publication and the credibility which it receives from the testimony of other history the plan is extensive i shall endeavor to keep every discussion distinct and to be as full and satisfactory in each discussion as my abilities and opportunities admit  discourse iv inspiration argued from prophecy psalms cxlvii   his understanding is infinite   it is a general opinion that this psalm in which the devout jews celebrated the perfections of god manifested in a great deliverance was written after the captivity having spoken of gods goodness and power the psalmest adds his understanding is infinite to this attribute i am now through divine assistance to call your attention infinite understanding is discovered in the exact knowledge which god has of all his works he sees what is past or what is to come with equal precision as what is present of nothing can he be ignorant whether the actions of angels or of men things done in the visible or invisible world what takes place in time or in eternity a knowledge so extensive so minute exceeds our comprehension it can belong to god only if writings can be found which contain such knowledge to such writings is affixed the seal of heaven i am now to contend that this sacred volume whence originates all our hopes is thus declared to be the word of god discoveries of a wonderful nature are made by the prophets in these scriptures as a standing proof of their authenticity  i shall endeavor first to fix precise ideas to the term prophet and prophesying and shall then produce as a specimen some prophecies that from these i may illustrate the attestation given to our holy religion from prophecy in general  the term prophet is of greek origin signifying to predict or foretell the correspond ing terms in the hebrew language express the one the man who sees the other the man who divines through that supernatural impulse under which the prophets acted they were enabled to instruct the people in their duty with precision and authority a hymn was sometimes suggested to the mind suitable for celebrating the praise of the almighty which they could immediately clothe with words and set off with proper melodious tunes when a number were together the same thoughts arising in their minds and the same expressions occurring they at one instant in the same words poured forth the same prayer under this influence also the prophet foretold future events every one of you says the apostle of a christian church under a divine inspiration has a psalm has a doctrine has a tongue has a revelation has an interpretation let it also be observed that when this extraordinary influence fell on every one it frequently threw him into an ecstacy agitating and convulsing the whole frame in an astonishing manner when any were thrown into a violent agitation which gave them an unnatural frantic appearance they were said to prophecy whatever was the cause of that agitation as the heathen poets instructed their countrymen in religion the apostles calls them prophets when the minds of saul and his servants were under such a supernatural commanding influence that their ill designs against david were suspended and every thought was absorbed in celebrating the praise of god they are said to prophecy  i have thus introduced my observations on prophecies to remove the uneasiness which the ignorant and presumptuous assertions of a late writer may have occasioned who says that the bible by a prophet means a poet and by prophesying making verses i should not even mention assertions which might well disgrace any man of common sense were it not that they receive currency without examination because the man by whom they are made has by his writings in other instances acquired among many some reputation  i now proceed to produce as a specimen some prophecies that from these i may illustrate the attestation given to our holy religion from prophecy in general  i begin with speaking of the flood enochs prophecy was in possession of the antideluvian world for near a thousand years he foretold a great calamity threatening the wicked in which their wickedness should receive a severe and examplary punishment noah illustrated this prophecy explaining its nature and fixing precisely the period when the punishment should be inflicted one hundred and twenty years before that period arrived no mind could penetrate so far into futurity far less could an event be conceived of hitherto unexamplified and altogether improbable it was not a fortunate conjecture in this venerable antideluvian he was certain that god had spoken to him and was so impressed with the assurance of the impending ruin that he set in earnest about providing for his own safety the chaldean historian berosus gives an account very corresponding to the mosaic he speaks of ten kings of chaldea before the flood ten generations intervened between adam and noah the last of the ten kings says berosus was warned by a dream of a flood and provided a vessel for his safety  abraham had a distinct view of what should befall his descendants for a long series of years know says the divine oracle of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shall go to thy fathers in peace thou shall be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full  abrahams prospects were good his character was respectable and his circumstances wealthy an eye less penetrating than the divine could not have foreseen these changes through which his posterity should pass  moses rests the whole credit of his law on two circumstances in themselves more than doubtful which no prudent person much less an experienced legislator would have done had he not acted under divine authority every male was required to repair thrice a year to jerusalem every seventh year the lands must lie uncultivated in the ordinary course of things the enemies with whom they were environed would take that opportunity of laying waste their lands famine would be introduced by so unprecedented a practice but god assured them from the exact knowledge he had of all hearts whether then in existence or to come into existence at the appointed period that when obeying his command no man should desire their land and that the earth by an abundance on the sixth year unknown in the other five should afford a full supply for the succeeding so as to enable them with great safety to submit to the divine requisition what a minute acquaintance with the hearts of men and with natural causes and what a controuling power over them in the coming as well as the existing generation to rest the whole weight of the mosaic economy on such a circumstance an understanding which was not infinite could never have penetrated the secrets of the heart as well as those of nature nor would common prudence have allowed moses to risk his reputation on what had it been a cheat might so frequently have been exposed i have fixed your attenon to what appears to me a standing miracle as well as a standing prophecy in attestation of the divine authority of the mosaic law  the captivity of the jews in babylon and the precise period of its duration had been foretold long before it took place nay the very name and victories of the deliverer had one hundred and fifty years previous to his birth been mentioned in the prophecy of isaiah seventy years were fixed upon for the captivity and cyrus was named as the instrument in the hand of providence for the restoration of the jews nothing was left uncertain in this prophecy it was read to cyrus after he became head of the babylonian empire for he mentions it in the decree which gave the jews their liberty and no doubt it had its weight in determining him to such an act this circumstance shows the existance of the prophecy among the jews a long time previously to the events to which it refers now was the period according to that prophecy when god should deliver his people and cyrus was the instrument which he should employ the devout jews could never have dreamed of such a deliverance had it not been foretold nor would any have had the boldness to impose a forgery upon cyrus or if they had his known wisdom had rendered such an imposition very vain if history in any instance deserves credibility it does in this that such a prophecy did exist and has in the minutest circumstances been exactly accomplished  the prophecies of daniel are plain and decisive i cannot be particular on this subject i shall mention one circumstance alexander deliberating on his expedition against persia was encouraged in a dream by a man in a dress which was new to him who assured him of success he had entered on the expedition when he found it necessary to punish the jews who adhered to persia on his march against jerusalem he was met by the high priest in his robes the very person and in the very robes seen in his dream the appearance diverted him from the vengeance which he had determined to take he did reverence to the high priest and offered sacrifices in the temple the prophecies of daniel were shown him which predict in the most circumstantial manner the overthrow of the persian empire they inspired him with confidence in his undertaking the jews who were entrusted with these prophecies he honored and granted them every indulgence which they could wish  nay porphery a learned and ingenius philosopher in the third century and the most formidable and embittered enemy with whom christianity ever struggled was so convinced of the exact fulfillment of the prophecies of daniel that he could no otherwise evade the argument thence in favor of our holy religion than by absurdly supposing in the face of the most incontestable evidence that these were written under the name of daniel by some person at a late period after the events said to be foretold had come to pass prophecies so unequivocal so circumstantial so plain to which even enemies give their attestation are a proof of the divine authority of scriptures which cannot be invalidated  our saviors prediction concerning jerusalem deserves great attention its overthrow is foretold  it should be an entire overthrow and take place whilst the present generation yet existed presages of its approach are specified directions are given to those who when these appeared would secure their personal safety let any considerate person read our saviors prophecy in the twentyfourth chapter of matthew and at the same time look at josephuss account of the destruction of jerusalem and he will certainly be convinced that our savior had the most exact knowledge of what afterward took place and gave a minute and intelligible prediction  it must appear to every one who considers how circumstantially all these prophecies have been given that an opponent of revelation who has lately come into view discovers a rashness and ignorance which is truly pitiable when he speaks of prophecies as delivered in such equivocal language as to fit almost any circumstance that might happen afterward and deridingly adds that shooting with a long bow of a thousand years to strike within a thousand miles of a mark the ingenuity of posterity could make it point blank neither groundless assertions nor loud laughs can command any authority with those who seriously enquire after the truth  i shall call your attention to one prophecy more but which from its great importance and the illustrations which it repeatedly receives may be considered as the leading prophecy of scripture it respects the messiah in whose appearance and character all whither jews or gentiles are nearly concerned he is spoken of as the desire of all nations who destroying the works of the devil should introduce universal righteousness and peace adam knew him as the seed of the woman isaiah as the son of a virgin david as a king whose thrown would be established forever daniel as cut off for the benefit of others micah as putting an end to injustice and war malachi as purifying the sons of levi that they might offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness the former dispensation and the various changes in the state of empires all tended to make way for the messiah and to introduce his government the moment when he should appear and enter on the execution of his office was precisely fixed four hundred years from cyruss decree in favor of the jews brought forward the happy moment to which the eyes of all were directed the prophecy was so plain and circumstantial that all the world were about this time looking out for some illustrious personage from whom they expected great advantages the jews were enquiring after him who was to come the gentiles were expecting the return of the golden age virgils fourth epilogue strongly expresses this expectation how the expectation was raised cannot so easily be ascertained it might from the scriptures themselves which were in such circulation that the inquisitive had it in their power to peruse them or from the sibylline oracles over which evil demons presided but which occasionally were constrained to give an unwilling attestation to the truth virgil was not singular in his expectation both suetonius and tacitus mention a prevailing opinion derived from their sacred writings that about this time some from judea should obtain the government virgil took the advantage of this state of mens minds to compliment his patron the consul asinius polico at the birth of his son saloninus as if this were the person promised to bless the nations that in both jews and gentiles an unusual expectation was excited is certain it is equally certain that their views were too gross and earthly the person expected came but so different from what their imaginations painted that to the jews he was a stumbling block and to the greeks foolishness but he did not live and die in vain he has established a kingdom on earth opposition it has met with and shall meet with but it shall stand it shall increase it shall become universal of this the book of revelation makes us certain persons versed in these kinds of studies know well that many things therein foretold have been accomplished many things are now accomplishing even that infidelity which now so generally prevails is consonant to what has been foreseen and confirms the prediction but when the whole shall be accomplished christ indeed shall reign on earth and restore to mankind the innocence and happiness of the paradisical state  the prophecies of scripture are not delivered in the same language as facts lifting too high the awful veil which conceals futurity must in many instances have been improper neither are these prophecies couched in terms which might be accommodated to whatever should happen there are certain principles by which the prophetic language may be determined the language of the prophecies which have been accomplished with the events which were in view must be contrasted with the language of the prophecies yet to be accomplished whence some idea may be formed of what is to be expected an attentive examination of scripture language with an accurate acquaintance with history is necessary in order to pursue profitably inquiries of this nature thus daniel found out that the deliverance of his people was at hand the jews thus could ascertain when the messiah should make his appearance mr fleming who searched after prophetic knowledge writing about an hundred years ago was certain from the revelation of john that a revolution would take place in france previously to the year      different writers have lately treated the subject of prophecies with great sagacity no knowledge of any kind can be acquired without pains it argues great rashness to pronounce on subjects with which we have no acquaintance it is easy for an ignorant person to say that none can acquire information with respect to the planets and their motions such assertions however no ways affect these studies it is the same with prophecy if a a man has never turned his thoughts that way he may pronounce them enigmatical and trifling but it is not a proof of a considerate person to make such assertions until he examines into the matter lest he expose at once his folly and rancour at revelation  what a glorious attestation do prophecies afford our holy religion a mind less comprehensive than divine could never view events so various so contingent so distant in time and place with such exactness and mark them out as circumstantially as if they were present discoveries of this nature are made in scripture as the events which are foretold come forward they afford new and irresistible evidences of the truth of revelations that scripture has this seal of heaven is not the belief of weak and credulous minds only but also of the most discerning sir isaac newton to whom we are indebted for our acquaintance with the solar system was so well assured of the truth of prophecies that he has illustrated them by a judicious and useful commentary our holy religion possesses attestations of the most satisfactory nature but man will not take the trouble to examine these it is not their wish that revelation be true and they speak according to their wishes such conduct is common in our age it is a crime of an aggravated nature it cries for vengeance the time has been when the enemies of our religion were unashamed of their opposition and could venture to carry it on in the dark only and in an underhanded manner now they assert their unfounded systems and daring blasphemies openly in the most frequented companies and even in public prints it is very strange that the friends of revelation cannot amuse themselves with the transactions of the day without also being shocked with silly ideas at what they account most sacred and of higher moment than even life or any of its enjoyments it will be necessary for them if such practices continue to unite in denying themselves an innocent and proper amusement rather than be repeatedly wounded by attacks upon religion of the most insolent and offensive kind were the subject easily and rationally discussed the friends of religion are always ready to meet any on this ground and to give an account of the faith which is in them but running into unsupported assertions virulent reproaches and insolent scorn neither their inclination their honor nor their religion allow them to meet any on such ground  i am persuaded every serious enquirer will be impressed with the attestations given to our holy religion others as they do not desire to know the truth must stand to all the consequences of remaining in ignorance  having now illustrated the glorious attestation afforded our holy religion from prophecy i ought next to show the attestation given it from miracles  discourse v inspiration argued from miracles acts viii    then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done   it has universally been expected that men acting under divine authority should confirm their pretensions by some miracles the nature of miracles may be better understood by bringing some in view than by any definition they commanded from philip preaching the gospel of christ among the samaritans attention and belief nay not from the samaritans only but from simon himself who was profoundly versed in every species of deceit which could impose upon mankind but of such powers as philip possessed he had no idea simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done  it is evidently deducible from these words that miracles are a proper attestation to the scripture and that those which are true have an intrinsic value of which others are destitute i shall at present attempt through divine assistance the illustration of both these particulars i shall offer no definitions nor lay down nice distinctions i shall simply state a few facts and then draw some conclusions  before the days of moses miracles are no where mentioned they were not previously known nor was it necessary that they should the nearer we approach the beginning of the world the more simplicity appears of gods revealing himself to mankind no doubt was entertained in succeeding ages the original tradition became more obscure and mens imaginations vain they could not confine themselves to the simple truth first it was disguised then questioned and at last denied this was the state of things in egypt moses could not gain credit on his own testimony that god had spoken to him in the bush pharaoh demanded some proof of his acting under divine authority which might exceed whatever could be effected by the deepest researches into nature with this moses complied he wrought miracles of various kinds a controuling power was discovered over all the elements the air was turned into darkness of so uncommon a nature that they could neither kindle any fire nor keep any flame alive it distracted the timorous and agitated the most undaunted the hail was dreadful and the fire withered every thing green an odious swarm was produced and the most pernicious insects invaded the land diseases fell upon the body the river turned into blood could not be drunk the firstborn of men and beast died and a rod thrown on the ground was changed into a hissing envenomed serpent in all this there could be no trick nor collusion no power but the divine could put out the sun or awake the thunder could arm insects with mischief and the lightning with death could afflict men in their persons and in all their comforts could change the helpful staff into the envenomed serpent or removing these calmities at his pleasure render men easy in their minds and safe in their circumstances realize egypt at this awful crisis think of the judgments which came upon them in a gradual succession and each more formidable than the other let it be particularly marked that goshen where the israelites resided was perfectly exempted from every plague dark in egypt it was light in goshen the egyptians were sick and dying not one sickly among the israelites nor in any danger when fire and hail when insects of various kinds were destructive to the master the slave free from destruction dwelt in safety having such a view could you have hesitated one moment was not the hand of god evidently distinguishable was not moses the servant of the most high did he not act under a divine commission  these operations were new and pharaoh was willing to ascertain their nature he called in his magicians to his assistance their character and pretensions are not well known jannes and jambres are named by the apostle as withstanding moses pliny the natural historian mentions the former of these in conjunction with moses and numenius the philosopher mentions both of them in the same conjunction as celebrated magicians in several miracles they were successful they produced frogs turned the water into blood and their rods into serpents it is evident from the scripture that the worshippers of idols were the worshippers of devils the power of these fallen spirits is certainly great it was now exerted to the utmost the magicians knew not whether their attempt would succeed whatever their enchantments were the effect was doubtful they made the attempt where they failed as well as where they succeeded the contest was between the power of fallen spirits and the divine power the issue might have been expected the divine power was gloriously triumphant the others under control was checked in the beginning of its success and could prevail for mischief only the magicians could avert none of the judgments introduced by moses and as soon as they were unsuccessful they dropped any further attempt acknowledging the finger of god after this pharaoh no more sought their assistance the point was decided the miracles of moses were done by the almighty and bore the seal of heaven to the commission of his servant if persons on the spot who knew the whole mystery of deceit and had at stake interest and reputation could moses have been made out an impostor were constrained to declare that god did by him works which exceeded the reach of human power in league with fellow spirits i cannot see how a different opinion can be entertained by even infidelity itself  could we fix our attention entirely to what the scriptures relate and impress our minds with their credibility we must often be astonished suppose a vast multitude on the banks of the potowmack their enemies press upon them with an armed force which cannot be resisted in this distress imagine that the stream divides the waters rise on each side forming a wall a path being left dry between through which the multitude may pass passed over they look back upon the enemy in eager haste pursuing through this unusual tract  i see the waters on either hand break in and drown the embattled hosts could you avoid ascribing all to the almighty and acknowledging that he distinguishes between the oppressor and the oppressed this is no imaginary scene it was experienced soon after the israelites left eygpt to admit them to the wilderness and again forty years having elapsed that they might enter the land promised their fathers the first instance has been greatly disguised both by josephus the jew and writers from among the gentiles but the miracle is undoubted and was well adapted to confirm the israelites in their obedience to god and to warn the surviving egyptians that there was no contending with the most high in this also they could not be deceived the israelites passed through the channel they saw with their eyes the waters on either hand the spray fell upon them like a thick mist which suggested to the apostle the idea of their being baptized unto moses in the sea on the opposite shore when looking back they found the enemy buried in the deep imposition in this instance was impossible it was evident to the senses of thousands if their seeing hearing or feeling could be credited all was real god had indeed appeared in their behalf and manifested evidently his power and glory  a mixed multitude consisting of many thousands were not likely to subsist long in a wilderness unimproved with food with raiment or any necessary yet in this same wilderness the vast multitude subsisted for forty years without cultivating the ground without commerce without manufactories in the ordinary course of things it could not have been it was one continued miracle their clothing and food were miraculously provided they wanted nothing and yet nothing came in the ordinary way they were under an immediate divine conduct the command of god denounced by moses and discovered in the motions of the wonderful cloud directed their journeyings or encampments he fed them from heaven preserved them in vigor and prevented their clothes from wearing out these facts are as well attested as any historical facts can be and they gave an astonishing discovery of the power and goodness of god  i shall not insist on many others of a like nature it is enough to observe that these were most common in the establishment of the jewish economy although never altogether wanting in babylon a few miracles are on record whereby the jews were vindicated in the belief and worship of the living and the true god the preservation of the three children in the fiery furnace and of daniel in the lions den the punishment of nebuchadnezzar and his remarkable recovery greatly tended to advance the honor of jehovahs name among the idolatrous nations these facts were all well ascertained done in the presence of a prodigious concourse of all ranks and characters and had a great effect procuring different decrees from the most haughty and idolatrous monarchs on earth enjoining worship and obedience to the most high  as the jewish dispensation was established by miracles so was the christian the expected messiah appearing was pleased for three years to take upon himself a public character every day he employed for the benefit of mankind he relieved all who applied to him he gave to the blind their fight and to the deaf their hearing his creative power restored to the high priests servant the ear which peter had smitten off and to many their deficient members he raised from the dead a widows son at naen and his friend lazarus at bethany the most inveterate lunacy and afflictive possession yielded to his command he calmed the raging of the sea and multiplied a few loaves and fishes to satisfy an hungry concourse he escaped from the enraged nazarenes they knew not how and by a word perhaps a commanding look laid his enemies prostrate at his feet these things were not done in private nor were they seldom repeated they were done in the most frequented places and multiplied daily his enemies did not could not deny what was done whatever construction their perverse minds put upon them and his attendants in astonishment insisted when christ comes will he do more miracles than these which this man has done nicodemus acknowledged that no man can do these miracles which thou do except god be with him and a man who had been born blind but recovered his sight declared before the jewish sanhedrim with great simplicity of heart why herein is a mavelous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he has opened mine eyes now we know that god hears not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and does his will him he hears since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of god he could do nothing they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and do thou teach us and they cast him out  nay my brethren not only were these things done by our lord himself but his desciples were empowered by him to do the same things in his name and this power continued with them for more than two hundred years among other extraordinary endowments they were enabled instantaneously to speak the language of any nation as fluently as if they had been natives and if i mistake not a specimen of this power remains in the church the new testament having been written originally in greek by those who were native jews and had no opportunity of acquiring in the ordinary course of things any acquaintance with a foreign language i find a circumstance much insisted on by mr addison and which he considers and very justly as a striking miracle i mean the fortitude and perseverance with which the young and the old the feeble and the robust the high and the low submitted to lingering and severe tortures when a renunciation of christianity or in some instances silence only would have prevented these severities or immediately have interrupted them human nature could not have held out without uncommon assistance from above this was frequently acknowledged stephen beheld his savior ready to receive his departing spirit others have been strengthened by an angel these facts were of such notoriety that even enemies have not ventured to call them in question they are a glorious attestation to our holy religion the more they are examined the more they must impress the mind  enemies have in different ways attempted to lesson their weight they mention a miracle wrought by vespasian the emperor who touching the eyes of a blind man restored him to sight allowing this which is not fully ascertained god might hereby put honor on a man who in conjunction with his son titus was appointed his instrument to punish the jews the philosopher apollonius is often mentioned by the enemies of our holy religion as a rival in doing miracles to our savior producing such a rivalship is a tacit acknowment that our savior did miracles with respect to apollonius many things said to be done by him are very ridiculous and whatever he did they are vouched by a weak and credulous person only his servant damis but what are these when compared to the miracles of our savior who publicly subjected to every degree of examination did more miracles in three years than moses and all the prophets put together and continued this power some ages with the church  that some things may be imposed upon men as miracles which are not is generally granted in scripture simon magus spoken of in my text before philips arrival in samaria used sorcery but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries  in philippi as the apostles went to pray as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which show unto us the way of salvation and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour and when her masters sow that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers  it is evident that this girl was under an evil influence and thereby enabled by her discoveries and actions to astonish the people but the power under which she acted could not resist the command of the apostle speaking in his masters name the scripture expressly foretells that that wicked shall be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because he has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth  wonderful things may according to these passages be done and of a nature too that were it possible they could deceive even the elect the scripture ascribes these to evil spirits they seek the shade and confirm men in their forgetfulness of god or in a depraved or corrupted conduct they have always yielded to true miracles which dispel these mists and encourages regard for god and purity in heart and life in this world impositions of different kinds are practiced these render no person of consideration skeptics neither ought counterfeits in religion to render them infidels true miracles are done openly in the face of the sun to the conviction of our senses and are wrought by persons of character and piety to confirm men in the purest doctrines and the most glorious hopes false miracles are few and concealed they avoid inspection and reconcile men to their evil habits and practices these are plain distinguishing rules applied to the miracles of scripture they discover their veracity they are the attestation of heaven to our holy religion mosess miracles became the more conspicuous and uncontroverted in consequence of opposition from pharaohs magicians philips confirmation to the gospel in consequence of simons sorceries the excellency and stability of the truth in consequence of the errors and falsehoods which arise  our savior appeals to his miracles in attestation of his character and urges upon the jews the unreasonableness of their unbelief having such an evidence of his coming from god if i had not done among them the works which none other did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father what god had done before the israelites is recapitulated as a new motive to obedience know you that day says moses for i speak not with your children which have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god his greatness his mighty hand and his stretched out arm and his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto his land and what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the waters of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the lord has destroyed them unto this day  it is not necessary that such miracles be continued well authenticated they have the same weight with remote ages as with the present assuring them that the dispensation which they attest is from god it is the unhappiness of mankind to be inconsiderate the heart is naturally averse to divine truth whatever invalidates it is listened unto be if ever so trifling even a contemptuous sneer although overborne by the most weighty considerations in no light does human nature appear for depraved in no light can it appear more truly pitiable let us not yield to such a bias let us weigh the attestations given to our holy religion let our eyes be directed to god to impress these upon our minds let us reverence what we must admit proceeds from god and take rules to which in prophecies and in miracles the seal of heaven is affixed as our guide in life then our conviction shall be confirmed and our path as the morning light shall shine more and more unto the perfect day  every step we have taken in the present discussion gives us new reason to receive the scriptures as the word of god and to reject with indignation whatever is designed to asperse or undervalue them and i make no doubt but an inclination to receive the word of god and an aversion at what tends to asperse and undervalue them will increase if the considerations i have yet to propose be well weighed  discourse vi the miracles attending our saviors death considered matthew xxvii    now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god   the alarming events which are related in this chapter or which may be collected from the other evangelists who speak of our saviors crucifixion and death made deep impression on the mind of the roman officer commanding the guard at his execution those events and the impression which the spectators received from them are brought into view and appear in an effecting light in our text now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god  discoursing from these words i propose through divine assistance  i to explain the nature of the events to which our text has an immediate respect and  ii to show how the centurion and those that were with him watching jesus were effected by them  explaining the nature of the events to which our text has an immediate respect it will be necessary to view them in order that each may receive proper attention  the first thing of which i take notice is the darkness which overspread the land for three hours this darkness was very remarkable it happened at full moon when that body could not be interposed between our earth and the sun which is fully ascertained to be the cause of eclipses and consequently the appearance cannot be accounted for on any known principle but must be considered as supernatural and miraculous  no eclipse can be total for so long a space as three hours nor can it at the same instant embrace the whole hemisphere in its shade as the account we have in the evangelists and the testimony of some profane authors lead us to suppose happened in the case before us all which considerations make the present appearance the more amazing and oblige us in accounting for it to have recourse to the immediate interposition and power of god he who kindled the sun at first and appointed him to rule the day can easily extinguish his ires at pleasure or withhold his cheering influence the exertion of such power then was every way suitable to the transaction of that important day it was a sign from heaven after which the jews had always been so anxious in proof of our saviors mission it was a token of displeasure against the jews for shutting their eyes to other evidences of this which were fully convincing and for allowing their blindness and malice to hurry them on to such dangerous lengths it was also a lively emblem of the struggle which the lord of nature now underwent with the powers of darkness and of the bitterness of distress which overwhelmed his spirit  the second thing of which i take notice is the earthquake of this my text makes particular mention and the rending of the rocks which was possibly a consequence of the earthquake according to some this shock was generally felt through the world according to others it was perceivable in judea only or in the places near where our savior was put to death be this as it may it was certainly attended with very terrible circumstances agitating the ground to the very spot on which the temple stood tearing the neighboring rocks asunder in an alarming manner and leaving in that opening a monument of this event to succeeding ages an earthquake is one of the most dreadful phenomena of nature sometimes it indicates that god is at hand the sea saw it and fled jordan was driven back the mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like lambs what ailed thee o thou sea that thou fledest thou jordan that thou wast driven back ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills like lambs tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the presence of the god of jacob at other times it indicates the divine wrath coming to relieve his servant from the oppression of his enemies at gods appearance the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it of both the divine presence and displeasure was this earthquake expressive it pointed out the eminence of the sufferer he was the son of god and savior of the world much indignity had been done him the very rocks and stones cry out against the madness and impiety of men and had it not been for his timely intercession father forgive them his enemies would in all likelihood have been immediately swallowed up and irrecoverably lost  the third thing of which i take notice is that the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom this veil was a hanging of the richest and strongest tapestry which separated the holy from the most holy place being now the time of the evening sacrifice and upon a solemn occasion when the high priest probably caiaphas himself was ministering at the golden altar and burning incense this veil was by an invisible power rent in two in the midst from the top to the very bottom whereby the sacred oracle was laid open to full view this was an awful and significant sign particularly suited to rouse the consciences of the jews and convince them that their persecution of jesus unto death was offensive unto god who would now abolish mosaic rites and services and open a passage for the jew and the gentile for the greek and barbarian who believe in him through the new and living way of obedience unto death unto the holiest of all  the fourth thing which deserves our attention is that having cried with a loud voice he yielded up the ghost the voice is among the first things in a dying person that fails him faltering so much that the few broken sentences attempted to be uttered are scarcely intelligible but our savior speaking as a man in full vigor and strength discovered that he was not yet exhausted but could have survived for a much longer time the tortures of the cross yielding up the ghost while so much life remained explains what he had formerly declared to his disciples no man takes away my life from me i lay it down of myself he withdrew from the body and died by an act of his own according to the power which he had received of his father he could have done so the moment he was nailed to the cross leaving an insensible corpse to the insults and cruelty of his enemies but he endured his suffering as long as was necessary with patience and resolution then he left the body in such a manner and with so much dignity as had not in any former instance nor can in any succeeding be equalled this circumstance in a particular manner affected the centurion who as another evangelist expressly informs us when he saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost glorified god by the confession in our text the loud voice which he uttered is very significant it may be considered as the shout of a conqueror now spoiling principalities and powers and making a show of them openly on his cross or the proclamation of a herald pointing out to all the world the prince of life mighty to save  the last thing i take notice of is that the graves were opened and many bodies of saints which slept arose it is likely that the tombs were opened by the earthquake and whilst they continued unclosed the dead bodies which were deposited recovered life and came forth to the astonishment of all those who saw or were informed of this fact it was an expressive event particularly so at this time discovering at once the resurrection of the body and the connection which this has with the death and resurrection of our savior from the dead the suns withholding his light at midday the earths trembling the rocks rending the veil of the temple torn by an invisible hand from the top to the bottom our saviors evidently yielding up his life by an act of his own the deads coming out of their graves are events well suited to command the attention and reach the heart which brings us to the  ii general head in which i proposed to show how the centurion and those that were with him watching jesus were effected by these alarming events it is said  first that they feared greatly were thrown into a panic lest they should be lost in the darkness or burried in the earthquake lest that god to whom vengeance belonged should in some very terrible manner avenge the quarrel of the savior both against them and the body of the jewish nation in general a guilty mind is conscious of amazement and distress even when there is no apparent danger but this becomes oppressive and overwhelming when god appears in such dreadful majesty as he now discovered these tormenting apprehensions were not peculiar to the soldiers who were on guard but another evangelist maks it known that all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned  we may easily suppose that the crowd which was now together was uncommonly great considering how much the fame of jesus was spread through judea and what vast multitudes were drawn to jerusalem to celebrate the feast that multitude many of whom in all likelihood had lately joined in the tumultuous outcry crucify him crucify him were now confounded with remorse and laid deeply to heart what had happened to which convictions we may reasonably ascribe a predisposition for the success which afterward attended the apostles ministrations the terror into which they were now thrown led them  second to confess truly this was the son of god we find a like confession once and again made by those who during our saviors personal ministry were witnesses of the miraculous power which he possessed its meaning considering the persons by whom it was made cannot be supposed always to have been precise and determined it however evidently includes thus much that the person spoken of was a dignified person and of unblemished sanctity was dear unto god and had particular interest with him was more than is found in human nature and possessed distinguished excellencies these or some such ideas are expressed in the confession before us  the sanhedrim condemn him for blasphemy in asserting that he was the son of god the multitude assent to the condemnation as just but the tide is turned they believe his pretensions to be well founded hereafter they expect to see him on the right hand of power coming in the clouds of heaven  the centurion and his soldiers the distant spectator and he who was near jew or gentile startled at the darkness and the earthquake at the extraordinary manner in which he died and the other prodigies which followed were necessitated to declare in spite of meanness and contempt of calumny and reproach of the shame of the cross and the ignominy of death that he was a righteous person whom the jews had maliciously accused whom pilate had wrongfully condemned whom they with wicked mouths and cruel hands had insulted and put to death heaven and earth the living and the dead declare his dignity and put it out of doubt that he was the son of god this confession was made in the  third place by the centurion and those that were with him watching jesus  it was a captain and his company soldiers and romans warlike heroes and experienced veterans whose intrepidity and courage armed their hearts against fear whose familiarity with scenes of cruelty and death hardened them against pity they lately insulted a condemned prisoner and increased by cruel mockings the agony of the cross but their hearts now relent their consciences severely smite them and they yield to a conviction which was so well founded that the person whom they had crucified was the son of god  but the conviction reaches further than among these soldiers the whole multitude of spectators felt its force and discovered the sadness of their hearts in their countenances and by expressive actions a conviction thus general and so well founded must have its weight with every thinking person and indeed it was to be expected from such events as have already been explained and it gives probability to what the evangelists record it may raise a moments doubt that we hear nothing of the relenting of the high priest and of those who were the immediate persecutors of our savior but this doubt will disappear when we remember that they had all along resisted the fullest conviction and most undoubted evidence it was therefore allowed in just judgment that their hearts like the heart of pharaoh should remain hardened and unrelenting but this does not weaken evidence otherwise universal and unexceptionable  we have now finished the observations by which we meant to illustrate this passage and may learn from what has been said how far the facts which have now been explained and the impression which they made on spectators ought to affect us  these are the seal of heaven to the character of jesus they rmove the reproach of the cross they put honor upon his person they enhance the value of his sufferings  whilst we follow our savior to calvary and contemplate the shame and ignominy the pain and distress the insult and cruelty with which he was overwhelmed let us immediately recollect the darkness which prevailed at midday the quaking of the earth the rending of the rocks the veil of the temple torn by an invisible hand the uncommon manner in which our savior died and the dead arising from their graves and appearing unto many and let the recollection of these things sink into our hearts for they testify that the father approved of the savior and excepts of his sufferings as the atonement for our guilt let this therefore be the language of our faith we believe heavenly father in him whom thou approvest and receive him as our savior may we be accepted in the beloved and find in our own experience the sufficiency of his atonement and the efficacy of his grace may we glory in his cross being crucified by it unto the world and having the world crucified unto us we yield ourselves up as his willing people whether we live may we live unto the lord or whether we die may we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die may we be the lords put thy law in our minds and write it in our hearts be our god and may we be thy people teach us to know the greatest and be merciful to our unrighteousness  our sins and our iniquities remember no more  discourse vii the scripture an ancient and genuine production acts xv    moses of old time has in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day   in these words the apostle james in a council assembled at jerusalem to decide on some difficulties which had arisen in the church at antioch and were now under consideration asserts that the old testament was generally known the book itself having for a long time been in circulation and the doctrines which it contained strenuously inculcated moses of old time has in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogue every sabbath day  the antiquity of the scriptures is evidently taught in these words and the great pains which had been taken to transmit them uncorrupted through succeeding ages the illustration of these things is what i am at this time through divine assistance to attempt  considering the scripture as the oldest book in the world it demands in this view the examination of the inquisitive exclusively of its higher demands as a divine revelation  the jewish religion has been of long standing and the jews so confirmed in the belief of its divine origin that no reproach nor suffering could root out this belief from their minds blended with other nations when it was for their interest to forget their own customs and religion they have adhered strictly to both this is the more remarkable since except christians and christianity it has happened to no other people nor religion the support of the secular arm withdrawn false religions have disappeared but judaism and christianity where judaism is refined and perfected have been introduced with such attestations of their proceeding from god that neither change nor affliction have been able to shake this pillar on which they rest  the jews were a very obstinate and incredulous people without the strongest evidence of the divine authority of their law they would never have submitted to such a number of burdensome and painful rites which separated them from all other people and placed them in some instances in a very rediculous point of light there was a settled opinion among them and a constant tradition that god had spoken to moses and had done by him in egypt and in the wilderness what no man unless authorized by god could have done this opinion and tradition gives the greatest credibility of which it is capable to the mosaic history the greeks from whom all nations derive their learning allow that they had their letters from foreigners which letters are the same as the syriac or hebrew the ancient attic laws also whence the roman were afterward taken owe their origin to the laws of moses than these circumstances which are well authenticated by grotius nothing can more convincingly establish the great antiquity of the writings of moses the authorities from which moses drew his history before his own time were good and character as a historian since he neither conceals his own faults nor attempts any thing which could tend to aggrandize his family stands very high the tradition from adam to moses concerning the creation and the subsequent events passed through few and these judicious credible persons methuselah conversed a long time both with adam and noah shem with noah and abraham isaac with abraham and joseph abraham with joseph and moses the information then from adam to moses passed through four persons only who were pious and intelligent who could not mistake the account and were every way disposed to preserve it full and unadulterated besides as science of every kind originated from egypt and the eastern countries and as moses was deeply versed in all their knowledge in this respect were his inspiration out of view he was well qualified for the task which he had undertaken a little before his death moses wrote his law and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished then moses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord saying take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be there for a witness against thee by this law their ritual was regulated and civil causes tried it was the directory for their worship and the guardian of all their priviliges it was necessary that a copy of it should be in the hands of their priests and rulers besides the one lodged in the ark their chief magistrate was obliged to have one copy written with his own hand to regulate him in the execution of his high office under the corrupt princes the divine law was much neglected this had been the case previously to jehosaphats reign yet the law was not lost numbers appointed by this good king had the book of the law of the lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught the people the worship in hezekiahs reign was hereby conducted his successors manasseh and amon were enemies to this law but it was sought after by josiah and strictly obeyed it was not lost during the captivity for ezra regulated the worship of the returning jews according to this law it included the whole books of moses recapitulating its contents nehemiah takes notice of the creation of abrahams history and of the departure of the israelites from egypt antiochus designed to destroy the law but the exertions of judas maccabaeus frustrated that design copies of it has been multiplied the jews had it with them in judea and in their dispersions through every country nor was it long after antiochuss day when the greek version of it was procured to enrich the library of one of the ptolemyes of egypt  the writings of moses have been in the hands of the jews since the first many interests were involved in preserving these unadulterated particularly as they contained their title to a possession in canaan men are very anxious to have titles of this kind undoubted all this anxiety was excited to prevent in the books of which i speak any alteration or curruption circumcision in use from the earliest ages and sacrifices of various kinds the observance of the sabbath and of different festivals the law of inheritances and the criminal law owed either their origin or establishment to moses is it possible that such things could have been imposed upon a people had they been fictitious were these not standing proofs that moses did once live and legislate and living and legislating must not the evidence of his acting under divine authority have been very strong which could overcome the most obstinate incredulity and bend the neck of the most inflexible to a grievous yoke this is a weighty consideration it is forcibly urged against the deists by mr charles leslie in a little but useful treatise called his short and easy method with them and indeed it is a consideration which an attentive person cannot get over by great peculiarities have the jews been distinguished ever since mosess day both in their own land and when strangers in other countries a reverence for moses was transmitted from father to son cotemporaries knew that he was commissioned from god and the impression could never be worn out even when it reflected most on their conduct and pretensions  in the writings of homer we have a good account of heathen theology these writings are confessedly the work of him whose name they hear and allowed to be genuine and ancient writings but is the authenticity of homer any ways equal to the authenticity of moses homers writings were found by lycurgus the lacedemonian legislator when he sailed into asia in detached pieces handed down by tradition only fifty years at least after homers death these pieces were preserved in this detached state under several titles for the religious and political knowledge which they contained until at last they were divided by pisistratus at athens into two poems the iliad and the odyssey this edition was corrected under alexander the great and afterward further under one of the ptolemyes which last edition is now in the hands of the learned homer thus found collected and improved is received as genuine he would be thought a madman by whom this was questioned yet it has not any of the marks of authenticity which belong to the writings of moses he wrote these with his own hand deposited them in the sanctuary and left monuments of their truth which are preserved through every age and seen among all nations to refuse such evidence is to be obstinately ignorant that the pentateuch was written by moses is confirmed by the highest attestation of which the thing can admit  the authenticity of mosess writings being established the authenticity of the rest will follow the jews were then in pessession of methods to determine what came from god and what was merely human joshua wrote the history of his own times and probably the last chapter of deuteronomy the psalms prophecies and histories of a private or public nature were written occasionally and being found genuine were gradually received into the canon ezra after the captivity began to collect them together giving a correct edition of the scripture he made great progress in this work which was completed some years after probably by malachi the whole was divided into sections and from this period read regularly in the synagogues until our saviors appearance who allowed their authenticity  the hints now thrown out must go far in establishing any by whom they are considered in the belief that the old testament is a genuine and an ancient book i proceed to speak of the new  it is the concurrent testimony of jews and gentiles of friends and enemies that jesus christ lived in judea in the reign of tiberius caesar and suffered under pontius pilate the account of his sufferings and death was transmitted to the emperor by the governor of judea and was extant when justin martyr wrote who appeals to it in his apology for christianity addressed to the roman senate equally evident is it that this same jesus after his death was reverenced was worshipped was obeyed by multitudes who bore his name their history is interwoven with the history of the empire christians were found in the palace and in the army among the polite and the rude the ignorant and the well informed edicts were repeatedly issued against them and strictly executed yet they multiplied and handed down their religion through every succeeding generation until the time in which we live the doctrines which jesus taught and which christians believed are contained in the new testament it is not certain at what time the books of the new testament were collected into one volume this we know that before the middle of the second century these books were generally read in every christian society throughout the world and were accounted a divine rule of faith and manners eusebius expressly affirms in his ecclesiastical history that john gave his approbation to the gospels of matthew mark and luke which discountenances the senseless jeer that luke was received into the church by one vote only the gospel had been in general circulation and receiving the apostle johns approbation he added his own as a supplement to the rest the other books of this volume were probably collected at the same time and sanctioned by the same authority spurious productions early appeared these are easily detected the churches to whom the epistles were written preserved them with care and communicated them to others any difficulty arising the truth was easily traced up to the source when either the apostless own writings or evidence equally weighty put the matter out of doubt some of the epistles being questioned after a minute investigation their authenticity was ascertained and they were universally received into the sacred canon the early ages of christianity had great opportunities of ascertaining whether the books of the new testament were written by those who bear their names and it was the opinion of those in these early ages whether friends or enemies that they were christians themselves acknowledged them as such neither jews nor gentiles raised any controversy on this subject julian who had apostatized from christianity and became its embittered enemy frankly confesses that peter and paul matthew mark and luke wrote the books read in christian assemblies under their name dr whitby has many quotations in proof of this particularly dr lardner those who are inquisitive after such information may consult these authors  it was so ordered in the divine providence that the frst ages ould receive the truth of the gospel history through few and very venerable witnesses john who conversed intimately with our savior lived until the year  00 his disciple polycarp who conversed also with others of the apostles lived till the year     ironicus the disciple of polycarp till the year  0  upon his martyrdom origin appeared and advocated christianity very successfully for fiftytwo years paul the famous hermit retired a little before origins death from the decian persecution and lived until the year     about which period the empire embraced the christian revelation this is one channel through which our saviors history might be preserved unadulterated and whence inquisitive persons might acquire the fullest satisfaction upon this mr addison lays great stress it deserves an attentive regard upon the fathers of the church whose information was so good we may certainly for historical facts entirely depend it is their unanimous voice that the scriptures of the new testament as now received were written by the persons who bear their names and were appealed to as divinely inspired writings  some institutions also originating from our saviors time and still preserved in the church such as the observance of the lords day the sacrament of baptism and of the lords supper give great credibility to the gospel history and to the peculiar doctrines by which it is distinguished  the only remaining enquiry is have these writings and institutions been handed down unadulterated are they no ways corrupted nor changed can we receive them as genuine and pure  some circumstances ought to have great weight in attending to these enquiries the writings of moses when once received could in no material point be altered since the original copy was sacredly preserved in the ark to which an appeal might always be made since many copies were in the hands of their magistrates and priests since it was the tenure on which they held their lands and the directory for their worship since the samaritans the bitter enemies of the jews had among them copies of these writings which they considered as sacred the remembrance of a whole nation must have been first entirely obliterated attachment to ancient practices removed an indifference become universal to these titles which secured them in their possessions and connivance be found among inveterate enemies before such corruptions could take place such things were impossible the jews in copying the sacred volume numbered the words and letters as well as sentences reproving the jews for many crimes our savior never once blamed them for corrupting the sacred text they had made it void by their traditions but the text remained in its original state and was approved of on all occasions by our savior and by his apostles as it was not corrupted then it could not afterward when copies thereof were multiplied and in all hands whether christians heathens or jews  the writings of the new testament have been guarded with equal care they could never originally have been admitted had not the facts which they relate the doctrines which they inculcate and the precepts which they prescribe been consonant with the facts the doctrines and the precepts related inculcated and prescribed by those who first spread the gospel and when admitted without an agreement of all the world for the scriptures had soon a general circulation these could not have been falsified that copyjests have committed blunders that errors have crept in through the press is not and cannot be denied it could not have been otherwise without a constant miracle this was not necessary these writings are as correct and pure as any of equal standing nay much more so mankind having every thing at stake in these writings have transmitted them from father to son with the utmost care it would be accounted a petulance very unworthy of an honest enquirer to reject as spurious the ilead or the aeneid because some errors have crept into the copies which are in our hands the petulance is the more inexcusable when the scriptures are in question which are more exempt from such errors than these other writings and come down to us with marks of the highest authenticity  had not the subject been of such importance i should not have treated of it at such length and indeed it might be illustrated in other ways considering the use of reason in religion and showing how much a good life prepossesses a man in favor of the gospel whilst a bad life inclines him to disbelieve it but enough has been said to direct the serious enquirer and we might speak for ever before others will be persuaded to open their eyes to the light which falls from every quarter on this subject  i therefore dismiss the subject at present testifying from the fullest conviction that these writings are indeed the word of god that they are the only safe guide through the darkness experienced in this world that by them afterward we shall assuredly be judged and according to their decision shall either stand or fall  discourse viii the use of reason in religion job xi    for vain man would be wise though man be born like a wild assess colt   we have in these words the situation of man naturally as he comes into the world born like a wild asses colt  and his arrogant pretensions vain man would be wise  i shall attempt at present through divine assistance the illustrations of each of these particulars  man naturally as he comes into the world is likened in my text to the wild assess colt sottish is this animal and stubborn therein is it characteristical of human nature what so helpless as the infant furnished with eyes hands and feet it can neither distinguish one object from another nor handle what is before it nor walk to the mind belongs many eminent qualities in infancy these lie dormant there is no trace of reason the future philosopher or the future idiot is not at this period to be known they are superior in nothing to the lower orders of creation in some respects they are their inferiors the perfect use of any sense or of any member is acquired in a very gradual manner the improvement of the mind is still more gradual it is a long time before we attain any useful knowledge some even after a long life know very little the most knowing find that they know in part only the present state in reference to the future rises little even when eminently improved above the state of infancy in reference to manhood this has readily been confessed by all who have given the matter any degree of attention whether they have enjoyed the direction of a divine revelation or have been directed by natural religion only pauls sentiments on this subject are well known speaking of endowments which rendered the possessor in his day celebrated and useful he speaks of them as adapted to an infant state only and ready soon to be laid aside and forgotten whether says he there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophecy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see as through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known of those who were left to the dictates of natural religion socrates was the most penetrating and moral yet he frankly acknowledged on all occasions that his knowledge by no means deserved the name it astonished him to hear that the oracle had pronounced him the wisest of men it must be said this distinguished man because i have found out that i know nothing  mankind thus helpless and ignorant in the infant state and acquiring even when most improved by religious and philosophical knowledge comparatively very inconsiderable seize are too headstrong it is but little they know nor are they anxious after knowledge much time and pains have been thrown away on numbers the darkness of their minds has been too gross to penetrate and their dispositions too obdurate to receive any polish when families or tribes have long separated from the rest of mankind they have generally sunk into a savage state in which the man has been degraded into the animal and the highly boasted gift of reason been hardly discernable a general intercourse with different nations preserves appearances but even this is not sufficient the united effort of the reason of nations celebrated as polite has left men under the influence of the most absurd opinions and corrupt practices  bewildered as mankind are in their opinions and degenerated in their practices their pretensions are high and arrogant vain man would be wise  he ventures upon the most abstruse subjects  no guide is supposed necessary  he can guide his own steps  providence has put the matter to an issue the gentile world had originally a simple and distinct tradition concerning the creation of the world and the object of worship what they saw of gods works what they experienced of his providence confirming that tradition ought to have rendered them devout thankful and obedient such the tendency of their advantages and nothing prevented their operating thus but mans vanity he would not keep to the simple truth but must blend it with his own inventions one invention was introduced after another until the truth was so entirely disguised that it could not be known syphis a king of egypt near abrahams time first ventured on such bold practices kings and philosophers in after ages trod too exactly in his footsteps forming a monstrous fabric of which we have a sad picture in the epistle to the romans the apostle speaks of the heathen world professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventers of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them  whether mankinds advantages have been greater or less the improvement of them through a vain imagination has been neglected the apostle paul beheld the working of this disposition in his own day folly was dignified with high sounding titles still it was folly revelation no where discourages useful knowledge whatever is for the convenience and happiness of man either in this world or in the next has its countenance and approbation but speculations which inflame mens pride and corrupt their conduct are uniformly discountenanced as unfit for them and of pernicious consequence beware says the apostle lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit again avoid profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called and again neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying in such admonitions the scriptures by no means discourage any useful knowledge more than physicians do who guard against dangerous pretenders to their art a philosophy which disguises the truth and depraves the practice but which has always been in too much repute is certainly pernicious incurring justly that censure thrown upon it in the scripture  having stated these few facts which give a mortifying view of human nature it will be necessary to find out if possible what is meant by reason which is so much spoken of and opposed by numbers very improperly to revelation reason is that intellectual principle which raises us above mere animal nature it capacitates us for receiving valuable knowledge it is our distinguishing characterestic it advances us in the scale of being we do not depreciate this principle for it is our glory let its operations be natural without any force or improper biass and it will operate for our advantage  i have considered reason as that capacity of the soul whereby we receive knowledge it has its particular sphere the sun diffuses its heat and light to a certain length in space at a certain point its influence ceases the eye takes in a limited view beyond this vision cannot reach the vibrations which produce sound affect the air to a precise extent angels are capable of certain kinds of knowledge and in a certain degree this capacity is different in different orders in all it is finite some things exceed their reach to them these are incomprehensible every thing has its bound whether it be the material system or intellectual capacity it belongs to the divine mind only to be infinite in its capacities and perfection  this is so evident that i need not attempt any illustration the subject had not at all been introduced were there not generally a very improper way of expressing ourselves man conceiving so extravagantly of reason as to place it on the throne of god and to worship this deity of their own creation it was a humor of the same kind in our first parents who expected to deify themselves by disobedience let me here propose a few plain enquiries there is no doubt but men have been in possession of reason from the first were ancient legislators and philosophers indebted for their knowledge whereby they became very useful and celebrated to their own reasoning by no means they traveled from one country to another collecting carefully such tradition as had escaped the hand of time and treasuring these in their minds formed from that source their systems of legislation and of wisdom what kind of religion originated from the speculations of men who laying aside tradition and every foreign assistance depended wholly upon themselves it was the most monstrous which can be imagined the creature was mistaken for the creator a four footed beast for the object of worship a creeping insect for the eternal mind has this principle an energy in our day which it had not in former days i am not sensible that it has dignified with a proud title it is not more the age of reason than other ages the age of revolutions would have been a more characteristical title is the book which compliments so highly the age in which we live a specimen of enlightened reason it is such a specimen as effrontery and ignorance of the subject can give whether this ignorance be pretended or real i shall not determine but it is gross and lamentable having spoken of the old testament the author introduces a new subject so much says he for the bible i now proceed to the new testament astonishing does he not know even the title of the book with which he contends the bible is the general name including both the old and the new testament and puts a mark of distinction on these writings the author quibbles at the titles old and new testament greater and lesser prophets this quibble arises from want of information these title are not in the text but mark out certain books doing this they answer the purpose of names and no more but the writings themselves are no more accountable for these names than the writings of homer for the names odissey and iliad given them long after the authors death the nineteenth psalm is celebrated as an original piece of deistical composition although that psalm be written expressly to show the excellency of revelation the author ridicules the system of revelation by placing perhaps in a proper light the inventions of men who enjoy this revelation this is neither candid nor just we have nothing to do with the systems of men let us confine ourselves to our bibles doing this a great part of his ridicule is lost i would call no man master on earth not even calvin himself to the law and to the prophets i appeal had this been done the book dignified with a proud title had never appeared it is contended that our savior did not mean to die for his enemies could not have discovered the lurking places to which he had retired without the assistance of a treacherous disciple this is intolerable is it not known that our savior on every day of that week on which he suffered entered publicly the city of jerusalem with his disciples walked through the streets not in disguise but attended with the shouts of multitudes repaired to the temple and taught with intrepidity and freedom from morning to night the book itself which this presumptuous writer has sent forth affords the best analogy for such ignorance of which the nature of the thing can admit declaring that the author had for some time declined having a bible in his possession and could not where he was procure a copy is it reasonable to condemn unheard to decide without examining to take things for granted which are absolutely false and to found on them a system derogatory to the honor of our holy religion if this be reason i renounce it as unworthy of notice let the author i speak of be its sole possessor it can neither do him nor any body else any material benefit  whatever revolutions have lately taken place proceed not i apprehend merely from the principle of reason if they did we should see an uniform system wisely contrived steadily prosecuted and beautifully completed nothing of all this appears these events have arisen from the impulse of the moment the first causes of these had not in view what afterward took place and the issue may be vastly different from what the present agents in them propose the fact is the world is goved by an invisible agent who uses men as his instruments and presides over the wild tumult of passion and folly to introduce his own designs and perfect his own work  it appears from these observations that reason has not that absolute control over either religious or civil matters which some men would assert secret springs generally unobserved produce effects which astonish the world although mankind be agents in what is going on and nearly concerned neither is the plan theirs nor the completion of that plan it is arrogant to assume to human effort that in which they are merely instruments and however brilliant and even useful would soon come to naught were it not part of the divine plan in governing the world  we must recur them to our first observation that reason is that principle which capacitates mankind for receiving knowledge this principle has been greatly perverted both in apostate angels and in fallen man they see things in a false light and from their mistaken apprehensions they raise systems of a monstrous and ruinous kind what the eye is to the body reason is to the soul if the eye be diseased the body has no distinct vision if reason be perverted the soul is deceived by erroneous systems it is gratifying to the pride of mankind to form splendid systems out of their vain speculations thus they thicken the darkness which already overclouds their minds they ought to acquaint themselves with simple facts and let these lead them to the truth i have in the course of the present examination mentioned a number of topics whence a divine revelation may be argued it is the business of reason to sift the matter thoroughly and to see how far a divine revelation may be argued from these topics convinced that the claim is not vain but that there are writings which proceed from god then reason will suggest the necessity and wisdom of yielding ourselves up to the direction which these afford without a murmuring thought or contentious word the writings whose divine authority i have attempted to vindicate are introduced with a few plain facts from these a system of religious and moral duties is deduced these facts are first principles let their nature be well ascertained they open the way for further discoveries the foundation laid on a rock the fabric will resist the most threatening and violent storms  in a divine revelation we may well expect some astonishing discoveries all nature is involved in mystery we penetrate very little into what falls under our observation in the heavens on the earth or through the sea if we reject every thing which exceeds our understanding we must reject the existence of god for we cannot conceive how any being could have existed from eternity without any cause of its existence we must reject the whole system of the universe for we have no idea of the manner in which such a system was produced was organized or is preserved in its present state the union of soul of body cannot be admitted for we can neither apprehend the nature thereof nor give an account of it let the same humor be indulged the man will become not a deist only but a skeptic and even an atheist  i can see nothing unreasonable in supposing that the godhead should be to a finite capacity incomprehensible i cannot comprehend the human and how can i the divine nature the scripture asserts one god in the godhead the scripture speaks of the father the son and the holy ghost i receive this on the credit of scripture i have found the scripture to be a divine revelation i submit therefore to its instruction a child must receive many things on the credit of the parent a scholar on the credit of the teacher must i reject what exceeds my understanding when god only is speaking this ought rather to be a new motive to acquiesce infinite wisdom cannot deceive me what is taught me i may not know now but i shall know afterward i see a light in scripture i follow whether it leads without distrust it shall lead to heaven the same observations apply to the atonement which i have now made concerning the god head the reasons for this wonderful dispensation i cannot ascertain i receive it as a part of divne revelation it must be necessary it gives me hope and refreshment it invigorates the soul and leads to a holy life it mortifies me to the mortal life and awakes in me immortality i receive the doctrine as divne it exceeds my comprehension now but it shall be part of my entertainment afterward to see it unfolded until then i give myself up to divine direction this i ought to do as an erring and guilty creature not my will is my daily language thine be done  my text discovers the great cause why men reject the scripture they would be wise although they be born as the wild assess colt remedying this disease the scripture requires if any man among you seems to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise let overgrown conceits of his own wisdom be laid aside that he may submit himself in the most unreserved manner to the divine direction verily said our savior to his desciples except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven little children are wholly under the direction and authority of their parents whom they believe whom they obey equal confidence equal submission is due from creatures to the creator and they can never be either happy or safe whilst it is otherwise on this principle is the general language of scripture whosoever exaleth himself shall be abased and he that humbles himself shall be exalted persons of an humble disposition have great encouragements to this man will i look says the lord even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembles at my word a different disposition incurs gods displeasure he challenges it as his own prerogative to look on every one that is proud and bring him low he shall despise their image the day of vengeance shall burn them up it shall leave them neither root nor branch  discourse ix a moral life disposes a man to receive but an immoral to reject the gospel john vii      my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself   in these words our savior addresses himself to the jews nothing can be conceived more obstinate than their opposition both to his person and doctrine this opposition is here ascribed to their lives wicked themselves they could not endure the holiness required in the doctrine and exemplified in the character of jesus christ let them cease to do evil that they may be open to conviction and that the truth may break with irresistible evidence upon their minds my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself  discoursing from these words i shall endeavor through divine assistance to illustrate the import of doing the will of god and to discover how far such conduct disposes us for receiving the doctrine of christ as divine  the way of holiness is so plain that the wayfaring man though a fool cannot err therein few are the rules of conduct and easy level to every capacity intelligible by every understanding he may run that reads them to one principle to one word may the whole be reduced  love he that loves has fulfilled the law it is equally effectual whether god or christ ourselves or others be in question persons of the best capacity and of the greatest refinement know well that there is not a more difficult thing than to arrest the operations of their own minds and to determine accurately concerning them should i enquire of any now hearing me do you love god or christ yourselves or others you would probably hesitate the answer is connected with a number of conclusions which ought previously to be drawn let me simplify the question and enquire have you any reason for the exercise of this affection and is your conduct correspondent your reply brings us directly to the point you know there is reason for the exercise of this affection by the mind you rank higher than the beasts of the field or the fowls of heaven you are thus akin to angels this is the choicest gift of god it has been stamped with his own image the body is adapted to our circumstances on earth and furnished with such members such senses such capacities as promote our convenience and comfort the peace of the mind the welfare of the body are the care of god both are considered in the constitution of this lower world and there is a better world where the ills incident to this are fully remedied when these circumstances are known can any thing be imagined more natural than worship and service let men only be persuaded of their relation to god and of the obligations under which as individuals as families as larger societies he has laid them and that these obligations are multiplied every day every hour every instant they must immediately perceive that prayer and praise reverence and obedience love and confidence in the closet in the family in the church in the more private or public walks of life are equally rational pleasant and indispensible were not men very inconsiderate they would never forget god precepts for the performance of such duties as i have been stating would hardly be requisite to these you would naturally be impelled if you be hungry need you be commanded to eat or thirsty to drink if languid and weary is it necessary to press you by persuasions and entreaties by promises and threatenings to receive cordials or to take rest no in such circumstances such conduct is as necessary and natural as it is to breathe equally so are all the duties of religion to the person who considers his obligations to god both for existence and for whatever renders existence a blessing  our relation to god and the obligations under which he has laid us are easily understood they do not exceed the reach of the meanest capacity are we equally related equally obligated to jesus christ an answer to this cannot be given without recollecting an era in the history of mankind mortifying in the highest degree and pernicious we re tossed about by furious passions betrayed by violent appetites we are subjected to vanity from the mind and from the body from ourselves and from others from the state of things here from what are apprehended shall be the state of things hereafter originate troublesome constant and various evils it was not so from the first man was made upright he was placed in the midst of delights all within all without what he then enjoyed what he knew he should afterward enjoy conspired to complete his happiness being in honor he abode not he rebelled against the creator with a daring rashness he touched he tasted the fruit which on the severest penalties was prohibited since that moment man sides with fallen angels painful is the representation given of human nature by the apostle but it is drawn from real life he represents it to be  earthly sensual and devilish the misery in which we were sunk the ruin in which we were overwhelmed excited the pity of jesus he undertook our deliverance i think i hear him address his father let the condemnatory sentence which they have incurred fall upon me let thy sword awake against thy fellow let it smite the shepherd let my life be taken for their life my blood for their blood accept of my intercessions in their behalf let them be renewed let them be sanctified let them be justified through the merit of my death and the operations of my spirit and be thou glorified in me and i in them the father accepted of the sons interposition he invested him with the mediatorial office through his death through his intercession through his prevailing influence men are rescued from ruin are received into favor are prepared for heaven let a man once be sensible of his guilty miserable situation let him behold the saviors interposition as warding off eternal destruction and restoring the privileges which he had forfeited he must with the utmost ardour recognize his deliverer and entrust with him his recovery believing in christ is particularly spoken of as the work by which god is more immediately honored the stupidity and ingratitude of hearing with indifference of such a salvation and such a savior excites the apostless indignation who pronounces the doom which a moments reflection must discover to be unavoidable if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maunatha let him remain under the curse and in his own person feel what his disobedience incurs  the love of god and of christ instantly suggests the obligation under which we are laid to both and the duties by which this obligation is best fulfilled self love is a principle distinct from either of the two i have mentioned it has a precise object the peace and welfare of the body and of the mind are intended of these self love is the guardian it is aware of danger and avoids it it examines in what course safety may be expected and determines to that course rather than any other the vindictive and intemperate act against its dictates both do violence to themselves both feel that they are wretched than the principle i speak of there is not a stronger in human nature you have felt its influence it has rendered you active vigorous and persevering placing in the mind itself such a guardian of our welfare is an instance of the goodness of god surprising is it to me that some should reduce all the principles of action to this one the love of god the love of christ the love of others are all distinct principles from the love of ourselves they are by no means discorddant the one secures our duty to god the other our duty to christ the third our duty to ourselves the fourth our duty one to another deficient in any of these principles there is a defect in the character when each is in exercise the glory of god and the happiness of our own nature are fully established the selfish seem to be the least honorable of all the principles of human action their operations not interfering with the operations of higher principles cannot be supposed displeasing to god nay he takes pleasure in our happiness and in every thing whereby it is promoted prudent steps for this purpose cannot be neglected without transgressing his positive command  our relation to our fellow men may easily be understood we spring from the same parent and travel the same road we are necessary to each other all orders are useful in their place the rich or poor the strong or weak the man of eminent or moderate abilities may advance the common welfare let us once be established in this truth and we will be inclined not only to respect even the meanest of our brethren but also be roused to perform our part in directing relieving and satisfying all with whom we have any connection if we look into the scripture we find that the friendly regard which mankind ought to show to each other and the friendly conduct in which they ought to abound are enjoined by the authority of god and obedience secured by prospects the most pleasant or terrifying as the injunction is observed or neglected the will of god cannot be performed whilst any of the relative duties are overlooked an exact attention to them is agreeable to god and in the satisfaction it gives carries its own reward  having now illustrated the import of doing the will of god in as far as our duty to god and christ ourselves and others are in question let us next endeavor to discover how such conduct disposes us to receive the doctrine of christ as divine  under one or the other of the following partculars may the leading doctrines of christ be arranged the depravity of our nature the efficacy of the gospel and the certainty of a future state of rewards and punishments let any man seriously and determinately set about performing the duties which he owes to god and christ himself and others and the doctrines i have mentioned will appear very evident he will no more be able to doubt of them than he can doubt of what he sees hears and feels  the depravity of human nature is strongly asserted its origin is traced its progress marked this truth is interwoven with all the institutions of the old testament and the doctrines of the new on this truth revelation rests shake this you shake the chief pillar and bring the whole superstructure to the ground the character which christ sustains as the prophet priest and king of his church suppose that we are sadly depraved if we be not depraved what the scripture says of the new birth is absolutely unintelligible of this as a fundamental doctrine you ought to be fully persuaded know the plagues of your own hearts see if they be not deceitful and desperately wicked but how are you most likely to gain satisfaction on this particular attempt doing the will of god in the extent i have shown to be necessary the attmpt will unfold the lamentable truth god you will find has the best claim upon your affection christ upon your trust it is matter of expediency and interest as well as duty that the body be kept under and the welfare of others be promoted convinced of this and determined to act upon the conviction you will find it no easy matter to put your determination in practice runnig well hindrances occur all that is commanded you are resolved to do but here you fail there you transgress after the greatest progress in religion there is reason to blush and to be confounded how is this to be accounted for otherwise than by that innate depravity spoken of in scripture we are not what god originally made us greatly are we corrupted the case is not singular what we experience is the experience of all who know themselves it astonishes the considerate to hear others speaking the very language of their own hearts the experience coincides face answers not more exactly to face in a glass than this a stronger internal proof of the truth of christianity cannot be received let a man know the plagues of his own heart let him be sensible of his perverseness then let the scriptures introduce the christian sighing groaning struggling  i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwells in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwells no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwells in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death can any hear this language without surprise is it not the very language of your own hearts is it not a proof that the book where such language is found proceeds from him who is well acquainted with the hearts and lives of the sons of men  the efficacy of the gospel meeting opposing overcoming the depravity of our nature is a doctrine of great importance it is plainly taught it has fully been experienced this efficacy the gospel exerts in three ways it convinces us of our ruined and perishing circumstancs it shows us the extent of our danger providing for our safety it strengthens us to improve this provision  in the conviction i speak of there is a secret though a powerful impulse new views open were a blind man on the brink of a precipice to receive his sight he could not be more alarmed the mind seems to exert her own powers the deductions are all natural easy and plain it is surprising that our ruined circumstances should for the first time strike us so sensibly explicable is this on the doctrine only of scripture the divine spirit is operating in this natural manner convincing us of sin dissolving the heart of stone and laying us in the dust at this moment all nature seems to avenge the creators quarrel against the guilty the disobedient adam is no more regaled with the verdure of paradise thorns and thistles are the spontaneous growth they are extirpated with labor water destroys a pofane world fire consumed the profligate sodomites the earth swallowed up the rebellious cora dathan abiram and their companions with pestilence and the sword the idolatrous and perverse jews are cut off particularly in the life and death of the son of god is it not very evident that the guilty cannot escape but there is an atonement for guilt there is a regenerating influence to create a new the soul in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god may the most irreligious and immoral be washed be sanctified and justified but how may we expect to experience this efficacy of the gospel by doing the will of god as my text directs attempt this persist in the attempt god requires such an expression of your faith and obedience the views i speak of shall open upon you the energy i speak of shall be felt the grace of the gospel shall refresh your souls the women of samaria i acknowledge when living in dissipation saul of tarsus when persecuting the church the jailor as philippi when oppressing the saints suddenly interrupted in their dangerous courses became acquainted with the power and grace of the gospel and are standing monuments of the divine mercy but this is unusual and it would be presumptuous to depend upon a similar interposition in the road of duty god usually meets with men inquire after this road enter upon it persevere therein you shall not seek god in vain you shall never find him a wilderness nor a land of darkness what a confirmation must this be to the gospel when you not only hear of its efficacy but also have experience thereof when it has became the wisdom of god and the power of god for your own salvation your own experience will sweetly accord with the experience of the apostle there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit  the gospel is particularly distinguished for bringing life and immortallity to light this is its peculiar honor were infidels to dictate in what manner this doctrine should be taught they would probably fix upon the very method which the gospel has taken a glorious personage was pleased to descend from the world of spirits he was visible on earth he appeared in human nature he was mortified to this world he kept the other world always in view certain of future rest and glory he labored he agonized he died in the separate state he became visible to his desciples he conversed frequently and in the most familiar manner with them five hundred at once were favored with his presence and conversation in the view of numbers after having given them the most abundant proof of his being alive he ascended up to heaven to receive the reigns of universal government his followers were so impressed with what they knew and felt that nothing could prevent them from serving their divine redeemer confident of being happy in his presence and blessed through eternity i cannot give you more certain directions for attaining to the same conviction which animated the disciples than the direction in my text do the will of god thus the film will fall from your eyes conversing with the father of your spirits you will become conscious of his existence your souls enlarging and discovering a noble ambition which no created thing can satisfy you will find that immortality coincides with your own feelings as well as with the assurances and proofs which christianity affords of nothing shall you be more certain the apostle paul speaks with great confidence he expresses the feelings of all christians if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead years confirmed the experience of younger life he goes off the stage with triumph i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing  i shall conclude with a short address first to unbelievers and then to those who are not yet fully established in the faith  infidelity is very prevalent amongst us this can easily be accounted for on the principles i have been attempting to establish iniquity greatly abounds unwilling to forsake their evil ways and dreading the denunciations of the gospel lest there be more truth in them than they could wish for the ease of their own minds men cavil at this character in scripture and at that institution this expression gives them offense and that doctrine one freedom is used with sacred things after another until they suppose that they have persuaded themselves and attempt to persuade others that all is a cheat a cunningly devised fable the fact is these cavils are founded either in ignorance or misrepresentation when examined they are unsubstantial they evaporate like smoke in the air surly dogs some times bark at the luminaries of heaven and they may bark for ever for their barking can neither tarnish these luminaries nor effect their existence your attempts o infidel are equally ineffectual christianity is founded on a rock nay the rock of ages if any be hearing me who incline to infidelity were the author of the age of reason himself present who not very modestly indeed nor very delicately has ventured publicly to cast abroad his poisonous arrows for the destruction if possible of these principles which have been the consolation of thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousands i would speak a word to this author i shall not upbraid you with the hard names you give the martyrs who have obtained general respect i shall not say a sentence of the undistinguished censure you pass upon the ministers of religion i ask you have you considered the proofs in favor of christianity from prophecy and miracles from the purity of its doctrines and the efficacy of its publication from the agreement between our own experience and the discoveries which it makes if these subjects be new to you and they appear to be so you speak of what you know nothing of and show a strange disposition to render others as unhappy as yourself depriving them of what is their staff and consolation you quarrel my friend with christianity the quarrel i suspect ought to be with yourself your heart perhaps and life is not right with god you tremble at the thought of a future world and would laugh it out of existence enter upon a new life seek a new nature the ground of your quarrel with christianity being now ended you would see with new eyes and confess that indeed it proceeds from god  i shall next address myself to those who are not yet fully established in the faith like a wave of the sea you are driven with the wind and tossed now one doctrine pleases you then another you halt between a variety of opinions at one time you bend to this denomination at another time to that the burden of your conversation and thoughts is the advantage derived from belonging to the party to which you attach yourselves and the errors and faults of all the rest let it be remembered that difference in opinion is unavoidable in the present state the politician the merchant the farmer the mechanic whilst they entertain different and peculiar opinions upon politics merchandise farming and mechanism live in very good neighborhood why may not religious persons who differ in opinion live in unity together as brethren i would not have you fond of disputing upon the peculiarities of this or the other church you may dispute for ever and gain no advantage these disputes supply the infidel with arms to the church to which choice or education or providence has attached you be steady but avoid ferments of all kinds these open the mouths of infidels and shake the steadfastness of the weak leaving others to their own master let it principally be your endeavor to have a conscience void of offense toward god and toward man be distinguished for your piety for your purity for your moderation whilst some use the scripture as a club to injure their neighbors do you use it as a staff for your own stay and consolation whilst many are zealous without knowledge be you zealous to excel all the world in love both to god and to man thus may the weak be established and the strong advanced were men to give more attention to their hearts and lives than to forms and words it would be both to their own comfort and to their honor of religion i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god  discourse x america warned delivered on wednesday   th october      being a fast day appointed by the synod of philidelphia  ezekiel xiv     0    if  send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it

the lord god how much more when  send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast   that god reigns is every where insisted upon in scripture with righteousness he judges the poor and reproves with equity he smites the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips he slays the wicked his government proceeds on steady principles he changes not of this my text gives us the fullest assurances  if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast though noah daniel and job were in it as i live says the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness for thus says the lord god how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast  discoursing from these words i shall through divine assistance first enquire what incurs the the judgments of god second examine the nature of those judgments specified in my text third show how certainly they fall upon a people when incurred and fourth mention the best security against them  what incurs the judgments of god is very evident certain characters are registered to condemnation what has befallen other sinners of equal notoriety may be considered as hanging over us the crimes exposed to the judgments spoken of in my text may be classed under three heads the irreligious the dissipated the oppressive are ever in the utmost danger  irreligion is the root of all crimes it consists in unworthy thoughts of god and unworthy behavior toward him adam did not believe that death would attend his disobedience if god threatens certainly he will not execute inconsiderate was his mind and ungrateful selfwilled and perverse too exactly is the same image received by his sons and transmitted through succeeding generations different circumstances may place it in different shades but the likeness is striking the heathens were so besotted and foolish as to change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and to fourfooted beasts and creeping things purity in heart and life was not so much thought of as exactness in some external rites and ceremonies the jews had advantages which were denied the heathen their dispositions however were often the same their prophets at times indeed had no reason to blame any neglect in the ritual proscribed by moses in this they were scrupolously precise it was however all parade they did not sanctify god in their hearts nor did they honor him in their lives there were times also when the ritual prescribed by moses was overlooked the homage due to the god of israel only was paid to idols the name the day the ordinances of god were profaned and despised it were well had this root of bitterness been extirpated after the introduction of christianity alas it has often sprung up to the detriment of mankind i need not give you a detail of irreligion as the disgrace of christian countries and christian societies in every age to the intelligent this is too well known let late years and this country bare witness of the sad truth the revolution which gave america her independence affected her religious principles the prejudices of former years were rejected what her ancestors accounted sacred she threw off as trifling perhaps pernicious reformation is commendable but men seldom keep the medium discovering errors on one side they hurry into errors on the other if the fathers have handed down human inventions as religion the children rejecting these inventions have rejected religion itself infidelity has deep root in this country it is of luxuriant growth the ignorance in which the youth are brought up with whom no pains is taken to form them to manly spiritual solid principles affords a dismal prospect by some religion is contemned by others something is substituted for religion which cannot bear the test the deriders of religion are very numerous they are countenanced by multitudes of profane swearers daring sabbath breakers of those who constantly neglect religious ordinances of a public or private nature and when some attention is paid to religion promoting a party quieting an uneasy mind the impulse of the moment suddenly felt suddenly removed is the foundation on which their religion rests it is a foundation of sand which the floods shall sweep away few experience the refined the heavenly the divine principles which christianity inspires founded on love to god and man on obedience to christ and conformity to his example irreligion assumes disguises suitable to the age and to the state of society it appears in this country with a bold countenance like a flood it has deluged the land men either keep god altogether out of view or believe him to be such a one as themselves but he will reprove them and set their sins in order before their eyes  the dissipated are a second class of people who draw down divine judgments upon a nation the antedeluvian world was sunk in dissipation and security nothing was thought of but pleasing the eye gratifying the taste and making a show in life they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all the lives men led in lots day were the same likewise also was it in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage buying selling building planting are necessary in their place the present life could not otherwise be maintained nor could we otherwise enjoy such comfort as this world is calculated to afford excess in things of themselves good may convert them into evil this is particularly true of the things now mentioned let them engross the whole attention let them be considered as our chief good let them be sought after with unsatiable desire let them so entirely intoxicate the soul as shall incapacitate us from attending to any other interest but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition in sodom were found pride fullness of bread and abundance of idleness neither did they strengthen the hands of the poor and the needy men thus prostitute to the world what god had reserved for himself they act in opposition to his will they are declared to be in a state of enmity from this crime america i am afraid cannot be vindicated since the revolution she has enjoyed uncommon prosperity the industrous find it easy to live in independent if not affluent circumstances what are the consequences are americans grateful to providence are they frugal are they charitable let an answer be given from a neighboring city the seat of government the center of trade the receptacle of wealth once celebrated for the purity of her manners and symplicity in her style of living what extravagance what luxury what folly what vice the disgrace of european countries has not gained a footing there and been suffered to tyrannize over arbitrary sway how is the gold become dim the most fine gold changed degeneracy of a pestilential nature has spread through the land americans scorning to lead frugal industrious temperate lives which at once would promote their honor and happiness have been infatuated by a speculating unbounded spirit ruinous to the soul and fatal to society shall i not visit for these things says the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this  the oppressive as well as the irreligious and dissipated are in the utmost danger among other crimes fatal to man in noahs day it is expressly said that the earth was filled with violence before the ruin in which jerusalem was involved by the roman army much oppression and violence were found in her take as an example of this an interesting incident in our saviors life to intimidate him from prosecuting his work the pharisees took an opportunity of addressing him the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures today and tomorrow and the third day i shall be perfected nevertheless i must walk today and tomorrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen does gather her brood under her wings and ye would not happy for americans that their liberties civil and religious are secured by the laws and an energetic government it is however to be lamented that oppressive conduct is not altogether unknown in some states it is not easy to recover a just debt in others slaves are treated with a rigor unbecoming in the treatment of the children of the same parent the purchase of the same blood the candidates for the same immortality government no doubt have good reasons for prosecuting the war on the frontiers would to god these reasons no longer existed war commonly includes blame on both sides the apostle james was sensible of this from whence come wars and fighting among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet have not because ye ask not the indians in hopes of plunder stain their hands in blood the frontier settlers may not perhaps have purer views nor be less guilty thus the guilt of a nation is increased thus national judgments are incurred i am naturally led  ii to examine the nature of these judgments specified in my text the sword is mentioned the first of the four judgments with which god corrects the nations god challenges it as his peculiar prerogative i make peace and create evil if i says god in the same chapter bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it the heathen raged says the psalmist speaking of wars the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the israelites were environed by hostile nations ready on all occasions to break in upon them to do them mischief it was enjoined by their religion that their men repair thrice a year to jerusalem was not this leaving their lands exposed was it not inviting the incursions of their enemies god himself removes this objection thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the lord god the god of israel for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shall go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year god governs by a restraining and a directing power he says to the sea thus far shall thou come and no farther even the wrath of man praises him and the remainder of wrath he restrains this interference is of so wonderful a nature that it is the subject of faith rather than of sense god may act through the instrumentality of good or evil angels of pious or wicked men when the sabeans and chaldeans excited by the evil one breaking in plundered job of all his substance did he curse their freebooters and give vent to his vexation in oaths and execrations no job was more devout he observed the hand of a father in this stroke the lord gave says he and the lord has taken away when shimei insulted david in his adversity and cursed him david restrained his servants from taking his life saying so let him curse because the lord has said unto him curse david politicians assign very plausable reasons for wars and their different progress infidels acquiesce in these and reject the interference of a divine government but devout persons consider wars as the rod with which god corrects the nations and brings about his own purposes by this rod our country is scourged americans are too apt to think despicably of the indians i know not what they are in themselves as instruments in the hand of providence there is no calamity which they may not bring upon this country i cannot help conceiving their power to be terrible they have stained in different battles the american arms one who had faced them in the field speaks of being exposed to the cruelties of a savage foe the most subtle and i will take upon me to say the most formidable of any people upon the face of gds earth we are not yet much affected by the wars in europe let us be thankful on this account god has endued our chief magistrate with prudence to avoid this calamity but let us repent least this also come upon us famine is the second of the four sore judgments which god sends upon a nation several famines are spoken of in scripture for these natural causes could be assigned if the nile for instance did not flow in egypt or the rains fall in judea at the proper seasons if catterpillers locusts or other insects abounding destroy the fruits and crops if such weather ocurs as occasions blasting and milldue is not the hand of god seen in these changes this he would have men be sensible of son of man when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously then will i stretch out mine have upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it  egypt in the days of joseph a land less subject to this calamity being more fertile than most others was visited with famine for seven years the same calamity fell upon judea and for the same space during ahabs reign famines are foretold as a presage of the destruction which of jerusalem americans may believe themselves safe from this calamity let them not boast it is in the store of the divine judgments he can call for it when he pleases to execute his vengeance the hessian fly which did such mischief some years past the blasting and milldew of which farmers complain last year may warn americans that their staff of bread is with god who may break it whenever their crimes provoke this calamity the prophet mentions the noisome beast as a third judgment with which god corrects the nations god promises israel i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite the cannanite and the hittite from before thee the hornet is bigger than the wasp and of the same species it is exceedingly fierce its sting occasions fevers it aims particularly against the eye joshua ascribes his victory over the amorites to these insects who darting against the enemy made them so blind that they could not see to fight and i sent the hornet before you which drove them out before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow god sent among the egyptians diverse sorts of flies which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them if the most contemptible creatures may be used for the punishment of a nation may not also the more formidable when the prophet cursed the profane children in the name of the lord as they went to bethel there came forth two shebears out of the wood and tore forty and two of them this happened by divine direction and was an immediate judgment from god it is expressly said in this chapter by god himself i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through for sake of the beasts inconsiderate people when incommoded by insects or otherwise think nothing of god the devout observe the hand of god in all that befalls them  the last judgment mentioned by the prophet whereby god punishes a guilty nation is the pestilence it is much easier to give a history of the pestilence than to investigate whence it proceeds and how it is communicated it is highly epidemical it may pass from land to land in goods or clothes this we may know with sufficient certainty that when god is pleased with a nation he takes sickness away from the midst of it when displeased he sends the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast a pestilence destroyed sennacheribs army wasted judea toward the conclusion of davids reign carried off the first born of egypt in all these cases the instrumentality of an angel is mentioned the psalmist speaks of the pestilence which walks in darkness evidently meaning that the causes of this disorder cannot be ascertained they elude the most diligent search in the same psalm the pestilence is compared to a fowlers snare its venom catches men as insensibly and suddenly as the snare does the bird when it is laid with much cunning during the peloponnesian war a dreadful plague carried off in one year an infinite number of the athenians the year in which it began was of all others the most healthy and free from diseases the athenians believed themselves punished for some acts of sacrilege of which they had been guilty thucydides acknowledges that he could not account for its introduction  one of cassiuss soldiers having found at babylon under ground a small golden coffer opening it such pestilential vapors arose as infected all who were present spread through the army desolated the provinces wherever they marched and was attended with great mortality to the remotest parts of the empire a plague raged in constantines reign with fury for three years in sicily greece the islands of the aegoean sea and constantinople that the living could scarcely bury the dead in the reign of micipsa of numidia a great part of africa was covered with locusts which destroyed the produce of the earth and even wood driven away by a strong wind into the african sea out of which being in vast heaps a plague arose which did unspeakable mischief it raged in the city of ittica in such a degree that   00 dead bodies were carried out of one gate in a year of the plauge which raged in london in the year      we have very circumstantial accounts it had been imported through holland from the levant it desolated the family in which it broke out it spread through the neighborhood appearances alarmed the city the bills of mortality in a week were between   0 and  00 though they increased in a short time to     a severe frost in january continuing several weeks the disorder abated and the apprehensions of the citizens ceased in may it broke out anew with increasing violence all who could left the city ferments arising from religious differences subsided the inns of court were shut up no contention about worldly interests all were at peace the people crowded the churches with uncommon ardor by the month of august a thousand died in a day in september   00 were dying one day with another people were almost driven to despair the contagion despised all medicine at this moment when hope was gone and the city nearly depopulated the disease instantly stopped the physicians were astonished all their patients were well the contagion no more appeared the most irreligious could not help acknowledging that this was the hand of god  our country has not been subject to this desolating calamity it has however fallen upon us the destroying angel has received the commission he has unsheathed his sword he spreads destruction our brethren in philadelphia deserve our sympathy multitudes have been cut off multitudes are in danger multitudes are alarmed their minds are much affected take for example a letter i lately received from my friend doctor rush i had informed him of our intentions this day many thanks says he to you for your proposed fast day for our distressed city the disease whose ravages you mean to deprecate still prevails never before did i witness such deep and universal distress continue fervently to pray for our citizens and for none oftener than your sincere friend such are the judgments with which god visits a guilty nation some times one is sent some times another some times the whole appear in dreadful array i come now  iii to show how certainly these judgments fall on a people when incurred there is a remarkable passage in the book of genesis god promised to abraham the possession of canaan and mentioned as a reason that the promise was not immediately performed the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full there were many pious people melchizedec for instance mamre eshcol and others who as salt preserved the land from degeneracy the land was not ripe for destruction there is a certain height in  at which when a nation arrives they can no longer be forborne then no intecessions on their bhalf can be of any av the decree is passed in the punishment there can be no delay no abatement the old world was so entirely abandoned that in noahs family alone could any goodness be found frequently no doubt did this pious patriarch bewail the state of mankind and pray for their reformation but the fatal moment arrived the destruction of mankind was inevitable abraham interceeds for the cities of the plain and his intercessions had prevailed for their deliverance had ten righteous persons been found amongst them the degeneracy was so deep so universal that even this number of that character could not be found among all the multitudes with which these cities abounded  when canaan was punished by the sword of joshua rahab was the only pious person in the whole country jerusalem was daringly wicked when the roman armies executed upon it the divine judgments a little before the day of judgment wickedness we have reason to think shall attain an atrocity unknown on earth before let the wickedness of a city a country an empire become universal and atrocious were the persons whose prayers availed much for their cotemporaries present interceeding for a people thus circumstanced it could not be effectual though noah daniel and job were there as i live says the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness nay let them not pray then the accepted time is escaped and the day of salvation with him they must be left who has said vengeance is mine i will repay  after examining what incurs the divine judgments the nature of those judgments specified in my text and the certainty of their falling upon a people when incured i am prepared in the  iv place to mention the best security of individuals against these judgments what crimes incur the divine judgments are the irreligious the dissipated the oppressive the troublers of the land do they provoke the lord to anger do they draw down vengeance on a people if you be of a different character if you sanctify the lord god in your hearts if you be mortified to the world if you do to others as you would that they should do to you in so far you discountenance the crimes for which god pleads against a nation and may expect either exemption from the judgments which are incurred or some advantage should these reach you the lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation the righteous shall save their souls alive a thousand may fall at their side ten thousand at their right hand but the destruction shall not come near unto them noah escapes from the destruction of the old world lot from the destruction of sodom rahab is not lost in jericho nor the christians in jerusalem god distinguishes between the righteous and the wicked i say not that the righteous are always safe in national calamities no  one event is common to them with the wicked but particular care is taken of them the fire which consumes the wicked refines the righteous if it be for their advantage they shall live if better things be intended them they shall be removed to regions of peace a father chastens the one a judge punishes the other we see a little way therefore cannot decide positively on what is doing in our world but we have reason to believe it shall be well with the righteous to them godliness is great gain if they be long continued on earth men shall be benefited by their example and prayers if they be taken to heaven they shall experience fullness of joy and pleasures for evermore  having finished the observations i intended for the illustration of this passage i shall conclude with an address to persons of different characters  it is very evident that national guilt draws down national calamities this guilt may arise not only from such public acts as are oppressive and such laws as are unjust but when the manners and lives of individuals are notoriously corrupted hereby national guilt is contracted and accumulated the idle and the dissipated the profane swearer and daring sabbathbreaker he who neglects religion and he who makes it the subject of his deision trouble society and expose it to divine vengeance upon you in some mease may be charged the blood which drenches the frontier settlements the pestilence which lays waste a neighboring city the mischief done during some years by the hessian fly during the last year by blasting and mildew societies smaller and larger are made up of individuals let each individual reform and reformation in the society be it ever so extensive will soon be apparent it may be objected had we any concern in the guilt we should feel the punishment we also should languish and bleed and die those whose blood pilate mingled with their sacrifices or those who were crushed under the tower of siloam were not as our savior assures more atrocious sinners than their brethren examples are necessary for the warning of others we may not be innocent although at present we may be safe if our guilt individually accumulates the national guilt justice to the sufferers as well as sympathy requires that each examine his own heart and life that he confess and forsake his sins that he fear god and keep his commandments public judgments are intended to bring men to the acknowledgment of a divine providence to the reverence and practice of a devout and religious life unless you do this you fail in a material instance in your duty to society and like achan in the camp of israel bring shame disappointment and ruin upon the nation society resembles the human body if one member suffers the whole suffers with it should we be so inattentive and perverse as to learn no wisdom from the distress in which our brethren at a distance are involved distress may approach near and fall upon our neighbors our families our own persons for gods sake my brethren for the sake of society for your own sakes let all sincerely and resolutely confess and forsake their sins that the prosperity of this country may not be blasted in the bud this is a favorite country it has enjoyed the smiles of heaven it is an asylum to the afflicted through the earth in proportion to our happiness is our ingratitude if we act unworthily of that happiness shall the ox know his owner and the ass his masters crib and americans not know god americans not acknowledge his providence waxing fat shall they kick forgetting the god that made them and lightly esteeming the work of their salvation to us indeed belong shame and confusion of face let the remembrance lay us in the dust and fill us with humliity and contrition of spirit  however far we may have gone astray there is every thing to encourage our penitence and reformation ezekiel beheld a mark set upon those who bewailed the guilt which drew down upon judea heavy judgments regard was paid to their persons and to their prayers had there been ten righteous persons in the cities of the plain they had not been destroyed for the elects sake the judgments which fell upon jerusalem were much mitigated in this respect the righteous are better than their neighbors they are the salt which preserves society from ruin let each seek god by fasting and prayer it may avail much both for effecting the reformation of america and suspending the judgments which hang over it some kinds of calamities as our savior assures us can be removed by prayer and fasting only esther found this very effectual for dissipating a dark cloud which threatened her nation the ninivites hereby prevented the destruction of their city when daniel besought god for the captives at babylon by fasting and prayer whilst he was yet speaking the command for their deliverance went forth from cyrus there is hope wherever a spirit of grace and supplication is found i am persuaded there are many in this land who fear god let them with one heart and one voice bewail the national guilt under which this country groans let them deprecate the judgments which are now amongst us let them discover a greater love for one another a greater attention to god as a spirit worshipping him in spirit and in truth let them herewith prove him whether he will not pour out upon them a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it whether he will not rebuke the devourer for their sakes all nations shall call america blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land says the lord of hosts  finis errata page line      theme read them    burmuda bermuda    0 the
