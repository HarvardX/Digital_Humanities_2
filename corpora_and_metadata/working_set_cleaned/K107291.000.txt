the grand question debated or an essay to prove that the soul of man is not neither can it be immortal  the whole founded on the arguments of lock newton pope burnet watts etc  by ontologos  slave to no sect who takes no private road but looks through nature up to natures god pope dublin printed for g wilson and sold by the booksellers of great britain and ireland mdccli  price one shilling and sixpence  introduction necessary to be read in this age of doubt and enquiry when any dissension from the sentiments of the rest of mankind is esteemed an instance of superior and refined qualifications it is highly probable that many of our fashionable philosophers will be strangely elated on the appearance of an essay of this kind and begin to triumph over those set of men who have confidence enough in any particular system as to think reason can afford no better or surer way to virtue and happiness  but however these people may value themselves for differing from the rest of the world had the author of this essay no other view than to show himself in this light he would have kept his sentiments ever to himself since that man must necessarily be a villain who endeavors to disturb the means of universal happiness by bringing in doubt or confuting any material point in that system on which that happiness depends  from a knowledge of this the virtuous philosophic heathens forbore to undeceive the world as to the veracity of their mythology for doubtless in those days of general ignorance if their moral precepts had been stripped of a religious reverence they would have been much less regarded as the difficulty would have been too great for the philosophers ever to have persuaded the rest of the world of the necessity and beauty of virtue  so if this age was as much involved in ignorance as theirs it would be the highest piece of injustice to separate morality from any one system of religion however false and absurd reason might make that system appear but while the world abounds as now it does with so many thousands who are resolved to think for themselves however little capacitated for such a task i think it a necessary piece of justice just to point the way the powers of reason naturally lead them lest from a ridiculous desire of being particular they run headlong on and instead of forming one rational scheme for their own satisfaction and happiness they use all their art to subvert the doctrines of revelation which can only disturb and perplex others without bringing the least advantage to themselves  on the other hand i think this essay may be useful to show that those who have engaged to support the cause of christianity by reason have taken very wrong steps as must evidently appear when their own arguments have reduced me to the necessity of concluding the soul cannot be immortal to support such a cause therefore with rational and philosophical arguments is the only way to give its enemies the advantage and if we think the scripture is the immediate word of god what need have we of reason to make us believe it but if we think it is not then reason must be our best and surest guide  it is however not at all material whether the author of this essay is directed in his own private sentiments by scripture or reason since all his arguments are here purely rational neither does he intend in the least to depreciate the cause of christianity well knowing that it is impossible that a sincere christian can be at all slaggerd in his faith by the strongest appearances of reason because the christian firmly believes that reason itself is a blind and insufficient guide to truth and though an argument should appear even to sensible demonstration he would nevertheless condemn it as a piece of sophistry and think there was some unseen unknown cause that might at once confute it all  reason therefore cannot affect or endanger the cause of christianity when founded on its only true basis the system of revelation but from hence appears the necessity that men should be altogether christians or philosophers left by endeavoring to join two such opposite systems they offend and entangle themselves in both and instead of knowing what virtue is by revelation or of seeing the necessity and beauty of it by philosophy they are hurried from one opinion to another and become nothing but disturbers of the world madmen fools and at last if possible mere atheists  it may perhaps be thought further that this essay may be detrimental to the cause of morality by destroying the fear of future punishments even among those who might be prevailed on to think and judge rationally  it is evident that religious precepts or the fear of future justiee will not restrain men from villainy else why are our necessary and indispensable laws  and i should be very sorry to think mankind were virtuous for no other cause than a view of a future reward for their actions or to think men had so mean an opinion of the wonderful and eternal god as to imagine he will give them everlasting happiness for paying him such a servile mercenary adoration which they would not pay but out of fear of punishment or in hopes of recompense  it may also be said that the expectation of future bliss whether just or no ought not to be taken away because it serves to comfort the virtuous under misfortunes inflicted on them by the vicious but is not a consciousness of innocence equal to this that which horace styles the brazen wall of the virtuous nil consire sii nulla pallescere culpa but certain it is that however appearances may deceive us whether virtue has a future reward or no it is a sufficient recompense to itself in this world  however whether it he thought so or not  the man that shuns the common received actions of vice only out of a dread of futurity and not from his natural goodness of heart will find means to be a villain though his passions should to that end be forced to varnish over the crime with the most sacred and religious color so though a man should see the necessity and beauty of virtue ever so clearly yet without goodness of heart he would find means to convert even his strongest plea of virtue into a reason for executing his favorite villainy and notwithstanding religious precepts may influence men to virtue equally as well as known philosophical truths yet if they have not a sufficient share of goodness of heart implanted in their nature they will be villains in spite of both religion or philosophy  and as that man is not a christian or good man who is only virtuous in expectation of future recompense so that man is not a philosopher or a good man who does not find it his interest and happiness to pursue virtue though he believes he never shall have a future reward for his actions  hence then it appears that no man has room to be proud of his virtue and that the more abandoned and vicious any man is the more he deserves our pity  the reader may now proceed to the treatise before him

philosophers that the soul of man is not neither can it be immortal sect i a definition of the soul as given by philosophers and a conclusion of its immortality drawn from it it is necessary before we form one objection to so general an opinion as the immortality of the soul that we should consider how far we agree as to its essential existence with those as the late dr watts was a man that expressed the united sentiments of the best philosophers in the most intelligent and perspicuous manner and was beside as strenuous a professor of the souls immortality as any man i hope i shall not be accused of unfair dealing for reasoning upon his definitions and arguments without introducing and reconciling the more abstruse assertions of those philosophers from whence he has drawn those definitions the truth of which their arguments however varied concur to maintain  who support this important doctrine  first then  we allow that the soul is an intellectual being not at all subject to the accidents and properties of matter in general such as solidity extension contraction expansion or any quality whereby it is rendered local as to that nice distinction made by some philosophers in saying that spirit has ubiety but not locality  or that it may be somewhere and yet be in no place i esteem it mighty ridiculous as having no real meaning at all in it  or in a capacity to take up the least or the most infinite space  ii that this intellectual being is acting on only a particular part of matter i e the body by certain inexplicable means as utterly unknown to us as the means how the planets act in their orbits by wonderful dependencies on their proper centers of gravitation all which we can attribute to nothing but the will of the great creator from whom they have received such necessary laws as are styled the laws of nature  iii that the soul is nothing but that power in man or rather acting on the body of man that enables him to perceive to reflect and to will  iv that the soul is a perpetual or constant power of thinking and that upon its ceasing to be active it must immediately cease to be  it is from these stated principles that a late philosopher who if we set aside his irrational attachment to some particular systems had of all mankind the greatest perspicuity and justness of reasoning draws these two corollaries   st that the soul is in its own nature immortal for nothing but the power which has given it this active life and being can destroy it it is entirely out of the reach of the material world to hurt it it cannot lay aside its own thinking it cannot put itself out of being nor can we conceive how any other spirit can make it cease to act i e cease to be such an active being as a spirit cannot be destroyed but by annihilation and surely god whose right and prerogative it is to create or give being to a creature has not put it into the power of any creature to annihilate his works or take away their being   dly that when the human body dies the soul exists and continues to think and act in a separate state and when it is freed from all the avocations of sensations of sensible things it will live more entirely in the reflection on its own operations and will commence a state of happiness or misery according to its own former conduct either rejoicing in the testimony of a good conscience or under inward anguish and bitter selfreproaches from the consciousness of its own guilt  perhaps this author from an earnest persuasion of the truth of his assertions drew these conclusions before his argument had gained sufficient ground for such weighty inferences for upon summing up the evidence of his reasons we find he is obliged to use his not being able to conceive how one spirit can be so prevalent as to annihilate another as a proof of the impossibility of it  hence we might conclude that our author could not conceive how god himself who is a spirit could annihilate the soul but if this is not his meaning as certainly we must infer it is not from what he says preceding that it is in the power of no other being to destroy it by which he must imply that it is in the power of god to destroy it  it is needless then to say surely god has not empowered any of his creatures to annihilate his works before we have sufficient reason to conclude that the creator himself will not put an end to them thus what does it argue in favor of the souls immortality to say no creature or power but god can annihilate the soul before we have proved that god himself will not destroy it on the dissolution of the body i e that he has not created the soul of such a nature that it cannot possibly exist without the necessary organs of the body here then is the point to be disputed on for as to the second corollary it is nothing more than a pretty rational consequence of the first and if the first is proved of no force that of itself must necessarily fall  but before we proceed immediately to examine the justness of the above inferences let us take a little notice of the universality of this opinion of the souls immortality because many have taken this as a presumptive proof of its veracity  sect ii the universality of the opinion of the souls immortality considered its foundation and insufficient consequence not only the christian of every sect the mohammedan and the persian believers but the unlettered indians have as it were naturally implanted this sentiment in their minds and the latter very rationally though so often laughed at and exploded a conceit believes also that his dog shall keep company with his master in the regions of immortality  let us examine then whether this is an innate idea explicitly wrought into the nature of the soul of man and born with us or whether it be an idea formed in the soul by its reflection on itself or if it be not an idea communicated to the soul in its communion or converse with souls of the same nature which converse it is plain our souls hold together when they acquaint each other with our thoughts by the means of sensation now if we could conclude it of the former nature there might seem some plausible reason for thinking it a presumptive proof of the souls immortality and esteeming it a sort of an evidence given us by our creator but we cannot conclude it such an innate idea because mr lock has manifestly disproved the possibility of there being any such innate ideas implanted in the soul but proves that all ideas must be formed by reflection or reason that is by the souls acting on itself now in this case it is absolutely impossible that the soul should be in a capacity of forming a just judgment on so abstruse a point at a time when it is almost incapable of forming any very rational ideas of things daily occurring to the senses for i imagine no body can tell how they first imbibed the notion of the souls immortality but if there be some who can they can easily ascertain whether it is an idea formed in the mind by reflection or whether it is not as i conclude it is an opinion communicated to the soul with its earliest notions of morality and therefore so deeply impressed in the tenderness of the mind when no act of reason was powerful enough to withstand the impression or to judge of the truth of such an impression that it requires all the efforts of reason afterward to eradicate it  as to mr wattss doctrine of innate ideas  i believe none will contend that the system of immortality is so consonant with the nature frame and make of the rational mind as that two and two make four  a part is less than the whole and other axioms according to which the rational mind of necessity must and will judge and therefore these says watts may be called innate ideas  the philosophical ancients it is true believed as much as the moderns a future existence of the soul of which socrates was a noble instance but their ideas seem plainly to have arisen from their abstracted notions of virtue and vice and the necessity they imagined of future rewards and punishments and though this circumstance makes strongly for the immortality of the soul yet there appears no proof of such a necessity since they themselves allowed that virtue was its own reward and vice its own punishment the one rendering mankind happy and the other occasioning them to be miserable even in this world but this we will consider presently  you will say then whence arose this idea at first even supposing it to have been communicated from father to son ever since the beginning if ever there was a beginning as in all probability there was of mans existence  it must then of necessity be either explicitly implanted in the soul or the effect of the souls acting on itself i e of reason or reflection  to this i say  it is probable that a man who had never heard of the souls being immortal might nevertheless be of that opinion yet this belief is occasioned more by the will influencing or as it were bribing the reason so to conclude than from the natural power of judging of truth which is essential to the soul for from the pleasure arising from our own ideas it is natural for the soul to will or desire never to be robbed of that pleasure which must cease in its nonexistence  but here you will say perhaps the reason is not subject to the will but the will to reason for you cannot perceive or think what you will  this is true  yet though the will is not the director of reason it can and plainly does impose false and specious propositions on the judgment in favor of its own cause and the conclusion formed by the judgment in consequence of these is called partiality for the power of reason in itself will from all propositions judge impartially  here comes the difficulty of persuading people to what they are unwilling to believe and the easy concurrence to the belief of any thing by people impartial and unbiasd and this the divines are sensible of when they say there is more hopes of converting a man of no religion at all than of a bigoted heretic  now that all or the greatest part of mankind seem to have the desire of immortality is plain and we may justly ask as cato is represented saying whence is this pleasing hope this fond desire this longing after immortality or whence this secret dread and inward horror of falling into naught why shrinks the soul back on herself and startles at destruction   from whence he infers it is the divinity that stirs within us it is heaven itself that points out an hereafter and intimates eternity to man   but this inference is not evident neither is our desire of a future existence any proof at all of it unless the case is fairly stated before those powers of reason whereby we naturally and infallibly judge of truth and they join to direct the will to maintain and support that doctrine for it is plain that the will when not acting from this innate knowledge of truth or the innate cause of virtue of which we shall speak hereafter directs us oftentimes to things stupid false and immoral hence it is evident that the most firm belief in man arising from his own reflections of a future existence is exactly the same with the belief of a man in the following case  suppose a man had a friend whom he loved as himself and it should be told him by one whose word equally might or might not be depended on that a most uncommon misfortune had happened to this friend  now his being unwilling that such a thing should be would immediately awake all the reasons or causes he could think of to encourage him to conclude that it really was not and if upon examining all that should occur he finds no justice to think the probability or the possibility of such a misfortune will he not believe is friend is safe  undoubtedly he will  but is this belief a proof that he is so  certainly no for after all there may be a cause which through the perplexity of his hopes and fears never appeared in a just light to his reason or perhaps was never suggested or perhaps a cause that he did not know existed in nature which may have occasioned such a misfortune and which cause when he comes to be sensible of he will no longer doubt of the truth of such an effect and of his friends misfortune  so though a man out of a desire of being immortal may think he has ever so many reasons to believe it yet if afterward he becomes sensible of a cause why it cannot be so that power of reason whereby he judges of truth will infallibly convince him of it and the only cause that makes a man remain not convinced by a just argument is that he either wants capacity or penetration to understand the justice of its propositions for it is plain if a man sees and knows two and two are added together that he must conclude the sum is four  but to apply the foregoing supposition to the effects of the prejudice of education suppose a man in those circumstances was told of a misfortune befalling his friend by a thousand witnesses whose veracity in other respects he had reason to depend on or even though some of them were the greatest liars yet they being all in the same story would he form one doubt of the truth of it even though he saw no reason to believe it  certainly no or if he did his belief and his doubts would be of the same kind exactly as that which a man entertains concerning the immortality of the soul that has been told of it a thousand times by a thousand people and has never impartially examined the probability or possibility of the truth of such a belief  here then is i think clearly demonstrated the source of the opinion concerning the soul of man being immortal and it is plain from it that we may justly assert that the universality of that belief is not the least proof of the truth of it  now we will consider then first the validity of the proofs brought by the abovequoted philosopher of the doctrine in dispute and then examine the reasons that may be given to think such an immortality necessary and then proceed to give other reasons for thinking there is no such a necessity and for our believing the soul incapable of existing after the decease of the body  sect iii proofs of the immortality of the soul examined first then the soul is immortal says our philosopher because nothing but the power which has given it this active life and being can destroy it  this reason granting it true has no weight at all relating to the assertion unless it had been before proved that the author of the souls being would not destroy it which is the most material point in question and this is what this philosopher has omitted to mention as if the divine volition or will was less necessary or less doubtful in this case than that power which is only the consequence of that volition but as this suggestion would have quite disconcerted his hypothesis he has summed up the cause without it   dly it is entirely out of the reach of the material world to hurt it  if our author here means that the soul as a power not at all subject to matters properties as at first allowed cannot be affected by matter in itself considered as a substance that has no power at all his assertion is as ridiculous and as childish as twould be to say if any thing is out of our reach we cannot reach it but if he means as he certainly does that the soul considered as a power and an existent being in itself cannot be affected by that power which acts upon all matter in general in some degree or other and is called the law of nature i must enter a little into the truth of his assertion  if we consider the soul abstracted from the body as having nothing at all to do with matter we may then say neither matter or the powers acting upon matter in general can affect it but if we consider the soul acting in conjunction with the body it may and will be affected by the power acting upon matter in general by means peculiar to that part of matter or body to which it is united that is on which it acts as if a stone should fall on my head the power acting on the stone would by means of the organs of sensation affect my soul  the same in cases of diseases broken limbs and the like the soul is affected with extreme pain which without the soul would not be felt and this pain must proceed from some cause to which matter in general is subjected as no man has a pain peculiar to himself but it is possible a man of the same construction may be liable to it as well as he it is true indeed he becomes sensible of this power acting upon matter in general by the means of sensation identically particular to himself for one man does not feel the pain of another as each is affected with his own  now there are instances of the rational faculties being impaired and rendered useless to the necessary offices of life from the diseases of the body as in cases of lunacy at which time the sensative faculties or the powers of sensation which are more immediately acting on the body seem much less affected than the reason or the souls power of acting upon itself since a lunatic that cannot remember reflect or judge is often very sensible that he sees hears and feels  now if the soul is so liable to be affected even in that part in which it is said its immortality consists viz that of acting upon itself by the slighter accidents of the body surely when the body receives the shock of death when the blood ceases to flow the eyes to see the ears to hear and all the whole body to move certainly the soul must be so affected as to cease altogether to be  we see a man wounded and maimed so that he cannot support himself yet may so recover as to be as useful and agreeable to himself and others as before  we see a lunatic oftentimes entirely incapable of reasoning yet may be so restored as to reflect and judge as nicely and justly as ever  again a man may be so wounded or by diseases rendered incapable of putting his limbs to their former use but must be forced to support an insufficient body till it drops into the grave the soul of a lunatic may be so affected that it shall support the insufficiency of reason till it shall we not say till it ceases to act at all consequently ceases to be  for if it is allowed that those powers of the soul which are called the powers of sensation immediately become inactive when the body dies according to the second corollary the soul in a separate state is freed from all the avocations of sensations and sensible things etc and if it is evident as i have proved it is that the power of the souls acting on itself is full as subject to be affected by accidents peculiar to matter as the power of sensation is have we the least shadow of reason to infer that the powers of reflection can exist without the assistance of the body any more than the powers of sensation i think not  but you will say perhaps this is no demonstrative proof well though it be not and we should allow in favor of this article that it is out of the power of the whole material world or the power acting upon all matter to hurt the soul considered separate from the body yet we must first know that it can exist in this separation before we allow this a reason for its immortality in other words  we must know the souls immortality from some other cause for this is an argument of no moment at all   dly it cannot lay aside its own thinking it cannot put itself out of being  it is possible for a man to take a pistol and shoot out his brains by which action he at once annihilates the powers of sensation no inconsiderable essence of the soul but whether the soul is altogether rendered inactive by death or no this assertion of the impossibility of the soul being able to destroy itself is no reason to conclude its immortality unless you will say that a mans being unable to walk is a proof he never shall depart from the spot he is in before you have proved the impossibility of his being carried   thly we cannot conceive how any other spirit can make the soul cease to act i e cease to be  this is the least of a reason that can possibly be given for if our not conceiving how any thing could be is a reason why it is not or cannot be we have the same reason to conclude that the soul and body do not act in conjunction because we cannot conceive by what means though we have daily such evident demonstrations of the veracity of such mutual acting  these then are the great proofs of our philosopher deduced from the best and most rational arguments of his own and of others in favor of the immortality of the soul  we will now examine the reasons that may be given to think such an immortality necessary  sect iv reasons to think the immortality of the soul necessary  st it may be thought necessary to the honor and wisdom of our great creator that a soul possessed of rational faculties in so high a degree and capable of such extraordinary seize should be continued longer in being than the short space of time allotted for the life of the body  as to this we are incapable of forming any true judgment of those high noble and extraordinary seize we may imagine the soul possessed of for nothing is high great or noble but by comparison and as we are so ignorant of the essential greatness of the deity we cannot form any just idea of what consequence we are of in respect to its wonderful and incomprehensible nature  it is therefore highly probable that we entertain a much greater opinion of our beings than is strictly consonant to the nature of things and the extensiveness of god  this supposition then argues nothing of a necessity for the immortality of the soul   dly it may be thought necessary from the seeming necessity of future rewards and punishments  this has for many ages been esteemed by the rationalists of almost all persuasions as a sufficient reason to expect if not an absolute proof of a future state  we will therefore consider it very impartially  this principle can have no other solid foundation than the abstracted notions of virtue and vice for if our actions were neither good or evil where is the necessity of rewards or punishments we must then first consider what is virtue and what its opposite vice  sect v virtue and vice their foundation and essence examined there has been nothing in all the systems of philosophers so much contested as this  what are virtue and vice  the man of faith will tell me that it is plainly revealed in the word of god the only true standard of wrong and right  now i think it absurd to imagine that the great creator permitted mankind to act for so many hundred years as according to chronological account were elapsed before the bible was wrote without a just standard for their actions but be that as it will  i allow that the system of morality to be found in the sacred writings abstracted from that heap of absurdities wherewith it is inculcated is a system as truly perfect just and noble as is to be met with in any writings whatever yet shall we not think this rather the system of the philosophic heathens improved than a new one immediately revealed to us from our creator  what are more noble and just according to our notions of justice than the sentiments delivered under that allegorical heap of absurdities in the heathen theology and it is evident these sentiments were as capable of influencing moral practices for where have we had one instance of a christian being a better man than socrates  shall we not think then that these two systems of morality spring from the same source in the rational mind and shall we not cast aside the heap of absurdities taught us by revelation as socrates plato and other philosophers of those days did those of the ancient mythology which nevertheless were as much and as literally believed by those who were incapable of thinking then as the scriptures by the generality of christians are now  it is possible the man of faith may see no manner of reason in all this i shall therefore leave him to the vanity of his own imagination and confine my discourse to the man of reason who is the only just disputant  we will examine then first what vice and virtue appear to be and then proceed to consider their cause or foundation  as to the former it will be needless for me to enter into the subject in my own words when it is already so justly expressed and so clearly demonstrated by the truly ingenious mr brown who in his second essay on the characteristics after having fully proved the imperfection of the definitions of virtue laid down by clarke wollaston and lord shaftesbury asserts  that happiness is the last criterion or test to which the moral beauty truth or rectitude of our affections is to be referred which he thus demonstrates by two circumstances    those very affections and actions which in the ordinary course of things are approved of as virtues do change their nature and become vicious in the strictest sense when they contradict this fundamental law of the greatest public happiness  thus although in general it is a parents duty to prefer a childs welfare to that of another person yet if this natural and just affection gain such strength as to tempt the parent to violate the public for his childs particular welfare what was before a duty by this becomes immoderate and criminal    actions which are in their own nature most shocking to every humane affection lose at once their moral deformity when they become subservient to the general welfare and assume both the name and nature of virtue for what is more contrary to every gentle and kind affection of the human breast than to take away the life of a man yet when the necessity of public example compels us to make a sacrifice of this kind though we may lament the occasion we cannot condemn the fact so far are we from branding it as murder that we approve it as justice and always defend it on this great principle alone that it was necessary for the public good  hence therefore we may obtain a just and adequate definition of virtue which is no other than the conformity of our affections with the public good or the voluntary production of the greatest happiness whoever will read this authors whole essay will see with what justness he proceeds to this definition of virtue  we will go on now to consider the foundation or source of virtue in the rational mind  dr watts allows that the foundation of moral virtue is naturally implanted in the soul of man and that this foundation is the innate knowledge of truth which is essential to the soul for hence it is says he that the soul rationally judges of right and wrong of fitness and unfitness  that two and two make four  that when a globe is fitted into an exact round case there is a fitness of those things to each other and then proceeds to say that thus the soul rationally concludes contracts are rather to be kept than broken now supposing that by the same rule that two and two make four we should see that contracts are rather to be kept than broken yet if the desire of promoting happiness as has been proved is virtue and happiness the effect of it we should in this case often find that keeping some sort of contracts rashly and inconsiderately made would render miserable all the parties engaged in it and be not at all instrumental to the public good and therefore breaking such a contract would be a means of happiness and as every means to mutual happiness is virtue even acting according to truth would then be vice  we see then here is an evident proof of the falsity of dr watts adjudging the foundation of virtue to the innate knowledge of truth as well as of mr wollastons definition of virtue who affirms that no act whether word or deed of any being to whom moral good and evil are imputable that interferes with any true proposition or denies any thing to be as it is can be right that on the contrary every act is right which does not contradict truth but treats every thing as being what it is  but i refer the reader to mr brown to see a beautiful and fair confutation of that definition and conclude that however essential the knowledge of truth is to the soul it is that faculty of the soul which watts calls pathetic instinct and disposition toward goodness and what i term goodness of heart and not the knowledge of truth that is the cause of moral virtue and of this as watts observes there are some few instances in most persons which appear chiefly in the working of benevolence and compassion in us toward sensible creatures inward aversions to cruelty and perhaps says he a natural reverence to that almighty power whom we call god when we come to know him  neither is it any ways more accountable how more or less of this disposition is implanted in each individual of mankind than it is by what means one man has more or less the capacity of reasoning genius or elevated ideas than another  now if from this source arises moral virtue every man will be naturally more or less virtuous as he has more or less goodness of heart naturally implanted in him and though some men who may perhaps have but little of this innate principle may do actions tending to the happiness of their fellow creatures either from the influence of moral precepts imagining thereby to acquire the favor of their creator or out of fear of what they are told are the consequences of vice and though others entirely disregarding every sentiment of this kind and deaf to whatever little they have of this natural goodness go on to the greatest lengths in actions that render the world miserable yet this does not at all hinder us from rationally fixing here the foundation of virtue  and if acting from this innate principle of goodness or desire of promting universal happiness be virtue acting from the immediate want of it must necessarily be vice  now where is the justice or necessity that men should be punished or rewarded for acting from principles which they neither gave themselves nor can possibly divest themselves of  for if the soul can divest itself of this instinct or faculty why cannot it divest itself of all its other faculties and so annihilate itself  dr watts allows that the soul cannot think otherwise than that two and two make four  a part is less than the whole and such like  now is this innate idea the knowledge of truth of more consequence or less easy for the soul to divest itself of than that great spring from which our happiness evidently derives i think it should not be thought so  for it appears that this knowledge of truth does not immediately occasion us to do good or ill but acts subservient to our desire of promoting happiness by forming propositions of the fitness and unfitness of things whereby the soul becomes sensible when to exert that instinct it is possessed of in favor of virtue so that we see this innate knowledge of truth is a secondary and not the primary cause of moral virtue only assisting the natural disposition to goodness in its offices  but here it may be objected  that the soul may be divested of this faculty or disposition for there are many men who have been possessed of a great share of it who by becoming familiar to inhuman sights and deeds of cruelty have lost a great deal of this disposition as is evident in surgeons butchers and the like so that those who at first might be almost ready to swoon at the amputation of a limb or at the death of a sheep shall after some time think no more of the cruelty of their profession than those whose concerns are with inanimate things  now however plausible this objection may seem it is nevertheless false for they have not a jot less of this natural disposition in them than before they ever practiced those professions and it is only that innate knowledge of truth whereby they judge of the fitness and unfitness of things that is vitiated or misled by a practice the necessity of which imposes specious propositions on the mind from which their reason concludes that this instinct or innate goodness of heart need not be exerted on such occasions and thus from being accustomed to the sights and actions of cruelty without feeling an uneasy sensation the distresses and sufferings of humanity do not awake this natural disposition in them as they did before  and yet suppose you tell a compassionate man that is a surgeon of the distresses of a poor creature who is starving in prison this will affect him fifty times more than your telling him of a man that is expiring with both his thighs broke while the keeper of a prison perhaps would be less affected to see the condition of a man expiring beneath all the complicated miseries of want and confinement than at the sight of a fractured skull or a broken arm  but the reason why we find among those people who are daily familiar to scenes of misery so little appearances of this instinct to goodness is perhaps from their being naturally more void of it than others which may be supposed one great reason why they should choose or endure to be of such professions  in the same manner many people run into vice by becoming familiar to actions which at first a seeming necessity for imposes upon the reason to conclude in some measure justifiable as a man that is starving might possibly prevail on his reason to conclude that his condition alleviates the crime of his robbing on the highway and he may silence his natural disposition to pity or goodness of heart from the specious supposition that the loosers may not be in a condition to want and therefore misery may not be the consequence of such an action and thus he goes on from one step to another till this natural instinct is not apprehensive when to exert itself  it was from a knowledge of the truth of this that mr pope says vice is a monster of so frightful mein that to be hated needs but to be seen but seen too often familiar with her face we first endure then pity then embrace thus it is that a man who naturally has a great share of this goodness of heart may be brought from one action to another to commit the most horrid of all vices murder but how often do we see that however powerful have been the motives that have induced them to such an action yet this instinct awaking in them has so strongly resisted and made such a terrible conflict in the soul that some have stood without being able to exert an act of volition to move their hands to commit the fact  others have begun and have been unable to perform the murder effectually and very few but that the moment the fact has been perpetrated have had no manner of thought of the motives that led them to it but have been struck with inexpressible horror which has been the effect of that goodness of heart implanted in the soul  and it is plain that the desire of gratifying our appetites and inclinations which imposes itself on the reason as a rational necessity is the cause why the powers of judging of moral fitness and unfitness draw false conclusions from which the will influences the body to commit acts of vice for a man that has naturally a greater share of anger and pride than a love of gain will sooner kill or offend another out of resentment than out of a prospect of interest while the man whose soul is more strongly influenced by avarice an inclination naturally implanted in the soul than by any other passion will sooner kill or offend a man out of a prospect of gain than out of resentment  thus it is evident that the passions to which the soul acting in conjunction with the body is subject do by imposing on the reason make it direct the will to influence us to actions of vice for as has been before observed the will is a power directed by the reason as it appears in the most abandoned cases  for when do we see a man attempt to stab or cut the throat of another with a straw never  unless he be a madman or an idiot and then we think there is no justice in punishing him for his actions  it is plain then by the rational means taken to perpetrate scenes of villainy that reason is in action at that time whence is it then that any vice is acted unless the power of judging of moral fitness or unfitness is not vitiated and abused and this power it is plain is more or less influenced according to that goodness of heart found in some degree perhaps in every man  but if there be a man who without hesitation from no cause either of resentment or interest can go and stab another and feel no remorse at what he has done that man is either a madman or an idiot entirely incapable of reason at all or else he is a man that has not nor ever had any goodness of heart in his nature  hence it appears that though natural instinct or disposition to goodness is the source of moral virtue yet it is directed to virtuous actions by the reason and that it may be influenced to remain seemingly inactive by those conclusions which reason naturally draws from specious and deluding propositions offered to it by the will or the desire of gratifying our inclinations so that either the want of this natural instinct or the vitiated power of reason which men have in proportion to their knowledge may occasion men to fall into vice and it is plain that a man that has a greater share of this instinct joined to his reason or a greater share of reason joined to this instinct will support the same misfortunes much longer without endeavoring to relieve himself by actions of vice than that man who has less of both  and it is plain that men who deservedly bear the character of the strictest virtue might in the same situation have been no more able either by goodness of heart or reason to resist the desire of gratifying their passions than those that have been remarkable for the most glaring actions of vice  for there is no man can be certain what he should or should not have done if under circumstances which he never experienced  and now it is plain also that men cannot give or take away from the soul the powers of reason or instinct and it is as entirely owing to the cause of the universal power or the law of nature that one man is inbenevolent as that another is dull  and as i hold it entirely commendable that the law should punish or execute a man who shows he either wants justness of reason or goodness of heart to direct his actions so i hold it as just that an idiot or a madman should equally be punished or executed as they are found to want these also  so that while there remains the least reason to hope a madman may recover his reason to influence his goodness of heart whereby he may be of service to community i would have him only confined to measures necessary to restore him so i would for the safety of mankind have all men who are found to want either of these whether from the greater want of reason as in idiots or the greater want of goodness of heart as in villains of which some are greater fools and others greater knaves only confined to measures necessary to restore them if possible to be of service to mankind but if they are found to be from more flagrant and repeated actions of vice incapable of such a restoration i would have them legally i say legally for there is no man that can be supposed to do justice for himself since those injuries that appear to a man when committed against his own person appear wonderfully heinous to the same injuries committed against others  it behooves therefore that all vices should be inspected and punished by those who are entirely disinterested hence it will follow that no villain ought to be a magistrate as he is interested in the cause of vice and that no one man should have that arbitrary power of doing either himself or others justice put to death and commend it as a virtuous action necessary to the public good whether they be madmen fools or villains  but though here appears justice in this action it is because vice and virtue are actions that affect only mankind but it would be stupid to imagine the original cause of all things or god would eternally punish the souls of men for not acting otherwise than they were influenced to do from powers which he is the cause of and it is just as stupid to think it injustice in the creator to leave unrewarded a man for doing what the frame make and nature of his soul obliges him to do  there appears then no necessity for future rewards and punishments from the abstracted notions of virtue and vice  sect vi certain reasons for the necessity of future rewards and punishments examined there may appear perhaps a necessity of future rewards and punishments from the sickness anguish and persecution of the virtuous in their life time while many of the wicked seem to be entirely free from these inconveniences  as to this it is impossible for us to trace how much trouble or misery one single vicious action of our lives may by a thousand unseen and unaccountable accidents inflict on the world so if misery is the consequence of vice as has been proved it is impossible to tell what man occasions most misery since one single act of vice committed on some particular occasions by one man may occasion a thousand times more misery in the world than the same act a thousand times repeated by another and in other circumstances  now in the strictest notions of justice no man should bear more misery than he has been the occasion of to others but should bear his share in proportion to that for if a man is only to bear so much misery as he intends to inflict by a vicious act perhaps he did not intend to be the occasion of a thousandth part of that which may happen by that act  who then must suffer for occasioning that misery  perhaps you will say that man who intended so much unhappiness by doing an act by which it may so happen from the nature of things none at all shall be effected  but i believe experience sufficiently convinces us that very few if any of mankind intend the misery which is the consequence of vice but that if that consequence appeared to them in a just light perhaps the worst of men would tremble with horror at the thought of committing such an act  yet though we suppose that men should in strict justice be answerable for all the misery their actions may be the occasion of each must be answerable as an individual for one man cannot be supposed to support the miseries of a thousand people put together though one single act of his may offend so many  he must therefore pay in proportion to himself as a single being what he owes to mankind and if so who knows how much of this debt the pains and difficulties daily attendant on the human body and mind do hourly discharge or who can tell how much committed misery is atoned for by a terrifying dream or a raging fit of the gout or the toothache add to this the pleasure and pain always in some degree concomitant to the actions of vice and virtue  hence then why may we not infer that the supreme being does actually dispense justice to all the human race though by means inexplicable to us in this world and that the balance of happiness and misery is adjusted at the death of every man  but you may call this abstruse or perhaps idle reasoning yet we may by looking round to the sensible creatures about us and by making some just comparisons acquire a better idea of ourselves and the insufficiency of this reason to expect a future state of rewards and punishments  in whatsoever degree we are pleased to consider ourselves above the brute creation no body will deny but that the great creator acts with impartial justice toward every one even the most minute and insignificant of his creatures why is it then a horse a dog or cat shall be nourished and fed with all the necessaries of life while others of their species shall be subject to continual hard labor to whipping or being worried to death  can we suppose this or that horse dog or cat has deserved more or less from the hands of its creator than another if not certainly there must be according to our notions of justice with respect to ourselves a state in which the sufferers shall be recompensed for the pains and fatigues of life  but this seems to argue the immortality of brutes which we shall not now consider or that by means utterly unknown to us the creator dispenses justice to these creatures in their life time and if to them why is it not probable that by some such like means he may act with us  this however shows how imperfect are our notions of what we call divine justice and how little from them is our reason to expect a future state of rewards and punishments when we cannot tell whether we have justice done us in this world or no  having now considered the proofs of the philosophers in favor of the souls immortality and the reasons that might induce us to think such an immortality necessary and as we find in their pretended proofs no evident demonstration of any such doctrine and as from the seeming reasons of its necessity we can draw no rational conclusions to expect it we will now proceed to examine the reasons that induce us to think the soul cannot be immortal  to this end we will consider our relation to sensible creatures whose souls are esteemed by philosophers at best but souls of another and an inferior nature and which they dont scruple to pronounce have no title to immortality  sect vii our relation to the brute creation considered it is the inference of similar and equal causes from similar and equal effects that leads us to the most just and rational knowledge and which as watts observes constitutes a great part of the science of mankind  who doubts nay is it not commonly laid down as the most evident of all truths that we shall all die  but whence do we draw this truth  why from reason  from this manner of comparison we daily see that creatures of similar form organs and faculties to ourselves are subject to death and meet with none whose length of years are so far beyond the common account of our lives as to give us the least room to think them exempt from it because we find their growing up their maturity and decay exactly resemble those that went before them  we see also this same decay and death happen to every animal in the brute creation and though we should meet with a creature of so extraordinary a kind as to have lived for two or three centuries and to have been transmitted from father to son we should admire it as an animal of excessive long life but should not in the least doubt but that it would die some time or other though we never saw or heard of any such a ones dying in our lives  now this accident as well as many others mankind have in common with the brutes  we cannot live without sustenance any more than they  are as liable in our nature to hurts pains and diseases as they are and if it should be proved we are possessed of the same kind of a soul however superior though it may perhaps be shown in some cases to be essentially equal is it not as indisputable a truth that our souls must cease to exist like theirs or if we suppose ourselves immortal that their immortality must be similar to ours  i hope no one will too rashly think this manner of reasoning a disparagement to the dignity of human nature before he has well considered the dignity and wisdom of an horse a fox and an elephant  let us then now examine how nearly we are allied to the animal creation  and first as to the body  philosophers agree that all matter is essentially the same and differs only in its modification but that the different modification of matter gives it no superior or inferior degree of merit in itself considered  for whether the clay be converted into the most pompous and superb figure with respect to us it is exactly the same clay considered in itself as that which is converted to the meanest and vilest uses  but should we bring the most plausible reasons from experience or philosophy to prove the bodies either of men or brutes superior we must give the cause entirely against ourselves experience tells us that the human body divested of the soul is to us more nauseous and detestable than that of most brutes and if from philosophy we should agree that beasts have no thought or liberty at all but are only pieces of finely organized matter capable of many subtle motions communicated to them by outward objects we by this yield them the superiority since we own the matter of our bodies is not capable of such sensation but that our sensation is the faculty of the soul we find also that by a successive revolution of particles of matter that same matter which is at one time grass becomes part of a beast and from thence to be part of a man by means of the sustenance of life  neither does the form of man give him any preeminence in the order of beings as it is no more serviceable to him in the offices of his life than are the forms of the brutes to them and though we distinguish a man from a brute rather by his outward form than by the dignity of his soul of which we cannot so immediately judge yet it is possible there are nay there have been many instances of creatures more resembling in their form the human than the brute species such as the chimpanzee and which for want of understanding speech and talking have yet been esteemed brutes  on the other hand i never heard any body presume to say that a wild boy i remember to have seen was not of the human species though he could not speak nor understand speech any otherwise than a dog might do and was beside all over hairy like a dog or a monkey though his features were almost as regular as i ever saw those of a man  it is plain then from such instances as these that it is possible by an intermixing of species that there are creatures in the world whose form and intellects are so joined that no body can pretend to determine justly whether they are men or brutes  now if this be as certainly it is the case there is no other true distinction in the order of beings than by that power which is their life  that which directs them to seek happiness or shun misery to wit the soul  we will now then consider what is the soul of a brute and how far it resembles the soul of man  sect viii the souls of brutes what philosophers agree they are if mr lockes supposition be true if spirit be only a property of matter it must of necessity cease to be when that matter has evidently no particular property at all but if we esteem the soul mortal it matters not at all whether we judge it a property of matter or a being in itself that spirit may be only a property of matter and that it is possible for the creator to join such an influence to matter as to make it capable of all we see it act the same system is as justly applicable to the man as the brute and that man has a soul considered not as a property of matter but as a being in itself was at first agreed on  we must conclude then that the acting principle in the brute is of the same kind with that of man and if of the same kind what possible degree of inferiority suppose the lowest can affect any being so much as to make it mortal while another being acting in in the same manner is immortal  take the most ignorant and stupid of all the human species and compare his intellectual faculty or soul to that of a lock a newton or a boil  what a wonderful difference how weak how insignificant how mean are the ideas on one side how strong how copious and how elevated on the other and yet we dont scruple in the least to allow the one a soul as immortal as the other  is it because they resemble each other in their outward form that we do this if so how excessively how poorly ridiculous do we judge of the order of beings  now since from such an inferiority in the faculties of the soul we draw no inference of the want of immortality we shall certainly find by comparing the actuating power of some brutes with that of some men that there being not so much difference between brutes and men as there is between men and men that we have no ground to suppose one more immortal than the other  but to confirm the justice of such a manner of reasoning we will quote a passage from the learned bishop burnet wherein he advances more than could from him be expected in favor of the brute creation  this writer after supposing that human nature can hardly receive or bear the notion of beasts having no sensation or thought at all about them because there are such evident indications of even high degrees of reason among the beasts he therefore concludes that it is more reasonable to imagine there may be spirits of a lower order in brutes that have in them a capacity of thinking and choosing but that it is so entirely under the impressions of matter that they are not capable of that largeness either of thought or liberty that is necessary to make them capable of good or evil of rewards or punishments but that therefore they may be perpetually rolling about from one body to another that is by transmigration  dr watts having quoted this passage states the case on both sides the question and for want of one single argument to proceed further without injuring that system to the promotion of which however absurdly he wanted to reduce all his philosophical arguments very fairly gives it up and says he can make nothing at all of it and yet after this confession he goes on to tell you no conclusions can be drawn from the nature of beasts let the case be decided how it will that can affect the nature reason or religion of mankind  this however you are to take upon the credit of his word only and are to believe the immortality of the soul from the necessity of future rewards and punishments which he says it is the glory and interest of the supreme ruler of the universe to appoint for though he so frankly owns he knows so little of the essential dignity of a brute yet he does not at all scruple to decide what is the glory and interest of a god whose essential perfections it is impossible after all our searches to know any thing at all about  as to the bishops conclusion that the soul of a brute must be more subject to matter than that of a man it is merely a conjecture the force of which will appear when we come to consider the actions of brutes in comparison with those of men  yet to infer that supposing it proved because they are incapable of rewards and punishments they must be transmigrated from one body to another is excessively stupid for the distribution of rewards and punishments seems more applicable to this system than any other  as that soul that suffered excessive toil and drudgery in one beast and was in itself of a harmless nature might by transmigration be converted into another body the business of whose life might be nothing but ease and pleasure so on the contrary the soul that in one life and form had tasted all the sweets and enjoyments in its kind and was an offensive animal might have a suitable retaliation in some other body  thus we see that those philosophers who most strenuously insist on the immortality of the soul of man are necessitated to conclude that brutes have souls capable of sensation and reflection and we find that upon granting this when they endeavor to distinguish it from the soul of man in so important a point as its immortality what egregious blunders they fall into  this watts saw and rather than make any blunder that might prejudice his cause from a conclusion in this point very judiciously does not decide any thing at all about it though in avoiding this he unluckily falls into that mistake i have above exposed  we will now come to compare the degrees of understanding in men and brutes  sect ix the powers of understanding in men and brutes compared we have considered the soul of man as essentially consisting in the faculties of sensation reflection and what is directed by these the will  first then as to perception or sensation  we have a thousand instances wherein the nice distinctions of sensation are more readily communicated to the soul of the brute than the man  of this there needs no other example than that wonderful power in the dog whereby he shall trace by the subtle effluvias of smell not only an animal but a human creature  we daily see this and are surpised at that extraordinary instinct which we find ourselves so void of that a man with all the faculties of his soul engaged shall not be able to tell which path among twenty his friend has taken while we see his dog without any other advantage from external objects in themselves considered shall pursue the right track after him  thus in every article of sensation there remains not the least doubt but that among some or other of the brute creation they are found to have perception equal and in many cases superior to man  now then we must consider in what degree they have reflection or reason and under this head we will just speak of the will it is plain that the power of volition is in some cases influenced by sensation  as when the senses are acting we cannot choose but see hear feel etc now in other cases it is plainly influenced by the powers of sensation acting with those of reason  as supposing a man should see a prodigious weight falling toward his head the apprehension occasioned by the sensation at that time which makes the will direct the body to get out of danger is partly the effect of reason for if a man was to see a feather falling down he would perhaps entirely disregard it though he may be as sensible of the descent of the feather as of the weight  and this power of volition brutes have in common with men for by this their bodies move and act equally wise for their own use and safety as we do  now reflection or reason is a faculty so necessary to the souls essential existence that without it we should not be capable of acting for our preservation  this we find also in a great degree essential to the souls of brutes for it is plain that animals remember persons and things acts of kindness and diskindness of which we have daily ten thousand instances  some animals stand in dread of what has offended them others again remember to resent the offense received  a horse stands in fear of a whip and the smack of it because he remembers the smart he felt at the time he saw the same object or heard the same sound  a horse naturally starts at the sound of a drum because it occasions a sensation he is a stranger to and therefore he does not know the consequence of it but after hearing it several times repeated and feeling no hurt arise from it he takes no more notice of that than of any other familiar sound  so a man is equally startled at an unusual noise but when he finds no hurtful consequence arise from it the repetition of the same accident will less and less affect him till it comes at last to have no other effect than that of confirming him when there is such a noise  a man is also afraid of a thrust from a sword because either he has felt the smart it can occasion or from information or reflection on the effects of a similar cause he justly imagines it can hurt him so if you could inform a horse that had never felt the whip that it would hurt like something he had felt he would stand in the same fear  neither does the difficulty of informing the horse this argue any thing of his want of reflection or reason for if you were to show a man whose language you were a stranger to an instrument the effects of which he had never seen or the effects of any thing similar to it you would find perhaps as much difficulty in communicating the knowledge of its effects to him by information as the effect of a whip to a horse  for supposing the horse entirely ignorant of the whip the sound attending it and the action accompanying the blow yet if you take another horse and lash him with it the animal that stands by will be immediately apprehensive of something from it but not because he hears the sound or sees the blow but by the agitation and concern in which he sees and hears his fellow creature at that time and of this he is naturally a judge  now to this apprehension are joined the circumstances of the blow the whip and the sound which are inseparable ideas and therefore when he hears or sees the one he is immediately apprehensive of the other so in the former case you must show the man its effects upon something whose nature and properties he is acquainted with and then he can be justly apprehensive of the true effect of such an instrument  hence it is evident that the soul of a brute has besides all the properties of sensation the powers of volition and that of retaining simple ideas equal to man and of acting as rationally from those ideas  but we will consider this further  the rule mr pope lays down is evident we cannot reason but from what we know a man cannot form any ideas of things whose nature he is entirely ignorant of and of any thing similar thereto for the most abstracted and metaphysical idea must have its foundation from the knowledge of physical and natural causes  a man who never had the sense of hearing cannot reason of sound or of any thing similar to it if of seeing he can form no idea relative to form or colors  reason then is the power of drawing inferences from ideas acquired by sensation which inferences are ideas formed purely by the souls reflection or power of comparing effects and properties within itself though the cause of those effects and the things possessed of those properties may perhaps be ten thousand miles withdrawn from any of the organs of sensation  in what degree then are some men possessed of this power of reason  we find here that while we have had men whose profound capacities have been able to comprehend and retain almost every kind of knowledge we have had others who have been capable of entering but into one or two branches of science and others again entirely incapacitated to comprehend or retain any thing at all of science thus we see some men so deeply enter into mathematical learning and the science of algebra while others cannot imagine in the least what they are about who talk of some quantities less than nothing and of others not quite so much less than nothing  and yet those who cannot comprehend this perhaps may very well understand that two and two make four and that three times three make nine because these are ideas the truth of which may by the organs of sensation be demonstrated and whenever the mind does judge it can judge no otherwise and yet there are some men so dull and void of the power of thinking that they cannot comprehend by what means or how this axiom is true without such a sensative demonstration  i shall not pretend to assert that a beast of any kind is capable of this knowledge otherwise than that a horse must feel that the weight or power of one is less than that of two of two less than three etc  this appears by his act of volition in putting out an additional strength to resist in proportion to such an added force  neither is it any ways material to the purposes of that beast or does it argue against the essential power of reason in the brute that this truth does not come to him in the form of a proposition since he is as sensible of the justice of the axiom as a man who is convinced by his senses that the same thing or accident is so many times repeated and cannot judge of it without the evidence of his senses or the remembrance of that evidence  now though such an evidence is the test of the most sublime reasoning yet the man of science taking such certain axioms for granted goes on through a thousand complex similar and dissimilar ideas without ever having occasion to examine the sensative truth of any one of those ideas  now such a manner of reasoning i will not pretend the brutes to be possessed of  and yet at the same time experience tells us that such a manner of reasoning is as little inherent to some of the human species  either then we must deny the souls of these men to be of the same nature with those of a superior capacity of receiving knowledge or by admitting that the souls of brutes are essentially the same with men of an inferior capacity we must allow that they are of the same nature with those of the most elevated genius  but perhaps it is not sufficiently evident that the souls of men of narrow and weak understandings are as incapable of reason as the brutes we will then compare their intellects more particularly  there can be no instance of the want of reason in man or brute but what must effect them either in speculation or practice  first then as to practice we can have no cause to imagine the brute wants reason as to its actions if it provides as wisely for itself in its own nature as man does for himself in his neither is the effect of rational propositions of any moment in this case for we dont say that man wants reason who avoids or chooses any thing that is agreeable or detrimental to his nature from his knowledge of its properties immediately by sensation any more than another who avoids or chooses the same thing because from a long train of examinations into the nature of beings their effects modes and properties he is sensible why such a thing is agreeable or detrimental to his nature  the philosopher will not run his head against a wall because he is sensible of the motion and properties of matter and the construction of his own organs fibers etc by which knowledge he is sensible he shall feel pain by such an action  a man that is no philosopher will not run his head against a wall because though he knows nothing at all concerning the properties of matter or the construction of himself yet he knows by the means of sensation and the rational conclusions he of necessity draws from those sensations that such an action will hurt him  now for some reason or other a horse will not run his head against a wall any sooner than a man or a philosopher  again we see with wonder the great improvement men have made toward the mutual benefit and advantage of each other by the arts of navigation commerce etc yet these improvements we are sensible must be made by men of the most refined or extensive talents and not by men of mean or narrow capacities  we see on the side of brutes the wonderful means they have taken and daily take for the mutual interest and preservation of their species equal perhaps in their nature and knowledge of things to ours  we have instances of many men that notwithstanding all the advantages of information by means received from creatures of their own kind yet cannot retain the method whereby they should know how to spell a word or a name and yet we have seen a dog in this metropolis that would never miss to spell the names of julius caesar and others by only hearing the ounds of them  and in some dogs of polite education we have found them also capacitated to the modish qualifications of dancing a minuet which some men perform much more clumsily with the same advantage  i have also a dog now by me who upon hearing the name of a gentleman who has offended him only mentioned will immediately begin barking though the party should be a hundred miles distant we see some parrots and magpies take off or imitate our speech articulately  is it then because we do not find in the same animal the power of speech joined with the understanding in the same manner as it is in us that we conclude its understanding is not essentially like ours  thus we may object against the parrot for talking what he does not understand  against the dog for not speaking what it understands  and may not the parrot or magpie laugh at you for not imitating its natural chatter or knowing what it means and perhaps it does and only takes off human voice out of derision and may not the dog esteem us a parcel of ignorant stupid beings that cannot trace the footsteps of each other as sagaciously as he can those of his master a hare or a fox  but in opposition to what i would here infer mr pope says the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day had he thy reason would he skip and play mr pope here puts the lamb in the place of a man which is not the case we are to suppose the lamb endowed with a human soul  yet as a lamb it is yeand brought up in the fields and pastures knows nothing at all or very little of the actions of man does not know a butchers knife from a piece of wax in that form it sees its shepherd indeed drive it or gently lead it from one place to another provide fodder or a fold for it at night this is all it knows of mankind  what ground has it then to be apprehensive of danger whether it is enclosed in a butchers or a shepherds pen since supposing it to have a human soul it cannot reason but from what it knows and it is very certain the lamb with its own soul is under terrible apprehensions when it hears the complaint of its fellow creatures with whom it never fails to sympathize or when he is tied by the heels for the slaughter this appears evident from its struggling to get free and if it was once loose it would make its escape with all possible speed  mr pope then should have said  had he thy knowledge would he skip and play for the want of more extensive knowledge in any creature wanting the opportunity of acquiring more knowledge does not in the least argue its want of the power of reasoning from the knowledge it has and it is also plain to me that if a lamb knew as much of a butcher as it does of a dog it would stand in fear of one as much as it does of the other and would no sooner permit itself to be drove into a butchers shop than it would into a river where it might be drowned or into a ditch where it might be smothered  it is plain then that a lamb though perhaps as stupid a creature as most of the brute species acts rationally from what it knows and as wisely to answer the ends of its creation as a man  you may perhaps say it is instinct in the one and the effects of a rational mind in the other  but i will not quarrel with you about words  you may call it instinct soul mind or what you please  but you must first prove an essential difference in two beings before i will allow them to be of a different kind  mr pope was very unwilling to go so far as to think the soul of the brute of the same nature with that of man and therefore after speaking of the wonderful instinct of brutes he says twixt that and reason what a nice barrier for ever separate yet for ever near remembrance and reflection how allied what thin partitions sense from thought divide   this hairbreadth difference this cobweb partition does not at all exist but in the vanity of imagination neither does our author give us any other proof of its being than a bare assertion that it is but reason feels no such thing  reason cannot help telling us that when two things are exactly alike they must be of the same nature  would it not be stupid to say that any thing exactly round may not be or that it is not a circle when all the idea we have of a circle is that it is exactly round  i believe you will say yes  certainly then if the soul of a brute is possessed of the same essential faculties as the soul of a man it must positively must be esteemed of the same nature  but let us examine into the powers of reason in the brute creation relating to speculation  there are some points of speculation so immediately applicable to practice that perhaps they should have been before considered these are those which are the foundations of art such are the theories of arithmetic geometry and government from which arise the arts of architecture commerce and law  let us turn to the brutes and see the effects of those sciences among them  the spiders web the birds nest the laws of the bees and the economy of the pismire are wonderful instances  then why should not we infer the same effect must proceed from the same cause  or will you say this seems to be rather instinct than reason because the beast bird and insect vary little in these acts from the rest of the same kind whereas some men build one kind of houses some another some have one method of commerce some another some one kind of laws some another yet shall not we as rationally account for this by saying that man having more pride and curiosity is more whimsical and wavering in his actions than the brutes who study no more than is necessary to the use of nature and therefore they are it is not however clearly evident that all the brutes are uniform in such actions with those of their species since if we were as sensible of their mechanism as of our own i make no doubt but we should discover many ingenious and considerable variations uniform in their actions for it is certain the use of a house is not its form advantage is the design of commerce and happiness the design of laws however their form or method may vary  is it then from the idle vanity of curiosity that we adjudge the actions of men to proceed from reason and from the want of that only that we allow the actions of brutes to be directed by bare instinct  i think this is stupid enough since we allow that instinct performs the purposes of the animal to the full as well and in some cases much better than reason performs ours  but to come to pure speculation  is the brute capable of laying down propositions and of forming conclusions from them relating to things perhaps unnecessary for them to know of this we may ever remain ignorant unless the brutes could invent a way to communicate to us their ideas but here we are as ignorant with respect to our fellow creatures as to the brutes for if i meet a man or keep him company for twelve months and in all that time he neither speaks writes or by any means communicates his thoughts to me i am entirely ignorant whether he be a man of science or the most illiterate of his species however if we may guess from physiognomy as we do among men i think it quite easy to imagine when a dog cat or any other animal is buried in deep contemplation and when a jackdaw magpye or ape is chattering i esteem them coxcombly brutes that cannot think  and whenever i look at an owl i cannot help suspecting but that from its little concern shown to external objects it is logically weighing some very nice point of metaphysics  but here it is possible i may be deceived  yet if i am it is nothing more than we are daily in the appearances of men  when we imagine a grave look and a solemn behavior denote wisdom and experience and that a man that chatters is a coxcomb which is not always the case  having now brought all the reasons that at present occur and which i think sufficient to place mankind in a true light with respect to their fellow creatures for so now i will presume to call the brutes we must draw this conclusion that men of science are of the highest order of animals and that next them all creatures without distinction must take their places not according to the form of their bodies but according to the native greatness of their souls by which order it will doubtless be found that some part of mankind will stand not only equal to but below some of the brute creation  now then to apply the design of our arguments  if we allow immortality to the soul of the philosopher and every soul of the like kind we must allow it to the meanest of all animals whereby a mouse a rat a louse and a flea will have immortal souls  an intolerable conclusion or else we must allow immortality to the higher order only and so fix a certain degree at which it must stop and if we fix that so low as to take in all and every soul of an equal degree to the souls of the meanest of mankind it is plain we must include some of the brutes in our system  or by admitting none of the brutes we must shut out some part of mankind with them  we will therefore proceed now to consider the possibility as well as the probability of the souls both of brutes and men being mortal or ceasing to exist as beings in themselves after the death of the body  sect x the possibility and probability of the souls being mortal with a definition of god it was at first allowed that the soul is not a material being but only a spirit or power acting upon matter by means entirely unknown that it is also capable of acting on itself as by reflection and that upon its ceasing to act it must immediately cease to be  now all power must be essentially the same however its manner of acting may vary as we must allow that that power which causes the planets to move in their orbits is exactly of the same nature as that which induces a stone thrown upwards to fall down again toward its proper center  exactly the same that enables a horse to draw a man to walk etc as that may be a piece of steel exactly of the same nature and capable of the same impressions that lies in a rude form and is acting in a very simple manner as that which is most surprizingly and ingeniously active in a clock or watch so it is that power called the law of nature that moves the planets the same that acts upon a stone upon a brute and upon a man for though a man be considered ever so much of a free agent and may choose and refuse his actions yet he cannot go beyond such certains laws  he cannot walk in the air nor move a limb contrary nor without an act of volition in his mind any more than a watch can cease to go or can go wrong when all its parts are justly constructed and put together so that power whereby we move bodies from one place to another is still the same power of nature notwithstanding their motion be upwards directly contrary to the known laws of gravitation because the motion of the arm whereby such bodies are impelled is the effect of the same power in a greater degree and it is as natural for a stone to rise in the air when thrown up as it is for it to fall again of its own accord  now suppose a man throwing a ball upwards it is plain he occasions a power to act upon the ball for when it is out of his hand he does not assist its motion any more yet the ball proceeds the power therefore acts upon it but how or by what means we can tell no otherwise than by saying it is the law or power of nature now it is the same law of nature that acts upon that matter which particularly constructed is called man  but to our supposition we see that the law of gravitation which acts without distinction upon all bodies whether endowed with a human soul or not lessens by degrees the power acting on the ball till it goes no further the power then ceases to act consequently ceases to be  and it is in vain to deny that this power is a soul because we cannot imagine it to be a cogitative or thinking power which means no more than a power which can act on itself as well as on matter neither can we imagine this power to be communicated from or to be a part of the human soul because the same power may be occasioned by things called insensible thus it is possible for even man himself to be in such circumstances that by the force occasioned by inanimate things he may be thrown up an excessive height into the air by earthquake gunpowder and the like now this power or soul that forces him up is superior in strength to the force of all the faculties of his soul acting together for neither his exerting the strongest act of volition or of reason can possibly prevent his submitting to the effect if he resist the cause  it is plain also that however nearly matter may be instrumental in such an accident yet as the soul does not exist till it acts and is nothing but action so there is no soul acting on the gunpowder or sulphur till there be such a particular uniting of particles of matter at which juncture the soul immediately exists acts and no sooner ceases to act that in ceases to be  the soul of man does not act i e exist till there be formed such a particular union of matter framed into organs of sense fibers etc fit for the soul to act on just then the soul begins to exist and exists acting till by some i would have none here conclude by the word accident that i think there is any such thing as chance or that any thing may or may not be since however dark and intricate it may seem to us there is an absolute necessity in the order of nature for things to happen as they do and as mr pope says whatever is is right  nay though i throw a pair of dice as high as the monument there is a certain law by which they will turn up that very number that they do and if they were thrown up by the same force in the same position and every other circumstance similar they must of necessity turn up the same again   accident or other those particles of matter are broken impard or disunited and then the soul ceases to act now it is equally evident that if a child is begotten and naturally formed in the womb with every organ fiber etc perfect it can no more fail of being agitated by a human soul than a regular constructed clock can forbear moving or the gunpowder forbear giving a concussion when touched by a sparkle of fire  and in each of these cases the parallel is just  for when the clock is maimed or rendered imperfect its power ceases and as soon as ever the volatile and combustible parts of the gunpowder are dispersed the soul ceases to exist there is no more power left and thus it is with that free agent man  now from the above instances we see the possibility of souls being created and destroyed as to their existence as separate beings with ease for we cannot imagine that those powers which acted on the ball on the gunpowder or on the clock to exist after the dispersion or maiming of the union of their proper matter acting on themselves as the soul of man is supposed to do if this were the case almost every action of our lives would create a new soul and we should have the universe strangely stocked with active beings we must conclude then that those powers or souls are annihilated here then it is evident that the greater power will always annihilate the less let the properties of that power or the manner of its acting be what they will  whether weak or strong violent or progressive animate or inanimate  or if there be any idea of their existing afterward they must be lost and mixed with the power of the universe the law of nature  hence then it is evident that those powers which act upon men on brutes and upon inanimate things are nothing more than the law of nature which is the consequence or the effect of the divine volition or will and that these powers as still effects of the same cause whether they act rationally and on themselves as in men and brutes or by necessity and purely on matter as in things inanimate and certainly if they are effects of the same cause the effects must be all of the same nature and here then will appear the probability of the souls mortality or cessation of being by considering the affinity of these powers or souls we see the soul of a man at first very weak not at all capable or but very faintly of exerting its rational faculties by degrees it grows stronger and stronger and acquires extensive knowledge till at length in old age notwithstanding all its acquirements it grows excessively weak and childish again  it is true we see in violent powers such as throwing a ball nothing but the gradual decay but in progressive powers such as in those of plants trees etc things always deemed inanimate we see exactly such a beginning progress and decay  if then we judge justly and that is certainly the only right way of judging from similar causes and effects is not here a probability nay do not our arguments all put together give us a demonstrative proof that the soul cannot exist as a being in itself when the body becomes inactive  in other words that it cannot be immortal  now from hence to form the most just definition of a deity we must conclude that god is in himself nothing but volition sir isaac newton will have god to be extended and to be a substance for says he power without substance cannot subsist now god considered as will must be a spirit and as a spirit must be power and as power may bd substance but it is evident that god is not that substance which is the power of nature of which our souls are identically part but he is that will or power which is the cause of that power of nature  now while we are so ignorant of what kind of substance that power or spirit is material substance it is allowed by all it cannot be of which our souls are part who can pretend to define what kind of a substance god is  i think therefore it is a little idle to pretend to say that god is substance at all when we dont know what we mean by it or a will and that that power which has been called the soul or law of nature and which mr pope calls god is nothing more than the effect of the divine will or the deity himself that it is not the being but only a consequence of the being of god so that whatever god wills is by that will actually done because volition being a spirit and a spirit or soul being nothing but action gods willing and acting is exactly the same thing and thus he is the prime cause of all things and this is all we can understand as to the essential being of a god  for to say the deity is power or the deity is space allows from what i have proved that we and every thing in nature are identically part of the divine being since we take up some space and are possessed of some power  but it is plain neither space or power are in themselves infinite things however they may surpass our comprehension for we cannot allow space to extend any further than god pleases and we see evidently that power cannot exert itself a jot further than the will of its creator assigns it  hence it is plain that power is a being capable of restraint and entirely acted on by the deity and is infinite no otherwise than as considered capable of executing the most infinite and unbounded commands of the deity and space is infinite no otherwise than that wherever power is it there finds space  but suppose we give up space as a being and say it is nothing  then we shall say how extensive soever is power it meets with no obstruction or want of space to act in  but here now may arise an objection against this definition of god from our having proved the mortality of the soul  for you may say that the power of volition or the will found in man must be similar to the nature of the deity and may have immortality annexed to it  in answer to this i say  it is evident that will considered as god and the will in man have no essential connection for the volition of god or god himself is the sole cause of all power and the will in man is only as it were a property of the same power in a very narrow degree for the will acts subservient to every other faculty of the soul i cannot perceive what i will  i cannot think what i will nor how i will  i cannot think two and two make five though i would ever so fain neither can i think any thing does not stand before me which i see and know actually does stand there though i exert the strongest act of volition i am capable of so in forming propositions  i cannot draw what conclusion i will from supposed concessions or known facts but must draw that which the power of reason tells me necessarily follows thus not one act of the soul is subject to the will of man and we see that brutes and idiots have often a greater share of will than the wisest and best philosopher  the matter of the body indeed is subject to will and that is all  and that but in some cases for if a mans leg is broke he may will long enough before it will move shall we then give up the powers of reason to annihilation and scruple to give up the will the most sensual and beastly faculty of the soul acting so much beneath its other faculties that it seems rather to be a property annexed to the soul than any thing essential to it  i am sure you will say no if we give up the other powers the will must necessarily follow for where there is neither perception or reflection there can be no will  thus we see that the will of god or the deity is the sole cause of the most extensive power and the will of man but at best the meanest faculty of a very small and limited portion of that power where is then the similarity here is neither the cause of the same effect nor the effect of the same cause  it is plain then they are not essentially in any degree the same and as this is our only way of judging rightly here evidently appears the reason why we cannot judge of the essence of god because we cannot reason but from what we know now all we know is that all power is the effect of the being of god hence we have god as the cause and power the effect but do we know the cause of any other effect similar to power if we did we might then judge of god and say he was like that cause we may say indeed god is allwise all justice all goodness and the like  but what are those things we call wisdom justice and goodness  why they are ideas which are the effects of a small part of that most extensive power which is the effect of god shall we then patch up a god with the effects of part of a cause which whole cause is the effect of himself is this doing honor to god no  let us say then that god is the cause of all things and there put an end to our enquiries for we have not ground to step one foot further  this reader is the effect of my first rational enquiry into the nature and dependency of my own being the tendency of inculcating and publishing this doctrine it is impossible i should foresee but i cannot think it will at all hurt the morality of those who understand it but will rather lead them to admire and adore the infinity of that god in whom our ideas and reasonings are lost as well as excite them to that general humanity that should be extended to every living creature to make them encourage those which are instrumental and to destroy those which are prejudicial to the greatest general good in whatever order of beings they may exist hence will follow the idea of virtue and the justice will appear evident in killing a mad dog in the lawful execution of a villainous man or in destroying every offensive animal but after all i am so willing to believe even to desire the immortality of the soul that is a capacity of retaining those ideas i am possessed of in this world that i heartily and sincerely wish to see these reasons i have here given confuted and proved erroneous and promise the world that if ever i should be of a contrary opinion i will undoubtedly give them my reasons for renouncing what i have here written  finis
