concerning the origin of the authors countrymen with the opinions of different writers on that subject  i believe it is difficult for those who publish their own memoirs to escape the imputation of vanity nor is this the only disadvantage under which they labor it is also their misfortune that what is uncommon is rarely if ever believed and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with disgust and to charge the writer with impertinence people generally think those memoirs only worthy to be read or remembered which abound in great or striking events those in short which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity all others they consign to contempt and oblivion it is therefore i confess not a little hazardous in a private and obscure individual and a stranger too thus to solicit the indulgent attention of the public especially when i own i offer here the history of neither a saint a hero nor a tyrant i believe there are a few events in my life which have not happened to many it is true the incidents of it are numerous and did i consider myself an european i might say my sufferings were great but when i compare my lot with that of most of my countrymen i regard myself as a particular favorite of heaven and acknowledge the mereies of providence in every occurrence of my life if then the following narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage general attention let my motive be some excuse for its publication i am not so soolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputation if it affords any satissaction to my numerous friends at whose request it has been written or in the smallest degree promotes the interests of humanity the ends for which it was undertaken will be fully attained and every wish of my heart gratisied let it therefore be remembered that in wishing to avoid censure i do not aspire to praise  that part of africa known by the name of guinea to which the trade for slaves is carried on extends along the coast above   00 miles from senegal to angola and includes a variety of kingdoms of these the most considerable is the kingdom of benin both as to extent and wealth the richness and cultivation of the soil the power of its king and the number and warlike disposition of the inhabitants it is situated nearly under the line and extends along the coast about   0 miles but runs back into the intertior part of africa to a distance hitherto i believe unexplored by any traveller and seems only terminated at length by the empire of abyssinia near   00 miles from its beginning this kingdom is divided into many provinces or districts in one of the most remote and fertile of which i was born in the year      situated in a charming fruitful vale named essaka the distance of this province from the capital of benin and the sea coast must be very considerable for i had never heard of white men or europeans nor of the sea and our subjection to the king of benin was little more than nominal for every transaction of the government as far as my slender observation extended was conducted by the chiefs or elders of the place the manners and government of a people who have little commerce with other countries are generally very simple and the history of what passes in one family or village may serve as a specimen of the whole nation my father was one of those elders or chiefs i have spoken of and was styled embrenche a term as i remember importing the highest distinction and signifying in our language a mark of grandeur this mark is conferred on the person entitled to it by cutting the skin across at the top of the forehead and drawing it down to the eyebrows and while it is in this situation applying a warm hand and rubbing it until it shrinks up into a thick weal across the lower part of the forehead most of the judges and senators were thus marked my father had long borne it i had seen it conferred on one of my brothers and i also was destined to receive it by my parents those embrenche or chief men decided disputes and punished crimes for which purpose they always assembled together the proceedings were generally short and in most cases the law of retaliation prevailed i remember a man was brought before my father and the other judges for kidnapping a boy and although he was the son of a chief or senator he was condemned to make recompense by a man or woman slave adultery however was sometimes punished with slavery or death a punishment which i believe is inflicted on it throughout most of the nations of africa see benezets account of guinea throughout  so sacred among them is the honor of the marriage bed and so jealous are they of the fidelity of their wives of this i recollect an instance  a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery and delivered over as the custom was to her husband to be punished accordingly he determined to put her to death but it being found just before her execution that she had an infant at her breast and no woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nurse she was spared on account of the child the men however do not preserve the same constancy to their wives which they expect from them for they indulge in a plurality though seldom in more than two their mode of marriage is thus  both parties are usually betrothed when young by their parents though i have known the males to betroth themselves on this occasion a feast is prepared and the bride and bridegroom stand up in the midst of all their friends who are assembled for the purpose while he declares she is thenceforth to be looked upon as his wife and that no other person is to pay any addresses to her this is also immediately proclaimed in the vicinity on which the bride retires from the assembly some time after she is brought home to her husband and then another feast is made to which the relations of both parties are invited her parents then deliver her to the bridegroom accompanied with a number of blessings and at the same time they tie round her waist a cotton string of the thickness of a goosequill which none but married women are permitted to wear she is now considered as completely his wife and at this time the dowry is given to the new married pair which generally consists of portions of land slaves and cattle household goods and implements of husbandry these are offered by the friends of both parties besides which the parents of the bridegroom present gifts to those of the bride whose property she is looked upon before marriage but after it she is esteemed the sole property of her husband the ceremony being now ended the festival begins which is celebrated with bonefires and loud acclamations of joy accompanied with music and dancing  we are almost a nation of dancers musicians and poets thus every great event such as a triumphant return from battle or other cause of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances which are accompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion the assembly is separated into four divisions which dance either apart or in succession and each with a character peculiar to itself the first division contains the married men who in their dances frequently exhibit feats of arms and the representation of a battle to these succeed the married women who dance in the second division the young men accupy the third and the maidens the fourth each represents some interesting scene of real life such as a great achievement domestic employment a pathetic story or some rural sport and as the subject is generally founded on some recent event it is therefore ever new this gives our dances a spirit and variety which i have scarcely seen elsewhere when i was in smyrna i have frequently seen the greeks dance after this manner  we have many musical instruments particularly drums of different kinds a piece of music which resembles a guitar and another much like a stickado these last are chiefly used by betrothed virgins who play on them on all grand festivals  as our manners are simple our luxuries are few the dress of both sexes is nearly the same it generally consists of a long piece of calico or muslin wrapped loosely round the body somewhat in the form of a highland played this is usually dyed blue which is our favorite color it is extracted from a berry and is brighter and richer than any i have seen in europe besides this our women of distinction wear golden ornaments which they dispose with some profusion on their arms and legs when our women are not employed with the men in tillage their usual occupation is spinning and weaving cotton which they afterward dye and make into garments they also manufacture earthen vessels of which we have many kinds among the rest tobacco pipes made after the same fashion and used in the same manner as those in turkey the bowl is earthen curiously figured to which a long reed is fixed as a tube this tube is sometimes so long as to be borne by one and frequently out of grandeur by two boys   our manner of living is entirely plain for as yet the natives are unacquainted with those refinements in cookery which debauch the taste bullocks goats and poultry supply the greatest part of their food these constitute likewise the principal wealth of the country and the chief articles of its commerce the flesh is usually stewed in a pan to make it savoury we sometimes use also pepper and other spices and we have salt made of wood ashes our vegetables are mostly plantains eadas yams beans and indian corn the head of the family usually eats alone his wives and slaves have also their separate tables before we taste food we always wash our hands indeed our cleanliness on all occasions is extreme but on this it is an indispensible ceremony after washing libation is made by pouring out a small portion of the drink on the floor and tossing a small quantity of the food in a certain place for the spirits of departed relations which the natives suppose to preside over their conduct and guard them from evil they are totally unacquainted with strong or spirituous liquors and their principal beverage is palm wine this is got from a tree of that name by tapping it at the top and fastening a large gourd to it and sometimes one tree will yield three or four gallons in a night when just drawn it is of a most delicious sweetness but in a few days it acquires a tartish and more spirituous flavor though i never saw any one intoxicated by it the same tree also produces nuts and oil our principal luxury is in perfumes one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance the other a kind of earth a small portion of which thrown into the fire diffuses a most powerful odor when i was in smyrna i saw the same kind of earth and brought some of it with me to england it resembles musk in strength but is more delicious in scent and is not unlike the smell of a rose  we beat this wood into powder and mix it with palm oil with which both men and women perfume themselves  in our buildings we study convenience rather than ornament each master of a family has a large square piece of ground surrounded with a moat or fence or enclosed with a wall made of red earth tempered which when dry is as hard as brick within this are his houses to accommodate his family and slaves which if numerous frequently present the appearance of a village in the middle stands the principal building appropriated to the sole use of the master and consisting of two apartments in one of which he sits in the day with his family the other is left apart for the reception of his friends he has besides these a distinct apartment in which he sleeps together with his male children on each side are the apartments of his wives who have also their separate day and night houses the habitations of the slaves and their families are distributed throughout the rest of the enclosure these houses never exceed one story in height they are always built of wood or stakes driven into the ground crossed with wattles and neatly plastered within and without the roof is thatched with reeds our dayhouses are left open at the sides but those in which we sleep are always covered and plastered in the inside with a composition mixed with cowdung to keep off the different insects which annoy us during the night the walls and floors also of these are generally covered with mats our beds consist of a platform raised three or four feet from the ground on which are laid skins and different parts of a spungy tree called plantain our covering is calico or muslin the same as our dress the usual seats are a few logs of wood but we have benches which are generally perfumed to accommodate strangers these compose the greater part of our household furniture houses so constructed and furnished require but little skill to erect them every man is a sussicient architect for the purpose the whole neighborhood afford their unanimous assistance in building them and in return receive and expect no other recompense than a feast  as we live in a country where nature is prodigal of her favors our wants are few and easily supplied of course we have few manufactures they consist for the most part of calicoes earthen ware ornaments and instruments of war and husbandry but these make no part of our commerce the principal articles of which as i have observed are provisions in such a state money is of little use however we have some small pieces of coin if i may call them such they are made something like an anchor but i do not remember either their value or denomination we have also markets at which i have been frequently with my mother these are sometimes visited by stout mahoganycoloured men from the south west of us we call them oyeeboe which term signifies red men living at a distance they generally bring us firearms gunpowder hats beads and dried fish the last we esteemed a great rarity as our waters were only brooks and springs these articles they barter with us for odoriferous woods and earth and our salt of wood ashes they always carry slaves through our land but the strictest account is exacted of their manner of procuring them before they are suffered to pass sometimes indeed we sold slaves to them but they were only prisoners of war or such among us as had been convicted of kidnapping or adultery and some other crimes which we esteemed heinous this practice of kidnapping induces me to think that notwithstanding all our strictness their principal business among us was to trepan our people i remember too they carried great sacks along with them which not long after i had an opportunity of fatally seeing applied to that infamous purpose  our land is uncommonly rich and fruitful and produces all kinds of vegetables in great abundance we have plenty of indian corn and vast quantities of cotton and tobacco our pine apples grow without culture they are about the size of the largest sugar loaf and sinely flavoured we have also spices of different kinds particularly pepper and a variety of delicious fruits which i have never seen in europe together with gums of various kinds and honey in abundance all our industry is exerted to improve those blessings of nature agriculture is our chief employment and every one even the children and women are engaged in it thus we are all habituated to labor from our earliest years every one contributes something to the common stock and as we are unacquainted with idleness we have no beggars the benefits of such a mode of living are obvious the west india planters prefer the slaves of benin or eboe to those of any other part of guinea for their hardiness intelligence integrity and zeal those benefits are felt by us in the general healthiness of the people and in their vigor and activity i might have added too in their comeliness deformity is indeed unknown amongst us i mean that of shape numbers of the natives of eboe now in london might be brought in support of this assertion for in regard to complexion ideas of beauty are wholly relative i remember while in africa to have seen three negro children who were tawny and another quite white who were universally regarded by myself and the natives in general as far as related to their complexions as deformed our women too were in my eyes at least uncommonly graceful alert and modest to a degree of bashfulness nor do i remember to have ever heard of an instance of incontinence amongst them before marriage they are also remarkably cheerful indeed cheerfulness and affability are two of the leading characteristics of our nation  our tillage is exercised in a large plain or common some hours walk from our dwellings and all the neighbors resort thither in a body they use no beasts of husbandry and their only instruments are hoes axes shovels and beaks or pointed iron to dig with sometimes we are visited by locusts which come in large clouds so as to darken the air and destroy our harvest this however happens rarely but when it does a famine is produced by it i remember an instance or two wherein this happened this common is often the theater of war and therefore when our people go out to till their land they not only go in a body but generally take their arms with them for fear of a surprise and when they apprehend an invasion they guard the avenues to their dwellings by driving sticks into the ground which are so sharp at one end as to pierce the foot and are generally dipped in poison from what i can recollect of these battles they appear to have been irruptions of one little state or district on the other to obtain prisoners or booty perhaps they were incited to this by those traders who brought the european goods i mentioned amongst us such a mode of obtaining slaves in africa is common and i believe more are procured this way and by kidnaping than any other see benezets account of africa throughout  when a trader wants slaves he applies to a chief for them and tempts him with his wares it is not extraordinary if on this occasion he yields to the temptation with as little firmness and accepts the price of his fellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlightened merchant accordingly he falls on his neighbors and a desperate battle ensues if he prevails and takes prisoners he gratifies his avarice by selling them but if his party be vanquished and he falls into the hands of the enemy he is put to death for as he has been known to foment their quarrels it is thought dangerous to let him survive and no ransom can save him though all other prisoners may be redeemed we have firearms bows and arrows broad twoedged swords and javelins we have shields also which cover a man from head to foot all are taught the use of these weapons even our women are warriors and march boldly out to fight along with the men our whole district is a kind of militia on a certain signal given such as the firing of a gun at night they all rise in arms and rush upon their enemy it is perhaps something remarkable that when our people march to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them i was once a witness to a battle in our common we had been all at work in it one day as usual when our people were suddenly attacked i climbed a tree at some distance from which i beheld the sight there were many women as well as men on both sides among others my mother was there and armed with a broad sword after fighting for a considerable time with great fury and many had been killed our people obtained the victory and took their enemys chief prisoner he was carried off in great triumph and though he offered a large ransom for his life he was put to death a virgin of note among our enemies had been slain in the battle and her arm was exposed in our marketplace where our trophies were always exhibited the spoils were divided according to the merit of the warriors those prisoners which were not sold or redeemed we kept as slaves but how different was their condition from that of the slaves in the west indies with us they do no more work than other members of the community even their master their food clothing and lodging were nearly the same as theirs except that they were not permitted to eat with those who were freeborn and there was scarce any other difference between them than a superior degree of importance which the head of a family possesses in our state and that authority which as such he exercises over every part of his household some of these slaves have even slaves under them as their own property and for their own use  as to religion the natives believe that there is one creator of all things and that he lives in the sun and is girted round with a belt that he may never eat or drink but according to some he smokes a pipe which is our own favorite luxury they believe he governs events especially our deaths or captivity but as for the doctrine of eternity i do not remember to have ever heard of it some however believe in the transmigration of souls in a certain degree those spirits which are not transmigrated such as their dear friends or relations they believe always attend them and guard them from the bad spirits or their foes for this reason they always before eating as i have observed put some small portion of the meat and pour some of their drink on the ground for them and they often make oblations of the blood of beasts or fowls at their graves i was very fond of my mother and almost constantly with her when she went to make these oblations at her mothers tomb which was a kind of small solitary thatched house i sometimes attended her there she made her libations and spent most of the night in cries and lamentations i have been often extremely terrified on these occasions the loneliness of the place the darkness of the night and the ceremony of libation naturally awful and gloomy were heightened by my mothers lamentations and these concurring with the doleful cries of birds by which these places were frequented gave an inexpressible terror to the scene  we compute the year from the day on which the sun crosses the line and on its setting that evening there is a general shout throughout the land at least i can speak from my own knowledge throughout our vicinity the people at the same time make a great noise with rattles not unlike the basket rattles used by children here though much larger and hold up their hands to heaven for a blessing it is then the greatest offerings are made and those children whom our wise men foretell will be fortunate are then presented to different people i remember many used to come to see me and i was carried about to others for that purpose they have many offerings particularly at full moons generally two at harvest before the fruits are taken out of the ground and when any young animals are killed sometimes they offer up part of them as a sacrifice these offerings when made by one of the heads of a family serve for the whole i remember we often had them at my fathers and my uncles and their families have been present some of our offerings are eaten with bitter herbs we had a saying among us to any one of a cross temper that if they were to be eaten they should be eaten with bitter herbs  we practiced circumcision like the jews and made offerings and feasts on that occasion in the same manner as they did like them also our children were named from some event some circumstance or fancied foreboding at the time of their birth i was named olaudah which in our language signifies vicissitude or fortunate also one favored and having a loud voice and well spoken i remember we never polluted the name of the object of our adoration on the contrary it was always mentioned with the greatest reverence and we were totally unacquainted with swearing and all those terms of abuse and reproach which find their way so readily and copiously into the language of more civilized people the only expressions of that kind i remember were may you rot or may you swell or may a beast take you  i have before remarked that the natives of this part of africa are extremely cleanly this necessary habit of decency was with us a part of religion and therefore we had many purifications and washings indeed almost as many and used on the same occasions if my recollection does not fail me as the jews those that touched the dead at any time were obliged to wash and purify themselves before they could enter a dwelling house every woman too at certain times was forbidden to come into a dwelling house or touch any person or any thing we eat i was so fond of my mother i could not keep from her or avoid touching her at some of those periods in consequence of which i was obliged to be kept out with her in a little house made for that purpose till offering was made and then we were purified  though we had no places of public worship we had priests and magicians or wise men i do not remember whether they had different offices or whether they were united in the same persons but they were held in great reverence by the people they calculated our time and foretold events as their name imported for we called them ahaffoewaycah which signifies calculators or yearly men our year being called ahaffoe they wore their beards and when they died they were suceeded by their sons most of their implements and things of value were interred along with them pipes and tobacco were also put into the grave with the corpse which was always perfumed and ornamented and animals were offered in sacrifice to them none accompanied their funerals but those of the same profession or tribe these buried them after sunset and always returned from the grave by a different way from that which they went  these magicians were also our doctors or physicians they practiced bleeding by cupping and were very successful in healing wounds and expelling poisons they had likewise some extraordinary method of discovering jealousy theft and poisoning the success of which no doubt they derived from the unbounded influence over the credulity and superstition of the people i do not remember what those methods were except that as to poisoning i recollect an instance or two which i hope it will not be deemed impertinen here to insert as it may serve as a kind of specimen of the rest and is stil used by the negroes in the west indies a young woman had been poisoned bu it was not known by whom the doctor ordered the corpse to be taken up b some persons and carried to the grave as soon as the bearers had raised it on their shoulders they seemed seized with some see also leiut matthews voyage p     sudden impulse and ran to and fro unable to stop themselves at last after having passed through a number of thorns and prickly bushes unhurt the corpse fell from them close to a house and defaced it in the fall and the owner being taken up he immediately confessed the poisoning an instance of this kind happened at montserrat in the west indies in the year      i then belonged to the charming sally capt doran  the chief mate mr mansfield and some of the crew being one day on shore were present at the burying of a poisoned negro girl though they had often heard of the circumstance of the running in such cases and had even seen it they imagined it to be a trick of the corpsebearers the mate therefore desired two of the sailors to take up the coffin and carry it to the grave the sailors who were all of the same opinion readily obeyed but they had scaretly raised it to their shoulders before they began to run furiously about quite unable to direct themselves till at last without intention they came to the hut of him who had poisoned the girl the coffin then immediately fell from their shoulders against the hut and damaged part of the wall the owner of the hut was taken into custody on this and confessed the poisoning  i give this story as it was related by the mate and crew on their return to the ship the credit which is due to it i leave with the reader   the natives are extremely cautions about poison when they buy any eatable the seller kisses it all round before the buyer to show him it is not poisoned and the same is done when any meat or drink is presented particularly to a stranger we have serpents of different kinds some of which are esteemed ominous when they appear in our houses and these we never molest i remember two of those ominous snakes each of which was as thick as the calf of a mans leg and in color resembling a dolphin in the water crept at different times into my mothers nighthouse where i always lay with her and coiled themselves into folds and each time they crowed like a cock i was desired by some of our wise men to touch these that i might be interested in the good omens which i did for they were quite harmless and would tamely suffer themselves to be handled and then they were put into a large open earthen pan and set on one side of the highway some of our snakes however were poisonous one of them crossed the road one day as i was standing on it and passed between my feet without offering to touch me to the great surprise of many who saw it and these incidents were accounted by the wise men and likewise by my mother and the rest of the people as remarkable omens in my favor  such is the imperfect sketch my memory has furnished me with of the manners and customs of a people among whom i first drew my breath and here i cannot forbear suggesting what has long struck me very forcibly namely the strong analogy which even by this sketch imperfect as it is appears to prevail in the manners and customs of my countrymen and those of the jews before they reached the land of promise and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that pastoral state which is described in genesis  an analogy which alone would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the other indeed this is the opinion of dr gill who in his commentary on genesis very ably deduces the pedigree of the africans from afer and afra the descendants of abraham by keturah his wife and concubine for both these titles are applied to her it is also conformable to the sentiments of dr john clarke formerly dean of sarum in his truth of the christian religion both these authors concur in ascribing to us this original the reasonings of those gentlemen are still further confirmed by the scripture chronology and if any further corroboration were required this resemblance in so many respects is a strong evidence in support of the opinion like the israelites in their primitive state our government was conducted by our chiefs or judges our wise men and elders and the head of a family with us enjoyed a similar authority over his household with that which is ascribed to abraham and the other patriarchs the law of retaliation obtained almost universally with us as with them and even their religion appeared to have shed upon us a ray of its glory though broken and spent in its passage or eclipsed by the cloud with which time tradition and ignorance might have enveloped it for we had our circumcision a rule i believe peculiar to that people we had also our sacrifices and burntofferings our washings and purifications on the same occasions as they had  as to the difference of color between the eboan africans and the modern jews i shall not presume to account for it it is a subject which has engaged the pens of men of both genius and learning and is far above my strength the most able and reverend mr t clarkson however in his much admired essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species has ascertained the cause in a manner that at once solves every objection on that account and on my mind at least has produced the fullest conviction i shall therefore refer to that performance for the theory page     to      contenting myself with extricating a fact as related by dr mitchel philos trans no     sect   cited by mr clarkson p  0   the spaniards who have inhabited america under the torrid zone for any time are become as dark colored as our native indians of virginia of which i myself have been a witness there is also another instance same page of a portuguese settlement at mitomba a river in sierra leona where the inhabitants are bred from a mixture of the first portuguese discoverers with the natives and are now become in their complexion and in the woolly quality of their hair perfect negroes retaining however a smattering of the portuguese language  these instances and a great many more which might be adduced while they show how the complexions of the same persons vary in different climates it is hoped may tend also to remove the prejudice that some conceive against the natives of africa on account of their color surely the minds of the spaniards did not change with their complexions are there not causes enough to which the apparent inferiority of an african may be ascribed without limiting the goodness of god and supposing he forbore to stamp understanding on certainly his own image because carved in ebony might it not naturally be ascribed to their situation when they come among europeans they are ignorant of their language religion manners and customs are any pains taken to teach them these are they treated as men does not slavery itself depress the mind and extinguish all its fire and every noble sentiment but above all what advantages do not a refined people possess over those who are rude and uncultivated let the polished and haughty european recollect that his ancestors were once like the africans uncivilized and even barbarous did nature make them inferior to their sons and should they too have been made slaves every rational mind answers no let such reflections as these melt the pride of their superiority into sympathy for the wants and miseries of their sable brethren and compel them to acknowledge that understanding is not confined to feature or color if when they look round the world they feel exultation let it be tempered with benevolence to others and gratitude to god who has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on

to him with some account of the manners and customs of my country they had been implanted in me with great care and made an impression on my mind which time could not erase and which all the adversity and variety of fortune i have since experienced served only to rivet and record for whether the love of ones country be real or imaginary or a lesson of reason or an instinct of nature i still look back with pleasure on the first scenes of my life though that pleasure has been for the most part mingled with sorrow  i have already acquainted the reader with the time and place of my birth my father besides many slaves had a numerous family of which seven lived to grow up including myself and a sister who was the only daughter as i was the youngest of the sons i became of course the greatest favorite with my mother and was always with her and she used to take particular pains to form my mind i was trained up from my earliest years in the art of war my daily exercise was shooting and throwing javelins and my mother adorned me with emblems after the manner of our greatest warriors in this way i grew up till i was turned the age of eleven when an end was put to my happiness in the following manner  generally when the grown people in the neighborhood were gone far in the fields to labor the children assembled together in some of the neighbors premises to play and commonly some of us used to get up a tree to look out for any assailant or kidnapper that might come upon us for they sometimes took those opportunities of our parents absence to attack and carry off as many as they could seize one day as i was watching at the top of a tree in our yard i saw one of those people come into the yard of our next neighbor but one to kidnap there being many stout young people in it immediately on this i gave the alarm of the rogue and he was surrounded by the stoutest of them who entangled him with cords so that he could not escape till some of the grown people came and secured him but alas ere long it was my fate to be thus attacked and to be carried off when none of the grown people were nigh one day when all our people were gone out to their works as usual and only i and my dear sister were left to mind the house two men and a woman got over our walls and in a moment seized us both and without giving us time to cry out or make resistance they stopped our mouths and ran off with us into the nearest wood here they tied our hands and continued to carry us as far as they could till night came on when we reached a small house where the robbers halted for refreshment and spent the night we were then unbound but were unable to take any food and being quite overpowered by fatigue and grief our only relief was some sleep which allayed our misfortune for a short time the next morning we left the house and continued traveling all the day for a long time we had kept the woods but at last we came into a road which i believed i knew i had now some hopes of being delivered for we had advanced but a little way before i discovered some people at a distance on which i began to cry out for their assistance but my cries had no other effect than to make them tie me faster and stop my mouth and then they put me into a large sack they also stopped my sisters mouth and tied her hands and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the sight of these people when we went to rest the following night they offered us some victuals but we refused it and the only comfort we had was in being in one anothers arms all that night and bathing each other with our tears but alas we were soon deprived of even the small comfort of weeping together the next day proved a day of greater sorrow than i had yet experienced for my sister and i were then separated while we lay clasped in each others arms it was in vain that we besought them not to part us she was torn from me and immediately carried away while i was left in a state of distraction not to be described i cried and grieved continually and for several days did not eat any thing but what they forced into my mouth at length after many days traveling during which i had often changed masters i got into the hands of a chieftain in a very pleasant country this man had two wives and some children and they all used me extremely well and did all they could to comfort me particularly the first wife who was something like my mother although i was a great many days journey from my fathers house yet these people spoke exactly the same language with us this first master of mine as i may call him was a smith and my principal employment was working his bellows which were the same kind as i had seen in my vicinity they were in some respects not unlike the stoves here in gentlemens kitchens and were covered over with leather and in the middle of that leather a stick was fixed and a person stood up and worked it in the same manner as is done to pump water out of a cask with a hand pump i believe it was gold he worked for it was of a lovely bright yellow color and was worn by the women on their wrists and ancles i was there i suppose about a month and they at last used to trust me some little distance from the house this liberty i used in embracing every opportunity to inquire the way to my own home and i also sometimes for the same purpose went with the maidens in the cool of the evenings to bring pitchers of water from the springs for the use of the house i had also remarked where the sun rose in the morning and set in the evening as i had traveled along and i had observed that  fathers house was toward the rising of the sun i therefore determined to seize the first opportunity of making my escape and to shape my course for that quarter for i was quite oppressed and weighed down by grief after my mother and friends and my love of liberty ever great was strengthened by the mortifying circumstance of not daring to eat with the freeborn children although i was mostly their companion while i was projecting my escape one day an unlucky event happened which quite disconcerted my plan and put an end to my hopes i used to be sometimes employed in assisting an elderly woman slave to cook and take care of the poultry and one morning while i was feeding some chickens i happened to toss a small pebble at one of them which hit it on the middle and directly killed it the old slave having soon after missed the chicken inquired after it and on my relating the accident for i told her the truth because my mother would never suffer me to tell a lie she flew into a violent passion threatened that i should suffer for it and my master being out she immediately went and told her mistress what i had done this alarmed me very much and i expected an instant flogging which to me was uncommonly dreadful for i had seldom been beaten at home i therefore resolved to fly and accordingly i ran into a thicket that was hard by and hid myself in the bushes soon afterward my mistress and the slave returned and not seeing me they searched all the house but not finding me and i not making answer when they called to me they thought i ad run away and the whole neighborhood was raised in the pursuit of me in that part of the country as in ours the houses and villages were skirted with woods or shrubberies and the bushes were so thick that a man could readily conceal himself in them so as to elude the strictest search the neighbors continued the whole day looking for me and several times many of them came within a few yards of the place where i lay hid i expected every moment when i heard a rustling among the trees to be found out and punished by my master but they never discovered me though they were often so near that i even heard their conjectures as they were looking about for me and i now learned from them that any attempt to return home would be hopeless most of them supposed i had fled toward home but the distance was so great and the way so intricate that they thought i could never reach it and that i should be lost in the woods when i heard this i was seized with a violent panie and abandoned myself to despair night too began to approach and aggravated all my fears i had before entertained hopes of getting home and had determined when it should be dark to make the attempt but i was now convinced it was fruitless and began to consider that if possibly i could escape all other animals i could not those of the human kind and that not knowing the way i must perish in the woods thus was i like the hunted deer  every leaf and every whispering breath conveyed a foe and every foe a death   i heard frequent rustlings among the leaves and being pretty sure they were snakes i expected every instant to be stung by them this increased my anguish and the horror of my situation became now quite insupportable i at length quitted the thicket very saint and hungry for i had not eaten or drank any thing all the day and crept to my masters kitchen from whence i set out at first and which was an open shed and laid myself down in the ashes with an anxious wish for death to relieve me from all my pains i was scarcely awake in the morning when the old woman slave who was the first up came to light the fire and saw me in the fire place she was very much surprised to see me and could scarcely believe her own eyes she now promised to intercede for me and went for her master who soon after came and having slightly reprimanded me ordered me to be taken care of and not ill treated  soon after this my masters only daughter and child by his first wife sickened and died which affected him so much that for some time he was almost frantic and really would have killed himself had he not been watched and prevented however in a small time afterward he recovered and i was again sold i was now carried to the left of the suns rising through many dreary wastes and dismal woods amidst the hideous roarings of wild beasts the people i was sold to used to carry me very often when i was tired either on their shoulders or on their backs i saw many convenient well built sheds along the road at proper distances to accommodate the merchants and travelers who lay in those buildings along with their wives who often accompany them and they always go well armed  from the time i left my own nation i always found somebody that understood me till i came to the sea coast the languages of different nations did not totally differ nor were they so copious as those of the europeans particularly the english they were therefore easily learned and while i was journeying thus through africa i acquired two or three different tongues in this manner i had been traveling for a considerable time when one evening to my great surprise whom should i see brought to the house where i was but my dear sister as soon as she saw me she gave a loud shriek and ran into my arms  i was quite overpowered neither of us could speak but for a considerable time clung to each other in mutual embraces unable to do any thing but weep our meeting affected all who saw us and indeed i must acknowledge in honor of those sable destroyers of human rights that i never met with any ill treatment or saw any offered to their slaves except tying them when necessary to keep them from running away when these people knew we were brother and sister they indulged us to be together and the man to whom i supposed we belonged lay with us he in the middle while she and i held one another by the hands across his breast all night and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes in the joy of being together but even this small comfort was scon to have an end for scarcely had the fatal morning appeared when she was again torn from me for ever i was now more miserable if possible than before the small relief which her presence gave me from pain was gone and the wretchedness of my situation was redoubled by my anxiety after her fate and my apprehensions lest her sufferings should be greater than mine when i could not be with her to alleviate them yes thou dear partner of all my childish sports thou sharer of my joys and sorrows happy should i have ever esteemed myself to encounter every misery for you and to procure your freedom by the sacrifice of my own though you were early forced from my arms your image has been always rivetted in my heart from which neither time nor fortune have been able to remove it so that while the thoughts of your sufferings have damped my prosperity they have mingled with adversity and increased its bitterness to that heaven which protects the weak from the strong i commit the care of your innocence and virtues if they have not already received their full reward and if your youth and delicacy have not long since fallen victims to the violence of the african trader the pestilential stench of a guinea ship the seasoning in the european colonies or the lash and lust of a brutal and unrelenting overseer  i did not long remain after my sister i was again sold and carried through a number of places till after traveling a considerable time i came to a town called tinmah in the most beautiful country i had yet seen in africa it was extremely rich and there were many rivulets which flowed through it and supplied a large pond in the center of the town where the people washed here i first saw and tasted cocoa nuts which i thought superior to any nuts i had ever tasted before and the trees which were loaded were also interspersed amongst the houses which had commodious shades adjoining and were in the same manner as ours the insides being neatly plastered and whitewashed here i also saw and tasted for the first time sugarcane their money consisted of little white shells the size of the finger nail i was sold here for one hundred and seventytwo of them by a merchant who lived and brought me there i had been about two or three days at his house when a wealthy widow a neighbor of his came there one evening and brought with her an only son a young gentleman about my own age and size here they saw me and having taken a fancy to me i was bought of the merchant and went home with them her house and premises were situated close to one of those rivulets i have mentioned and were the finest i ever saw in africa they were very extensive and she had a number of slaves to attend her the next day i was washed and perfumed and when mealtime came i was led into the presence of my mistress and eat and drank before her with her son this filled me with astonishment and i could scarce help expressing my surprise that the young gentleman should suffer me who was bound to eat with him who was free and not only so but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till i had taken first because i was the eldest which was agreeable to our custom indeed every thing here and all their treatment of me made me forget that i was a slave the language of these people resembled ours so nearly that we understood each other perfectly they had also the very same customs as we there were likewise slaves daily to attend us while my young master and i with other boys sported with our darts and bows and arrows as i had been used to do at home in this resemblance to my former happy state i passed about two months and i now began to think i was to be adopted into the family and was beginning to be reconciled to my situation and to forget by degrees my misfortunes when all at once the delusion vanished for without the least previous knowledge one morning early while my dear master and companion was still asleep i was awakened out of my reverie to fresh sorrow and hurried away even amongst the uncircumcised  thus at the very moment i dreamed of the greatest happiness i found myself most miserable and it seemed as if fortune wished to give me this taste of joy only to render the reverse more poignant the change i now experienced was as painful as it was sudden and unexpected it was a change indeed from a state of bliss to a scene which is inexpressible by me as it discovered to me an element i had never before beheld and till then had no idea of and wherein such instances of hardship and cruelty continually occurred as i can never reflect on but with horror  all the nations and people i had hitherto passed through resembled our own in their manners customs and language but i came at length to a country the inhabitants of which differed from us in all those particulars i was very much struck with this difference especially when i came among a people who did not circumcise and eat without washing their hands they cooked also in iron pots and had european cutlasses and cross bows which were unknown to us and fought with their fists amongst themselves their women were not so modest as ours for they eat and drank and slept with their men but above all i was amazed to see no sacrifices or offerings among them in some of those places the people ornamented themselves with scars and likewise filed their teeth very sharp they wanted sometimes to ornament me in the same manner but i would not suffer them hoping that i might some time be among a people who did not thus disfigure themselves as i thought they did at last i came to the banks of a large river which was covered with canoes in which the people appeared to live with their household utensils and provisions of all kinds i was beyond measure astonished at this as i had never before seen any water larger than a pond or a rivulet and my surprise was mingled with no small fear when i was put into one of these canoes and we began to paddle and move along the river we continued going on thus till night and when we came to land and made fires on the banks each family by themselves some dragged their canoes on shore others stayed and cooked in theirs and laid in them all night those on the land had mats of which they made tents some in the shape of little houses in these we slept and after the morning meal we embarked again and proceeded as before i was often very much astonished to see some of the women as well as the men jump into the water dive to the bottom come up again and swim about thus i continued to travel sometimes by land sometimes by water through different countries and various nations till at the end of six or seven months after i had been kidnapped i arrived at the sea coast it would be tedious and uninteresting to relate all the incidents which befell me during this journey and which i have not yet forgotten of the various hands i passed through and the manners and customs of all the different people among whom i lived i shall therefore only observe that in all the places where i was the soil was exceedingly rich the pomkins aedas plantains yams etc etc were in great abundance and of incredible size there were also vast quantities of different gums though not used for any purpose and every where a great deal of tobacco the cotton even grew quite wild and there was plenty of redwood i saw no mechanics whatever in all the way except such as i have mentioned the chief employment in all these countries was agriculture and both the males and females as with us were brought up to it and trained in the arts of war  the first object which saluted my eyes when i arrived on the coast was the sea and a slave ship which was then riding at anchor and waiting for its cargo these filled me with astonishment which was soon converted into terror when i was carried on board i was immediately handled and tossed up to see if i were sound by some of the crew and i was now persuaded that i had gotten into a world of bad spirits and that they were going to kill me their complexions too differing so much from ours their long hair and the language they spoke which was very different from any i had ever heard united to confirm me in this belief indeed such were the horrors of my views and fears at the moment that if ten thousand world had been my own i would have freely parted with them all to have exchanged my condition with that of the meanest slave in my own country when i looked round the ship too and saw a large furnace or copper boiling and a multitude of black people of every description chained together every one of their countenances expressing dejection and sorrow i no longer doubted of my fate and quite overpowered with horror and anguish i fell motionless on the deck and fainted when i recovered a little i found some black people about me who i believed were some of those who brought me on board and had been receiving their pay they talked to me in order to cheer me but all in vain i asked them if we were not to be eaten by those white men with horrible looks red faces and long hair they told me i was not and one of the crew brought me a small portion of spirituous liquor in a wine glass but being afraid of him i would not take it out of his hand one of the blacks therefore took it from him and gave it to me and i took a little down my palate which instead of reviving me as they thought it would threw me into the greatest consternation at the strange feeling it produced having never tasted any such liquor before soon after this the blacks who brought me on board went off and left me abandoned to despair i now saw myself deprived of all chance of returning to my native country or even the least glimpse of hope of gaining the shore which i now considered as friendly and i even wished for my former slavery in preference to my present situation which was filled with horrors of every kind still heightened by my ignorance of what i was to undergo i was not long suffered to indulge my grief i was soon put down under the decks and there i received such a salutation in my nostrils as i had never experienced in my life so that with the loathsomeness of the stench and crying together i became so sick and low that i was not able to eat nor had i the least desire to taste any thing i now wished for the last friend death to relieve me but soon to my grief two of the white men offered me eatables and on my refusing to eat one of them held me fast by the hands and laid me across i think the windlass and tied my feet while the other flogged me severely i had never experienced any thing of this kind before and although not being used to the water i naturally feared that element the first time i saw it yet nevertheless could i have got over the nettings i would have jumped over the side but i could not and besides the crew used to watch us very closely who were not chained down to the decks lest we should leap into the water and i have seen some of these poor african prisoners most severely cut for attempting to do so and hourly whipped for not eating this indeed was often the case with myself in a little time after amongst the poor chained men i found some of my own nation which in a small degree gave ease to my mind i inquired of these what was to be done with us they gave me to understand we were to be carried to these white peoples country to work for them i then was a little revived and thought if it were no worse than working my situation was not so desperate but still i feared i should be put to death the white people looked and acted as i thought in so savage a manner for i had never seen among any people such instances of brutal cruelty and this not only shown toward us blacks but also to some of the whites themselves one white man in particular i saw when we were permitted to be on deck flogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast that he died in consequence of it and they tossed him over the side as they would have done a brute this made me fear these people the more and i expected nothing less than to be treated in the same manner i could not help expressing my fears and apprehensions to some of my countrymen i asked them if these people had no country but lived in this hollow place the ship they told me they did not but came from a distant one then said i how comes it in all our country we never heard of them they told me because they lived so very far off i then asked where were their women had they any like themselves i was told they had and why said i do we not see them they answered because they were left behind i asked how the vessel could go they told me they could not tell but that there were cloth put upon the masts by the help of the ropes i saw and then the vessel went on and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the water when they liked in order to stop the vessel i was exceedingly amazed at this account and really thought they were spirits i therefore wished much to be from amongst them for i expected they would sacrifice me but my wishes were vain for we were so quartered that it was impossible for any of us to make our escape while we stayed on the coast i was mostly on deck and one day to my great astonishment i saw one of these vessels coming in with the sails up as soon as the whites saw it they gave a great shout at which we were amazed and the more so as the vessel appeared larger by approaching nearer at last she came to an anchor in my sight and when the anchor was let go i and my countrymen who saw it were lost in astonishment to observe the vessel stop and were now convinced it was done by magic soon after this the other ship got her boats out and they came on board of us and the people of both ships seemed very glad to see each other several of the strangers also shook hands with us black people and made motions with their hands signifying i suppose we were to go to their country but we did not understand them at last when the ship we were in had got in all her cargo they made ready with many fearful noises and we were all put under deck so that we could not see how they managed the vessel but this disappointment was the least of my sorrow the stench of the hold while we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome that it was dangerous to remain there for any time and some of us had been permitted to stay on the deck for the fresh air but now that the whole ships cargo were confined together it became absolutely pestilential the closeness of the place and the heat of the climate added to the number in the ship which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself almost suffocated us this produced copious perspirations so that the air soon became unfit for respiration from a variety of loathsome smells and brought on a sickness among the slaves of which many died thus falling victims to the improvident avarice as i may call it of their purchasers this wretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains now become insupportable and the filth of the necessary tubs into which the children often fell and were almost suffocated the shrieks of the women and the groans of the dying rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable happily perhaps for myself i was soon reduced so low here that it was thought necessary to keep me almost always ondeck and from my extreme youth i was not put in fetters in this situation i expected every hour to share the fate of my companions some of whom were almost daily brought upon deck at the point of death which i began to hope would soon put an end to my miseries often did i think many of the inhabitants of the deep much more happy than myself i envied them the freedom they enjoyed and as often wished i could change my condition for theirs every circumstance i met with served only to render my state more painful and heighten my apprehensions and my opinion of the cruelty of the whites one day they had taken a number of fishes and when they had killed and satisfied themselves with as many as they thought fit to our astonishment who were on the deck rather than give any of them to us to eat as we expected they tossed the remaining fish into the sea again although we begged and prayed for some as well as we could but in vain and some of my countrymen being pressed by hunger took an opportunity when they thought no one saw them of trying to get a little privately but they were discovered and the attempt procured them some very severe floggings one day when we had a smooth sea and moderate wind two of my wearied countrymen who were chained together i was near them at the time preferring death to such a life of misery somehow made through the nettings and jumped into the sea immediately another quite dejected fellow who on account of his illness was suffered to be out of irons also followed their example and i believe many more would very soon have done the same if they had not been prevented by the ships crew who were instantly alarmed those of us that were the most active were in a moment put down under the deck and there was such a noise and confusion amongst the people of the ship as i never heard before to stop her and get the boat out to go after the slaves however two of the wretches were drowned but they got the other and afterward flogged him unmercifully for thus attempting to prefer death to slavery in this manner we continued to undergo more hardships than i can now relate hardships which are inseparable from this accursed trade many a time we were near suffocation from the want of fresh air which we were often without for whole days together this and the stench of the necessary tubs carried off many during our passage i first saw flying fishes which surprised me very much they used frequently to fly across the ship and many of them fell on the deck i also now first saw the use of the quadrant i had often with astonishment seen the mariners make observations with it and i could not think what it meant they at last took notice of my surprise and one of them willing to increase it as well as to gratify my curiosity made me one day look through it the clouds appeared to me to be land which disappeared as they passed along this heightened my wonder and i was now more persuaded than ever that i was in another world and that every thing about me was magic at last we came in sight of the island of barbados at which the whites on board gave a great shout and made many signs of joy to us we did not know what to think of this but as the vessel drew nearer we plainly saw the harbor and other ships of different kinds and sizes and we soon anchored amongst them off bridge town many merchants and planters now came on board though it was in the evening they put us in separate parcels and examined us attentively they also made us jump and pointed to the land signifying we were to go there we thought by this we should be eaten by these ugly men as they appeared to us and when soon after we were all put down under the deck again there was much dread and trembling among us and nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from these apprehensions insomuch that at last the white people got some old slaves from the land to pacify us they told us we were not to be eaten but to work and were soon to go on land where we should see many of our country people this report eased us much and sure enough soon after we were landed there came to us africans of all languages we were conducted immediately to the merchants yard where we were all pent up together like so many sheep in a fold without regard to sex or age as every object was new to me every thing i saw filled me with surprise what struck me first was that the houses were built with bricks and stories and in every other respect different from those i had seen in africa but i was still more astonished on seeing people on horseback i did not know what this could mean and indeed i thought these people were full of nothing but magical arts while i was in this astonishment one of my fellow prisoners spoke to a countryman of his about the horses who said they were the same kind they had in their country i understood them though they were from a distant part of africa and i thought it odd i had not seen any horses there but afterward when i came to converse with different africans i found they had many horses amongst them and much larger than those i then saw we were not many days in the merchants custody before we were sold after their usual manner which is this  on a signal given as the beat of a drum the buyers rush at once into the yard where the slaves are confined and make choice of that parcel they like best the noise and clamor with which this is attended and the eagerness visible in the countenances of the buyers serve not a little to increase the apprehension of the terrified africans who may well be supposed to consider them as the ministers of that destruction to which they think themselves devoted in this manner without scruple are relations and friends separated most of them never to see each other again i remember in the vessel in which i was brought over in the mens apartment there were several brothers who in the sale were sold in different lots and it was very moving on this occasion to see and hear their cries at parting o ye nominal christians might not an african ask you learned you this from your god who says unto you do unto all men as you would men should do unto you is it not enough that we are torn from our country and friends to toil for your luxury and lust of gain must every tender feeling be likewise sacrificed to your avarice are the dearest friends and relations now rendered more dear by their separation from their kindred still to be parted from each other and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of slavery with the small comsort of being together and mingling their sufferings and sorrows why are parents to lose their children brothers their sisters or husbands their wives surely this is a new refinement in cruelty which while it has no advantage to atone for it thus aggravates distress and adds fresh horrors even to the wretchedness of slavery

boscawen in       i now totally lost the small remains of comfort i had enjoyed in conversing with my countrymen the women too who used to wash and take care of me were all gone different ways and i never saw one of them afterward  i stayed in this island for a few days i believe it could not be above a fortnight when i and some few more slaves that were not saleable amongst the rest from very much fretting were shipped off in a sloop for north america on the passage we were better treated than when we were coming from africa and we had plenty of rice and fat pork we were landed up a river a good way from the sea about virginia county where we saw few or none of our native africans and not one soul who could talk to me i was a few weeks weeding grass and gathering stones in a plantation and at last all my companions were distributed different ways and only myself was left i was now exceedingly miserable and thought myself worse off than any of the rest of my companions for they could talk to each other but i had no person to speak to that i could understand in this state i was constantly grieving and pining and wishing for death rather than any thing else while i was in this plantation the gentleman to whom i suppose the estate belonged being unwell i was one day sent for to his dwelling house to fan him when i came into the room where he was i was very much affrighted at some things i saw and the more so as i had seen a black woman slave as i came through the house who was cooking the dinner and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines she had one particularly on her head which locked her mouth so fast that she could scarcely speak and could not eat nor drink i was much astonished and shocked at this contrivance which i afterward learned was called the iron muzzle soon after i had a fan put into my hand to fan the gentleman while he slept and so i did indeed with great fear while he was fast asleep i indulged myself a great deal in looking about the room which to me appeared very fine and curious the first object that engaged my attention was a watch which hung on the chimney and was going i was quite surprised at the noise it made and was afraid it would tell the gentleman any thing i might do amiss and when i immediately after observed a picture hanging in the room which appeared constantly to look at me i was still more affrighted having never seen such things as these before at one time i thought it was something relative to magic and not seeing it move i thought it might be some way the whites had to keep their great men when they died and offer them libations as we used to do to our friendly spirits in this state of anxiety i remained till my master awoke when i was dismissed out of the room to my no small satisfaction and relief for i thought that these people were all made up of wonders in this place i was called jacob but on board the african snow i was called michael i had been some time in this miserable forlorn and much dejected state without having any one to talk to which made my life a burden when the kind and unknown hand of the creator who in very deed leads the blind in a way they know not now began to appear to my comfort for one day the captain of a merchant ship called the industrious be came on some business to my masters house this gentleman whose name was michael henry pascal was a lieutenant in the royal navy but now commanded this trading ship which was somewhere in the confines of the county many miles off while he was at my masters house it happened that he saw me and like me so well that he made a purchase of me i think i have often heard him say he gave thirty or forty pounds sterling for me but i do not now remember which however he meant me for a present to some of his friends in england and i was sent accordingly from the house of my then master one mr campbell to the place where the ship lay i was conducted on horseback by an elderly black man a mode of traveling which appeared very odd to me when i arrived i was carried on board a fine large ship loaded with tobacco etc and just ready to sail for england i now thought my condition much mended i had sails to lie on and plenty of good victuals to eat and every body on board used me very kindly quite contrary to what i had seen of any white people before i therefore began to think that they were not all of the same disposition a few days after i was on board we sailed for england i was still at a loss to conjecture my destiny by this time however i could smatter a little imperfect english and i wanted to know as well as i could where we were going some of the people of the ship used to tell me they were going to carry me back to my own country and this made me very happy i was qui e rejoiced at the idea of going back and thought if i should get home what wonders i should have to tell but i was reserved for another fate and was soon undeceived when we came within sight of the english coast while i was on board this ship my captain and master named me gustavus vasa i at that time began to understand him a little and refused to be called so and told him as well as i could that i would be called jacob but he said i should not and still called me gustavus and when i resused to answer to my new name which at first i did it gained me many a cuff so at length i submitted and by which i have been known ever since the ship had a very long passage and on that account we had very short allowance of provisions toward the last we had only one pound and a half of bread per week and about the same quantity of meat and one quart of water a day we spoke with only one vessel the whole time we were at sea and but once we caught a few fishes in our extremities the captain and people told me in jest they would kill and eat me but i thought them in earnest and was depressed beyond measure expecting every moment to be my last while i was in this situation one evening they caught with a good deal of trouble a large shark and got it on board this gladdened my poor heart exceedingly as i thought it would serve the people to eat instead of their eating me but very soon to my astonishment they cut off a small part of the tail and tossed the rest over the side this renewed my consternation and i did not know what to think of these white people though i very much feared they would kill and eat me there was on board the ship a young lad who had never been at sea before about four or five years older than myself his name was richard baker he was a native of america had received an excellent education and was of a most amiable temper soon after i went on board he showed me a great deal of partiality and attention and in return i grew extremely fond of him we at length became inseparable and for the space of two years he was of very great use to me and was my constant companion and instructor although this dear youth had many slaves of his own yet he and i have gone through many sufferings together on shipboard and we have many nights lain in each others bosoms when we were in great distress thus such a friendship was cemented between us as we cherished till his death which to my very great sorrow happened in the year      when he was up the archipelago on board his majestys ship the preston an event which i have never ceased to regret as i lost at once a kind interpreter an agreeable companion and a faithful friend who at the age of fifteen discovered a mind superior to prejudice and who was not ashamed to notice to associate with and to be the friend and instructor of one who was ignorant a stranger of a different complexion and a slave my master had lodged in his mothers house in america he respected him very much and made him always eat with him in the cabin he used often to tell him jocularly that he would kill and eat me sometimes he would say to me  the black people were not good to eat and would ask me if we did not eat people in my country i said no then he said he would kill dick as he always called him first and afterward me though this hearing relieved my mind a little as to myself i was alarmed for dick and whenever he was called i used to be very much afraid he was to be killed and i would peep and watch to see if they were going to kill him nor was i free from this consternation till we made the land one night we lost a man overboard and the cries and noise were so great and confused in stopping the ship that i who did not know what was the matter began as usual to be very much afraid and to think they were going to make an offering with me and perform some magic which i still believed they dealt in as the waves were very high i thought the ruler of the seas was angry and i expected to be offered up to appease him this filled my mind with agony and i could not any more that night close my eyes again to rest however when daylight appeared was a little eased in my mind but still every time i was called i used to think it was to be killed some time after this we saw some very large fish which i afterward found were called grampusses they looked to me extremely terrible and made their appearance just at dusk and were so near as to blow the water on the ships deck i believed them to be the rulers of the sea and as the white people did not make any offerings at any time i thought they were angry with them and at last what confirmed my belief was the wind just then died away and a calm ensued and in consequence of it the ship stopped going i supposed that the fish had performed this and i hid myself in the fore part of the ship through fear of being offered up to appease them every minute peeping and quaking but my good friend dick came shortly toward me and i took an opportunity to ask him as well as i could what these fish were not being able to talk much english i could but just make him understand my question and not at all when i asked him if any offerings were to be made to them however he told me these fish would swallow any body which sufficiently alarmed me here he was called away by the captain who was leaning over the quarter deck railing and looking at the fish and most of the people were busied in getting a barrel of pitch to light for them to play with the captain now called me to him having learned some of my apprehensions from dick and having diverted himself and others for some time with my fears which appeared ludicrous enough in my crying and trembling he dismissed me the barrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the side into the water by this time it was just dark and the fish went after it and to my great joy i saw them no more  however all my alarms began to subside when we got sight of land and at last the ship arrived at falmouth after a passage of thirteen weeks every heart on board seemed gladdened on our reaching the shore and none more than mine the captain immediately went on shore and sent on board some fresh provisions which we wanted very much we made good use of them and our samine was soon turned into feasting almost without ending it was about the beginning of the spring      when i arrived in england and i was near twelve years of age at that time i was very much struck with the buildings and the pavement of the streets in falmouth and indeed every object i saw filled me with new surprise one morning when i got upon deck i saw it covered all over with the snow that fell overnight as i had never seen any thing of the kind before i thought it was salt so i immediately ran down to the mate and desired him as well as i could to come and see how somebody in the night had thrown salt all over the deck he knowing what it was desired me to bring some of it down to him accordingly i took up a handful of it which i found very cold indeed and when i brought it to him he desired me to taste it i did so and i was surprised beyond measure i then asked him what it was he told me it was snow but i could not in anywise understand him he asked me if we had no such thing in my country and i told him no i then asked him the use of it and who made it he told me a great man in the heavens called god but here again i was to all intents and purposes at a loss to understand him and the more so when a little after i saw the air filled with it in a heavy shower which fell down on the same day after this i went to church and having never been at such a place before i was again amazed at seeing and hearing the service i asked all i could about it and they gave me to understand it was worshipping god who made us and all things i was still at a great loss and soon got into an endless field of inquiries as well as i was able to speak and ask about things however my little friend dick used to be my best interpreter for i could make free with him and he always instructed me with pleasure and from what i could understand by him of this god and in seeing these white people did not sell one another as we did i was much pleased and in this i thought they were much happier than we africans i was astonished at the wisdom of the white people in all things i saw but was amazed at their not sacrificing or making any offerings and eating with unwashed hands and touching the dead i likewise could not help remarking the particular slenderness of their women which i did not at first like and i thought they were not so modest and shamefaced as the african women  i had often seen my master and dick employed in reading and i had a great curiosity to talk to the books as i thought they did and so to learn how all things had a beginning for that purpose i have often taken up a book and have talked to it and then put my ears to it when alone in hopes it would answer me and i have been very much concerned when i found it remained silent  my master lodged at the house of a gentleman in falmouth who had a fine little daughter about six or seven years of age and she grew prodigiously fond of me insomuch that we used to eat together and had servants to wait on us i was so much caressed by this family that it often reminded me of the treatment i had received from my little noble african master after i had been here a few days i was sent on board of the ship but the child cried so much aster me that nothing could pacify her till i was sent for again it is ludicrous enough that i began to fear i should be betrothed to this young lady and when my master asked me if i would stay there with her behind him as he was going away with the ship which had taken in the tobacco again i cried immediately and said i would not leave him at last by stealth one night i was sent on board the ship again and in a little time we sailed for guernsey where she was in part owned by a merchant one nicholas doberry as i was now amongst a people who had not their faces scarred like some of the african nations where i had been i was very glad i did not let them ornament me in that manner when i was with them when we arrived at guernsey my master placed me to board and lodge with one of his mates who had a wife and family there and some months afterward he went to england and left me in care of this mate together with my friend dick this mate had a little daughter aged about five or six years with whom i used to be much delighted i had often observed that when her mother washed her face it looked very rosy but when she washed mine it did not look so i therefore tried oftentimes myself if i could not by washing make my face of the same color as my little playmate mary but it was all in vain and i now began to be mortified at the difference in our complexions this woman behaved to me with great kindness and attention and taught me every thing in the same manner as she did her own child and indeed in every respect treated me as such i remained here till the summer of the year      when my master being appointed first lieutenant of his majestys ship the roebuck sent for dick and me and his old mate on this we all left guernsey and set out for england in a sloop bound for london as we were coming up toward the nore where the roebuck lay a man of wars boat came alongside to press our people on which each man ran to hide himself i was very much frightened at this though i did not know what it meant or what to think or do however i went and hid myself also under a hencoop immediately afterward the pressgang came on board with their swords drawn and searched all about pulled the people out by force and put them into the boat at last i was found out also the man that found me held me up by the heels while they all made their sport of me i roaring and crying out all the time most lustily but at last the mate who was my conductor seeing this came to my assistance and did all he could to pacify me but all to very little purpose till i had seen the boat go off soon afterward we came to the nore where the roebuck lay and to our great joy my master came on board to us and brought us to the ship when i went on board this large ship i was amazed indeed to see the quantity of men and the guns however my surprise began to diminish as my knowledge increased and i ceased to feel those apprehensions and alarms which had taken such strong possession of me when i first came among the europeans and for some time after i began now to pass to an opposite extreme i was so far from being afraid of any thing new which i saw that after i had been some time in this ship i even began to long for an engagement my griefs too which in young minds are not perpetual were now wearing away and i soon enjoyed myself pretty well and felt tolerably easy in my present situation there was a number of boys on board which still made it more agreeable for we were always together and a great part of our time was spent in play i remained in this ship a considerable time during which we made several cruises and visited a variety of places among others we were twice in holland and brought over several persons of distinction from it whose names i do not now remember on the passage one day for the diversion of those gentlemen all the boys were called on the quarter deck and were paired proportionably and then made to fight after which the gentlemen gave the combatants from five to nine shillings each this was the first time i ever fought with a white boy and i never knew what it was to have a bloody nose before this made me fight most desperately i suppose considerably more than an hour and at last both of us being weary we were parted i had a great deal of this kind of sport afterward in which the captain and the ships company used very much to encourage me sometime afterward the ship went to leith in scotland and from thence to the orkneys where i was surprised in seeing scarcely any night and from thence we sailed with a great fleet full of soldiers for england all this time we had never come to an engagement though we were frequently cruising off the coast of france during which we chased many vessels and took in all seventeen prizes i had been learning many of the maneuvers of the ship during our cruise and i was several times made to fire the guns one evening off havre de grace just as it was growing dark we were standing off shore and met with a fine large frenchbuilt frigate we got all things immediately ready for fighting and i now expected i should be gratified in seeing an engagement which i had so long wished for in vain but the very moment the word of command was given to fire we heard those on board the other ship cry haul down the jib and in that instant she hoisted english colors there was instantly with us an amazing cry of  avast or stop firing and i think one or two guns had been let off but happily they did no mischief we had hailed them several times but they not hearing we received no answer which was the cause of our firing the boat was then sent on board of her and she proved to be the ambuscade man of war to my nosmall disappointment we returned to portsmouth without having been in any action just at the trial of admiral byng whom i saw several times during it and my master having left the ship and gone to london for promotion dick and i were put on board the savage sloop of war and we went in her to assist in bringing off the st george man of war that had ran ashore somewhere on the coast after staying a few weeks on board the savage dick and i were sent on shore at deal where we remained some short time till my master sent for us to london the place i had long desired exceedingly to see we therefore both with great pleasure got into a wagon and came to london where we were received by a mr guerin a relation of my master this gentleman had two sisters very amiable ladies who took much notice and great care of me though i had desired so much to see london when i arrived in it i was unfortunately unable to gratify my curiosity for i had at this time the chilblains to such a degree that i could not stand for several months and i was obliged to be sent to st georges hospital there i grew so ill that the doctors wanted to cut my left leg off at different times apprehending a mortification but i always said i would rather die than suffer it and happily i thank god i recovered without the operation after being there several weeks and just as i had recovered the small pox broke out on me so that i was again confined and i thought myself now particularly unfortunate however i soon recovered again and by this time my master having been promoted to be first lieutenant of the preston man of war of fifty guns then new at deptford dick and i were sent on board her and soon after we went to holland to bring over the late duke of  to england  while i was in this ship an incident happened which though trifling i beg leave to relate as i could not help taking particular notice of it and considering it then as a judgment of god one morning a young man was looking up to the foretop and in a wicked tone common on shipboard d  d his eyes about something just at the moment some small particles of dirt fell into his left eye and by the evening it was very much inflamed the next day it grew worse and within six or seven days he lost it from this ship my master was appointed a lieutenant on board the royal george when he was going he wished me to stay on board the preston to learn the french horn but the ship being ordered for turkey i could not think of leaving my master to whom i was very warmly attached and i told him if he left me behind it would break my heart this prevailed on him to take me with him but he left dick on board the preston whom i embraced at parting for the last time the royal george was the largest ship i had ever seen so that when i came on board of her i was surprised at the number of people men women and children of every denomination and the largeness of the guns many of them also of brass which i had never seen before here were also shops or stalls of every kind of goods and people crying their different commodities about the ship as in a town to me it appeared a little world into which i was again cast with out a friend for i had no longer my dear companion dick we did not stay long here my master was not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to be sixth lieutenant of the namur which was then at spithead fitting up for vice admiral boscawen who was going with a large fleet on an expedition against louisburgh the crew of the royal george were turned over to her and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoisted on board the blue at the maintop gallant mast head there was a very great fleet of men of war of every description assembled together for this expedition and i was in hopes soon to have an opportunity of being gratified with a sea fight all things being now in readiness this mighty fleet for there was also admiral cornishs fleet in company destined for the east indies at last weighed anchor and failed the two fleets continued in company for several days and then parted admiral cornish in the lenox having first saluted our admiral in the namur which he returned we then steered for america but by contrary winds we were driven to teneriffe where i was struck with its noted peak its prodigious height and its form resembling a sugar loaf filled me with wonder we remained in sight of this island some days and then proceeded for america which we soon made and got into a very commodious harbor called st george in halifax where we had fish in great plenty and all other fresh provisions we were here joined by different men of war and transport ships with soldiers after which our fleet being increased to a prodigious number of ships of all kinds we sailed for cape breton in nova scotia we had the good and gallant general wolf on board our ship whose affability made him highly esteemed and beloved by all the men he often honored me as well as other boys with marks of his notice and saved me once a flogging for fighting with a young gentleman we arrived at cape breton in the summer of      and here the soldiers were to be landed in order to make an attack upon louisbourgh my master had some part in superintending the landing and here i was in a small measure gratified in seeing an encounter between our men and the enemy the french were posted on the shore to receive us and disputed our landing for a long time but at last they were driven from their trenches and a complete landing was effected our troops pursued them as far as the town of louisbourgh in this action many were killed on both sides one thing remarkable i saw this day  a lieutenant of the princess amelia ho as well as my master superintended  landing was giving the word of command and while his mouth was oper a musket ball went through it and passed out at his check i had that day in my hand the scalp of an indian king who was killed in the engagement the scalp had been taken off by an highlander i saw this kings ornaments too which were very curious and made of feathers  our land forces laid siege to the town of louisbourgh while the french men of war were blocked up in the harbor by the fleet the batteries at the same time playing upon them from the land this they did with such effect that one day i saw some of the ships set on fire by the shells from the batteries and i believe two or three of them were quite burnt at another time about fifty boats belonging to the english men of war commaded by captain george belfour of the aetna fire ship and mr laforey another junior captain attacked and boarded the only two remaining french men of war in the harbor they also set fire to a seventygun ship but a sixtyfour called the bienfaisant they brought off during my stay here i had often an opportunity of being near captain belfour who was pleased to notice me and liked me so much that he often asked my master to let him have me but he would not part with me and no consideration could have induced me to leave him at last louisbourgh was taken and the english men of war came into the harbor before it to my very great joy for i had now more liberty of indulging myself and i went often on shore when the ships were in the harbor we had the most beautiful procession on the water i ever saw all the admirals and captains of the men of war full dressed and in their barges well ornamented with pendants came alongside of the namur the vice admiral then went on shore in his barge followed by the other officers in order of seniority to take possession as i suppose of the town and fort some time after this the french governor and his lady and other persons of note came on board our ship to dine on this occasion our ships were dressed with colors of all kinds from the topgallantmast head to the deck and this with the firing of guns formed a most grand and magnificent spectacle  as soon as every thing here was settled admiral boscawen sailed with part of the fleet for england leaving some ships behind with rear admirals sir charles hardy and durell it was now winter and one evening during our passage home about dusk when we were in the channel or near soundings and were beginning to look for land we descried seven sail of large men of war which stood off shore several people on board of our ship said as the two fleets were in forty minutes from the first sight within hail of each other that they were english men of war and some of our people even began to name some of the ships by this time both fleets began to mingle and our admiral ordered his flag to be hoisted at that instant the other fleet which were french hoisted their ensigns and gave us a broadside as they passed by nothing could create greater surprise and confusion among us than this the wind was high the sea rough and we had our lower and middle deck guns housed in so that not a single gun on board was ready te be fired at any of the french ships however the royal william and the somerset being our sternmost ships became a little prepared and each gave the french ships a broadside as they passed by i afterward heard this was a french squadron commanded by mons conflans and certainly had the frenchmen known our condition and had a mind to fight us they might have done us great mischief but we were not long before we were prepared for an engagement immediately many things were tossed overboard the ships were made ready for fighting as soon as possible and about ten at night we had bent a new main sail the old one being split being now in readiness for fighting we wore ship and stood after the french fleet who were one or two ships in number more than we however we gave them chase and continued pursuing them all night and at daylight we saw six of them all large ships of the line and an english east indiaman a prize they had taken we chased them all day till between three and four oclock in the evening when we came up with and passed within a musket shot of one seventyfour gun ship and the indiaman also who now hoisted her colors but immediately hauled them down again on this we made a signal for the other ships to take possession of her and supposing the man of war would likewise strike we cheered but she did not though if we had fired into her from being so near we must have taken her to my utter surprise the somerset who was the next ship astern of the namur made way likewise and thinking they were sure of this french ship they cheered in the same manner but still continued to follow us the french commodore was about a gunshot ahead of all running from us with all speed and about four oclock he carried his foretopmast overboard this caused another loud cheer with us and a little after the topmast came close by us but to our great surprise instead of coming up with her we found she went as fast as ever if not faster the sea grew now much smoother and the wind lulling the seventyfour gun ship we had passed came again by us in the very same direction and so near that we heard her people talk as she went by yet not a shot was fired on either side and about five or six oclock just as it grew dark she joined her commodore we chased all night but the next day we were out of sight so that we saw no more of them and we only had the old indiaman called carnarvon i think for our trouble after this we stood in for the channel and soon made the land and about the close of the year       we got safe to st helens here the namur ran aground and also another large ship astern of us but by starting our water and tossing many things overboard to lighten her we got the ships off without any damage we stayed for a short time at spithead and then went into portsmouth harbor to refit from whence the admiral went to london and my master and i soon followed with a pressgang as we wanted some hands to complete our complement  chap iv the author is

became inured to that service and began to consider myself as happily situated for my master treated me always extremely well and my attachment and gratitude to him were very great from the various scenes i had beheld on shipboard i soon grew a stranger to terror of every kind and was in that respect at least almost an englishman i have often reflected with surprise that i never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous dangers i have been in that i was silled with at the first sight of the europeans and at every act of theirs even the most trifling when i first came among them and for some time afterward that fear however which was the effect of my ignorance wore away as i began to know them i could now speak english tolerably well and i perfectly understood every thing that was said i not only felt myself quite easy with these new countrymen but relished their society and manners i no longer looked upon them as spirits but as men superior to us and therefore i had the stronger desire to resemble them to imbibe their spirit and imitate their manners i therefore embraced every occasion of improvement and every new thing that i observed i treasured up in my memory i had long wished to be able to read and write and for this purpose i took every opportunity to gain instruction but had made as yet very little progress however when i went to london with my master i had soon an opportunity of improving myself which i gladly embraced shortly after my arrival he sent me to wait upon the miss guerins who had treated me with much kindness when i was there before and they sent me to school  while i was attending these ladies their servants told me i could not go to heaven unless i was baptized this made me very uneasy for i had now some faint idea of a future state accordingly i communicated my anxiety to the eldest miss guerin with whom i was become a favorite and pressed her to have me baptized when to my great joy she told me i should she had formerly asked my master to let me be baptized but he had refused however she now insisted on it and he being under some obligation to her brother complied with her request so i was baptized in st margarets church westminster in february      by my present name the clergyman at the same time gave me a book called a guide to the indians written by the bishop of sodor and man on this occasion miss guerin did me the honor to stand as godmother and afterward gave me a treat i used to attend these ladies about the town in which service i was extremely happy as i had thus many opportunities of seeing london which i desired of all things i was sometimes however with my master at his rendezvoushouse which was at the foot of westminsterbridge here i used to enjoy myself in playing about the bridge stairs and often in the watermens wherries with other boys on one of these occasions there was another boy with me in a wherry and we went out into the current of the river while we were there two more stout boys came to us in another wherry and abusing us for taking the boat desired me to get into the other wherryboat accordingly i went to get out of the wherry i was in but just as i had got one of my feet into the other boat the boys shoved it off so that i fell into the thames and not being able to swim i should unavoidably have been drowned but for the assistance of some watermen who providentially came to my relief  the namur being again got ready for sea my master with his gang was ordered on board and to my no small grief i was obliged to leave my schoolmaster whom i liked very much and always attended while i stayed in london to repair on board with my master nor did i leave my kind patronesses the miss guerins without uneasiness and regret they often used to teach me to read and took great pains to instruct me in the principles of religion and the knowledge of god i therefore parted from those amiable ladies with reluctance after receiving from them many friendly cautions how to conduct myself and some valuable presents  when i came to spithead i found we were destined for the mediterranean with a large fleet which was now ready to put to sea we only waited for the arrival of the admiral who soon came on board and about the beginning of the spring      having weighed anchor and got under way sailed for the mediterranean and in eleven days from the lands end we got to gibraltar while we were here i used to be often on shore and got various fruits in great plenty and very cheap  i had frequently told several people in my excursions on shore the story of my being kidnapped with my sister and of our being separated as i have related before and i had as often expressed my anxiety for her fate and my sorrow at having never met her again one day when i was on shore and mentioning these circumstances to some persons one of them told me he knew where my sister was and if i would accompany him he would bring me to her improbable as this story was i believed it immediately and agreed to go with him while my heart leaped for joy and indeed he conducted me to a black young woman who was so like my sister that at first sight i really thought it was her but i was quickly undeceived and on talking to her i found her to be of another nation  while we lay here the preston came in from the levant as soon as she arrived my master told me i should now see my old companion dick who was gone in her when she sailed for turkey i was much rejoiced at this news and expected every minute to embrace him and when the captain came on board of our ship which he did immediately after i ran to inquire after my friend but with inexpressible sorrow i learned from the boats crew that the dear youth was dead and that they had brought his chest and all his other things to my master these he afterward gave to me and i regarded them as a memorial of my friend whom i loved and grieved for as a brother  while we were at gibralter i saw a soldier hanging by the heels at one of the moles he had drowned himself in endeavoring to desert  i thought this a strange sight as i had seen a man hanged in london by his neck at another time i saw the master of a frigate towed to shore on a grating by several of the men of wars boats and discharged the fleet which i understood was a mark of disgrace for cowardice on board the same ship there was also a sailor hung up at the yardarm  after lying at gibralter for some time we sailed up the mediterranean a considerable way above the gulf of eyons where we were one night overtaken with a terrible gale of wind much greater than any i had ever yet experienced the sea ran so high that though all the guns were well housed there was great reason to fear their getting loose the ship rolled so much and if they had it must have proved our destruction after we had cruised here for a short time we came to barcelona a spanish seaport remarkable for its silk manufactures here the ships were all to be watered and my master who spoke different languages and used often to interpret for the admiral superintended the watering of ours for that purpose he and the officers of the other ships who were on the same service had tents pitched in the bay and the spanish soldiers were stationed along the shore i suppose to see that no depredations were committed by our men  i used constantly to attend my master and i was charmed with this place all the time we stayed it was like a fair with the natives who brought us fruits of all kinds and sold them to us much cheaper than i got them in england they used also to bring wine down to us in hog and sheep skins which diverted me very much the spanish officers here treated our officers with great politeness and attention and some of them in particular used to come often to my masters tent to visit him where they would sometimes divert themselves by mounting me on the horses or mules so that i could not fall and setting them off at full gallop my imperfect skill in horsemanship all the while affording them no small entertainment after the ships were watered we returned to our old station of cruizing off toulon for the purpose of intercepting a fleet of french men of war that lay there one sunday in our cruise we came off a place where there were two small french frigates lying in shore and our admiral thinking to take or destroy them sent two ships in after them  the culloden and the conqueror they soon came up to the frenchmen and i saw a smart fight here both by sea and land for the frigates were covered by batteries and they played upon our ships most furiously which they as furiously returned and for a long time a constant firing was kept up on all sides at an amazing rate at last one frigate sunk but the people escaped though not without much difficulty and a little after some of the people left the other frigate also which was a mere wreck however our ships did not venture to bring her away they were so much annoyed from the batteries which raked them both in going and coming their topmasts were shot away and they were otherwise so much shattered that the admiral was obliged to send in many boats to tow them back to the fleet i afterward sailed with a man who fought in one of the french batteries during the engagement and he told me our ships had done considerable mischief that day on shore and in the batteries  after this we sailed for gibraltar and arrived there about august      here we remained with all our sails unbent while the fleet was watering and doing other necessary things while we were in this situation one day the admiral with most of the principal officers and many people of all stations being on shore about seven oclock in the evening we were alarmed by signals from the frigates stationed for that purpose and in an instant there was a general cry that the french fleet was out and just passing through the streights the admiral immediately came on board with some other officers and it is impossible to describe the noise hurry and confusion throughout the whole fleet in bending their sails and slipping their cables many people and ships boats were left on shore in the bustle we had two captains on board of our ship who came away in the hurry and left their ships to follow we showed lights from the gunwales to the main top masthead and all our lieutenants were employed amongst the fleet to tell the ships not to wait for there captains but to put the sails to the yards slip their cables and follow us and in this confusion of making ready for fighting we set out for sea in the dark after the french fleet here i could have exclaimed with ajax oh jove o father if it be thy will that we must perish we thy will obey but let us perish by the light of day they had got the start of us so far that we were not able to come up with them during the night but at daylight we saw seven sail of the line of battle some miles ahead we immediately chased them till about four oclock in the evening when our ships came up with them and though we were about fifteen large ships our gallant admiral only fought them with his own division which consisted of seven so that we were just ship for ship we passed by the whole of the enemys fleet in order to come at their commander mons la clue who was in the ocean an eightyfour gun ship as we passed they all fired on us and at one time three of them fired together continuing to do so for some time notwithstanding which our admiral would not suffer a gun to be fired at any of them to my astonishment but made us lie on our bellies on the deck till we came quite close to the ocean who was ahead of them all when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers into her at once  the engagement now commenced with great fury on both sides the ocean immediately returned our fire and we continued engaged with each other for some time during which i was frequently stunned with the thundering of the great guns whose dreadful contents hurried many of my companions into awful eternity at last the french line was entirely broken and we obtained the victory which was immediately proclaimed with loud huzzas and acclamations we took three prizes la modeste of sixtyfour guns and le temeraire and centaur of seventyfour guns each the rest of the french ships took to flight with all the sail they could crowd our ship being very much damaged and quite disabled from pursuing the enemy the admiral immediately quitted her and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board the newark with which and some other ships he went after the french the ocean and another large french ship called the redoubtable endeavoring to escape ran ashore at cape logas on the coast of portugal and the french admiral and some of the crew got ashore but we finding it impossible to get the ships off set fire to them both about midnight i saw the ocean blow up with a most dreadful explosion i never beheld a more awful scene in less than a minute the midnight for a certain space seemed turned into day by the blaze which was attended with a noise louder and more terrible than thunder that seemed to rend every element around us  my station during the engagement was on the middledeck where i was quartered with another boy to bring powder to the aftermost gun and here i was a witness of the dreadful fate of many of my companions who in the twinkling of an eye were dashed in pieces and launched into eternity happily i escaped unhurt though the shot and splinters flew thick about me during the whole fight toward the latter part of it my master was wounded and i saw him carried down to the surgeon but though i was much alarmed for him and wished to assist him i dared not leave my post at this station my gunmate a partner in bringing powder for the same gun and i ran a very great risk for more than half an hour of blowing up the ship for when we had taken the cartridges out of the boxes the bottoms of many of them proving rotten the powder ran all about the deck near the match tub we scarcely had water enough at the last to throw on it we were also from our employment very much exposed to the enemys shots for we had to go through nearly the whole length of the ship to bring the powder i expected therefore every minute to be my last especially when i saw our men fall so thick about me but wishing to guard as much against the dangers as possible at first i thought it would be safest not to go for the powder till the frenchmen had fired the roadside and then while they were charging i could go and come wit powder but immediately afterward i thought this caution was fruitless and cheering myself with the reflection that there was a time allotted for to die as well as to be born i instantly cast off all fear or thought whatever of death and went through the whole of my duty with alacrity pleasing myself with the hope if i survived the battle of relating it and the dangers i had escaped to the miss guerins and others when i should return to london  our ship suffered very much in this engagement for besides the number of our killed and wounded she was almost torn to pieces and our rigging so much shattered that our mizenmast mainyard etc hung over the side of the ship so that we were obliged to get many carpenters and others from some of the ships of the fleet to assist in setting us in some tolerable order and notwithstanding which it took us some time before we were completely refitted after which we lest admiral broderick to command and we with the prizes steered for england on the passage and as soon as my master was something recovered of his wounds the admiral appointed him captain of the aetna fireship on which he and i left the namur and went on board of her at sea i liked this little ship very much i now became the captains steward in which situation i was very happy for i was extremely well treated by all on board and i had leisure to improve myself in reading and ing the latter i had learned a little of before i left the namur as there was a school on board when we arrived at spithead the aetna went into portsmouth harbor to refit which being done we returned to spichead and joined a large fleet that was thought to be intended against the havannah but about that time the king died whether that prevented the expedition i know not but it caused our ship to be stationed at cowes in the isle of wight till the beginning of the year sixtyone here i spent my time very pleasantly i was much on shore all about this delightful island and found the inhabitants very civil  while i was here i met with a trifling incident which surprised me agreeably i was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had a black boy about my own size this boy having observed me from his masters house was transported at the sight of one of his own countrymen and ran to meet me with the utmost haste i not knowing what he was about turned a little out of his way at first but to no purpose he soon came close to me and caught hold of me in his arms as if i had been his brother though we had never seen each other before after we had talked together for some time he took me to his masters house where i was treated very kindly this benevolent boy and i were very happy in frequently seeing each other till about the month of march      when our ship had orders to fit out again for another expedition when we got ready we joined a very large fleet at spithead commanded by commodore keppel which was destined against belleisle and with a number of transport ships with troops on board to make a descent on the place we sailed once more in quest of fame i longed to engage in new adventures and see fresh wonders  i had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impression and every event which i considered as mavelous every extraordinary escape or signal deliverance either of myself or others i looked upon to be effected by the interposition of providence we had not been above ten days at sea before an incident of this kind happened which whatever credit it may obtain from the reader made no small impression on my mind  we had on board a gunner whose name was john mondle a man of very indifferent morals this mans cabin was between the decks exactly over where i lay abreast of the quarter deck ladder one night the  th of april being terrified with a dream he awoke in so great a fright that he could not rest in his bed any longer nor even remain in his cabin and he went upon deck about four oclock in the morning extremely agitated he immediately told those on the deck of the agonies of his mind and the dream which occasioned it in which he said he had seen many things very awful and had been warned by st peter to repent who told him time was short this he said had greatly alarmed him and he was determined to alter his life people generally mock the fears of others when they are themselves in safety and some of his shipmates who heard him only laughed at him however he made a vow that he never would drink strong liquors again and he immediately got a light and gave away his seastores of liquor after which his agitation still continuing he began to read the scriptures hoping to find some relief and soon afterward he laid himself down again on his bed and endeavored to compose himself to sleep but to no purpose his mind still continuing in a state of agony by this time it was exactly half after seven in the morning i was then under the halfdeck at the great cabin door and all at once i heard the people in the waist cry out most fearfully  the lord have mercy upon us we are all lost the lord have mercy upon us mr mondle hearing the cries immediately ran out of his cabin and we were instantly struck by the lynne a fortygun ship captain clark which nearly ran us down this ship had just put about and was by the wind but had not got full headway or we must all have perished for the wind was brisk however before mr mondle had got four steps from his cabin door she struck our ship with her cutwater right in the middle of his bed and cabin and ran it up to the combings of the quarter deck hatchway and above three feet below water and in a minute there was not a bit of wood to be seen where mr mondles cabin stood and he was so near being killed that some of the splinters tore his face as mr mondle must inevitably have perished from this accident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way i have related i could not help regarding this as an awful interposition of providence for his preservation the two ships for some time swinged alongside of each other for ours being a fireship our grapplingirons caught the lynne every way and the yards and rigging went at an astonishing rate our ship was in such a shocking condition that we all thought she would instantly go down and every one ran for their lives and got as well as they could on board the lynne but our lieutenant being the aggressor he never quitted the ship however when we found she did not sink immediately the captain came on board again and encouraged our people to return and try to save her many on this came back but some would not venture some of the ships in the fleet seeing our situation immediately sent their boats to our assistance but it took us the whole day to save the ship with all their help and by using every possible means particularly frapping her together with many hawsers and putting a great quantity of tallow below water where she was damaged she was kept together but it was well we did not meet with any gales of wind or we must have gone to pieces for we were in such a crazy condition that we had ships to attend us till we arrived at belleisle the place of our destination and then we had all things taken out of the ship and she was properly repaired this escape of mr mondle which he as well as myself always considered as a singular act of providence i believe had a great influence on his life and conduct ever afterward  now that i am on this subject i beg leave to relate another instance or two which strongly raised my belief of the particular interposition of heaven and which might not otherways have found a place here from their insignificance i belonged for a few days in the year      to the jason of fiftyfour guns at plymouth and one night when i was on board a woman with a child at her breast fell from the upperdeck down into the hold near the keel every one thought that the mother and child must be both dashed to pieces but to our great surprise neither of them was hurt i myself one day fell headlong from the upperdeck of the aetna down the afterhold when the ballast was out and all who saw me fall cried out i was killed but i received not the least injury and in the same ship a man fell from the masthead on the deck without being hurt in these and in many more instances i thought i could plainly trace the hand of god without whose permission a sparrow cannot fall i began to raise my fear from man to him alone and to call daily on his holy name with fear and reverence and i trust he heard my supplications and graciously condescended to answer me according to his holy word and to implant the seeds of piety in me even one of the meanest of his creatures  when we had refitted our ship and all things were in readiness for attacking the place the troops on board the transports were ordered to disembark and my master as a junior captain had a share in the command of the landing this was on the   th of april the french were drawn up on the shore and had made every disposition to oppose the landing of our men only a small part of them this day being able to effect it most of them after fighting with great bravery were cut off and general crawford with a number of others were taken prisoners in this days engagement we had also our lieutenant killed  on the   st of april we renewed our efforts to land the men while all the men of war were stationed along the shore to cover it and fired at the french batteries and breast works from early in the morning till about four oclock in the evening when our soldiers effected a safe landing they immediately attacked the french and after a sharp encounter forced them from the batteries before the enemy retreated they blew up several of them lest they should fall into our hands our men now proceeded to besiege the citadel and my master was ordered on shore to superintend the landing of all the materials necessary for carrying on the siege in which service i mostly attended him while i was there i went about to different parts of the island and one day particularly my curiosity almost cost me my life i wanted very much to see the mode of charging the mortars and letting off the shells and for that purpose i went to an english battery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel there indeed i had an opportunity of completely gratifying myself in seeing the whole operation and that not without running a very great risk both from the english shells that burst while i was there but likewise from those of the french one of the largest of their shells bursted within nine or ten yards of me there was a single rock close by about the size of a butt and i got instant shelter under it in time to avoid the fury of the shell where it burst the earth was torn in such a manner that two or three butts might easily have gone into the hole it made and it threw great quantities of stones and dirt to a considerable distance three shot were also fired at me and another boy who was along with me one of them in particular seemed winged with red lightning and impetuous rage for with a most dreadful sound it hissed close by me and struck a rock at a little distance which it shattered to pieces when i saw what perilous circumstances i was in i attempted to return the nearest way i could find and thereby i got between the english and the french sentinels an english sergeant who commanded the outposts seeing me and surprised how i came there which was by stealth along the seashore reprimanded me very severely for it and instantly took the sentinel off his post into custody for his negligence in suffering me to pass the lines while i was in this situation i observed at a little distance a french horse belonging to some islanders which i thought i would now mount for the greater expedition of getting off accordingly i took some cord which i had about me and making a kind of bridle of it i put it round the horses head and the tame beast very quietly suffered me to tie him thus and mount him as soon as i was on the horses back i began to kick and beat him and try every means to make him go quick but all to very little purpose i could not drive him out of a slow pace while i was creeping along still within reach of the enemys shot i met with a servant well mounted on an english horse i immediately stopped and crying told him my case and begged of him to help me and this he effectually did for having a fine large whip he began to lash my horse with it so severely that he set off full speed with me toward the sea while i was quite unable to hold or manage him in this manner i went along till i came to a craggy precipice i now could not stop my horse and my mind was filled with apprehensions of my deplorable fate should he go down the precipice which he appeared fully disposed to do i therefore thought i had better throw myself off him at once which i did immediately with a great deal of dexterity and fortunately escaped unhurt as soon as i found myself at liberty i made the best of my way for the ship determined i would not be so foolhardy again in a hurry  we continued to besiege the citadel till june when it surrendered during the siege i have counted above sixty shells and carcases in the air at once when this place was taken i went through the citadel and in the bombproofs under it which were cut in the solid rock and i thought it a surprising place both for strength and building notwithstanding which our shots and shells had made amazing devastation and ruinous heaps all around it  after the taking of this island our ships with some others commanded by commodore stanhope in the swiftsure went to basseroad where we blocked up a french fleet our ships were there from june till february following and in that time i saw a great many scenes of war and stratagems on both sides to destroy each others fleet sometimes we would attack the french with some ships of the line at other times with boats and frequently we made prizes once or twice the french attacked us by throwing shells with their bombvessels and one day as a french vessel was throwing shells at our ships she broke from her springs behind the isle of i de re the tide being complicated she came within a gun shot of the nassau but the nassau could not bring a gun to bear upon her and thereby the frenchman got off we were twice attacked by their fire floats which they chained together and then let them float down with the tide but each time we sent boats with graplings and towed them safe out of the fleet  we had different commanders while we were at this place commodores stanhope dennis lord how etc from hence before the spanish war began our ship and the wasp sloop were sent to st sebastian in spain by commodore stanhope and commodore dennis afterward sent our ship as a cartel to bayonne in france among others whom we brought from bayonne were two gentlemen who had been in the west indies where they sold slaves and they confessed they had made at one time a false bill of sale and sold two portuguese white men among a lot of slaves  after which  people have it that sometimes shortly before persons die their ward has been seen that is some spirit exactly in their likeness though they are themselves at other places at the same time one day while we were at bayonne mr mondle saw one of our men as he thought in the gunroom and a little after coming on the quarter deck he spoke of some circumstances of this man to some of the officers they told him that he man was then out of the ship in one of the coats with the lieutenant but mr mondle would not believe it and we searched the ship when he found the man was actually out of her and when the boat returned some time afterward we found the man had been drowned at he very time mr mondle thought he saw him we went in february in      to belleisle and there stayed till the summer when we lest it and returned to portsmouth  after our ship was fitted out again for service in september she went to guernsey where i was very glad to see my old hostess who was now a widow and my former little charming companion her daughter i spent some time here very happily with them till october when we had orders to repair to portsmouth we parted from each other with a great deal of affection and i promised to return soon and see them again not knowing what allpowerful fate had determined for me our ship having arrived at portsmouth we went into the harbor and remained there till the latter end of november when we heard great talk about a peace and to our very great joy in the beginning of december we had orders to go up to london with our ship to be paid off we received this news with loud huzzas and every other demonstration of gladness and nothing but mirth was to be seen throughout every part of the ship i too was not without my share of the general joy on this occasion i thought now of nothing but being freed and working for myself and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good education for i always had a great desire to be able at least to read and write and while i was on shipboard i had endeavored to improve myself in both while i was in the aetna particularly the captains clerk taught me to write and gave me a smattering of arithmetic as far as the rule of three there was also one daniel queen about forty years of age a man very well educated who messed with me on board this ship and he likewise dressed and attended the captain fortunately this man soon became very much attached to me and took very great pains to instruct me in many things he taught me to shave and dress hair a little and also to read in the bible explaining many passages to me which i did not comprehend i was wonderfully surprised to see the laws and rules of my own country written almost exactly here a circumstance which i believe tended to impress our manners and customs more deeply on my memory i used to tell him of this resemblance and many a time we have sat up the whole night together at this employment in short he was like a father to me and some even used to call me after his name they also styled me the black christian indeed i almost loved him with the affection of a son many things i have denied myself that he might have them and when i used to play at marbles or any other game and won a few halfpence or got any little money which i sometimes did for shaving any one i used to buy him a little sugar or tobacco as far as my stock of money would go he used to say that he and i never should part and that when our ship was paid off as i was as free as himself or any other man on board he would instruct me in his business by which i might gain a good livelihood this gave me new life and spirits and my heart burned within me while i thought the time long till i obtained my freedom for though my master had not promised it to me yet besides the assurances i had received that he had no right to detain me he always treated me with the greatest kindness and reposed in me an unbounded confidence he even paid attention to my morals and would never suffer me to deceive him or tell lies of which he used to tell me the consequences and that if i did so god would not love me so that from all this tenderness i had never once supposed in all my dreams of freedom that he would think of detaining me any longer than i wished  in pursuance of our orders we sailed from portsmouth for the thames and arrived at deptford the  0th of december where we cast anchor just as it was high water the ship was up about half an hour when my master ordered the barge to be manned and all in an instant without having before given me the least reason to suspect any thing of the matter he forced me into the barge saying i was going to leave him but he would take care i should not i was so struck with the unexpectedness of this proceeding that for some time i did not make a reply only i made an offer to go for my books and chest of clothes but he swore i should not move out of his sight and if i did he would cut my throat at the same time taking his hanger i began however to collect myself and plucking up courage i told him i was free and he could not by law serve me so but this only enraged him the more and he continued to swear and said he would soon let me know whether he would or not and at that instant sprung himself into the barge from the ship to the astonishment and sorrow of all on board the tide rather unluckily for me had just turned downward so that we quickly fell down the river along with it till we came among some outwardbound west indiamen for he was resolved to put me on board the first vessel he could get to receive me the boats crew who pulled against their will became quite faint disserent times and would have gone ashore but he would not let them some of them strove then to cheer me and told me he could not sell me and that they would stand by me which revived me a little and i still entertained hopes for as they pulled along he asked some vessels to receive me but they would not but just as we had got a little below gravesend we came alongside of a ship which was going away the next tide for the west indies her name was the charming sally captain james doran and my master went on board and agreed with him for me and in a little time i was sent sor into the cabin when i came there captain doran asked me if i knew him i answered that i did not then said he you are now my slave i told him my master could not sell me to him nor to any one else why said he did not your master buy you i confessed he did but i have served him said i many years and he has taken all my wages and prizemoney for i only got one sixpence during the war besides this i have been baptized and by the laws of the land no man has a right to sell me and i added that i had heard a lawyer and others at different times tell my master so they both then said that those people who told me so were not my friends but i replied  it was very extraordinary that other people did not know the law as well as they upon this captain doran said i talked too much english and if i did not behave myself well and be quiet he had a method on board to make me i was too well convinced of his power over me to doubt what he said and my former sufferings in the slaveship presenting themselves to my mind the recollection of them made me shudder however before i retired i told them that as i could not get any right among men here i hoped i should hereafter in heaven and i immediately left the cabin filled with resentment and sorrow the only coat i had with me my master took away with him and said if your prizemoney had been  0000l i had a right to it all and would have taken it i had about nine guineas which during my long seafaring life i had scraped together from trifling perquisites and little ventures and i hid it that instant lest my master should take that from me likewise still hoping that by some means or other i should make my escape to the snore and indeed some of my old snipmates told me not to despair for they would get me back again and that as soon as they could get their pay they would immediately come to portsmouth to me where this ship was going but alas all my hopes were baffled and the hour of my deliverance was as yet far off my master having soon concluded his bargain with the captain came out of the cabin and he and his people got into the boat and put off i followed them with aching eyes as long as i could and when they were out of sight i threw myself on the deck with a heart ready to burst with serrow and anguish  chap v the authors reflections on his situation  is deceived by a promise of being delivered  his despair at sailing for the west indies  arrives at montserrat where he is sold to mr king  various interesting instances of oppression cruelty and extortion which the author saw practiced upon the slaves in the west indies during his captivity from the year      to       address on it to the planters  thus at the moment i expected all my toils to end was i plunged as i supposed in a new slavery in comparison of which all my service hitherto had been perfect freedom and whose horrors always present to my mind now rushed on it with tenfold aggravation i wept very bitterly for some time and began to think that i must have done something to displease the lord that he thus punished me so severely this filled me with painful reflections on my past conduct i recollected that on the morning of our arrival at deptford i had rashly sworn that as soon as we reached london i would spend the day in rambling and sport my conscience smote me for this unguarded expression i felt that the lord was able to disappoint me in all things and immediately considered my present situation as a judgment of heaven on account of my presumption in swearing i therefore with contrition of heart acknowledged my transgression to god and poured out my soul before him with unfeigned repentance and with earnest supplications i besought him not to abandon me in my distress nor cast me from his mercy for ever in a little time my grief spent with its own violence began to subside and after the first confusion of my thoughts was over i reflected with more calmness on my present condition i considered that trials and disappointments are sometimes for our good and i thought god might perhaps have permitted this in order to teach me wisdom and resignation for he had hitherto shadowed me with the wings of his mercy and by his invisible but powerful hand brought me the way i knew not these reflections gave me a little comfort and i rose at last from the deck with dejection and sorrow in my countenance yet mixed with some faint hope that the lord would appear for my deliverance  soon afterward as my new master was going on shore he called me to him and told me to behave myself well and do the business of the ship the same as any of the rest of the boys and that i should sare the better for it but i made him no answer i was then asked if i could swim and i said no however i was made to go under the deck and was well watched the next tide the ship got under way and soon after arrived at the mother bank portsmouth where she waited a few days for some of the west india convoy while i was here i tried every means i could devise amongst the people of the ship to get me a boat from the shore as there was none suffered to come alongside of the ship and their own whenever it was used was hoisted in again immediately a sailor on board took a guinea from me on pretense of getting me a boat and promised me time after time that it was hourly to come off when he had the watch upon deck i watched also and looked long enough but all in vain i could never see either the boat or my guinea again and what i thought was still the worst of all the fellow gave information as i afterward found all the while to the mates of my intention to go off if i could in any way do it but rogue like he never told them he had got a guinea from me to procure my ese however after we had sailed and his trick was made known to the ships crew i had some satisfacti in seeing him detested and desp by them all for his behavior to me i was still in hopes that my old shipmates would not forget heir promise to come for me to portsmouth and indeed at last but not till the day before we sailed some of them did come there and sent me off some oranges and other tokens of their regard they also sent me word they would come off to me themselves the next day or the day after and a lady also who lived in gosport wrote to me that she would come and take me out of the ship at the same time this lady had been once very intimate with my former master i used to sell and take care of a great deal of property for her in different ships and in return she always showed great friendship for me and used to tell my master that she would take me away to live with her but unfortunately for me a disagreement soon afterward took place between them and she was succeeded in my masters good graces by another lady who appeared sole mistress of the aetna and mostly lodged on board i was not so great a favorite with this lady as with the former she had conceived a pique against me on some occasion when she was on board and she did not fail to instigate my master to treat me in the manner he did thus was i sacrificed to the envy and resentment of this woman for knowing that the lady whom she had succeeded in my masters good graces designed to take me into her service which had i once got on shore she would not have been able to present she felt her pride alarmed at the superiority of her rival in being attended by a black servant it was not less to prevent this than to be revenged on me that she caused the captain to treat me thus cruelly   however the next morning the  0th of december the wind being brisk and easterly the aeolus frigate which was to escort the convoy made a signal for failing all the ships then got up their anchors and before any of my friends had an opportunity to come off to my relief to my inexpressible anguish our ship had got under way what tumultuous emotions agitated my soul when the convoy got under sail and i a prisoner on board now without hope i kept my swimming eyes upon the land in a state of unutterable grief not knowing what to do and despairing how to help myself while my mind was in this situation the fleet sailed on and in one days time i lost sight of the wishedfor land in the first expressions of my grief i reproached my fate and wished i had never been born i was ready to curse the tide that bore us the gale that wasted my prison and even the ship that conducted us and i called on death to relieve me from the horrors i felt and dreaded that i might be in that place where slaves are free and men oppress no more fool that i was inured so long to pain to trust to hope or dream of joy again          right        now draggd once more beyond the western main to groan beneath some dastard planters chain where my poor countrymen in bondage wait the long enfranchisement of a lingering fate hard lingering fate while ere the dawn of day roused by the lash they go their cheerless way and as their soul with shame and anguish burn salute with groans unwelcome morns return and chiding every hour the slowpaced sun pursue their toils till all his race is run no eye to mark their sufferings with a tear no friend to comfort and no hope to cheer then like the dull unpitied brutes repair to stalls as wretched and as course a fare thank heaven one day of misery was over then sink to sleep and wish to wake no more the dying negro a poem originally published in    perhaps it may not be deemed impertinent here to a that this elegant and pat little poem was occasioned as appears by the advertisement prefixed to it by the following incident a black who a fw days before had ran away from his master and got himself christened with intent to marry a white woman his fellow servants being taken and sent on board a ship in the thames took an opportunity of shooting himself through the head  the turbulence of my emotions however naturally gave way to calmer thoughts and i soon perceived what fate had decreed no mortal on earth could prevent the convoy sailed on without any accident with a pleasant gale and smooth sea for six weeks till february when one morning the aeolus ran down a brig one of the convoy and she instantly went down and was ingulfed in the dark recesses of the ocean the convoy was immediately thrown into great confusion till it was daylight and the aeolus was illumined with lights to prevent any farther mischief on the   th of february      from the mast head we descried our destined island montserrat and soon after i beheld those regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can rarely dwell hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end still urges at the sight of this land of bondage a fresh horror ran through all my ame and chilled me to the heart my former slavery now rose in dreadful review to my mind and displayed nothing but misery stripes and chains and in the first paroxysm of my grief i called upon gods thunder and his avenging power to direct the stroke of death to me rather than permit me to become a slave and be sold from lord to lord  in this state of my mind our ship came to an anchor and soon after discharged her cargo i now knew what it was to work hard i was made to help to unload and load the ship and to comfort me in my distress in that time two of the sailors robbed me of all my money and ran away from the ship i had been so long used to an european climate that at first i felt the scorching west india sun very painful while the dashing surf would toss the boat and the people in it frequently above high water mark sometimes our limbs were broken with this or even attended with instant death and i was day by day mangled and torn  about the middle of may when the ship was got ready to sail for england i all the time believing that fates blackest clouds were gathering over my head and expecting their bursting would mix me with the dead captain doran sent for me ashore one morning and i was told by the messenger that my fate was then determined with trembling steps and fluttering heart i came to the captain and found with him one mr robert king a quaker and the first merchant in the place the captain then told me my former master had sent me there to be sold but that he had desired him to get me the best master he could as he told him i was a very deserving boy which captain doran said he found to be true and if he were to stay in the west indies he would be glad to keep me himself but he could not venture to take me to london for he was very sure that when i came there i would leave him i at that instant burst out a crying and begged much of him to take me to england with him but all to no purpose he told me he had got me the very best master in the whole island with whom i should be as happy as if i were in england and for that reason he chose to let him have me though he could sell me to his own brotherinlaw for a great deal more money than what he got from this gentleman mr king my new master then made a reply and said the reason he had bought me was on account of my good character and as he had not the least doubt of my good behavior i should be very well off with him he also told me he did not live in the west indies but at philadelphia where he was going soon and as i understood something of the rules of arithmetic when we got there he would put me to school and fit me for a clerk this conversation relieved my mind a little and i left those gentlemen considerably more at ease in myself than when i came to them and i was very thankful to captain doran and even to my old master for the character they had given me a character which i afterward found of infinite service to me i went on board again and took leave of all my shipmates and the next day the ship sailed when she weighed anchor i went to the waterside and looked at her with a very wishful and aching heart and followed her with my eyes until she was totally out of sight i was so bowed down with grief that i could not hold up my head for many months and if my new master had not been kind to me i believe i should have died under it at last and indeed i soon found that he fully deserved the good character which captain doran had given me of him for he possessed a most amiable disposition and temper and was very charitable and humane if any of his slaves behaved amiss he did not beat or use them ill but parted with them this made them afraid of disobliging him and as he treated his slaves better than any other man on the island so he was better and more faithfully served by them in return by this kind treatment i did at last endeavor to compose myself and with fortitude though moneyless determined to face whatever fate had decreed for me mr king soon asked me what i could do and at the same time said he did not mean to treat me as a common slave i told him i knew something of seamanship and could shave and dress hair pretty well and i could refine wines which i had learned on shipboard where i had often done it and that i could write and understood arithmetic tolerably well as far as the rule of three he then asked me if i knew any thing of gauging and on my answering that i did not he said one of his clerks should teach me to guage  mr king dealt in all manner of merchandise and kept from one to six clerks he loaded many vessels in a year particularly to philadelphia where he was born and was connected with a great mercantile house in that city he had besides many vessels and droggers of different sizes which used to go about the island and others to collect rum sugar and other goods i understood pulling and managing those boats very well and this hard work which was the first that he set me to in the sugar seasons used to be my constant employment i have rowed the boat and slaved at the oars from one hour to sixteen in the twentyfour during which i had fifteen pence sterling per day to live on though sometimes only ten pence however this was considerably more than was allowed to other slaves that used to work often with me and belonged to other gentlemen on the island those poor souls had never more than ninepence per day and seldom more than sixpence from their masters or owners though they earned them three or four pisterines these pisterines are of the value of a shilling  for it is a common practice in the west indies for men to purchase slaves though they have not plantations themselves in order to let them out to planters and merchants at so much a piece by the day and they give what allowance they choose out of this produce of their daily work to their slaves for subsistence this allowance is often very scanty my master often gave the owners of these slaves two and a half of these pieces per day and found the poor fellows in victuals himself because he thought their owners did not feed them well enough according to the work they did the slaves used to like this very well and as they knew my master to be a man of feeling they were always glad to work for him in preference to any other gentleman some of whom after they had been paid for these poor peoples labors would not give them their allowance out of it many times have i even seen these unfortunate wretches beaten for asking for their pay and often severely flogged by their owners if they did not bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time though the poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had worked for sometimes for more than half the day before they could get their pay and this generally on sundays when they wanted the time for themselves in particular i knew a countryman of mine who once did not bring the weekly money directly that it was earned and though he brought it the same day to his master yet he was staked to the ground for his pretended negligence and was just going to receive a hundred lashes but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty this poor man was very industrious and by his frugality had saved so much money by working on shipboard that he had got a white man to buy him a boat unknown to his master some time after he had this little estate the governor wanted a boat to bring his sugar from different parts of the island and knowing this to be a negromans boat he seized upon it for himself and would not pay the owner a farthing the man on this went to his master and complained to him of this act of the governor but the only satisfaction he received was to be damned very heartily by his master who asked him how dare any of his negroes to have a boat if the justlymerited ruin of the governors fortune could be any gratification to the poor man he had thus robbed he was not without consolation extortion and rapine are poor providers and some time after this the governor died in the kings bench in england as i was told in great poverty the last war favored this poor negroman and he found some means to escape from his christian master he came to england where i saw him afterward several times such treatment as this often drives these miserable wretches to despair and they run away from their masters at the hazard of their lives many of them in this place unable to get their pay when they have earned it and fearing to be flogged as usual if they return home without it run away where they can for shelter and a reward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive my master used sometimes in these cases to agree with their owners and to settle with them himself and thereby he saved many of them a flogging  once for a few days i was let out to fit a vessel and i had no victuals allowed me by either party at last i told my master of this treatment and he took me away from it in many of the estates on the different islands where i used to be sent for rum or sugar they would not deliver it to me or any other negro he was therefore obliged to send a white man along with me to those places and then he used to pay him from six to ten pisterines a day from being thus employed during the time i served mr king in going about the different estates on the island i had all the opportunity i could wish for to see the dreadful usage of the poor men usage that reconciled me to my situation and made me bless god for the hands into which i had fallen  i had the good fortune to please my master in every department in which he employed me and there was scarcely any part of his business or household affairs in which i was not occasionally engaged i often supplied the place of a clerk in receiving and delivering cargoes to the ships in tending stores and delivering goods and besides this i used to shave and dress my master when convenient and take care of his horse and when it was necessary which was very often i worked likewise on board of different vessels of his by these means i became very useful to my master and saved him as he used to acknowledge above a hundred pounds a year nor did he scruple to say i was of more advantage to him than any of his clerks though their usual wages in the west indies are from sixty to a hundred pounds current a year  i have sometimes heard it asserted that a negro cannot earn his master the first cost but nothing can be further from the truth i suppose nine tenths of the mechanics throughout the west indies are negro slaves and i well know the coopers among them earn two dollars a day the carpenters the same and oftentimes more as also the masons smiths and fishermen etc and i have known many slaves whose masters would not take a thousand pounds current for them but surely this assertion refutes itself for if it be true why do the planters and merchants pay such a price for slaves and above all why do those who make this assertion exclaim the most loudly against the abolition of the slave trade so much are men blinded and to such inconsistent arguments are they driven by mistaken interest i grant indeed that slaves are some times by halffeeding halfclothing overworking and stripes reduced so low that they are turned out as unfit for service and left to perish in the woods or expire on a dunghill  my master was several times offered by different gentlemen one hundred guineas for me but he always told them he would not sell me to my great joy and i used to double my diligence and care for fear of getting into the hands of those men who did not allow a valuable slave the common support of life many of them even used to find fault with my master for feeding his slaves so well as he did although i often went hungry and an englishman might think my fare very indifferent but he used to tell them he always would do it because the slaves thereby looked better and did more work  while i was thus employed by my master i was often a witness to cruelties of every kind which were exercised on my unhappy fellow slaves i used frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in my care for sale and it was almost a constant practice with our clerks and other whites to commit violent depredations on the chastity of the female slaves and these i was though with reluctance obliged to submit to at all times being unable to help them when we have had some of these slaves on board my masters vessels to carry them to other islands or to america i have known our mates to commit these acts most shamefully to the disgrace not of christians only but of men i have even known them gratify their brutal passion with females not ten years old and these abominations some of them practiced to such scandalous excess that one of our captains discharged the mate and others on that account and yet in montserrat i have seen a negro man staked to the ground and cut most shockingly and then his ears cut off bit by bit because he had been connected with a white woman who was a common prostitute as if it were no crime in the whites to rob an innocent african girl of her virtue but most heinous in a black man only to gratify a passion of nature where the temptation was offered by one of a different color though the most abandoned woman of her species  one mr d  told me that he had sold   000 negroes and that he once cut off a negromans leg for running away  i asked him if the man had died in the operation how he as a christian could answer for the horrid act before god and he told me answering was a thing of another world what he thought and did were policy i told him that the christian doctrine taught us to do unto others as we would that others should do unto us he then said that his scheme had the desired effect  it cured that man and some others of running away  another negroman was half hanged and then burnt for attempting to poison a cruel overseer thus by repeated cruelties are the wretched first urged to despair and then murdered because they still retain so much of human nature about them as to wish to put an end to their misery and retaliate on their tyrants these overseers are indeed for the most part persons of the worst character of any denomination of men in the west indies unfortunately many humane gentlemen by not residing on their estates are obliged to leave the management of them in the hands of these human butchers who cut and mangle the slaves in a shocking manner on the most trifling occasions and altogether treat them in every respect like brutes they pay no regard to the situation of pregnant women nor the least attention to the lodging of the field negroes their huts which ought to be well covered and the place dry where they take their little repose are often open sheds built in damp places so that when the poor creatures return tired from the toils of the field they contract many disorders from being exposed to the damp air in this uncomfortable state while they are heated and their pores are open this neglect certainly conspires with many others to cause a decrease in the births as well as in the lives of the grown negroes i can quote many instances of gentlemen who reside on their estates in the west indies and then the scene is quite changed the negroes are treated with lenity and proper care by which their lives are prolonged and their masters profited to the honor of humanity i knew several gentlemen who managed their estates in this manner and they found that benevolence was their true interest and among many i could mention in several of the islands i knew one in montserrat mr dubury and many others montserrat whose slaves looked remarkably well and never needed any fresh supplies of negroes and there are many other estates especially in barbados which from such judicious treatment need no fresh stock of negroes at any time i have the honor of knowing a most worthy and humane gentleman who is a native of barbados and has estates there sir philip gibbes baronet barbados  this gentlem has w a treatise on the usage of his ow es he allows them two hours for reshment at midday and many other indulgencies and comforts particularly in their lying and besides this he raises more provisions on his estate than they can destroy so that by these attentions he saves the lives of his negroes and keeps them healthy and as happy as the condition of slavery can admit i myself as shall appear in the sequel managed an estate where by those attentions the negroes were uncommonly cheerful and healthy and did more work by half than by the common mode of treatment they usually do for want therefore of such care and attention to the poor negroes and otherwise oppressed as they are it is no wonder that the decrease should require  0000 new negroes annually to fill up the vacant places of the dead  even in barbados notwithstanding those humane exceptions which i have mentioned and others i am acquainted with which justly make it quoted as a place where slaves meet with the best treatment and need fewest recruits of any in the west indies yet this island requires  000 negroes annually to keep up the original stock which is only  0000 so that the whole term of a negros life may be said to be there but sixteen years benezets account of guinea p     and yet the climate here is in every respect the same as that from which they are taken except in being more wholesome do the british colonies decrease in this manner and yet what a prodigious difference is there between an english and west india climate  while i was in montserrat i knew a negro man named emanuel sankey who endeavored to escape from his miserable bondage by concealing himself on board of a london ship but fate did not favor the poor oppressed man for being discovered when the vessel was under sail he was delivered up again to his master this christian master immediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wrist and ancle and then took some sticks of sealing wax and lighted them and droped it all over his back there was another master who was noted for cruelty and i believe he had not a slave but what had been cut and had pieces fairly taken out of the flesh and after they had been punished thus he used to make them get into a long wooden box or case he had for that purpose in which he shut them up during pleasure it was just about the height and breadth of a man and the poor wretches had no room when in the case to move  it was very common in several of the islands particularly in st kitts for the slaves to be branded with the initial letters of their masters name and a load of heavy iron hooks hung about their necks indeed on the most trifling occasions they were loaded with chains and often instruments of torture were added the iron muzzle thumbscrews etc are so well known as not to need a description and were sometimes applied for the slightest faults i have seen a negro beaten till some of his bones were broken for only letting a pot boil over is it surprising that usage like this should drive the poor creatures to despair and make them seek a refuge in death from those evils which render their lives intolerable  while with shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast they view their lamentable lot and find no rest   this they frequently do a negroman on board a vessel of my master while i belonged to her having been put in irons for some trifling misdemeanor and kept in that state for some days being weary of life took an opportunity of jumping overboard into the sea however he was picked up without being drowned another whose life was also a burden to him resolved to starve himself to death and refused to eat any victuals this procured him a severe flogging and he also on the first occasion which offered jumped overboard at charles town but was saved  nor is there any greater regard shown to the little property than there is to the persons and lives of the negroes i have already related an instance or two of particular oppression out of many which i have witnessed but the following is frequent in all the islands the wretched fieldslaves after toiling all the day for an unfeeling owner who gives them but little victuals steal sometimes a few moments from rest or refreshment to gather some small portion of grass according as their time will admit this they commonly tie up in a parcel either a bits worth sixpence or half a bits worth and bring it to town or to the market to sell nothing is more common than for the white people on this occasion to take the grass from them without paying for it and not only so but too often also to my knowledge our clerks and many others at the same time have committed acts of violence on the poor wretched and helpless females whom i have seen for hours stand crying to no purpose and get no redress or pay of any kind is not this one common and crying sin enough to bring down gods judgment on the islands he tells us the oppressor and the oppressed are both in his hands and if these are not the poor the brokenhearted the blind the captive the bruised which our savior speaks of who are they one of these depredators once in st eustatia came on board of our vessel and bought some fowls and pigs of me and a whole day after his departure with the things he returned again and wanted his money back i refused to give it and not seeing my captain on board he began the common pranks with me and swore he would even break open my chest and take my money i therefore expected as my captain was absent that he would be as good as his word and he was just proceeding to strike me when fortunately a british seaman on board whose heart had not been debauched by a west india climate interposed and prevented him but had the cruel man struck me i certainly should have defended myself at the hazard of my life for what is life to a man thus oppressed he went away however swearing and threatened that whenever he caught me on shore he would shoot me and pay for me afterward  the small account in which the life of a negro is held in the west indies is so universally known that it might seem impertinent to quote the following extract if some people had not been hardy enough of late to assert that negroes are on the same footing in that respect as europeans by the    th act page     of the assembly of barbados it is enacted that if any negro or other slave under punishment by his master or his order for running away or any other crime or misdemeanor toward his said master unfortunately shall suffer in life or member no person whatsoever shall be liable to a fine but if any man shall out of wantonness or only of bloodymindedness or cruel iniention wilfully kill a negro or other slave of his own he shall pay into the public treasury fifteen pounds sterling and it is the same in most if not all of the west india islands is not this one of the many acts of the islands which call loudly for redress and do not the assembly which enacted it deserve the appellation of savages and brutes rather than of christians and men it is an act at once unmerciful unjust and unwise which for cruelty would disgrace an assembly of those who are called barbarians and for its injustice and insanity would shock the morality and common sense of a samde or hottentot  shocking as this and many more acts of the bloody west india code at first view appear how is the iniquity of it heightened when we consider to whom it may be extended mr james tobin a zealous labourer in the vineyard of slavery gives an account of a french planter of his acquaintance in the island of martinico who showed him many mulattoes working in the fields like beasts of burden and he told mr tobin these were all the produce of his own loins and i myself have known similar instances pray reader are these sons and daughters of the french planter less his children by being begotten on black women and what must be the virtue of those legislators and the feelings of those fathers who estimate the lives of their sons however begotten at no more than fifteen pounds though they should be murdered as the act says out of wantonness and bloodymindedness but is not the slave trade entirely a war with the heart of man and surely that which is begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue involves in its continuance destruction to every principle and buries all sentiments in ruin  i have often seen slaves particularly those who were meagre in different islands put into scales and weighed and then sold from three pence to six pence or nine pence a pound my master however whose humanity was shocked at this mode used to sell such by the lump and at or after a sale it was not uncommon to see negroes taken from their wives wives taken from their husbands and children from their parents and sent off to other islands and wherever else their merciless lords choose and probably never more during life see each other oftentimes my heart has bled at these partings when the friends of the departed have been at the water side and with sighs and tears have kept their eyes fixed on the vessel till it went out of sight  a poor creole negro i knew well who after having been often thus transported from island to island at last resided in montserrat this man used to tell me many melancholy tales of himself generally after he had done working for his master he used to employ his few leisure moments to go a fishing when he had caught any fish his master would frequently take them from him without paying him and at other times some other white people would serve him in the same manner one day he said to me very movingly sometimes when a white man take away my fish i go to my maser and he get me my right and when my maser by strength take away my fishes what me must do i cannot go to any body to be righted then said the poor man looking up above i must look up to god mighty in the top for right this artless tale moved me much and i could not help feeling the just cause moses had in redressing his brother against the egyptian i exhorted the man to look up still to the god on the top since there was no redress below though i little thought then that i myself should more than once experience such imposition and need the same exhortation hereafter in my own transactions in the islands and that even this poor man and i should some time after suffer together in the same manner as shall be related hereafter  nor was such usage as this confined to particular places or individuals for in all the different islands in which i have been and i have visited no less than fifteen the treatment of the slave was nearly the same so nearly indeed that the history of an island or even a plantation with a few such exceptions as i have mentioned might serve for a history of the whole such a tendency has the slave trade to debauch mens minds and harden them to every feeling of humanity for i will not suppose that the dealers in slaves are born worse than other men  no it is the fatality of this mistaken avarice that it corrupts the milk of human kindness and turns it into gall and had the pursuits of those men been different they might have been as generous as tenderhearted and just as they are unfeeling rapacious and cruel surely this traffic cannot be good which spreads like a pestilence and taints what it touches which violates that first natural right of mankind equality and independency and gives one man a dominion over his fellows which god could never intend for it raises the owner to a state as far above man as it depresses the slave below it and with all the presumption of human pride sets a distinction between them immeasurable in extent and endless in duration yet how mistaken is the avarice even of the planters are slaves more useful by being thus humbled to the condition of brutes than they would be if suffered to enjoy the privileges of men the freedom which diffuses health and prosperity through out britain answers you  no when you make men slaves you deprive them of half their virtue you set them in your own conduct an example of fraud rapine and cruelty and compel them to live with you in a state of war and yet you complain that they are not honest or faithful you stupify them with stripes and think it necessary to keep them in a state of ignorance and yet you assert that they are incapable of learning that their minds are such a barren soil or moor that culture would be lost on them and that they come from a climate where nature though prodigal of her bounties in a degree unknown to yourselves has left man alone scant and unfinished and incapable of enjoying the treasures she has poured out for him  an assertion at once impious and absurd why do you use those instruments of torture are they fit to be applied by one rational being to another and are ye not struck with shame and mortification to see the partakers of your nature reduced so low but above all are there no dangers attending this mode of treatment are you not hourly in dread of an insurrection nor would it be surprising for when   no peace is given to us enslaved but custody severe and stripes and arbitrary punishment inflicted  what peace can we return but to our power hostility and hate untamed reluctance and revenge though slow yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest and may least rejoice in doing what we most in suffering feel but by changing your conduct and treating your slaves as men every cause of fear would be banished they would be faithful honest intelligent and vigorous and peace prosperity and happiness would attend you  chap vi some account of brimstonehill in montserrat  favorable change in the authors situation  he commences merchant with three pence  his various success in dealing in the different islands and america and the impositions he meets with in his transactions with europeans  a curious imposition on human nature  danger of the surfs in the west indies  remarkable instance of kidnapping a free mulatto  ths author is nearly murdered by doctor perkins in savannah  in the precedeing chapter i have set before the reader a few of those many instances of oppression extortion and cruelty which i have been a witness to in the west indies but were i to enumerate them all the catalogue would be tedious and disgusting the punishments of the slaves on every trifling occasion are so frequent and so well known together with the different instruments with which they are tortured that it cannot any longer afford novelty to recite them and they are too shocking to yield delight either to the writer or the reader i shall therefore hereafter only mention such as incidentally befell myself in the course of my adventures  in the variety of departments in which i was employed by my master i had an opportunity of seeing many curious scenes in different islands but above all i was struck with a celebrated curiosity called brimstonehill which is a high and steep mountain some few miles from the town of plymouth in montserrat i had often heard of some  this  white  when we  under different  of brimstone occa  steams of various little  were then boiling naturally in the earth some of these ponds were as white as milk some quite blue and many others of different colors i had taken some potatoes with me and i put them into different ponds and in a few minutes they were well boiled i tasted some of them but they were very sulphurous and the silver shoe buckles and all the other things of that metal we had among us were in a little time turned as black as lead  some time in the year      kind providence seemed to appear rather more favorable to me one of my masters vessels a bermudas sloop about sixty tons burden was commanded by one captain thomas farmer an englishman a very alert and active man who gained my master a great deal of money by his good mangement in carrying passengers from one island to another but very often his sailors used to get drunk and run away from the vessel which hindered him in his business very much this man had taken a liking to me and many different times begged of my master to let me go a trip with him as a sailor but he would tell him he could not spare me though the vessel sometimes could not go for want of hands for sailors were generally very scarce in the island however at last from necessity or force my master was prevailed on though very reluctantly to let me go with this captain but he gave him great charge to take care that i did not run away for if i did he would make him pay for me this being the case the captain had for some time a sharp eye upon me whenever the vessel anchored and as soon as she returned i was sent for on shore again thus was i slaving as it were for life sometimes at one thing and sometimes at another so that the captain and i were nearly the most useful men in my masters employment i also became so useful to the captain on shipboard that many times when he used to ask for me to go with him though it should be but for twentyfour hours to some of the islands near us my master would answer he could not spare me at which the captain would swear and would no go the trip and tell my master i was better to him on board than any three white men he had for they used to behave ill in many respects particularly in getting drunk and then they frequently got the boat stove so as to hinder the vessel from coming back as soon as she might have done this my master knew very well and at last by the captains constant entreaties after i had been several times with him one day to my great joy told me the captain would not let him rest and asked whether i would go aboard as a sailor or stay on shore and mind the stores for he could not bear any longer to be plagued in this manner i was very happy at this proposal for i immediately thought i might in time stand some chance by being on board to get a little money or possibly make my escape if i should be used ill i also expected to get better food and in greater abundance for i had oftentimes felt much hunger though my master treated his slaves as i have observed uncommonly well i therefore without hesitation answered him that i would go and be a sailor if he pleased accordingly i was ordered on board directly nevertheless between the vessel and the shore when she was in port i had little or no rest as my master always wished to have me along with him indeed he was a very pleasant gentleman and but for my expectations on shipboard i should not have thought of leaving him but the captain liked me also very much and i was entirely his right hand man i did all i could to deserve his favor and in return i received better treatment from him than any other i believe ever met with in the west indies in my situation  after i had been sailing for some time with this captain at length i endeavored to try my luck and commence merchant i had but a very small capital to begin with for one single half bit which is equal to threepence in england made up my whole stock however i trusted to the lord to be with me and at one of our trips to st eustatia a dutch island i bought a glass tumbler with my half bit and when i came to montserrat i sold it for a bit or sixpence luckily we made several successive trips to st eustatia which was a general mart for the west indies about twenty leagues from montserrat and in our next finding my tumbler so profitable with this one bit i bought two tumblers more and when i came back i sold them for two bits equal to a shilling sterling when we went again i bought with these two bits four more of these glasses which i sold for fout bits on our return to montserrat and in our next voyage to st eustatia i bought two glasses with one bit and with the other three i bought a jug of geneva nearly about three pints in measure when we came to montserrat i sold the gin for eight bits and the tumblers for two so that my capital now amounted in all to a dollar well husbanded and acquired in the space of a month or six weeks when i blessed the lord that i was so rich as we sailed to different islands i laid this money out in various things occasionally and it used to turn to very good account especially when we went to guadaloupe grenada and the rest of the french islands thus was i going all about the islands upwards of four years and ever trading as i went during which i experienced many instances of ill usage and have seen many injuries done to other negroes in our dealings with whites and amidst our recreations when we have been dancing and merrymaking they without cause have molested and insulted us indeed i was more than once obliged to look up to god on high as i had advised the poor fisherman some time before and i had not been long trading for myself in the manner i have related above when i experienced the like trial in company with him as follows this man being used to the water was upon an emergency put on board of us by his master to work as another hand on a voyage to santa cruz and at our sailing he had brought his little all for a venture which consisted of six bits worth of limes and oranges in a bag i had also my whole stock which was about twelve bits worth of the same kind of goods separate in two bags for we had heard these fruits sold well in that island when we came there in some little convenient time he and i went ashore with our fruits to sell them but we had scarcely landed when we were met by two white men who presently took our three bags from us we could not at first guess what they meant to do and for some time we thought they were jesting with us but they too soon let us know otherwise for they took our ventures immediately to a house hard by and adjoining the fort while we followed all the way begging of them to give us our fruits but in vain they not only refused to return them but swore at us and threatened if we did not immediately depart they would flog us well we told them these three bags were all we were worth in the world and that we brought them with us to sell when we came from montserrat and showed them the vessel but this was rather against us as they now saw we were strangers as well as slaves they still therefore swore and desired us to be gone and even took sticks to beat us while we seeing they meant what they said went off in the greatest confusion and despair thus in the very minute of gaining more by three times than i ever did by any venture in my life before was i deprived of every farthing i was worth an insupportable misfortune but how to help ourselves we knew not in our consternation we went to the commanding officer of the fort and told him how we had been served by some of his people but we obtained not the least redress he answered our complaints only by a volley of imprecations against us and immediately took a horsewhip in order to chastise us so that we were obliged to turn out much faster than we came in i now in the agony of distress and indignation wished that the ire of god in his forked lightning might transsix these cruel oppressors among the dead still however we persevered went back again to the house and begged and besought them again and again for our fruits till at last some other people that were in the house asked if we would be contented if they kept one bag and gave us the other two we seeing no remedy whatever consented to this and they observing one bag to have both kinds of fruit in it which belonged to my companion kept that and the other two which were mine they gave us back as soon as i got them i ran as fast as i could and got the first negro man i could to help me off my companion however stayed a little longer to plead he told them the bag they had was his and likewise all that he was worth in the world but this was of no avail and he was obliged to return without it the poor old man wringing his hands cried bitterly for his loss and indeed he then did look up to god on high which so moved me with pity for him that i gave him nearly one third of my fruits we then proceeded to the markets to sell them and providence was more favorable to us than we could have expected for we sold our fruits uncommonly well i got for mine about thirtyseven bits such a surprising reverse of fortune in so short a space of time seemed like a dream and proved no small encouragement for me to trust the lord in any situation my captain afterward frequently used to take my part and get me my right when i have been plundered or used ill by these tender christian depredators among whom i have shuddered to observe the unceasing blasphemous execrations which are want only thrown out by persons of all ages and conditions not only without occasion but even as if they were indulgences and pleasure  at one of our trips to st kitts i had eleven bits of my own and my friendly captain lent me five more with which i bought a bible i was very glad to get this book which i fcarcely could meet with any where i think there was none sold in montserrat and much to my grief from being forced out of the aetna in the manner i have related my bible and the guide to the indians the two books i loved above all others were left behind  while i was in this place st kitts a very curious imposition on human nature took place  a white man wanted to marry in the church a free black woman that had land and slaves in montserrat but the clergyman told him it was against the law of the place to marry a white and a black in the church the man then asked to be married on the water to which the parson consented and the two lovers went in one boat and the parson and clerk in another and thus the ceremony was performed after this the loving pair came on board our vessel and my captain treated them extremely well and brought them safe to montserrat  the reader cannot but judge of the irksomeness of this situation to a mind like mine in being daily exposed to new hardships and impositions after having seen many better days and been as it were in a state of freedom and plenty added to which every part of the world i had hitherto been in seemed to me a paradise in comparison of the west indies my mind was therefore hourly replete with inventions and thoughts of being freed and if possible by honest and honorable means for i always remembered the old adage and i trust it has ever been my ruling principle that honesty is the best policy and likewise that other golden precept  to do unto all men as i would they should do unto me however as i was from early years a predestinarian i thought whatever fate had determined must ever come to pass and therefore if ever it were my lot to be freed nothing could prevent me although i should at present see no means or hope to obtain my freedom on the other hand if it were my fate not to be freed i never should be so and all my endeavors for that purpose would be fruitless in the midst of these thoughts i therefore looked up with prayers anxiously to god for my liberty and at the same time used every honest means and did all that was possible on my part to obtain it in process  time i became master of a few pound and in a  way of making more whi my friendly captain knew very well this occasioned him sometimes to take liberties with me but whenever he treated me waspishly i used plainly to tell him my mind and that i would die before i would be imposed upon as other negroes were and that to me life had lost its relish when liberty was gone this i said although i foresaw my then wellbeing or future hopes of freedom humanly speaking depended on this man however as he could not bear the thoughts of my not failing with him he always became mild on my threats i therefore continued with him and from my great attention to his orders and his business i gained him credit and through his kindness to me i at last procured my liberty while i thus went on filled with the thoughts of freedom and resisting oppression as well as i was able my life hung daily in suspense particularly in the surfs i have formerly mentioned as i could not swim these are extremely violent throughout the west indies and i was ever exposed to their howling rage and devouring fury in all the islands i have seen them strike and toss a boat right up an end and maim several on board once in the grenada islands when i and about eight others were pulling a large boat with two puncheons of water in it a surf struck us and drove the boat and all in it about half a stones throw among some trees and above the high water mark we were obliged to get all the assistance we could from the nearest estate to mend the boat and launch it into the water again at montserrat one night in pressing hard to get off the shore on board the punt was overset with us four times the first time i was very near being drowned however the jacket i had on kept me up above water a little space of time while i called on a man near me who was a good swimmer and told him i could not swim he then made haste to me and just as i was sinking he caught hold of me and brought me to sounding and then he went and brought the punt also as soon as we had turned the water out of her lest we should be used ill for being absent we attempted again three times more and as often the horrid surfs served us as at first but at last the fifth time we attempted we gained our point at the eminent hazard of our lives one day also at old road in montserrat our captain and three men besides myself were going in a large canoe in quest of rum and sugar when a single surf tossed the canoe an amazing distance from the water and some of us near a stones throw from each other most of us were very much bruised so that i and many more often said and really thought that there was not such another place under the heavens as this i longed therefore much to leave it and daily wished to see my masters promise performed of going to philadelphia  while we lay in this place a very cruel thing happened on board of our sloop which filled me with horror though i found afterward such practices were frequent there was a very clever and decent free young mulattoman who sailed a long time with us he had a free woman for his wife by whom he had a child and she was then living on shore and all very happy our captain and mate and other people on board and several elsewhere even the natives of bermudas all knew this young man from a child that he was always free and no one had ever claimed him as their property however as might too often overcomes right in these parts it happened that a bermudas captain whose vessel lay there for a few days in the road came on board of us and seeing the mulattoman whose name was joseph clipson he told him he was not free and that he had orders from his master to bring him to bermudas the poor man could not believe the captain to be in earnest but he was very soon undeceived his men laying violent hands on him and although he showed a ficate of his being born  kitts and most people on  that he served his time  ing and always passed  yet he was forcibly taken  vessel he then asked to  ashore before the secretary or magistrates and these infernal invaders of human rights promised him he should but instead of that they carried him on board of the other vessel and the next day without giving the poor man any hearing on shore or suffering him even to see his wife or child he was earried away and probably doomed never more in this world to see them again nor was this the only instance of this kind of barbarity i was a witness to i have since often seen in jamaica and other islands free men whom i have known in america thus villainously trepanned and held in bondage i have heard of two similar practices even in philadelphia and were it not for the benevolence of the quakers in that city many of the sable race who now breathe the air of liberty would i believe be groaning indeed under some planters chains these things opened my mind to a new seen of horror to which i had been before a stranger hitherto i had thought only slavery dreadful but the state of a free negro appeared to me now equally so at least and in some respects even worse for they live in constant alarm for their liberty which is but nominal for they are universally insulted and plundered without the possibility of redress for such is the equity of the west indian laws that no sree negros evidence will be admitted in their courts of justice in this situation is it surprising that slaves when mildly treated should prefer even the misery of slavery to such a mockery of sreedom i was now completely disgusted with the west indies and thought i never should be entirely free until i had left them  with thoughts like these my anxious boding mind recalled those pleasing scenes i left behind scenes where fair liberty in bright array makes darkness bright and even illumines day where nor complexion wealth or station can protect the wretch who makes a slave of man i determined to make every exertion to obtain my freedom and to return to old england for this purpose i thought a knowledge of navigation might be of use to me for though i did not intend to run away unless i should be ill used yet in such a case if i understood navigation i might attempt my escape in our sloop which was one of the swiftest sailing vessels in the west indies and i could be at no loss for hands to join me and if i should make this attempt i had intended to have gone for england but this as i said was only to be in the event of my meeting with any ill usage i therefore employed the mate of our vessel to teach me navigation for which i agreed to give him twentyfour dollars and actually paid him part of the money down though when the captain some time after came to know that the mate was to have such a sum for teaching me he rebuked him and said it was a shame for him to take any money from me however my progress in this useful art was much retarded by the constancy of our work had i wished to run away i did not want opportunities which frequently presented themselves and particularly at one time soon after this when we were at the island of gaurdeloupe there was a large fleet of merchantmen bound for old france and seamen then being very scarce they gave from fifteen to twenty pounds a man for the run our mate and all the white sailors left our vessel on this account and went on board of the french ships they would have had me also to go with them for they regarded me and swore to protect me if i would go and as the fleet was to sail the next day i really believe i could have got safe to europe at that time however as my master was kind i would not attempt to leave him still remembering the old maxim that honesty is the best policy i suffered them to go without me indeed my captain was much afraid of my leaving him and the vessel at that time as i had so fair an opportunity but i thank god this fidelity of mine turned out much to my advantage hereafter when i did not in the least think of it and made me so much in favor with the captain that he used now and then to teach me some parts of navigation himself but some of our passengers and others seeing this found much fault with him for it saying it was a very dangerous thing to let a negro know navigation thus i was hindered again in my pursuits about the latter end of the year      my master bought a larger sloop called the prudence about seventy or eighty tons of which my captain had the command i went with him into this vessel and we took a load of new slaves for georgia and charles town my master now left me entirely to the captain though he still wished for me to be with him but i who always much wished to lose sight of the west indies was not a little rejoiced at the thoughts of seeing any other country therefore relying on the goodness of my captain i got ready all the little venture i could and when the vessel was ready we sailed to my great joy when we got to our destined places georgia and charles town i expected i should have an opportunity of selling my little property to advantage but here particularly in charles town i met with buyers white men who imposed on me as in other places notwithstanding i was resolved to have fortitude thinking no lot or trial too hard when kind heaven is the rewarder  we soon got loaded again and returned to montserrat and there amongst the rest of the islands i sold my goods well and in this manner i continued trading during the year      meeting with various scenes of imposition as usual after this my master fitted out his vessel for philadelphia in the year      and during the time we were loading her and getting ready for the voyage i worked with redoubled alacrity from the hope of getting money enough by these voyages to buy my freedom in time if it should please god and also to see the town of philadelphia which i had heard a great deal about for some years past besides which i had always longed to prove my masters promise the first day i came to him in the midst of these elevated ideas and while i was about getting my little merchandise in readiness one sunday my master sent for me to his house when i came there i found him and the captain together and on my going in i was struck with astonishment at his telling me he heard that i meant to run away from him when i got to philadelphia and therefore said he i must sell you again you cost me a great deal of money no less than forty pounds sterling and it will not do to lose so much you are a valuable fellow continued he and i can get any day for you one hundred guineas from many gentlemen in this island and then he told me of captain dorans brotherinlaw a severe master who ever wanted to buy me to make me his overseer my captain also said he could get much more than a hundred guineas for me in carolina this i knew to be a fact for the gentleman that wanted to buy me came off several times on board of us and spoke to me to live with him and said he would use me well when i asked what work he would put me to he said as i was a sailor he would make me a captain of one of his rice vessels but i refused and fearing at the same time by a sudden turn i saw in the captains temper he might mean to sell me i told the gentleman i would not live with him on any condition and that i certainly would run away with his vessel but he said he did not fear that as he would catch him again and then he told me how cruelly he would serve me if i should do so my captain however gave him to understand that i knew something of navigation so he thought better of it and to my great joy he went away i now told my master i did not say i would run away in philadelphia neither did i mean it as he did not use me ill nor yet the captain for if they did i certainly would have made some attempts before now but as i thought that if it were gods will i ever should be freed it would be so and on the contrary if it was not his will it would not happen so i hoped if ever i were freed whilst i was used well it should be by honest means but as i could not help myself he must do as he pleased i could only hope and trust to the god of heaven and at that instant my mind was big with inventions and full of schemes to escape i then appealed to the captain whether he ever saw any sign of my making the least attempt to run away and asked him if i did not always come on board according to the time for which he gave me liberty and more particularly when all our men left us at gaurdeloupe and went on board of the french fleet and advised me to go with them whether i might not and that he could not have got me again to my no small surprise and very great joy the captain confirmed every syllable that i had said and even more for he said he had tried different times to see if i would make any attempt of this kind both at st eustatia and in america and he never found that i made the smallest but on the contrary i always came on board according to his orders and he did really believe if i ever meant to run away that as i could never have had a better opportunity i would have done it the night the mate and all the people left our vessel at gaurdeloupe the captain then insormed my master who had been thus imposed on by our mate though i did not know who was my ememy the reason the mate had for imposing this lie upon him which was because i had acquainted the captain of the provisions the mate had given away or taken out of the vessel this speech of the captain was like life to the dead to me and instantly my soul glorified god and still more so on hearing my master immediately say that i was a sensible fellow and he never did intend to use me as a common slave and that but for the entreaties of the captain and his character of me he would not have let me go from the stores about as i had done that also in so doing he thought by carrying one little thing or other to different places to sell i might make money that he also intended to encourage me in this by crediting me with half a puncheon of rum and half a hogshead of sugar at a time so that from being careful i might have money enough in some time to purchase my freedom and when that was the case i might depend upon it he would let me have it for forty pounds sterling money which was only the same price he gave for me this sound gladdened my poor heart beyond measure though indeed it was no more than the very idea i had formed in my mind of my master long before and i immediately made him this reply sir i always had that very thought of you indeed i had and that made me so diligent in serving you he then gave me a large piece of silver coin such as i never had seen or had before and told me to get ready for the voyage and he would credit me with a tierce of sugar and another of rum he also said that he had two amiable sisters in philadelphia from whom i might get some necessary things upon this my noble captain desired me to go aboard and knowing the african metal he charged me not to say any thing of this matter to any body and he promised that the lying mate should not go with him any more this was a change indeed in the same hour to feel the most exquisite pain and in the turn of a moment the fullest joy it caused in me such sensations as i was only able to express in my looks my heart was so overpowered with gratitude that i could have kissed both of their feet when i left the room i immediately went or rather flew to the vessel which being loaded my master as good as his word trusted me with a tierce of rum and another of sugar when we sailed and arrived safe at the elegant town of philadelphia i soon sold my goods here pretty well and in this charming place i found every thing plentiful and cheap  while i was in this place a very extraordinary occurrence befell me i had been told one evening of a wise woman a mrs davis who revealed secrets foretold events etc i put littie faith in this story at first as i could not conceive that any mortal could foresee the future disposals of providence nor did i believe in any other revelation than that of the holy scriptures however i was greatly astonished at seeing this woman in a dream that night though a person i never before beheld in my life this made such an impression on me that i could not get the idea the next day out of my mind and i then became as anxious to see her as i was before indifferent accordingly in the evening after we left off working i inquired where she lived and being directed to her to my inexpressible surprise beheld the very woman in the very same dress she appeared to me to wear in the vision she immediately told me i had dreamed of her the preceding night related to me many things that had happened with a correctness that astonished me and finally told me i should not be long a slave this was the more agreeable news as i believed it the more readily from her having so faithfully related the past incidents of my life she said i should be twice in very great danger of my life within eighteen months which if i escaped i should afterward go on well so giving me her blessing we parted after staying here some time till our vessel was loaded and i had bought in my little traffic we sailed from this agreeable spot for montserrat once more to encounter the raging surfs  we arrived safe at montserrat where we discharged our cargo and soon after that we took slaves on board for st eustatia and from thence to georgia i had always exerted myself and did double work in order to make our voyages as short as possible and from thus overworking myself while we were at georgia i caught a fever and ague i was very ill for eleven days and near dying eternity was now exceedingly impressed on my mind and i feared very much that awful event i prayed the lord therefore to spare me and i made a promise in my mind to god that i would be good if ever i should recover at length from having an eminent doctor to attend me i was restored again to health and soon after we got the vessel loaded and set off for montserrat during the passage as i was perfectly restored and had much business of the vessel to mind all my endeavors to keep up my integrity and perform my promise to god began to fail and in spite of all i could do as we drew nearer and nearer to the islands my resolutions more and more declined as if the very air of that country or climate seemed fatal to piety when we were safe arrived at montserrat and i had got ashore i forgot my former resolutions  alas how prone is the heart to leave that god it wishes to love and how strongly do the things of this world strike the senses and captivate the soul  after our vessel was discharged we soon got her ready and took in as usual some of the poor oppressed natives of africa and other negroes we then set off again for georgia and charlestown we arrived at georgia and having landed part of our cargo proceeded to charlestown with the remainder while we were there i saw the town illuminated the guns were fired and bonfires and other demonstrations of joy shown on account of the repeal of the stamp act here i disposed of some goods on my own account the white men buying them with smooth promises and fair words giving me however but very indifferent payment there was one gentleman particularly who bought a puncheon of rum of me which gave me a great deal of trouble and although i used the interest of my friendly captain i could not obtain any thing for it for being a negro man i could not oblige him to pay me this vexed me much not knowing how to act and i lost some time in seeking after this christian and though when the sabbath came which the negroes usually make their holiday i was much inclined to go to public worship i was obliged to hire some black men to help to pull a boat across the water to go in quest of this gentleman when i found him after much entreaty both from myself and my worthy captain he at last paid me in dollars some of them however were copper and of consequence of no value but he took advantage of my being a negro man and obliged me to put up with those or none although i objected to them immediately after as i was trying to pass them in the market amongst other white men i was abused for offering to pass bad coin and though i showed them the man i got them from i was within one minute of being tied up and flogged without either judge or jury however by the help of a good pair of heels i ran off and so escaped the bastinadoes i should have received i got on board as fast as i could but still continued in fear of them until we sailed which i thanked god we did not long after and i have never been amongst them since  we soon came to georgia where we were to complete our lading and here worse fate than ever attended me for one sunday night as i was with some negroes in their masters yard in the town of savannah it happened that their master one doctor perkins who was a very severe and cruel man came in drunk and not liking to see any strange negroes in his yard he and a ruffian of a white man he had in his service beset me in an instant and both of them struck me with the first weapons they could get hold of i cried out as long as i could for help and mercy but though i gave a good account of myself and he knew my captain who lodged hard by him it was to no purpose they beat and mangled me in a shameful manner leaving me near dead i lost so much blood from the wounds i received that i lay quite motionless and was so benumbed that i could not feel any thing for many hours early in the morning they took me away to the jail as i did not return to the ship all night my captain not knowing where i was and being uneasy that i did not then make my appearance he made inquiry after me and having found where i was immediately came to me as soon as the good man saw me so cut and mangled he could not forbear weeping he soon got me out of jail to his lodgings and immediately sent for the best doctors in the place who at first declared it as their opinion that i could not recover my captain on this went to all the lawyers in the town for their advice but they told him they could do nothing for me as i was a negro he then went to doctor perkins the hero who had vanquished me and menaced him swearing he would be revenged of him and challenged him to fight  but cowardice is ever the companion of cruelty  and the doctor refused however by the skilfulness of one doctor brady of that place i began at last to amend but although i was so sore and bad with the wounds i had all over me that i could not rest in any posture yet i was in more pain on account of the captains uneasiness about me than i otherwise should have been the worthy man nursed and watched me all the hours of the night and i was through his attention and that of the doctor able to get out of bed in about sixteen or eighteen days all this time i was very much wanted on board as i used frequently to go up and down the river for rafts and other parts of our cargo and stow them when the mate was sick or absent in about four weeks i was able to go on duty and in a fortnight after having got in all our lading our vessel set sail for montserrat and in less than three weeks we arrived there safe toward the end of the year this ended my adventures in      for i did not leave montserrat again till the beginning of the following year  end of the first volume
