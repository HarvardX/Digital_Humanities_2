a petition to the right hon mr  in favor of mr maclean by a lady  london printed for g smith near temple bar fleet street    0  a petition to the right hon mr  in favor of mr maclean if ever statesman melted at distress nor chose to make it more instead of less if they retain a sense of human things and deign to look on mortals down from kings list list oh  whom three realms obey to the sad purport of my weeping lay ah how i dread least crowding on some hour that twists confused the intricate web of power hiding those slender threads that lead us still letting the puppets think they act at will or if unhappily on one i press more serious how to keep ones self in place nay i might fear though this should meet your eyes when only monarchs linger for replies yet they perhaps would wait when ladies write for foreigners they say are all polite and strange effect of breathing different air reward the brave and reverence the fair you should to r  ts send my unread griefs deputies are more difficult than chiefs perhaps he would see with joy my macleans fall such little people envy one so tall no may this find thee when thy souls unbent and laughs to think how easys government when frugal e  lends her still retreat or verdant g  h her pacific seat or thy pleased eye athwart the g  p  k rolls peeping through l c  s pigeonholes gently dissolved in unconcern the same as when to derby the banditti came yet still i run one risque what can be worse you will think it begging cause it is in verse too sure we beg for life we beg it is true if we had robbed enough we need not sue
