longsword earl of salisbury an historical romance  in two volumes volume the first the second edition  dublin printed by george faulkner in parliament street mdcclxvi  advertisement the outlines of the following story and some of the incidents and more minute circumstances are to be found in the ancient english historians if too great liberties have been taken in altering or enlarging their accounts the reader who looks only for amusement will probably forgive it the learned and critical if this work should be honored by such readers will deem it a matter of too little consequence to call for the severity of their censure  it is generally expected that pieces of this kind should convey some useful moral which moral not always perhaps the most valuable or refined is sometimes made to float on the surface of the narrative or is plucked up at proper intervals and presented to the view of the reader with great solemnity but the author of these sheets has too high an opinion of the judgment and penetration of his readers to pursue this method although he cannot pretend to be very deep yet he hopes he is clear and if any thing lies at bottom worth the picking up it will be discovered without his direction  longsword earl of salisbury book i sect i when henry the third of that name reigned in england sir randolph a valiant knight of cornwall now too old to take a part in the affairs and commotions of the realm retired to the peaceful enjoyment of those honors and fortunes which he had purchased by a series of hardy services in the field the eve of his life was engaged in the pleasing occupation of training up two youths his sons who were rising fast to maturity in teaching them the sacred duties which they owed to heaven and to their country inspiring them with a gallant love of arms and possessing their minds with undaunted courage duly tempered with benevolence and humanity  the season was genial the evening serene and refreshing when randolph wandered forth with a youth attending him on each side eagerly listening to his narrative of wars and glorious dangers the boys passed slowly on with their eyes and thoughts fixed on their father till they were insensibly led to the brow of a chalky cliff commanding a wide and uninterrupted view of the calm unruffled sea that now reflected all the rich and glowing crimson of the setting sun here they sat down and urgently entreated their father to renew the story of his dangers in the holy land the achievements of the brave soldiers of the cross the recent wars in france and the valor of earl richard and his knights while the attention of randolph was fixed on a small barque now approaching to the shore  its keel cut swiftly and deeply into the sands and a general shout from the vessel roused the little company whose attention was still farther awakened when they observed the deportment of the man who first leaped on shore his garb was that of an humble pilgrim whose holy vows were leading him to some scene of devotion and by his side hung a large and trenchant weapon befitting the son of honorable war rather than the votary of religion his look was pale and squalid but his port erect and a secret greatness and manly dignity seemed to break through all the gloom of adversity which surrounded him no sooner had he touched the strand than he stood for a moment as it were in a still and motionless surprise then salling on his knees with arms crossed and eyes raised up to heaven his looks expressed the most rapturous gratitude and thankfulness as if for a deliverance from some great calamity whilst some others of the crew with all appearances of tender regard conveyed a young and beautisul personage to shore dressed in the same habit with their leader the whole scene was extraordinary and affecting the youths had descried it and starting up and turning to their father seemed to demand the reason of this appearance come my sons cried randolph this stranger appears unfortunate perhaps he may accept of our hospitable reception let our friendly offices not to be wanting to allay his grief and to supply his necessities thus saying he led them by a winding descent toward the shore where the crew were by this time disembarqued  sir randolph approached the stranger to whom the rest of the company seemed to pay a particular regard with a concern truly humane when instantly the eyes of each were fixed in mute surprise upon the other  my general  my knight their tongues could utter no more they rushed into each others arms and clung together in a tumultuous disorder of grief amazement and affection at length words forced their passage great earl cried randolph and do i really behold thee do i embrace the man under whose command my last days of honorable war saw glory and victory has my leader survived the dreadful night of tempest which dispersed our ships he whom we imagined buried in the seas is he at length returned in safety but why this garb are these wretched weeds befitting the son of an illustrious monarch the conqueror of gascoigne the glory of england thou art come but not to peace and repose danger difficulty and distress are still prepared for that undaunted spirit  am i not in england replied the stranger have i not at length happily efcaped the insidious attempts of my enemies what dangers have i now to fear no my dearest  illustrious dame tenderest wife in thy arms shall i now forget my dangers to thee i fly to wipe away those tears which burst for that my departure and must have flowed in full streams during this melancholy interval of my absence in thee and thy endearments shall all my future hopes be centered and never no never more shall william be deluded by the smiling promises of glory to hazard the chance of arms enough has been already done enough has been given to honor and to my country peace and retirement repose and tranquillity be now the lot of these shattered limbs and this distracted wearied spirit  whilst the earl thus indulged his flattering prospects of tranquillity the thoughts of randolph were busy and disordered he surveyed him with a mixture of pity and affection and half suppressing the sigh that labored in his breast he assumed a look of ease and complacency and invited lord william and his attendants to partake of the refreshment which his neighboring residence afforded they passed on with the pleasing sensations of men who after a length of days spent in a foreign and unfriendly land began once more to taste the comforts of a native country and to share in the social intercourse of kinsmen and fellow citizens their leader turned to the youthful pilgrim whom he embraced with a tender and affectionate concern but with such joy as seemed clouded by the remembrance of past calamities they retired a few paces as if in private conference and the elder seemed intent in comforting and encouraging the courteous knight would not break in upon their private conference and to leave them the more free to indulge that mutual affection which they discovered he turned to his youths behold said he this truly honorable lord great in descent powerful in arms full of the mighty spirit of his royal father the second henry a monarch fatally seduced by the beauty of rosamond and mark the just dispensations of heaven heavy was the punishment which the mother paid for her forbidden love nor has misfortune spared this the offspring of an unlawful and unhappy passion yet let us be just to his virtues and learn from him that renown is not to be purchased but by toil and perils under his banners has your father oftentimes encountered dangers with him did i hasten to support the cause and title of our king when john had met his fate and the son of france rioted in the calamities of england with him did these old arms contribute to execute the vengeance of our country upon the adherents of the perfidious lewis and when the count malleon revolted from his liege lord and erected the standard of france in our province of gascoigne then did he bravely second the efforts of richard uncle to our prince and led us on to victory aspire to the same renown but expect the like fortune dream not of undisturbed happiness and tranquillity by expecting labor and distress you shall learn to encounter and to conquer them in a glorious and honest cause  thus far paternal tenderness diverted the attention of randolph from his illustrious friend who in this short interval had been equally engaged he embraced his followers congratulated their happy arrival and zealously extolled their merits and faithful services the knight with all due courtesy led them on toward his hospitable hall which soon opened to their view and soon received the wearied guests no friendly care was wanting to recall their languid and drooping spirits as men just snatched from the dread gulf of misery and suddenly restored to a degree of happiness beyond the hopes and even the conceptions of their dejected thoughts they gazed each upon his fellow in a silent extacy of surprise and joy and still more endeared to each other as sharers in the same misfortunes their eyes their hands encountered spontaneously and they embraced with an affecting cordiality and pleasure earl william who now began to resume his native dignity his eyes as it were newly lightened up his voice less plaintive his aspect greater and his port still more princely earnestly seized the hand of that young personage to whom he seemed more particularly attentive and thus addressed himself to his host o my friend here is our dearest charge know and respect this beautiful maid for such she is the daughter of a brave and honest soldier his name les roches and once mine enemy but furtune and his virtues united us in bands of friendship truly sacred and inviolable it is by his goodness that i now see my native land his generous pity saved me when the arm of mine enemy was just raised to strike to strike me basely and treacherously unknowing unsuspecting and unprovided for defense welcome lady replied the knight alas these limbs were not formed for toil or dangerous adventure but where is thy gallant father my heart pants to embrace him an english heart which holds a soldier dear of whatever clime or country and doubly dear and doubly honored shall that soldier be who restores a noble and beloved son to england here grief threatened to break through the fair reserve of female modesty and had already fallen in gentle drops down her glowing cheeks which the earl perceiving checked with a kindly reproving look then softly entreated randolph to summon such of his domestics as might be proper to conduct her to refreshment and repose these instantly appeared and were instructed to perform their offices with all tender and respectful care the maid retired in silence randolph seemed wrapped in delight and wonder whilst the earl pursued her parting steps with looks of sweetest complacency and pity the knight then turning to the followers of this lord my friends said he your toils demand retirement this roof knows no other happiness than to greet the approach of worth and valor it is yours and use it freely for this night at least forget your labors and indulge your faint and harassed limbs in peaceful rest  yes said the earl to rest my dear companions but bear with my impatience and be stirring with the dawn that we may issue forth with newrecruited speed and quickly gain my castle there shall our labors end there shall the gentle countess acknowledge your deserts and there shall her long lost lord reward your fidelity  sir randolph you too shall accompany us and share the general joy we shall teach you to receive your fellow soldier with a more lively sympathy and brighten that honest aspect with gayer smiles  to this gentle reproof which seemed to have escaped unwarily from the jealousy of friendship randolph made no reply but with a countenance of strict composure which effectually concealed whatever thoughts or passions were now busy in his mind he invited lord william to retire no my friend replied the earl  my followers are happily disposed of at last thanks to the preserving hand of heaven and to thee they enjoy that secure repose to which they have been so long strangers i feel my heart eased of its oppressing load nor will i give these eyes to sleep till i have heard  say what of my wife what of my friends of the king and realm can my good host impart  but chiefly of my wife of ela i would hear all thou can deliver how has she borne this tedious absence know thou not of her present state speak alas the grief of my widowed dame seems to affect that good  but say is she well  randolph had betrayed some agitation at these enquities but quickly recollecting his disordered thoughts her tenderness and love for thee have been approved said he in the absence of her lord tomorrow thou shall see her in her princely castle but now indulge my patience say what means this garb this appearance of misfortune who are these thy attendants  yes said the earl i will tell thee all sit down  thou will not be displeased to hear the story of my misfortunes since our last dreadful separation randolph obeyed and the earl thus began  sect ii how can i recall to mind the fatal time when our victorious army loaded with the spoils of gascoigne reimbarked and with hearts of joy and expectation steered toward their native shore thou randolph who had shared the dangers of our war whose hoary head still disdained to droop beneath its beaver must retain the dreadful remembrance of that night when winds and seas conspired together and united their unrelenting fury against the bands of england when the roaring hurricane deasened us with its horrid menaces and the frequent lightning served to disclose all the terrors of the gloomy deep our army that had undauntedly defied the swords of france found now another enemy against whose obstinate assaults their courage seemed but ineffectual and every moment presented us with the distracting expectation of perishing in dishonorable obscurity and much does it rejoice me that in that extremity of distress the blessed saints were not unmindful of randolph that my gallant knight was happily rescued from destruction to cheer his friends and enjoy his latter days in peace and dignity the fate of salisbury was more severe and affecting the ship which received me and my associates was quickly separated from our fleet a helpless and solitary prey to the violence of the tempest which our pilot had neither skill nor spirit to oppose and in that dreadful moment when raised to a giddy and terrible height we hung upon the breaking wave or sunk down deep into the dark and yawning gulf then was my dear hearts treasure my beloved dame present to my distracted mind to die was horrible because to die was to be torn from ela her sorrows crowded upon my busy fancy and i sunk o my friend how can i speak it i funk into a coward  does that tear now stealing down your furrowed cheek express your pity of my weakness or a sense of my misfortunes  the disorder of the good knight which could no longer be entirely concealed here suspended the narration lord william seized his hand with a look of surprise and concern at his sensibility but randolph prevented all expostulation by a sudden and violent effort to resume his serenity he soon recalled his thoughts to a composed attention and at his desire the earl proceeded  heaven was at length pleased in some degree to control the violence of the storm the dawn of morning seemed to promise us at least some respite from destruction yet still helpless and desponding without course or direction we tossed as the winds and tides impelled and when at last we descried land that cheering object to wretches who have supported an unequal contest with the raging tempest only served to inspire us with new fears lest it should prove the land of our enemy but alas it was decreed and the shocking scene still dwells on my imagination in all its horror that far the greater part of us should never touch the shore which lay in view we steered upon a coast utterly unknown the rock which lay in ambush to destroy us assailed our vessel the waves rushed impetuously through the breach in that dreadful moment when hope vanished when death stood with open arms to receive his prey the magnanimity of my dear unhappy companions  how shall i speak it they clung round my knees with tears of solicitude and zeal for my preservation they entreated they pressed they forced me to seek for safety in the boat which it was their last care to make ready for their beloved captain with ten more the most eminent in command resolute and undismayed even in the very moment of their destruction they hailed our departure and triumphed in our safety i hear their shouts they still strike my ears  o england can the world boast such sons  the deep closed over them and snatched the dear afflicting awesul object for ever from our eyes we rowed away in silence and astonishment full of the terrible idea and little cheered by the prospect of land which we dreaded to find unfriendly nor were our fears mistaken for when our last and utmost efforts had been exerted to gain the shore some wretched fishermen who had at first gazed in expectation on our vessel and at the sight of armed men sled precipitately into the country appeared by their garb and language to be french and convinced us that the prospect of immediate destruction was only changed for another no less dreadful that of an hard and tedious captivity that of falling into the hands of men whom we had but now defied and vanquished and being made the victims of revenge for blood still reeking upon our blades  we moored our boat uncertain what course to pursue whether to seek refuge from our enemies in an unknown and tempestuous sea or by advancing forward to resign ourselves into their power it was however soon resolved boldly to meet our danger we moved on slowly and circumspect the sun played upon our armor and its reflected beams served as a direction to a small armed band that had been alarmed by their countrymen and now marched forth to seek their invaders my companions little dismayed at such a superiority of numbers as they had frequently repelled unsheathed their swords now their only weapons and stood as men resolved to defend their lives and liberty to the utmost the undaunted show of resistance persuaded our enemies that some hostile design was meditated and that greater numbers were approaching to our support they halted and surveyed us their bowmen discharged their shafts and three of my unhappy friends lay bleeding upon the earth pouring out their lives without a possibility of assistance or the consolation of a brave revenge our enemies animated by their success rushed upon us they felt our blades but soon taught us that resistance was ineffectual they surrounded my friends and impatient to secure their captives hurried them precipitately across the plain but in their blind unguided fury left me at some distance singly engaged with their commander who with couched lance spurred forward and loudly called upon me to yield myself his prisoner or meet my fate active and experienced in arms i evaded his onset and with this good sword whose length and keenness had long been the terror of his countrymen i aimed a blow which was received by his fiery charger the beast grew furious with anguish and impatient of command soon cast his rider at my feet but i who neither inclined nor deemed it prudent to pursue the work of death ever ready to spare a prostrate foe and nothing disposed to provoke a severe vengeance on my companions lifted my beaver and with looks of courtesy raised the leader from the ground i prepared to accost him when starting back as if unable to support some sudden and violent surprise he stood speechless and motionless casting his eyes to heaven and fixing them on me by turns blessed saints  o noble lord  thus did he exclaim twice my preserver how shall les roches repay thy exalted goodness in the isle of the and thus attended but fly this moment i must rejoin my friends that path is safe it leads thee to a place of concealment expect me soon and expect some return of gratitude  with these words the stranger for such he still seemed to me turned hastily away in pursuit of his troop now leading off their prisoners in triumph nor could i suddenly recover from my amazement mine eyes still attended him and marked his hasty steps until he was lost in the distant crowd then suddenly recollecting mine own danger and his friendly counsel i took the path to which he had pointed and measured out the tedious way with limbs wearied and faint and with a mind no less harassed by tumultuous passions still confounded and perplexed my thoughts sought in vain for that security that concealment which the stranger had promised when turning mine eyes eagerly on every side in search of some cheering object they at length discovered at some distance a large and venerable pile it is windows crowded with the foliage of their ornaments and dimmed by the hand of the painter it is numerous spires towering above the roof and the christian ensign on it is front declared it a residence of devotion and charity hither i determined to bend my course and to six here my last and only hopes of refuge war had long taught me to support toil and abstinence but alas my spirit now denied it is wonted assistance to my exhausted strength and when my limbs had labored up the eminence on which this mansion stood with slow and painful efforts when a few paces only remained to bring me to the entrance nature could struggle no farther my sight grew clouded i fell as in the arms of death and fainted under the severe oppression of fatigue and distress nor did my miserable state escape the regards of charity for when my languid eyes again opened to the light i found myself attended by one who seemed an inhabitant and from him learned that i lays before the portal of an ancient abbey where the brethren of the cistertian order employed their peaceful hours in orisons to heaven and acts of humanity to their fellow creatures the friendly door was laid open for my reception the arm which had raised me from the ground with the same humane concern supported my tottering steps and led me through the winding isles to a retired chamber where the charitable offices of my attendant were busily employed to provide whatever might be needful for rest and refreshment whatever might recall the strength and comfort the afflicted spirit of a wretched stranger  i felt the kind effects of his pious care and though stili anxious and oppressed yet reiieved from the extremity of languor and conscious of returning strength i requested to be conducted to the reverend abbot who in that instant prevented me and entered to enquire into the occasion of my arrival and to know what further offices might be granted to a man whose appearance and distress had by this time engaged the attention of the whole fraternity with the authority of a superior he directed my conductor to withdraw and for a while surveyed me with a kind yet piercing eye his aspect from which the beams of piety and charity seemed to break forth in a mild and cheering light commanded reverence and love i made the due obeisance and entreated his kind protection for a man who had drunk deeply of affliction who stood before him a monument of the tremendous displeasure of heaven torn perhaps for ever from all that he held dear cast on a foreign shore without guide friend or refuge yet sometime no stranger to happier days son replied the venerable father these gates are never barred against the afflicted but far be all pollution from our walls war has been thy occupation but has that sword been ever stained with the blood of a friend or brother has no great offense odious to religion or humanity cut thee off from society and driven thee away a wretched and abandoned wanderer impatient of suspicion i fell upon my knees before him and instantly addressed myself to shrift opened my whole soul freely as in the face of heaven declared my country my name and quality and distinctly recounted my late unhappy fortunes the good father heard me with exact attention hesitating and struggling with the rising passion he uttered some words of comfort while the big tear rolled down nor did this mark of generous pity disgrace his venerable aspect although he labored to conceal it when he was to urge the precepts of fortitude and patience my son said he now resuming a look of ease and composed dignity nature obliges us to feel but religion forbids us to repine that power which deals out misfortune to sinful mortals will in his own appointed time accept of their penitence and wipe away their tears thou art the enemy of my country but thou art a man this roof shall not reject thee retire and rest securely the duties of my office call me with tomorrows rising sun i will revisit thee he departed and deprived me of that momentary comfort which his looks and voice inspired  the couch now received me but not to repose my busy thoughts too long and too violently agitated to subside into serenity and quiet revolved the dreadful scenes in which i had been just now engaged sometimes were they fixed on the fate of my companions now on my own danger and ever and anon distracted me with the recollection of my country my family and o killing torment my wife but i was not long permitted to indulge these sad reflections a rude knocking at the gates echoed through the arched isles and roused me from my gloomy dreams suddenly it ceased silence still more alarming and anxious expectation succeeded i started up and grasped my sword as it were instinctively i heard the seet of haste approaching my chamber the door opened and there stood before me the frenchman whose life i had that day spared and whom i now recognized rather by his voice than by the glimmering lamp depending from the cieling have i found my preserver thus did he earnestly accost me well did i divine that he would find refuge with my reverend kinsman and that i should still be able to repay the goodness of lord william  thou know me said i hastily interrupting him twice i think thou said it twice i had preserved thee all this is strange and would be unfolded recal to mind replied the frenchman that busy day when the gallant earl of march was forced to yield before the english bands led by duke richard and by thee the impetuous malleon he whose envy of thy superior worth and greatness had first prompted to revolt from england he who hated thy name and fickened at the report of thy valor loudly defied and challenged thee ye engaged horse to horse with the furious rage of rivals and soon the superior prowess of salisbury prevailed i well remember it said i and when the count was sinking to the ground a valiant soldier rushed forward to his rescue and exposed himself to all the fury of his victorious enemies i was that soldier cried he mine own men shrunk cowardly from me the english surrounded me and when their swords were raised to destroy me then did lord william with difficuity repress their violence and i became his prisoner  hereupon i interrupted him  a prisoner then were my intentions not duly executed that fidelity and valor which prompted the brave soldier to defy the terrors of death in order to preserve his friend deserved more respect and better fortune my orders were that he should be freed and honorably conducted to his own camp without delay or ransom and these orders were obeyed said he i was freed i was honorably conducted to my own camp without delay or ransom and there did i loudly proclaim thy worth the listening soldiers hung on me with rapture whilst i told the deed and enemies were taught to revere the magnanimity and generous humanity of england and of salisbury o fatal zeal of gratitude the count malleon whose imperious spirit could but ill endure the piercing wound his honor had now received discomfitted disgraced and doubly conquered now felt the most malignant passions rankling in his breast tortured by the praises of the conqueror he breathed revenge and fury thundered out the severest and most tremendous menaces against himself the world but above all against lord william o would to heaven that this extravagance of rage and malice had even now subsided here the good frenchman seemed in no small emotion raised as i then conceived by the ardour of gratitude and indignation at the ungenerous conduct of his countryman i endeavored to divert him to some other subject by discovering an unwillingness of hearing my own commendations and by speaking of the malice of my enemy with slight and scorn alas said he thou know not half thy danger in this island on which thou have been cast naked and defenseless count savoure de malleon bears an absolute command if he should discover thee which heaven forbid what fortunate event could save thy life or if spared what ransom could purchase thy liberty i am indeed his officer but all my cares and services must be devoted to my preserver thy remaining friends i have seen disposed with such advantage as their present state allows their ransom shall be my work but o my heart bleeds for their noble leader i chose this silent hour when darkness might conceal me from the eye of suspicion to come and warn thee of thy danger let these holy walls still conceal thee nor dare to brave the arm of revenge and malice i must retire thy friends shall be my care and may heaven direct me to some means of speedily removing thee from this accursed place i seized the hand of the generous les roches and attempted to express my acknowledgements of his humane and noble friendship but he hastily broke from me with a tender and affecting prayer for my preservation and left me full of wonder and perplexity  sect iii the lingering hours of night at length passed away and the matinbell summoned the reverend fraternity to their early devotions their pious cares for me were now renewed their charitable offices repeated to oblige and comfort me the hoary abbot returned to cheer me with his presence and his ghostly counsel i was witness of the comforts of religion and tranquillity happiness seemed to me the native resident of the cloister and my repining heart murmured against heaven that had marked me out for the storm and turbulence of life another day was spent and another night passed away more tranquil and refreshing and i rose with my thoughts fixed on the kind les roches and in anxious impatience for his return the day advanced but my friend still delayed his coming at length the charitable abbot appeared not with a front of placid serenity but gloomy and contracted full of anxiety and grief which like the infectious blast that at once destroys the fruits of nature filled my soul instantly with i knew not what dreadful and ominous presage unhappy son said he malleon has discovered if not the place of thy concealment at least that thou art concealed in this island thanks to the indiscretion of some of thy countrymen which disclosed the name of their commander his jealousy points to les roches as the author of thy escape vengeance is denounced against him and this moment the good les roches lies in the damp dungeon for me said i and is charity so great a crime is tyranny suffered to rage thus without control in france for me does my kind preserver endure the pain of captivity  with a look in which affection and authority were united the father here repressed my emotion son said he the time calls for calm and determined measures in this place thou can not longer abide thy coming was not secret and should it reach malleon alas i fear the impetuosity of that proud count might drive him to violate the sacred privileges of our house les roches though now unable to assist thee is yet anxious still for thy preservation the peasant sent by him to inform me of thy dangers waits to conduct thee faithfully to the vessel prepared to convey thee to rochelle thither thy ransomed friends have already directed their course and from thence some fortunate event may conduct thee to thy native country tarry here until the shades of night may conceal thy departure then issue forth and may all good angels hold thee in their protection our prayers  here pity stopped his voice and filled his eyes with tears whilst i in broken accents labored to express my sense of his goodness my pity for the kind and injured les roches and my indignation at the baseness of malleon he saw my passionate disorder he entreated he exhorted and he reproved till perceiving by my wandering and inattention that my mind was too busily engaged to admit his spiritual counsels he retired and abandoned me to my own reflections and these were entirely confined to the misfortunes of the generous and kind les roches i accused myself as the sole author of his sufferings and abhorred the mean design of flying when i had involved my friend in danger what can the malice of malleon inflict on me it was thus i reasoned if to purchase the liberty of my preserver i resign myself into his power to kill me  that were unnatural the man i never injured cannot proceed to such an extravagance of calm unprovoked cruelty or if he could my country could not long be unacquainted with my fate and would he must be well assured discharge all it is vengeance on my destroyer and shall the fear of bearing the insult and triumph of my rival in arms shall the tediousness of captivity or the severities of a prison drive me from the man who suffers for his goodness toward me shall i sacrifice his freedom perhaps his life only to hasten my return to england  the thought appeared odious and dishonorable i instantly formed the darling resolution of purchasing the freedom of les roches by delivering myself into the hands of my enemy and spent the remaining hours of day in that satisfaction and complacency which arise from the flattering ideas of selfapplause the sun declined darkness gradually prevailed and at length brought on the hour of my departure and now firmly and obstinately settled in my dangerous purpose i received the benediction of the reverend abbot with a countenance of fixed serenity which he good man commended as an indication of my reliance upon heaven touched with his goodness i could not suppress the tears that started from me and interrupted my grateful acknowledgements of his charitable care and his zealous prayers for my protection our hands were clasped in each other our eyes rather than our tongues spoke the emotions of our breasts until the father who first made the effort to repress his passion urged the necessity of my departure and while he ardently commended me to every holy faint i issued forth under the direction of the peasant my conductor  i had not departed many paces from the abbey when addressing myself to the guide with a voice which bespoke a deliberate and determined resolution i commanded him to conduct me to the prison where les roches lay confined the poor man who was no stranger to my quality or to my hazardous situation expressed the utmost horror and astonishment and in language rude and unrefined yet such as denoted an honest and a tender affection attempted to remonstrate against such a perilous design i showed him gold but this had no effect i then drew my sword and threatened him with the utmost severity of vengeance unless he instantly obeyed my command terror seemed to have a greater influence than entreaties or promises he changed his course and called on me to follow thus directed i eagerly took the path which i supposed would lead me to my friend filled with the high thoughts of obtaining his freedom by a free resignation of my own but after long traversing the gloomy and tedious way i found too late that either fear and darkness had misled my conductor or that he had purposely deceived my expectations for when the dawn began to appear we found ourselves suddenly prevented from all farther progress by a deep and rapid current the peasant trembled but i had no power however irritated to punish his error or his mistaken tenderness exhausted as i was with fatigue and inward agitation my arm with difficulty took the casque from my forehead i dipped it in the stream and drank deeply then resigning my feeble limbs to the dank ground insensible of all danger and indifferent to my fate i funk into a profound sleep nor did i awaken till the meridian fun slashed upon me with it is beams and roused me by the full force of their heat and brightness i called on the peasant but he had deferted me i arose and wandered slowly along the banks of the river without purpose or direction and so freely did i indulge the wandering of my thoughts so far was i lost to recollection that i never once perceived the found of approaching feet till i was encompassed by fix armed men who proved as i at once supposed the guards of count malleon  but my friend why should i abuse thy indulgence by this minute detail night steals fast from us let me not forget what thy age demands no replied randolph think not of me my soul is all attention to the misfortunes of my leader haste and give to my impatience the story of thy deliverance that i too in my turn may relate the things which demand thy serious ear  the earl then proceeded  sect iv the soldiers required my name my purpose and destination and as i had long since resigned all hopes of escape i discovered myself without reserve or difficulty two of them were instantly dismissed with a nod and departed with the most precipitate speed whilst the remaining number with that courtesy and respect which bespoke them the brave and generous sons of honorable war conducted me to a cottage that lay at some small distance fast by the margin of the current here i was treated not with imperious insolence the effects of base and dishonorable enmity but with all humane and kind regards due to a brave unfortunate this encouraged me to attempt some conference with my keepers who on their part discovered no reluctance to gratify their prisoner from them i learned that my guide had really mistaken the way and that i now lay within one hours distance from the castle of their lord i earnestly enquired after the fate of les roches and heard with a mixture of joy and vexation at my own precipitate conduct that on the preceding night he had been released from his captivity when i expressed my surprise and satisfaction at this event i was told that immediately after that the surviving englishmen had been ransomed by the bounty of les roches and suffered at his intercession to depart count savoure had received information that one of them had rashly discovered that the lord of salisbury their leader was still in the isle of the this instantly kindled up a flame of passion in his breast he affected to regard the tale of their distress as vain and fictitious and expressed strong apprehensions of a conspiracy formed by his enemies in concert with his officer to seize the island in this sudden and violent fit of rage he had commanded les roches to prison and ordered astrict guard to watch round the coast the frenchman conscious of his own innocence exclaimed loudly against the severity of his commander mentioned the inconsiderable number of the englishmen that had appeared and enlarged on the unreasonable nature of the counts suspicions he demanded to know if any man had dared to accuse him if he had an accuser he defied him to the lists and offered to prove his falsehood and his own loyalty in single combat yet with what reserve so ever these soldiers spoke of their commander i learned clearly that his remonstrances had not so great an effect on count savoure as the power and influence of les roches who though he fought under his command had himself a numerous and formidable body of feudatory vassals that attended him in arms and were attached to their chief with an ardent and invariable affection it appeared plainly that fear for cruel natures are most accessible to fear had determined the imperious count to release my friend when the first sudden passion of rage had somewhat abated and no appearance of danger had been discovered my guards informed me still farther that on this very morning malleon had repented of his lenity and that his apprehensions were again awakened as he had received information that on that part of the shore which looks toward the main land of france another vessel had been discovered hovering about the island with an appearance which fully warranted suspicion i readily concluded that this was no other than the vessel in which my ransomed friends had embarked and which still lay off the shore in hopes of receiving me but without discovering this i contented myself with earnestly disavowing in general all intentions of an hostile nature nor could i speak of the mean fears and insolent severity of malleon but with a warm and passionate indignation but here our conference was interrupted by the arrival of another body who came as they said to take charge of me and dismissed the others from their attendance i now expected to be led in triumph to the presence of my enemy but soon learned that i was to continue for some time in my present situation at this i ventured to express some surprise but the looks and words of sullen gloom and moroseness which these my new guards assumed obliged me to surpress all farther enquiries i submitted patiently to my fate i was disarmed and confined in the cottage under the care of two soldiers who seemed to command the party the rest of which they had disposed at some distance in different situations to watch all approaches that might threaten rescue  night advanced upon us and i was left to my repose but what repose remained for a wretch tossed about through all the vicissitudes of danger toil and distress by the capricious cruelty of fortune a thousand thoughts and a thousand passions encountered each other in my distracted breast i threw myself upon my hard and homely couch and started up by turns like the feverish wretch incessantly changing in fruitless search of ease nature seemed to lower upon me and to thunder terror into my affrighted ears the loud storm and the roaring torrent broke in upon the silence of night and made darkness doubly dreadful how did i then accuse the slow and indolent advances of time that tortured me with cruel delay oftentimes did i endeavor to compose my troubled thoughts and as often did the terrors of the night awaken my distractions watchful and disordered as i was my soul was soon tortured with a new and terrible alarm it was now the dead midnight hour on that side where my chamber looked down upon the troubled river i plainly heard my two guards in dreadful conference encouraging each other to the horrid purpose of murder it is now said one the very moment of execution he sleeps take you this dagger and let us enter when we have dispatched this englishman my orders are to plunge his body in the river that it may be thought he has escaped observe me well and be assured of the favor of our count the dagger is the last resource no blood if possible our first attempt must be by strangling  accursed wretch cried randolph with a sudden and violent interruption what was the crime of salisbury is superior worth so odious and insupportable can envy prove so bloody  oftentimes said lord william have i seen death loading the fields of war with frightful carnage and never did my soul shrink at his approach but now when he appeared in the form of a calm and deliberate assassin i at once lost all firmness the cold dew issued from every pore i commended myself to heaven and lay entranced in dismay a hideous interval of suspense succeeded for the murderers had not yet appeared the torture of this delay was even worse than death to this i had resigned myself or even wished to receive it still i lay in stupid expectation of the fatal messengers of death and still their horrid deed was suspended a sudden and violent tumult recalled my dying senses the noise grew nearer and louder i started at the clash of arms i heard a groan the crowd pressed in upon me and i saw les roches my kind preserver his eyes darting rage and his weapon reeking with slaughter there lies the wretch said he who dared to lift his sword against my approach i threw myself into his bloody arms in a rapturous extacy of joy and gratitude and just found breath to exclaim gracious powers am i then rescued from the base murderers arm murder cried les roches for this horrid purpose then were thou detained here but it is well there wanted but this to confirm those brave spirits who feel and will revenge our wrongs no prisoner now no concealed fugitive lord william shall confront his enemy and take his free course undaunted and uncontrouled in the fair face of day and scorn the malice of this injurious count but haste  and let us join our friends  i obeyed the joyful summons but first searched for my armor which the guards whose power was now expired had taken from me the attendants of les roches buckled on my harness and i once more grasped my sword i issued forth as if restored from the grave accompanied by les roches and his companions leading away my guards whom they had overpowered and scarcely had we measured out the distance of an arrows flight when we descried a gallant troop marching toward us who raised a shout of triumph at our approach and received us with the joy of brethren and associates i expressed my surprise but was soon taught the reason of this appearance and the cause of my surprising change of fortune i now learned that malleon like the unskilful soldier who by the force of his own illdirected blow is oftentimes tumbled to the ground was defeated in the purposes of his malice by the blind and furious impetuosity of that very malice in his first rage of disappointed revenge he had injured and insulted a brave chief who had ranged his numerous adherents under the banners of this proud count and given their swords to support his power the gentle manners of les roches had ever commanded the affections of his adherents and now when they saw their chief thrust into the vile dungeon in contempt of all his former services and for no crime but the suspicion of having spared an helpless wanderer their mutiny like the noise of distant thunder though not violent was yet terrible and struck the ear with the threatenings of an approaching storm malleon quickly perceived the danger and endeavored to corred his hasty error by releasing les roches from his captivity but little did this ungracious condescension allay the ferment of his vassals little did the chief regard this extorted act of justice as the reparation due to his injured honor and little did it allay the ardor of his affection and solicitude for the man he now called his friend it was his first care to employ the liberty he had regained in my protection and with a few chosen followers he instantly hastened to the shore whither he had directed the faithful peasant to conduct me but salisbury was not to be found yet still flattered with the hope that my speed had prevented him and that i had already embarked he returned with his attendants to whom he distinctly related our first encounter in the island and his cares to defend me from the malice of my rival they were taught to love me to pity my fortunes and to rejoice in my supposed escape the infection spread among their associates i became the general object of their discourse when suddenly the peasant who had fled from me in wild affright to inform his master of my situation arrived and acquainted them that amidst all my dangers i had obstinately resolved not to abandon my friend but to share his fortune in despite of all the power and cruelty of malleon scarcely had he informed them of his own error and the place where he had left me when the news arrived of my being seized and detained until the count might declare his pleasure not the flashing lightning when it has broken in upon a forest of our stately oaks ever raised a more sudden and violent conflagration than these accounts kindled in the minds of the brave soldiers of les roches it was at once resolved for ever to abandon the service of a tyrannical and revengeful lord and to rescue me from his oppressive power but their chief wisely labored to temper and allay the violence which threatened to defeat it is own purpose by his persuasion it was determined to act with secrecy and caution to wait until darkness might conceal their motions and to choose the dead hour of midnight to surprise my guards and to snatch me from the cruel malice of my enemy eternal goodness that directed their hearts and guided their steps be witness for me with what gratitude i received my miraculous preservation no longer the helpless victim of fell revenge no longer crouching under the ruthless arm of a russian i felt my afflictions no more they vanished like a frightful dream which the cheerful beams of morning had dissipated and i now appeared as indeed a soldier encompassed by a hardy band in the gay trim of war to which the rising light gave new luster still farther irritated by the black design of murder loudly encouraging me to rely on their protection and to bid defiance to the ungenerous cruel count nor was this confidence slightly founded for i learned that by their revolt malleon was deprived of a force which fully equalled all that yet remained under his command  sect v they now marched on publicly disclaiming all obedience but to their chief les roches not as intending hostilities but determined to retire from the island and to demonstrate the sincerity of their declarations the guards lately overpowered were already freed and courteously dismissed nor was even the surviving ruffian detained count savoure could not look with unconcern at so alarming a defection in his troops all his remaining force was instantly collected and soon we were confronted by a considerable body led by the proud count that stopped our farther progress and while each party drew up in formidable array each was possessed with anxiety and expectation on our side a firm resolution to support our purpose to the last was unalterably fixed in every heart yet with humane concern and generous reluctance against shedding the blood of countrymen endeared by natural affection and a long social intercourse the little armies stood for a while in a state of sullen inaction lowering upon each other a delay which seemed to declare that neither presumed on any superiority and that both expected and desired a parley this was at length proposed by my friend and readily accepted  the commanders on each side advanced with a few attendants and first malleon proudly demanded the reason of this appearance of disloyalty and hostility les roches repelled his accusation by recounting the injuries that had been offered to his honor and independance urged the ungrateful returns made to his free and faithful services by a vile unprovoked imprisonment and declared that his sole purpose was to withdraw his arms from a lord who had loaded him with wrongs and disgrace to this the count replied that the present appearance discovered clearly the necessity and the justice of his late conduct that it now plainly appeared that les roches had united with his enemy and the enemy of his country to tear the island from him and that far from having oppressed or injured him nothing but his own mistaken lenity had enabled a false frenchman to proceed in this traitorous design for this had he rescued from him the man who had basely stolen upon his territory to corrupt his dependants and to arm them against their lord for this he had murdered his officer who gallantly opposed his unjust attempt and for this he now stood in arms ready to sacrifice his kinsmen and countrymen to the treacherous purpose of an englishman who did not dare to meet him bravely in the field but labored to destroy him by the secret practices of fraud and circumvention  to this my friend answered with a generous warmth that as my soul was incapable of a base design so my manner of coming into the island plainly removed all suspicions of any attempt against his government that cast as i was upon his shore helpless and unattended by any numbers that could create the least fear my endeavors had solely been exerted to elude his search and to regain my native country that all his own offense had been an endeavor though fruitless to favor the secret retreat of a noble enemy to whom he owed his life and liberty nor could he repent of his grateful efforts when no ransom was to be accepted no captivity or restraint was deemed sufficiently severe for a noble generous and unhappy lord when the ruffian had been hired to shed his blood and in the dead hour of night dared to lift the murderous dagger against his unoffending unsuspecting innocence  suspicion grief and indignation now raised a confused murmur among the attendants of malleon the same impressions together with the story of intended murder quickly reached their associates and spread contagiously through their lines while the anguish of confusion shame revenge and disappointment turned the aspect of count savoure to ghastly pale yet dreading the effects of this discovery he soon endeavored to assume a look of composure and conscious integrity exclaimed loudly against the infamous contrivance to destroy his honor and vehemently disavowed all intentions but such as were fully warranted by the laws of honorable war this declaration silenced the disorder in his troops whose honest hearts could not without regret believe their general guilty of so black an attempt he warmly repeated his professions of innocence and called for the soldier said to be accomplice to him in whose breast les roches had plunged his sword the steady villain now stood forth and assumed such a countenance as effectually concealed his falsehood from every human eye in the face of both the armies falling upon his knees and lifting up his eyes toward heaven he called on every saint to bear witness to his innocence and with horrid imprecations of the divine wrath declared that the only orders of his lord had been to treat their prisoner with respect and care befitting an illustrious soldier the constancy and the fair appearance of ingenuous sincerity which accompanied these solemn declarations failed not of their desired effect the troops of count malleon were fired with indignation and joyed to find that their commander had not acted unworthy of his own and of his countrys honor they expressed a violent and tumultuous rage against the author of this supposed calumny whilst the adherents of the good les roches were confounded and abased their eyes were turned upon me with suspicion and cold distrust the boldest among them ventured to break out into rude invectives and to propose that i should be instantly delivered up into the hands of their brave countryman whom i had so basely abused by my horrid imputations my enemy exulted my friend though still amply satisfied of my truth and honor was perplexed and grieved and the late of salisbury seemed to depend on a single moment of tumult and confusion when with an effort of desperate resolution i stepped forth and both parties hung upon me with looks of mute suspense and expectation i recounted plainly and clearly all my adventures since fortune had driven me to this unkind shore my departure from the abbey with a full intention of resigning myself into the power of the count in order to preserve my friend my being seized by the guards and detained on the spot where they had found me instead of being conducted to prison or to the presence of malleon a circumstance full of suspicion i described that dreadful night in all its horrors when i had been so wonderfully delivered from instant death and if any doubt remained of my truth and sincerity i offered to make my solemn appeal to heaven there said i casting down my gage i am ready to prove upon that recreant lord his vile falsehoods and to assert my own innocence and his dishonor in single combat  thou have seen two gallant bands closing with each other and for a while maintaining the conflict in terrible suspense pressed and receding recovering and pressing by turns until one mighty effort determines the fortune of the day and the whole tumultuous rout of vanquished and victors pour along the plain such had been the war of pailions in these two parties and such was now the force with which both were hurried away my bold challenge was received with an universal acclamation by men too zealous votaries of warlike glory and honor to desire that baseness and falsehood should be supported or concealed shame forbad the count to decline this hardy trial and though appalled by conscious guilt he accepted my defiance les roches whose friendly cares never were diverted from me demanded an interval of two days to restore my harassed mind and body to their native vigor and to prepare me for the encounter this could not be refused the time the place and every previous circumstance was soon adjusted as the laws of arms require and each party drew off in silent expectation of the event  on the second morning as i revolved my late dangers and indulged the pleasing thoughts of my fate being soon to be decided by the fair and honorable chance of arms an officer from count malleon appeared before the place of my residence and demanded admission to lord salisbury i received him accompanied by my friend count savoure said he thirsts not for thy blood it has been thy desire to depart this island in peace he commands me to acquaint thee that a barque is prepared and that thou may unopposed and unmolested seek thy native land he wishes not to detain thee nor regards the honor of vanquishing lord william as the least accession to his renown my eyes darted fiery indignation upon this messenger of abject fear i defy his power said i and scorn his friendship i stay not here by his permission and without his permission will i depart thinks he that an english lord will fully his fair fame and meanly steal away from honorable danger bear back my defiance to the man who could entertain so base a thought tell him i shall here wait and wait with impatience for the dawning of tomorrow the officer departed my friend embraced me with tears of joy whilst i felt my heart cheerful and dilated and from this overture derived an happy presage of victory  the morning of combat now appeared nor did i wait the summons of my friends but impatient for the great decision i prevented their officious care and stood before them in arms demanding to be conducted to the lifts these were prepared with every accustomed provision and defense against fraud or treachery and while i entered on one side attended by les roches and his chosen companions count savoure appeared with an equal number of attendants on the other darting looks of deadly hate rather than of manly valor we advanced toward each other not with the courtesy of honorable rivals but sullen and indignant silent and disdainful our assistants having first exacted the usual oaths in which we disclaimed all unlawful methods of defense all fraudulent or magical resources separated us from each other and pointed out our just stations here while our horses pawed the ground impatient to start forward we waited the signal of the trumpets when suddenly our attendants burst into the middle space and called upon us to dismount we obeyed and as i advanced toward the crowd of knights and squires i soon discovered my dear and reverend friend the abbot directing and commanding them with a paternal authority two were ordered to take charge of our horses and our weapons whilst the father approached and invited us to a private conference lord malleon said he hear me and tremble at thy presumption tempt not the wrath of heaven by exposing thyself to the hazard of arms in a cause which thou know is unjust and do thou lord william remember that thou art for bidden to seek a brutal revenge the count was just preparing to express his indignation at such a bold and unexpected interruption when the father surveying him with a look of pity mixed with some degree of scorn proceeded thus the wretch hired by thee to shed the blood of this unhappy lord though sorely wounded by les roches was yet left with some remains of life the peasants bore him to our house for relief and ghostly comfort there he expired but not before his parting breath had publicly declared the dreadful purpose  but i will not wound thy ears with the horrid recital alas thy shame is but too well known if thou have yet the smallest remains of goodness dare not by this combat to defy the award of heaven nor longer pursue this lord with causeless hatred my rival now seemed to shrink before me into all the meanness of disgrace and abject baseness whilst my triumph was more exalted than the most successful event of combat could have given my eyes were lighted up with indignation but my heart disdained reproaches whilst i embraced the reverend father and freely submitted my arms to his direction and control anguish shame remorse and envy seemed to tear the soul of malleon with their united tortures tears burst from him not the gentle drops of penitence but tears of vexation of disappointed and detected malice silent and trembling he seemed irresolute for some moments then in sullen and broken accents he just forced out i will not  depart  i will not fight with thee  my prisoner  yet i seek no ransom retire from this island and henceforth avoid my fury here a loud shout prevented my reply the soldiers of les roches by this time informed of the tidings which the abbot brought and which were no longer secret hastened to receive me with their gratulations and whilst they accompanied me to their camp the base count followed by a silent and dejected party marched away and covered his disgraced head in the recesses of his castle  book ii sect i the good old knight could not suppress his exultation at the final issue of this dangerous contest he pressed the hand of lord william with an affectionate warmth and congratulated him on his victory over his base and treacherous foe a victory much more complete much more mortifying to his rival than could possibly have been acquired by arms but the earl soon restrained his joy by acquainting him that this event did not put an end to his dangers randolph once more composed himself into a grave and earnest attention and lord william thus resumed the story of his fortunes  to retire from this odious scene of my calamity was now the great purpose upon which my soul was fixed i had leisure to indulge my wishes to regain my friends my country and my wife and earnestly entreated les roches to crown all his goodness by speedily recalling my countrymen and providing a vessel to convey us to the english shore he expressed his surprise and concern at this request he urged the danger of attempting a return without a force sufficient to defend me against an enemy who could not be a stranger to such a design and whose deadly hate must prompt him to arrest me in my passage no my friend said he attend us into france south of the city of poictiers my castle lies at no inconvenient distance from the coast thither permit me to conduct thee and thence with a retinue befitting his greatness shall earl william be attended in honor and security to england  the apprehensions of falling once more into the hands of malice and insolent revenge prevailed over my impatience and determined me to embrace this friendly counsel a few chosen followers were dispatched to rochelle where my countrymen lay in anxious expectation of their leader who informed them of our fortunes and after an interval of some days returned with all conveniences for transporting the forces of les roches our embarkation wore a gay and gallant aspect conducted with cheerfulness and zeal without fear of danger or control the last vessel had now received my friend and me and was on the point of leaving the shore when we discovered a soldier hastening down toward us and with extended arms entreating to he received we demanded his name and the reason of his extraordinary appearance alas cried he with that abasement which marks out calamity and oppression but yesterday the officer of malleon favored and honored by my leader now the victim of his wild revenge unless your protection shall deign to shield the unfortunate daumont here our attention was awakened and i soon discovered that he was that messenger who the morning before our intended combat had accosted me with those overtures which fear had extorted from malleon as he stood upon the beach with the passionate warmth of a sincere and deeplypierced mind the soldier thus proceeded when insolent revenge and cruelty point their ungenerous fury against a valiant but unfortunate rival what heart must not be moved and what brave son of war can conceal his indignation let the coward dissemble his emotions alas i have not learned his virtue nor know i that mean reserve which he calls prudence lord salisbury is the enemy of count savoure but a gallant and an honorable enemy let me ever emulate his exalted virtues and scorn the base and cruel envy that would oppress them we were soon no strangers to his fortunes and while the abject minions of a proud lord suppressed their pity my thoughts were not so obedient to control they forced their way boldly and surprised my fellow soldiers with the most ardent expressions of indignation at the malice of our leader whose flatterers treasured up the dangerous discourse and failed not to convey it faithfully to his ear and now daumont was marked out for destruction when rage and vengeance were ready to seize me i fled if my services may merit your protection use them and save me from ruin should savoure spare and forgive me witness ye holy angels this arm shall never draw it is weapon for that dishonorable lord no if i am abandoned let me wander in disgraceful obscurity let me feel the hard hand of want and poverty or let me die rather than be made perhaps the minister of bloody cruelty on some brave soldier who has become odious by his virtues  dangerous hypocrisy how exactly can thou assume the fairest semblances of goodness o why should generous and ingenuous minds be more particularly the prey of thine accursed artifice  we received him without the least difficulty or suspicion and his wiley arts of insinuation not only wrought us to pity but soon commanded our affections and implicit confidence on me his attention was perpetually engaged ever officious in performing all the little offices which bespoke respect and love his tears flowed instantly at the mention of my misfortunes his eyes were lighted up with indignation at the very name of my enemy if we spoke of his cruelty he trembled if of his cowardice he smiled with contempt or frowned with stern abhorrence in a word the ardor of his affection seemed not so much the effect of humanity as of a long an intimate and tender friendship les roches admired the virtues of this daumont nor could my heart refuse it is full return of affection and gratitude to such exalted goodness daumont became our friend and counselor he shared our thoughts and directed our actions  we were now happily ived at rochelle where i embraced my countrymen whose suspense and apprehensions were at length dispelled filled with joy and gay expectations we all advanced forward toward the domain of our kind protector confident of comfort and security under his hospitable roof his followers no longer deeming their services necessary to their lord and impatient to revisit their several habitations separated in their march and left us not wholly unattended but at the head of an inconsiderable body when we at length arrived at the castle of les roches here we had been taught to expect the cheerful welcome of affection and here we now looked for joy and congratulation the kind greetings of friends and the officious cares of domestics but alas we had entered the mansion of sorrow on every face sat silent grief and consternation and chilled our souls with terrible apprehensions my friend cast his eyes round with the most earnest anxiety sometimes they turned on me now on his attendants at length he rushed precipitately from us and traversed the apartments as if in search of something particularly dear to him i looked upon daumont who seemed equally astonished and equally uninformed of the cause of this strange disorder some few broken exclamations of surprise and solicitude were all that my tongue could utter tortured with expectation and impatience to know the worst that fortune threatened i eagerly waited the return of my friend certain to receive the news of some calamity but utterly incapable of forming the least conjecture of its nature circumstances or extent les roches prolonged his absence to a tedious and afflicting length at last a domestic appeared and called for daumont who as he departed turned upon me with a look of surprise and concern then vanished and lest me to all the torture of uncertainty a thousand extravagant conjectures did my fancy form and reject by turns my countrymen equally perplexed and agitated gazed on me and each other in silent astonishment good heaven what new wonders for what are we reserved thus did i exclaim and in that moment some attendants entered and with courteous and gentle demeanor inviting us to follow conducted us to several chambers where refreshment was provided with all hospitable care yet in all the silence and solemnity of sorrow thrice did i essay to speak my wonder and as often did fear suppress my voice still my friend delayed his appearance but after a tedious and distracting interval daumont at length stood before me with an aspect which redoubled all that horror which my soul had for some time felt i eagerly enquired about les roches alas said he i know not what sudden gloom has possessed this baron he has long since departed with a few attendants on me devolves the command of this castle i am now his officer and must implicitly obey his orders and his orders are that the lord of salisbury should be entertained with all due honors a prisoner indeed but a noble prisoner the rigours of his consinement must be duly allayed by respect and careful attention i started and exclaimed  prisoner confinement explain this wonder such said he are the commands of les roches this chamber must content thee the guards who are to confine thee within these bounds are enjoined the strictest vigilance yet with due deference and care to do thee service do i dream cried i is this real is this my hospitable reception then pressing the hand of daumont whose dejected looks seemed to promise sympathy and tender pity i eagerly urged him to give me the whole story of this surprising change again indulging my distractions is les roches false to me said i o no it cannot be the good the tender the affectionate les roches my friend my preserver do not wrong his virtues it cannot be where is he why delays he o wretch why do thou torment my soul with idle terrors  the frenchman appeared violently moved at my disorder his tears for he could command tears flowed freely his sighs were deep and frequent and his voice broken and interrupted at length as if recollecting some share of reason and calm reflection unhappy lord said he too truly have i declared thy situation but what has moved les roches to this or for what fortunes earl william is reserved alas is yet a secret to daumont too true it is that some extraordinary event has called away the lord of this place perhaps he has found it necessary to deliver thee back into the power of malleon perhaps he has rescued thee from the rage of that proud count that he may have the glory of displaying to his countrymen an illustrious captive won by himself but i fear his virtue most yes it must be so he has indeed preserved thee from the treacherous attempts of base envy but his duty to his prince and to his country forbids him to restore to england the champion that has fought her battles against france o rigid sense of duty that thus tears asunder the bands of nature and friendship happy daumont whose soul aspires not to such high unfeeling virtue who cannot resist the tender solicitations of pity let me ever indulge the kind emotion uncontrouled by rigorous scruples or splendid notions of duty too severe and too exalted for humanity  these suggestions exactly answered to his purpose my soul was too much disordered to examine them by the rules of calm deliberate reason and the emotion which he assumed increased my inward tumult and gave him entire possession of my heart in this fatal moment the tenderness the zeal the solicitude the sufferings of les roches all vanished from my thoughts i had even forgotten the confusion which appeared in his castle on our arrival and his own surprise and concern i had forgotten that some unexpected event must have torn him from me i imputed his absence to no other cause but the shame of encountering the looks and reproaches of a man whom he had betrayed and all confused and distracted as i was resigned myself entirely to the influence of this new friend whose power was like that of those infernal imps who they say command the winds to roar or to be still and the waves to swell or to subside as their wicked purposes require as he depressed or roused me i melted into grief or raged in all the violence of vain and impotent indignation i now considered myself as an helpless prey doomed to inevitable destruction surrounded on all sides by my hunters and fatally lured to their toils nor was daumont at all sollicitious to dispel my fears he expatiated on the horrors of a dungeon on the wretchedness of captivity the cruel tyranny of exasperated enemies and rivals the loss of friends and honors years of bondage spent in gloomy solitude in useless inaction the gazing curiosity of the base and ignoble the insolence and triumphant scorn of the coward who had perhaps trembled at my sword and fled from my arm in battle then as if afraid to dwell upon the terrible idea he just hinted at the tears of my friends and the sorrow of an helpless widowed wife  have thou never heard that the enemy of mankind oftentimes presents shocking and frightful phantoms before the eyes of the holy hermit in order to distract his thoughts and to confound his purposes such were the arts by which this frenchman practiced upon my soul i started up in a sudden fit of fury and extravagance i cursed my own blindness and folly that had betrayed me into the power of my enemies and when i had once escaped had seduced me into france instead of steering directly for the shore of england then madly seizing d aumont i thundered out terrible execrations on his head and wild menaces of vengeance as an accomplice in cursed treachery he trembled and with silent looks and tears seemed kindly to reproach my unjust suspicions then in broken and imperfect words appeared to struggle with his passions and complained of the wrong done to his friendship i instantly melted into all the tenderness of grief and affection and ardently embracing the frenchman i acknowledged my error and requested his assistance and counsel in this my dangerous situation alas said he if i am true to salisbury i must betray les roches hard situation for the soldier who owes exact obedience to the dictates of duty and honor but too well i feel that my heart is not secured against the assaults of pity yes i am thine and wholly thine here he clasped me in his arms and thus proceeded i must deliver thee and one moments delay may deprive me of that power here we must not abide let us depart together and let me share thy fortune some friends i have that shall receive and comfort thee i know the way that leads to the coast and will conduct thee thence may lord salisbury soon find the means of returning to his native country and thither for thou will not leave me to the mercy of our common unemies shall d aumont attend thee i heard him with eagerness and implicit confidence without pause or reflection i submitted to his guidance and in that very hour we both departed from the castle  sect ii thus had i rashly ventured forth into a wide and unknown scene of danger under the direction of a false guide whose treachery was soon discovered it was night and the moon cast her mild gleam over all the prospect that lay before us daumont repeated his assurances of friendship spoke with cheerfulness and confidence encouraging me to hope and to fix my reliance on his services i expected every instant to be conducted to some place of retirement and friendly recepiton sometimes i expressed my uneasiness but ever and anon my guide practiced his arts of soothing persuasion and flattering professions to allay my fears thus we proceeded for some hours at length in our tedious progress we passed by the skirts of a thick forest from whence our ears were first pierced with shrill and lamentable shrieks as if from a female voice and instantly afterward there issued out a small number of armed men who surrounded us and demanded our names and quality my companion nothing alarmed at this appearance made the like enquiries on his part and learned that they were the soldiers of chauvigny lord of poictiers i seek that lord said he when one of the soldiers surveying him attentively replied daumont  i know thee now what from count malleon i started at the hideous name and turning on my companion perceived that the blood had deserted his cheeks and that he stood in violent agitations but ere i could express my wonder retiring a sew paces from me he cried out there stands lord salisbury my purpose was to conduct him to poictiers he is now your prisoner and let him be quickly conveyed to your lord i stood confounded for a moment at this astonishing treachery then quickly drawing my sword i ran furiously upon d aumont nor was it without the utmost difficulty that the soldiers restrained my just vengeance overpowered and disarmed me then leading me into the wood we joined some others of their body who were intently engaged on a spectacle of pity  a youth who seemed just rising to manhood of graceful form tall of stature and with limbs of perfect shape lay sorely wounded upon the ground languid pale and bloody over him hung one in the habit of a page younger and still more exquisitely beautiful piercing the air with lamentations and eagerly employed in binding up the wounds of the fallen youth with locks of comely auburn torn from a fair though dishevelled head no sooner bad the soldiers proclaimed my name to their associates than the page turning upon me with a face which discovered one of natures most lovely productions sullied and disordered by grief just exclaimed o fatal cause of all my misery then bending down again as if disdaining attention to any but one favorite object resumed the charitable cares of assisting and supporting the wounded youth who by this time revived from his trance and cast a languid look of love and tenderness upon his kind companion o jacqueline said he are we then prevented but thou have escaped the present danger nor shall force tear me from thee or time efface thy remembrance this was answered with deep sighs and tender looks which spoke an affection ardent and powerful though controuled by the presence of strangers every word and every action increased my surprise utterly unable to conceive how any part of the distress i now beheld could be imputed to me i attempted with all courtesy to accost the page who on the other hand had no eyes no ear no voice for me but how was my astonished soul afflicted and confounded when one of the soldiers casually discovered that this page was no other than a young maiden and daughter to les roches whilst she was busily employed about the wounded youth and with the assistance of some soldiers raising him from the ground i turned to daumont with looks of rage and anguish wretch said i explain this wonder is this the work of thy cursed treachery no proud lord replied the false frenchman this youth is son to count chauvigny whose prisoner i have made thee but were he mine enemy i am no murderer witness for me that if my nature had been cruel i might have plunged the dagger into thine own heart what though i promised malleon to use all my art to separate thee from thy protector and to betray thee into the power of the lord of poictiers yet i scorn the base work of blood i have used my art and with success i have served my country and my chief to whose hand the laws of war and thy fate consign thee and to whom thou shall be soon restored by his friend chauvigny  i prepared to retort this insolence when the soldiers interrupted and commanded me to attend them to poictiers whither we now bent our course the wounded youth being supported by the soldiers and followed by the sorrowful jacqueline but scarcely had we proceeded a few paces when another and a larger body of armed men was discovered rushing precipitately across the plain my guards nothing doubting but that these were friends took no pains to avoid their approach as they poured down upon us their leader cast his eyes on me and with plain marks of surprise pronounced my name when instantly the whole party fell with the utmost fury upon my guards they in vain endeavored to support an unequal contest encouraged by the voice and actions of daumont who fought with desperate rage impatient to take a share in this encounter i suddenly snatched my sword from the soldier who had seized it and flew upon my betrayer but ere i could execute my just vengeance his false heart was pierced by another arm my guard were at length wholly overpowered a few lay bleeding the rest yielded their arms and were made prisoners together with the wounded youth and his fair attendant almost expiring with terror and astonishment  and now i learned from my deliverers some part of that distress in which i had involved the good les roches and the danger which i had escaped hear the story as it was then and afterward unfolded still more clearly the delay of our embarkation from the isle of the had given the implacable malleon an opportunity of dispatching a messenger to lord chauvigny by whom he accused les roches of practices against his government and of wresting from him a prisoner of so much consequence as salisbury this lord fired at the supposed injury offered to his friend seized the castle of les roches with the too common violence of a neighboring and more powerful baron and carried off his only daughter as a pledge for my surrender if still in the hands of les roches or as a means of awakening my sense of honor and gratitude and thus obliging me to return if already dismissed hence the grief and confusion of the domestics at our arrival and hence the disorder of my friend who dreading my impetuosity and well remembering how rashly i had resolved to deliver myself to count malleon in order to gain his liberty determined to conceal from me the cause of this disorder and to try what might be effected by force of arms for the rescue of his daughter daumont with whom he consulted and to whom he spoke his fears of my precipitate generosity commended his resolution and at he prepared for immediate departure in order to collect his force the false frenchman proposed that to himself should be committed the care of preventing me from leaving the castle in his absence how he abused this trust thou haft already heard but heaven was pleased to make his treachery the means of my preservation chauvigny who was still further informed of our approach and of the weakness of our retinue determined to make himself master both of mine and of the person of my friend and no sooner had i departed from the castle under the conduct of my perfidious guide than it was again seized by a force detached for that purpose whilst another body hastening to support their associates accidentally encountered les roches dispersed his followers and were only prevented from seizing him by the desperate valor of my seven englishmen whose attendance he had required and who now with difficulty secured his retreat a number of his followers thus dispersed fled with precipitate haste toward their private haunts for present security and to collect new force for the deliverance of their chief and in their flight proved my deliverers  they now submitted to my direction and invited me to share their fortune and by my persuasion they dismissed the soldiers of chauvigny together with his wounded son i embraced the youth at his departure who seemed confounded and ashamed at the violence with which his father pursued a stranger thus superior to revenge his eyes were turned on jacqueline whose looks and tears expressed all the anguish of separation but the daughter of my dearest friend was a treasure not to be entrusted to the mercy of an enemy and she was therefore detained however reluctant my deliverers anxious for our security conveyed us with rapid speed to the fastness of an high and dreary mountain where an humble cottage received and the kind offices of honest poverty relieved us and here this maid whose beauty created love and reverence in the breast of every beholder informed me freely of her dangers and distress soon as she had been conveyed to the castle of poictiers the young chauvigny already no stranger to the charms of jacqueline visited the fair prisoner and endeavored to allay her sorrows beauty when distressed is doubly powerful and when pity unites with love no heart can resist their impression this the youth experienced his soul became totally subdued nor could he conceal the generous weakness he pleaded in all the most affecting accents of a sincere and ardent passion nor did he plead in vain the maid too susceptible of tenderness and too artless to conceal her sensibility heard him with indulgence approved his worth nor frowned on his love yet still a greatness and elevation of soul gave dignity to her female softness she demanded a strong and to a lover a severe proof of his sincerity restore me to my father said she then speak thy passion he entreated wept and conjured she answered as before till at length the youth consented to the painful task of approving his sincerity by parting with the dear object of his passion a habit was provided to conceal the maid and at the appointed hour when guards had been bribed and suspicion lulled to sleep she issued forth under the conduct of her lover and directed her eager steps toward her fathers castle and fatal had been the end of this rash design had not heaven wonderfully interposed they had advanced considerably in their progress filled with gay hopes and insensible to danger when some lawless rovers of the night arrested and began to rifle them the young lord patiently submitted to their depredations but alarmed for his dear companion and anxious to conceal the secret of her sex from brutal violence he called upon them to spare the page and with loud denunciations of vengeance wildly assailed the wretch who was preparing to strip his jacqueline a sudden wound laid him on the earth the forest echoed with the shrieks of the distracted maid and in that moment the soldiers sent in pursuit of them for their departure was not long concealed happily appeared in view and drove the robbers from their prey  sect iii i adored the preserving hand of heaven whose influence had appeared so evidently in these events the treachery of daumont in seeking to destroy me had opportunely conveyed me from the power of my enemies the violence and oppression of chauvigny had proved the means of sending me deliverers when fortune seemed most to frown upon me and of giving up his own son to my mercy i was now at liberty if an obscure and comfortless retreat could deserve that name i had delivered an helpless maid the dear child and precious treasure of my friend from the power of an oppressor i was attended by honest and faithful followers resolute to protect and zealous to oblige me yet still my soul was anxious for the fortune of the kind and generous les roches whose virtues seemed to have drawn down ruin upon his injured head some emissaries i sent forth from time to time to learn his fate but no intelligence of his situation could be obtained his castle was deserted his friends dispersed he himself lost in some obscure retirement with my gallant englishmen or perhaps slain by the malice of his pursuers the proud lord of poictiers had in the name of his prince unwarrantably assumed to support his oppression proclaimed him a traitor and denounced death against those who should presume to assist him such was the rage and malice of disappointed pride  i joined my tears with those of the charming jacqueline at these afflicting tidings weeks and months passed away in the tortures of anxious uncertainty though careless of my own fate yet i felt the tenderest concern for my dear charge whom i conducted from one retreat to another as the alarm of danger drove us forward or the advice of our followers directed my cares had now taught her to love me as a parent and preserver and the magnanimity which she discovered amidst all her dangers and difficulties commanded my respect and admiration she endured fatigue not only with cheerfulness but joy and as if from her infant years inured to poverty and hardships she seemed to have retained no memory of the ease and softness of prosperity nor did the tear ever start from her eye but at the recollection of her father a courage above her sex and a surprising recollection and command of thought much beyond her years never once deserted her in the most trying moments so that whoever beheld her manly garb and observed her determined spirit must have supposed that i was attended by a youth not yet initiated in arms but eagerly ambitious to become a soldier and impatient to enter on the course of gallant action and renown she it was who first proposed the design of quitting these ignoble retreats and endeavoring to find her father now when time had abated the ardor of our enemys pursuit and she too suggested the disguise which effectually concealed us from jealousy and malice by the assistance of our faithful adherents the habit of a palmer was provided for each and thus accoutred we ventured forth from our retreat i the father she the blooming son whilst a few zealous and humble friends themselves disguised watched our steps at some distance and waited to repel our dangers long time we journied on and often were we indebted to the kind offices of charity undiscovered and unsuspected often times have i gratified the curious peasant whose hospitable door was opened for our reception with the recital of hardy deeds achieved by his noble countrymen when the christian powers united against the infidel and oftentimes have i repeated my tale to gain his confidence and to lead him to some discoveries that might direct me to my friend but never could we receive the least information of les roches or of his fortunes oblivion seemed to have involved him in her gloomy shades deserted abandoned and forgotten by his unkind ungrateful countrymen yet ever and anon the remembrance of his goodness and the thought of those calamities in which i had involved him recurred to torment my soul nor was the melancholy idea ever absent from the mind of jacqueline  our excursions were prolonged to a tedious and oppressing length sometimes the heavy hand of fatigue and languor pressed sore upon my dear companion and called for all my care and tenderness and these were again amply repaid when the violent and complicated griefs that preyed upon my heart threatened me with some heavy malady thus wandering on and wearied in a fruitless search chance rather than our own determination led us to the sea coast where the wide extended scene displayed before me awakened all my eager wisher to revisit england oftentimes did i cast my eyes forward toward that seat of honor and security and as often did they turn back on france as if in search of my dear and injured friend not my own fortunes only were now the object of my thoughts jacqueline the child of my preserver the partner of his sorrows and his sufferings demanded a share in my solicitude i had still gold to bribe the sailor to convey us to a harbor of safety i could not bear the thought of leaving this precious pledge of friendship to the care of poor and helpless followers and yet my soul was pained when i made an effort to persuade her to seek refuge in an unknown country and to resign her last faint hopes of embracing a beloved parent here all my address was employed and every flattering suggestion urged to quiet her anxiety all our disappointed enquiries i converted into arguments of the caution and vigilance of les roches which must have effectually concealed him from the malice of his pursuers i spoke of my own influence in the english court of the military power i could command and conjured her to rest assured that nothing was wanting for his protection but my appearance in england that there i could command authority and power sufficient to support his rights and redress his injuries her great soul was animated with new vigor and resolution at the thoughts of redress and with a firmness which would have done honor to the bolder sex she freely consented to submit to my direction and declared herself ready to attend me  our two followers whose unwearied zeal had not yet lost sight of us were now employed to procure a vessel to convey us from the land of danger and oppression as two pilgrims engaged by solemn vows to visit the lately erected shrine of st thomas of canterbury the same of which had not been confined to england some days past in expectation of their success an interval which was employed in comforting my fair charge and confirming her resolution on the morning of a vernal day we wandered forth from the charitable cottage that lately had received us to indulge our gentle conference without fear or control the sun was climbing to his meridian height and warned us to repose under the shade of a steeply rising hill whose trees nodded over us and embrowned the neighboring plain here we had not long reclined when the noise of jocund mirth struck our ears and called our attention to two travelers who lay at some distance sharing their friendly meal i started and listened to the well known sounds i heard my own native lays sweetly rehearsing the renowned deeds of arthur valiant prince the ancient wars of ambrose the armoric knight and the triumphs of british valor i melted into tears such are the tender emotions which the love of country raises in our breasts then rushing impetuously toward the travelers i gazed on them with astonishment they sprung from the ground no less surprised and i embraced two of my dear countrymen and late companions they surveyed me with joy and wonder they acquainted me that their fellows were at hand they asked by what miracle i had been preserved but i at once stopped their enquiries by demanding to know the fate of les roches their cold and mournful looks at the mention of this name chilled the blood of jacqueline who had by this time joined us say said she in breathless agitation when how where did les roches perish could not his followers defend him or did they desert him perfidious men where were their coward swords when the malice of his persecutors tore his poor helpless body no faithful friend to defend him no charitable hand to close his dying eyes here a flood of tears broke forth while my countrymen wondered at her emotion and eager to remove her suspicions declared that les roches had wanted neither fidelity nor courage to defend him lives he cried the maid where lead me to him and again resigned herself to sorrow when the englishmen declared that they were strangers to his fate nor knew his place of residence if yet alive i interposed to moderate her passion then turning to my friends demanded the full relation of their fortunes since treachery and oppression had last torn us from each other  they had been persuaded as i now learned that i must have been seized in the castle and that i now lay under the severe oppression of captivity as les roches had instantly acquainted them with the secret of his daughters being conveyed to poictiers with his apprehensions of my precipitate zeal and the measures he had taken to prevent any rash purpose of throwing myself into the hands of my pursuers they had attended him in his sudden excursion to collect his forces and in the gallant act of defending him they had been particularly animated by fitzalan the man whose inconsiderate error had first disclosed my name in the isle of the and who now fought with redoubled sury to atone for his fatal imprudence he it was who when les roches lay surrounded and disarmed hewed his way through unequal numbers and led the brave englishmen to his rescue they took their course from his direction and conveyed him to the neighboring hills where secret and unvisited retreats received him and where the vigilance and bravery of his followers guarded against the approach of frand and violence his own countrymen awed by the denunciations of chauvigny deserted their unhappy chief the helpless and abandoned victim of fatigue and want the woods supplied his nourishment the naked turf received his devoted head whilst the sidelity and affection of his associates watched his broken slumbers long time had they attended him from one retreat to another through a series of uniform distress without any new or extraordinary change of fortune till on one fatal morning they whose industry bad been employed in hunting for food and they who had the charge of watching near his humble couch were struck with confusion and surprise when they came to seek their leader he had suddenly disappeared nor could their most diligent enquiries learn his new residence or inform them of his fate and now impatient of their situation and determined rather to yield themselves into the hands of their enemies than to waste a tedious life in distressful and useless retirement they descended from their mountains and boldly adventured into more known and more frequented paths here they soon found that the hopes of regaining england were not yet to be resigned pursuit and difficulty had ceased they passed on unnoticed and unmolested and at length gained the coast where we were now all happily assembled  the vessel lay ready to receive us we embarked with joy yet still cautious to guard against malice and hostility i continued my disguise the winds were long unfavourable and frequently were our souls terrified with the most alarming menaces of destruction twice did i embrace my lovely charge in firm persuasion that i had taken my last and final farewell and that the approaching hour must have consigned us to one general ruin yet still the holy saints denied not their protection courage and vigor unabated successfully contended against the angry elements harassed wasted and oppressed with toil we at length gained the cheering prospect of our dear native shore here out shattered vessel happily arrived and here we repose our wearied limbs under your hospitable protection  sect iv the earl ceased and randolph who had listened with exact attention paused for a moment in thoughtful silence raised his eyes and hands to heaven in rapturous admiration and grateful acknowledgement of that power which had hitherto conducted his friend safely through this variety of peril and distress then freely exclaimed at the envy of malleon the tyranny of chauvigny and the treachery of daumont with all the zeal of generous indignation and abhorrence his tears confessed that pity with which he thought on the cruel sat of les roches and infected the earl with a render emotion of grief for the misfortunes of his dear peril and distress then freely exclaimed at the envy of malleon the tyranny of chauvigny and friend and protector he had not entertained the least suspicion but that his own misfortunes were now completely ended that any thing more remained but to repair to his castle and comfort his solitary countess yet now when restored to a degree of tranquillity he again offered at some enquiries on his part of his house his son and wife but was instantly interrupted by randolph who reminded him of rest the night was far spent fatigue and sleep which the agitation raised by the recital of his adventures had hitherto repelled now resumed their power and invaded him with double force he retired and at last enjoyed the comfort to him long unknown of peaceful and secure repose  age had made randolph watchful he rose before the dawn and was soon joined by the attendants of lord william who advanced to greet their host and to acknowledge his generous cares their mutual salutations were cordial and affectionate the englishmen seemed to have forgot their toils lusty and spirited they stood accoutred and prepared to meet their leader earnest to tender their services and impatient to accompany his progress nor did they long wait for the appearance of lord william he had sprung from his couch refreshed and restored to life and vigor and now came forth to embrace the companions of his labors and to repeat his congratulations my friends said randolph bear with us for a moment i have something which demands the private attention of the earl  yet  no  it need not be concealed from you your counsels may assist us thus speaking he led the way toward a private apartment whither he was followed by the earl and his companions not without some degree of wonder and anxious expectation  randolph cast his eyes downwards for some moments and was silent then turning them on lord william for what fortunes said he this earl is preserved i know not but tranquillity seems yet to be removed to some distance from his grasp something still remains to exercise his spirit raymond nephew to that hubert whose councils govern our king now possesses his castle there and through all it is district he governs with an absolute sway  what cried salisbury is my power er expired do i indeed live or have my rights been forfeited  where were my friends has my countess been ignominiously driven out by the usurper is this the reward of my services  randolph here repressed his violence and demanding a calm and patient attention the knight thus proceeded  we all know with what uncontrouled power hubert rules in the court of england how his subtle arts of insinuation have penetrated into the inmost heart of our henry and now direct all it is motions and designs already too dangerous he seeks but to extend his influence and authority and to heap wealth and honors on his family and dependents these are his great purposes and to these he sacrifices the reputation of his master and the welfare of his country to him was soon conveyed the false intelligence that earl william and his knights separated from our fleet in the tempestuous tumult had perished in the deep the king heard the tidings with kind concern and paid the just tribute of sorrow to his unhappy kinsman and brave soldier the crafty hubert assumed the semblance of grief whilst his soul was busy in contriving the means of turning this event to his own interested purposes he seized the easy and complying moment when the king lay most open to his influence he represented the close alliance in which raymond his good nephew stood to the illustrious house of salisbury he reminded him that by the royal bounty lord william had obtained the heiress of that house with her possessions and urged that the same royal bounty ought now to confer this gift on him whom nature seemed to point out as the true inheritor in a word he asked this boon that raymond should be permitted to wed the countess now supposed a widow and to enjoy her ample fortunes and her honors  heavens exclaimed the earl this man admitted to her bed  am i so soon forgotten what not a few months of sorrow  think not hardly of the countess said randolph her dignity of soul  yes cried william again interrupting him i know it  it cannot be  proceed and give me all those strange events  the king replied randolph granted his suit without difficulty go said he command raymond to prepare for his departure let him summon all his address and eloquence to prevail upon the gentle countess no easy conquest she no common prize my grace waits on her consent  consent impossible cried salisbury when randolph again endeavoring to allay the heat of his impatience earnestly united his entreaties with those of the earls companions and at length obtained a patient audience  raymond thus the old knight proceeded was not slow to accept this gracious condescension to his wishes supported by the power of hubert enriched by his bounty and attended by the flattering followers of his prosperity this lord soon prepared all necessaries for a magnificent and stately progress he left the english court which now graced the city of marlborough with it is residence for thither the indisposition of our liege had caused it to be transferred and at the head of a gallant troop of knights armed and caparisoned in all their courtly pride and splendour and implicitly obedient to their leader he proceeded toward the castle of salisbury the humble villagers gazed on this gay troop with surprise and pleasure were soon informed of their purpose and soon spread the story through all the neighboring land the countess had already learned the melancholy tidings of her lord and indulged her griefs in secret when roused by the appearance of this retinue and nothing suspecting the purpose of raymond she opened her gates wide to his approach and received him and his attendants with all hospitable rites befitting her own nobility and the greatness of her guests to raymond she appeared in all the dignity of grief holding her young son a fair copy of her beauty and her sorrow and if fame speaks true the charms of the majestic mourner had in that moment too powerful an influence upon the heart of raymond love came in aid of his ambition and inflamed the ardor of his pursuit with all those soothing arts which courts and their polished converse had bestowed he labored to dispel her gloom and cautiously to introduce the great purpose of his arrival long time he suspended his declaration such is the controuling power of beauty surrounded by the awful beams of chaste and graceful dignity yet in every interview was his passion confirmed and increased at length so have we been informed he spoke his suit with humble and anxious hesitation and was received with surprise and scornful denial  whilst the knight thus spoke a succession of violent passions had distracted the mind of lord william his eyes first expressed an earnest and tumultuous impatience he trembled and the blood retired from his cheeks then rushed back to resume it is seat with double force and glowed with fiery indignation again his tender looks declared with what love and gratitude and sympathizing pity he felt the sorrows of his beloved countess impatience and anxiety again succeeded and when the knight paused his looks had grown great and elevated and a sudden exclamation of triumph broke involuntarily from his lips what remains said he but that we now go and resume our authority what is wanting but our presence to relieve our countess from this importunate wooer come my friends let us haste away let us break through that cloud of obscurity which has too long concealed us and confound the men who grasp at our rights and honors with such a precipitate and rash presumption shall ela weep and i delay to comfort her shall proud intrusion break upon her privacy and irritate her grief and do i not fly to relieve her beware replied the knight with looks of sage and rigid caution beware of violence consult not with thy passions thy countess has i hope maintained her firmness and constant purpose to the last should she  but i cannot fear it  yet still raymond is in possession of thy castle he acts as lord of thy land and inheritor of thy power can thou behold this usurpation calm and unmoved trust me i dread thy impetuous resentment raymond is proud and insolent hubert crafty dark and revengeful the injurious never can forgive shame and disappointment may drive him to desperate resolutions  alas i cannot speak half my fears  this mysterious language of the knight who however he suppressed his fear really dreaded a fatal compliance in the countess and formed the most terrible presages of broils and blood kindled up a sudden flame in the breast of salisbury heavens cried he if raymond should have already  i see the danger of my situation  but let us quickly seek this invader randolph now seemed to condemn his own apprehensions which he observed might arise from doubtful or mistaken information his retirement had rendered him the more liable to be deceived and despair of ever seeing the return of his friend had made him less solicitous in his enquiries however he still urged caution and calm procedure he advised that some friends should be sent forward to the castle to declare the approach of earl william this said he will give an opportunity to raymond to retire without the shame of encountering the severity of his aspect who comes to drive him from his usurped state and without provoking thee to some rash deed of ungoverned passion then shall we follow and peace joy and conjugal affection shall receive thee the earl approved his counsel and consented to the desires of his companions who pressed to be the harbingers of his approach they instantly took these way whilst randolph dispatched his messengers to summon such a number of dependants as might afford an honorable conduct to the earl together with the fair jacqueline who now came forth not in her disguise but in a female garb though not magnificent yet better suited to display her modest graces and to give new luster to her beauty it was resolved that for a few days they should continue with the hospitable knight an interval tedious and distracting to the earl whose mind was filled with doubts and fears impatient to know more than had already been received from the imperfect intelligence of his host yet dreading to hear something which might fatally wound his peace  end of book ii book iii sect i whatever sadlyboding thoughts were entertained by lord william little did they correspond with that weight of anguish which by this time had oppressed his wife in whose castle the insolence and cruelty of raymond and his creatures had taken their lawless course free from control his first appearance had been courteous and gentle befitting a noble visitant nor did he disclose his purpose till he had gained the fair opinion of the unsuspecting countess love and wedlock when first made his theme sounded like notes jarring and discordant to the ear exactly tuned to harmony and when he urged his suit directly a sudden flood of tears confessed her inward emotion such tears as indignation and disdain force from the eyes of distressed greatness and highborn pride raymond stood amazed and vain were his repeated endeavors to compose her disorder at length her passions thus found an utterance and do thou know me have thou ever heard that the greatness of soul which has invariably distinguished my long train of mighty ancestry is lost in me  one year has not yet elapsed since these arms embraced my honored lord but had the grave long since received him had time dried up my widows tears think thou that the widow of a plantagenet  but why talk i thus  how know thou what officious babbling slave has flattered thee with the lying story that lord william lives no longer that the great light of england is extinguished and that raymond may now rise and shine  it is false  i will not think it yet yet will i hope for his return should he find thee here and this thy purpose what could defend lord raymoud from his resentment thou know the mighty spirit earl william fly this moment and tempt not thy fate nay never frown how would one single glance of his princely eye confound that haughty confidence know presuming lord that the slightest probability of his appearance should strike thee with terror thus saying she turned scornfully away lovely even in her disdain and suddenly left her suitor in wonder and confusion who too deeply affected by her beauty to submit to this repulse solicited entreated and at length rather forced than was admitted to a second interview earnestly did he urge his love and with all the gentle eloquence of a sincere and ardent passion just to the deserts of of earl william he acknowledged his high worth and his own inferior merit but the hopes of his return he treated as desperate and unreasonable and exerted all his art to banish from her thoughts the memory of a man whom fate had long since buried in eternal oblivion  behold this boy said the countess clasping her young son in him at least salisbury still lives and never can his mourning wife resign the dear melancholy remmembrance of his greatness while this precious pledge of former love this lively image of a noble and honorable father remains to sooth her sorrow behold him see how all the princely dignity of william already sits displayed in his youthful front and wonder not that ela never can descend to any other passion  thus obstinate and inexorable the countess ever added scorn and reproof to her denial insulted the love and stung the pride of raymond whose disgrace was soon no secret to his attendants of these the first and principal in his confidence was a man nurtured in courts long practiced in the arts of flattery and the homage of dependence trained to watch the looks the smiles the frowns of a superior to aid his pleasures to indulge his passions to love to hate as he directed with an obsequiousness equalled only by the insolence and oppression which he dealt out with unfeeling severity to all beneath him subtle and expert he was in the arts of fraud and circumvention ever attentive to his own private intetest patient persevering and sagacious in the means of advancing it his name was gray to him raymond unbosomed his disordered thoughts lamented his despised love and the unrelenting pride of ela which threatened to blast all his hopes of ambition the flatterer expressed the utmost indignation and as if the resolution of the countess had been unwarranted and injurious injurious to the honor and dignity of raymond he censured him with an artful semblance of sincerity and zeal as if he himself had been the cause of his own repulse he accused him of indulging the perverseness and pride of this high dame by the humble and abject strain of his addresses he persuaded him that in this place he was now absolute lord and inheritor who should command and not entreat graced as he was by the royal favor and supported by the power of hubert the slightest hint was more than sufficient to inflame the pride of raymond he yielded entirely to the pleasing delusion and already fancied himself undoubted heir of the house of salsbury and master of its ample domain the conditions on which the king had assented to his petition were totally forgotten and he now determined to act agreeably to that high character in which his imagination had arrayed him and to extort that compliance to his wishes which his solicitations could not obtain every thing was disposed at his command and the domestics and inhabitants of the castle taught to acknowledge a new lord to the countess he affected to appear not as an humble lover but an imperious sovereign master yet awed by her dignity and beauty he acted this part not without constraint and shame and still repulsed and still despised he required all the artifice and flattery of gray to suport him in his purpose yet this extraordinary change could not fail to alarm the fears of the countess with surprise and helpless indignation she found herself the prisoner of her guest her usual attendants were removed and new domestics assigned the creatures of her enemy who performed the due offices to her and to her infant son not without respect and care but with sullen silence and reserve and all her words and actions were free to the observation of strange and unfriendly keepers if raymond ventured to appear in her presence for still he dreaded the severity of her frown with wild dismay yet with the dignity of injured greatness she demanded an explanation of this mysterious conduct whilst he only urged the necessity of an absolute compliance with his desires and left her agitated soul to divine the fatal consequences of a refusal sometimes she endeavored to expostulate to speak her wrongs boldly and to menace her oppressors but tears never failed to betray her inward terror and to discover a lively sense of the weakness of her widowed state sometimes she called upon lord william and tormented herself with the remembrance of the virtues and renown of her lost protector sometimes she pressed her son with an eager and passionate fondness to her heart and invoked every saint in heaven to save the precious creature for him much more anxious than for her own fate she formed a thousand visionary schemes to rescue him from the oppressor which like fantastical dreams vanished and left her to despair raymond though insolent and cruel yet still loved the unhappy countess nor could he behold her distress without some pangs of remorse but his unrelenting minion was ever at hand to condemn and deride his weakness so he deemed it and to persuade him that nothing but rigid authority and severe restraint could prevail upon the high mind of ela and reduce her to what his abandoned flattery presumed to call a reasonable compliance thus was her resolution still assailed and still unconquered  but greater trials remained for this unhappy lady gray whose mind was not discomposed by passion and who thought more coolly than his lord seriously reflected on the necessity of forcing the countess to give her hand to raymond in order to establish his rightful claim to an inheritance which promised ample advantages to his creatures and when the prospect of riches and rewards were presented to his view his rapacious soul instantly became deaf to all the calls of pity nor was one sentiment of humanity suffered to intrude upon his mind the enamoured raymond grew more and more impatient and every hour lamented the inflexible spirit of the countess and her unalterable aversion to his love his flatterer still wore a face of friendly anxiety and concern and as if he lived only for his lord seemed to feel the disappointment as his own misfortune and expressed that earnestness for conquering this difficulty with which men generally pursue their private interests raymond was charmed with this specious show of zeal and sincere affection he called him friend guardian and director he lavishly promised wealth and honors and entreated him to devise some means of accomplishing his wishes gray seemed for a while immersed in thought then as if suddenly recollecting himself he assumed a look of confidence and exultation it cannot be thus he exclaimed this imperious countess cannot for ever prove insensible to the inviting voice of joy and happiness she sees thy passion and would inflame it by this affected delay or if her haughty soul be really unmoved something must be thought of  raymond must  yes my ever honored lord thou shall possess her let me be favored with thy confidence submit to my direction for some days shun her presence for there thy weakness is discovered rely on my services and let it be my part to prevail upon her  go said raymond to you and to your conduct i implicitly resign my hopes prevail and be great as thou can wish  thus was the afflicted countess given up to the hands of insolence and cruelty without help or friend without counsel or resource  instead of the man whose arrogance was tempered by that reverence and love with which her beauty had inspired him ela saw now before her an unrelenting unfeeling vassal in condition such as her soul disdained to hold converse with and in temper base and brutal he approached her with a rude insensibility to her state and to her sorrows instead of pleading the passion or the merits of his master he proudly demanded her compliance he called upon her to consider his power and her own condition that she was no longer mistress in this stately castle which with all its wide extended lands had devolved to raymond now the master even of her and of her son and that she had only to choose whether to appear as his consort in all the luster that riches and royal favor can bestow or to waste her solitary days in grief and abject dependence  the countess though pierced with sorrow and sensible of her helpless condition surveyed the rude minion in disdainful silence he repeated his bold remonstrances yet nothing more could his importunities extort than a stern command to retire from her presence he obeyed but soon returned and repeated his odious insolence in that moment her young son appeared and flew with eager and fond caresses to his mother at sight of him she instantly forgot her greatness her griefs burst forth in a sudden and violent stream she embraced him with trembling arms and the boy though unable to conceive the cause sympathized passionately with the countess the sight was pitiful and affecting but the hardened gray felt only a short and transient surprise is he thus dear said he know then that his mothers obstinacy may prove fatal to her son the charge of him now belongs to raymond he best knows how to defeat all future attempts to dispossess him of his rights  the countess started up in speechless amazement and gray turned from her with a sullen menace that henceforward her son should be a stranger to her arms stay replied the countess pale and trembling with terror and virtuous anger hear me cruel man  heavens is it for this that we are made prisoners within our own walls shut up from society and relief no access for comfort or friendship no resource no support for our helpless innocence and did the bloody purpose of a murderer lurk beneath his courtly smiles when lord raymond first entered our castle and dreads he not vengeance have the friends of william all perished with him  at least heaven is our friend and will repay the cruel deed o there is a blessed angel ever ready to present the cries of infant innocence before the throne of justice and to implore for vengeance on the arm that has been lifted against it  seeks he our love mistaken lord little do thou conceive the fatal consequences of extorting a feigned consent when the heart is still estranged cold indifference distaste aversion and loathing ever watch round the bridal bed and fright away all joy and social comforts  seeks he our possessions  take them enjoy them freely and let us retire to some seat of humble obscurity where no curious eye shall ever pierce through our recess where the name of salisbury was never known or uttered by the voice of fame there shall my child labor with the lowly peasant and never shall his mother betray the secret of his birth but if his blood must be the horrid purchase  o let raymond secure his power and riches beyond the reach of time or fortune let me too perish drive not all mercy from your hearts but spare me the dreadful sight of my childs blood no let me be made the first victim of your cruelty  pity and humanity for a moment assailed the ruthless heart of gray but soon were they repelled he sternly answered that she and her son might yet be happy that the conditions were easy and honorable but that disdain and pride were no good proofs of a mothers tenderness that the fortune of this boy was in her power and that should he suffer she herself would be the author of his sufferings  then calling the attendants he commanded them to remove young william his mother fell upon her knees stretching out her trembling arms in expressive silence to her bosom the boy fled for refuge from his infant terrors she rose and clasped him to her breast devouring the dear object with eyes of frantic fondness the ministers of cruelty relented and hesitated but gray severely repeated his command they surrounded the distracted mother and her weeping son soon conquered her feeble efforts to detain him and tore him from her struggling grasp her shrieks echoed through the castle and wounded the affrighted ear till nature harassed and exhausted by contending with the vast affliction lost its powers and the countess lay pale and lifeless upon the ground the tumult in her apartment had already reached the ear of raymond who flew to enquire the cause and now came to be a witness of her distress he soon learned the cause and far from approving the cruelty of his minion he received him with frowns and reproof he ordered the female attendants to convey their afflicted lady to her couch and with all tender cares to recall her dying senses thither he himself soon followed to restore her dear son and to calm her terrors but she now had no ear for comfort the fever had already seized upon her enflamed her eye and raged in her boiling veins her disordered fancy tormented her with killing images of terror and his presence added new force to her delirium raymond felt all the violence of love and distraction and gray stood aghast this subtle minion labored first to appease the resentment of his lord and then to give him comfort he himself appeared most sollicitous for the recovery of the countess although his wicked heart secretly exulted in her present danger should she live and at length consent to accept of raymond for a husband his insolence must then be remembered and his lord taught to detest the author of her sufferings should she still refuse to give her hand to raymond this lord could not long continue his oppression but must soon resign his unjust pretensions and thus dash all his own hopes of rich rewards nay possibly his conduct might hereafter meet a severe punishment thus he reasoned and regarded her death as an event highly to be wished an infant heir might easily be disposed of and raymond invested with his rights without control or opposition every hour flattered his hopes with desperate accounts of ela and her alarming situation his art was exerted to the utmost to divert the attention of raymond from her distress to alienate his mind from a woman who had presumptuously insuited his passion and to dazzle him with the gay view of those fortunes which were now ready to crown his wishes to inflame the pride of this lord was his artifice and flattery principally directed and when he had warmed his imagination with prospects of riches and magnificence when he had worked up his pliant mind to the due pitch of insolence and fierceness he even dared to hint at the necessity of defeating all future claims and with hardened calmness and indifference declared that it must be his own care prudently and secretly to dispose of young william nor did raymond in his present temper hear him with abhorrence or emotion to such inconsistencies is the mind of man hurried by the tyranny of passions he had just expressed the tenderest pity for the countess and now when the determined villain had proposed to destroy her infant son he started not at the horrid council nor refused his consent  sect ii but that pity which pride and interested cruelty denied her ela found now in her own sex her principal female attendant though the creature of raymond and by him appointed for her service had long beheld her sorrows and maternal fondness with secret grief and sympathy she had herself been wife and mother had long felt and known their endearments and cares long had she wept in secret for the afflictions of her injured lady and now attended on her sick couch with all the fond zeal and concern which a womans distress could excite in the gentle and feeling mind of woman her affection was now undissembled for her lord enjoined the most assiduous care when the disorder had first seized the countess and that affection was attended with success proportioned to it is ardor and sincerity not time nor fatigue could abate her diligence and kind attention to a beloved mistress who long lay insensible of her goodness shrinking timorously from the hand that presented relief at length however nature appeared still unconquered in this severe conflict reason began gradually to regain it is native seat and the countess was restored to some composure elinor so was her attendant called watched the happy moment when she began to survey the objects round her without distraction to offer comfort and consolation she presented her son who stood weeping by her side to assure her of his security and every office which duty and charity could dictate she busily performed to allay the violence of her malady and to restore her languid spirit the countess touched with her goodness repaid her with the warmest expressions of regard and gratitude their affection was now mutual and was succeeded by mutual considence thus even amongst it is enemies did oppressed virtue so far prevail as to reconcile one mind and to attach one relenting heart to it is injured cause ela every hour experienced the happy effects of tender care she had recovered some degree of ease and strength she had leisure to reflect upon her danger and difficulties misfortune and solitude had effaced the proud thoughts of rank and greatness and without reserve she opened her soul to this attendant bitterly lamenting the severity of her fate who though she numbered many and powerful friends though her fortune and condition gave her the command of a formidable band of vassals yet by foul treachery was cut off from all relief from all possibility of complaining or petitioning for deliverance subjected to the will of insolent and cruel enemies and exposed to all the distresses of captivity in that very place where she was rightful mistress strange reward for the services of her great father and her noble husband the attendant with ardent prayers and lively effusions of pity and tenderness gave her some slight consolation but though she felt for her distress she seemed incapable of devising any reasonable means of relief hope patience and such like terms which found but harshly in the ear of affliction she repeated with a warm but impotent zeal she even ventured to hint at the expediency of assuming an appearance of less severity to lord raymond of flattering his fond expectations for a while thus to amuse the busy and contriving malice of his creature to gain some interval of ease some happy respite from persecution time and the interposition of heaven might then work wonderfully for her deliverance but the soul of ela still retained a dignity superior to the arts of dissimulation she started with abhorrence at the thought of sullying her bright same by any suspicious conduct any semblance of unworthy condescension her high mind dwelt with more pleasure on the flattering thoughts of redress and vengeance she reflected that the land still contained many powerful friends to her lost husband and to her noble house she hoped that nothing was necessary for her deliverance and for the punishment of her oppressors but to inform them of her dangerous and distressful state possessed with these thoughts she conceived the bold design of eluding the vigilance of raymond and of escaping to a religious house there to take sanctuary with her infant son from thence to represent to the king the cruel insult offered to the memory of his kinsman and faithful soldier and to demand redress of his and her own wrongs from the justice of the throne and the power of her friends she took no pains to conceal these sentiments but freely communicated the design to elinor and entreated her assistance she enlarged on the power and opportunities of rewarding her fidelity which success must give her she lavishly poured out gold and jewels go said she find among the dependants of this proud lord if there be courage and humanity in any breast to favor a virtuous design here are rewards a small portion and but an earnest of that munificence with which my gratitude shall repay the benefit the attendant at first seemed astonished at the boldness of the attempt whilst the countess renewed her solicitations a new and sudden thought seemed to start to life within her mind but before she could give it utterance their conversation was interrupted and elinor commanded to attend instantly on lord raymond she departed with a look which assured the countess of her unalterable attachment but did not entirely dissipate her terrors these were instantly awakened at the alarm of every thing new and unexpected  a long interval of suspense increased her anxiety at length however the faithful attendant returned and with a cheerful aspect dearest lady said she the blessed saints seem to encourage us to the bold attempt of escaping from these walls lord raymond has appointed his knights to make ready in three days to accompany him to the neighboring woods there to pursue the chase he has enquired of your health and is persuaded that you continue ill at ease he has enjoined the exactest care and vigilance in his absence and particularly that none be suffered to approach your chamber but in my presence and by my appointment the command of the castle is to be committed to my brother and strict ward to be maintained but he is no friend to oppression i have already sounded and find him apt to our purpose ela passionately entreated that this man should be brought before her but soon recollecting the necessity of avoiding all suspicion she contented herself with intrusting to elinor the important charge of prevailing on him into her hands she earnestly gave up all her store of wealth and the good attendant prudently and faithfully employed such part of it as was necessary to confirm the wavering resolution of her brother she prevailed and returned with the pleasing tidings that he had consented to follow the fortunes of the countess and to seize the approaching occasion to convey her and her young son to any place of safety in the mean time she advised that ela should still continue the appearance of malady and weakness and patiently wait the happy moment of her deliverance the eyes of this lady brightened up with joy and pleasure and her breast labored with the violent emotions of gratitude gracious powers thus her passions forced their way is this the vassal of an unjust oppressor this the agent of tyranny and cruelty say whence has thy gentle manners been so strangely associated with savage pride and usurpation whence has thy goodness and affection been chosen by lord raymond to minister to his purposes who art thou that feelst my affliction and art thus kindly sollicitous for my relief the attendant wept and thus returned answer to the enquiries of the countess  sect iii happier days have i beheld and better fortune have i experienced i had a husband lady brave and honest a son too trained to arms and exercised in deeds of war  but heaven was pleased to take them from me  here her grief broke forth with still greater violence and redoubled the attention of the countess nor did she soon recover such ease as enabled her to proceed in the following manner  our residence was in the neighborhood of nottingham where we lived in peace removed from the cares of greatness and the bitterness of distress my husband was loving edmund our only child the delight of our eyes and comfort of our advanccing years though bred to arms he was mild and gentle and though nurtured in the humble vale of life he was brave and generous even from his infant years he had conceived an affection for the daughter she too the only child of a neighboring franklin which grew with their ripening age nor was condemned or controuled the fond parents beheld this youthful pair of lovers with secret joy and hoped in them to transmit their names and little inheritances to succeeding times they were betrothed and but waited for the holy benediction to crown their wishes when war and tumult began to rage in england john was then our king he had submitted and was reconciled to the holy father he had attempted to recover his dominions in france but abandoned by his discontented nobles he returned to his kingdom full of vexation and revenge ah lady little does the highborn courtier or the powerful lord conceive of that weight of misery which public dissentions heap upon the lowly subject the king marched like an enemy through the land spoiling and ravaging the estates of his wayward barons he arrived at nottingham where my lord of canterbury at length prevailed to stop his unfriendly progress he continued here for some time his followers secure in his protection and enriched by his bounty little regarded the severe limits which laws prescribe gay revellers they who full of mirth and disport beguiled the time in song and dance with courtly dames one of these glittering minions of royal favor perchance cast his wanton eyes on edyth the maid betrothed to my son accursed be the hour in which he discovered and was enamoured with her beauty he courted her in gentle guise with fair semblance of respect and decent love he dazzled her with a view of costly gifts he promised much he sighed often and sometimes wept but all fruitless were his endeavors to conquer the integrity of this honest maiden yet not entirely displeased at his flattering arts she listened without terror or abhorrence whilst yet his purpose was not directly avowed and sometimes yielding to his courtesy suffered him to lead her forth and to amuse her ear with tales of courtly pleasures and splendour the jealous anxiety of edmund ever watched their steps at wary distance till at length when this incautious maid had been conducted to a secret path when she suddenly found her helpless innocence at the mercy of a luxurious courtier when he boldly pressed his suit and attempted to force her trembling and dismayed to his wicked purpose her piercing shrieks soon summoned a faithful deliverer to her side edmund mad with rage and jealousy fatally smote the ravisher and carelessly leaving him weltering in blood conveyed away his edyth who had fainted with terror and surprise and safely deposited his hearts dear treasure in her fathers dwelling  an event like this was not to be concealed nor did the unhappy youth now mad with passion and deaf to the calls of prudence fear to avow his bloody deed freely and publicly soon was the body discovered and soon was edmund seized and torn from his frantic mistress an armed band hurried him away with loud and tumultuous denunciations of vengeance when happily the king now returning from the chase descried the rout and dispatched an attendant to demand the cause of such disorder of this he was instantly informed and curious to learn the occasion of such a presumptuous violence upon his officer to view the man who even boasted of his outrage he ordered the criminal to be brought before him my son was now led forward and as he prepared to cast himself at the feet of his liege the fiery beast which the king bestrode frighted at the tumult began to start and rear up with ungovernable wildness the attendants instantly alighted but before they could support their falling master edmund had burst like lightning from the hands of his guards broke his fall and remounted him this zeal and vigor were beheld with wonder and secret applause the king himself was by no means unaffected by the incident his looks grew less severe and in a tone not angry but majestically grave he demanded to know who he was and what had prompted him to this act of blood my son kneeled before him modest but not abject and with an ingenuous plainness and freedom related the unhappy cause that had provoked him to this outrage his love to the betrothed maid the arts and treachery to which she had been exposed the horrid attempt of violation and his own fatal encounter with the kingsofficer in a word he ackowledged the crime and with decent boldness declared himself resigned to the punishment and prepared to yield up his forfeit life the king listened with attention and in the natural and unaffected narrative saw the full proof of all that had been alleged with a sudden warmth he swore by the foot of god his usual oath that his servant had deservedly met his sat that edmund was a brave youth and merited not only pardon but reward and that henceforward he should be his soldier the witnessess of this scene were not slow to applaud the sentiments of their sovereign they vied with each other in their praises of my son whose youthful breast was but too susceptible of their impressions how happy did we then esteem ourselves when we saw our child rescued from destruction graced with the royal favor and entrusted with an honorable command to us he paid his filial duty then flew to the beloved edyth to comfort her forrow and revive her spirit confounded and depressed by the late event of her he took a tender leave with assurances of invariable fidelity and passionate vows of speedy return to complete his happiness then departed to perform the duties of his new charge but we were not as yet totally bereft of our darling object some intervals he found for brief yet frequent visitings to delight us with the accounts of his advancing fortune so completely was he now possessed with the thoughts of war and honor so elevated and transported by the view of courtly splendour and the gay promises of youthful ambition that love seemed to hold but a second place within his mind and the sighs and halfsuppressed tears of edyth sometimes consessed her jealous fear of his estrangement he saw and chid her unjust suspicions to allay them he proposed that the holy father should instantly unite their hands their nuptials were sudden and their conjugal endearments alas too soon interrupted by our sons necessary attendance on his royal master  the land was now threatened with all the calamities of civil war a second time had the bold barons put on their armor and collected their vassals against john my husband although he bad already suffered in their cause yet still adhered with an obstinate integrity to that side which he deemed the great bulwark of his country he earnestly pressed young edmund to abandon the service of a prince whose savor was precarious suddenly and capriciously bestowed and as suddenly and capriciously withdrawn but he was heard with reluctance and aversion he urged the solid comforts of honest poverty and contentment he called it shameful forgive me lady if his homely sentiments offend to unite with repacious foreigners and to embrue his hands in the blood of countrymen and brethren his son was still unmoved and to all his arguments opposed one plea his forfeit life and the vast debt of gratitude he owed the king a fathers authority was then exerted he was commanded upon his filial obedience to attend on the confederated lords the terrors of divine vengeance were denounced on his undutiful obstinacy he hesitated but the flattering prospects of ambition at length prevailed he forgot the submssion due to a parents authority full of gay hopes and impatient of control he hastened away to serve his liege lord whilst my husband irritated at his disobedience pronounced something like a curse upon his unhappy son and followed the standard of william de albinet the commanding baron  through the course of these unhappy contests edmund increased in honor and still more and more approved his active valor it is too well known with what shameful disregard to the protection of their adherents the barons suffered a number of the most faithful to their cause to be shut up within the castle of rochester and to be sorely pressed by the royal army while they themselves rioted in london in a fatal hour edmund was commanded to the siege of this castle  o lady a few words are sufficieut for the rest of his sad story how does the dreadful remembrance pierce my afflicted heart many deeds of manhood did he atchieve and oftentimes did he repel the desperate valor of the besieged at the head of a small party he at length ventured too rashly to approach the castle walls and was suddenly encountered by a larger body of the enemy the contest was obstinate and bloody but his associates were borne down by numbers and lest him as they yielded singly engaged with a soldier whose sword threatened destruction they rushed upon each other they closed they redoubled their deadly blows till at length a well directed stroke from the arm of edmund fell upon the front of his antagonist clest his bearer and uncovered his wounded head edmund started stood aghast uttered some confused sounds of horror how can i speak it  the ill fated youth  o for ever accursed be the authors of every civil strife  had smote his father  here the disorder of the unhappy mother stopped her voice the countess was scarcely less affected she trembled as if witness of the horrid scene and elinor at length proceeded thus  my husband stunned and saint was sinking down when edmund seized him in his arms and gently laid him upon the earth he kneeled before him in all the bitterness of anguish and distraction his lamentations were loud and wild and earnestly did he implore for pardon and bitterly did he curse his own fatal error the languid eyes of his father were fixed kindly upon him his faltering voice spoke forgiveness and now was edmund preparing to bind up his wound and to convey him to some place of safety and relief when the noise of tumult and rout grew loud he turned his head hastily to learn the cause and in that fatal moment received a shot from a crossbow full in his brain the son sunk down by the side of the bleeding father the routed and the pursuers a party of the royal army who had come to the support of their associates trampled upon their bodies edmund had at once expired with a groan my husband lived but to relate the dreadful story  here the attendant struggled to suppress her sorrow not so the gentle countess her tender mind was deeply pierced and freely was her pity uttered  thus said elinor in one accursed hour was i bereft of all my comfort the calamity was too great for my weak heart to bear the relation instantly confused my brain and deprived me of reason long did i continue in a melancholy insensibility to my distress and perhaps heaven was kind in thus afflicting me when time and a brothers tender care had at length restored my disordered senses i learned that the wretched edyth had been seized with the pangs of untimely childbirth had with pain and sorrow given her lifeless burden to the light long languished in sickness and grief and was at length retired to a religious house there to end her wretched days and there were they soon ended i my self had been despoiled of all my possessions by the sury of civil war in which both parties were equally incensed against my husband or my son rescued from death and supported by the kindness of my brother the vassal of lord raymond him have i followed and by his means have i been placed here ready to obey our lord in all humble and honest duties but we have not yet learned to be the base instruments of oppression  here she paused and wept the countess labored to comfort and to inspire her with hopes of better fortune repeated her assurances of favor and protection and earnestly declared that to be happy she had but to extricate a grateful mistress from her present distress  sect iv the long wished for day at length appeared when raymond and his knights were to issue forth and oswald the brother of elinor was to be warder of the castle the time and manner of escape had been duly concerted the garb of an humble domestic had been provided for the countess in which disguise she together with her son and faithful woman were to be conveyed through a postern gate which led to a neighboring wood there was oswald to provide horses and from thence to conduct them to a religious house which had been enriched by the pious bounty of ela in her more prosperous days and where she now hoped to find due regard and inviolable sanctuary the day was spent in preparation in fears and hopes and anxiety at length the midhour of night approached the hour appointed for departure oswald by means of a trusty servant had placed his horses in the wood and had so stationed his men as to prevent them from being witnesses of his design the countess had put on her disguise embraced her son and delivered him to the hand of elinor their conductor led them cautiously and silently through the castle they had passed the gate and were now stretching toward the wood with more enlivened steps when the shrill sound of a horn proceeded from the other side of the castle and proclaimed the approach of some knight or stranger oswald started the women trembled the sound was loudly repeated and returned from the adjacent hills when oswald marking where the full moon disclosed a beaten path and pointing toward the wood earnestly pressed them to bend their course thither without fear or hesitation and there to wait his coming which he promised should be speedy he spoke of the present alarm as of no moment but declared himself resolved to learn the occasion of it they obeyed and he returned into the castle where he appeared opportunely to prevent suspicion or detection the domestics were all roused and some had already mounted the battlements to demand who at this dead hour had approached the castle and on what occasion they were answered that there stood two persons at the gates dispatched by hubert chief justiciary to lord raymond on especial affairs that they had been misguided and wandered through the country until night had overtaken them that at length they had recovered the true path and that their fatigue required immediate entrance and refreshment by the command of oswald they were admitted and entertained with due courtesy he though determined to abandon the service of raymond and impatient to rejoin the countess and her son yet could not resist the desire of conferring with these messengers and especially when he learned from one of them who seemed of inferior quality that they brought some intelligence about lord salisbury he invited this man to refresh himself with wine for the other had retired to rest he entertained him with all hospitable kindness and from him learned that but a little time since solemn justs and tournaments had been held at the english court in which a young knight of france induced as he declared by the fame of the gallant nobles of britain had appeared and distinguished himself by his prowess and courage that the king and his courtiers had received him with all due honors that in some conversations he had lamented the fate of an english lord known in both realms by the name of salisbury who as he was informed had been pursued by adverse fortune in poictou obliged to fly before his enemies abandoned by his few attendants and accompanied only by a fair and noble lady and that too strong reasons there were to fear that he had perished oswald heard him with a violent yet well dissembled emotion and having prevailed on him to retire paused though still anxious to seek the countess and debated within his mind whether he should communicate this intelligence or no as he was not sufficiently acquainted with the refined and exalted sentiments of noble minds he concluded that the hopes of her lords return were elas only motive for receiving the addresses of lord raymond with such severity and abhorrence and that any assurances of his death must determine her to accept the tenders of his love he therefore resolved freely to declare what he had just now heard and hoped that she might thus be prevailed on to abandon the design of flying and to return to her castle  the domestics were now separated and silence and tranquillity again restored when oswald again issued forth still firmly resolved to obey the commands of the countess whatever these might be and faithfully to follow her fortunes should she be still resolute to tempt the dangers of flight he found her at the appointed station impatient of his tedious absence and almost sinking under the terrors of night and solitude elinor sat by her side still more dismayed supporting her young son and shielding him from the dampy air whilst he lay composed in peaceful sleep the moon was hastening to her decline and threatened to involve them in all the horrors of darkness when their long expected protector at length appeared to relieve their distracting fears he briefly related the occasion of his delay the arrival of these messengers and the discourse which he had held with one of them the bare mention of intelligence about lord william raised an universal agitation in the countess the melancholy air which oswald assumed increased her terror and impatience nor had he yet finished his relation when the blood deserted the cheeks of ela she closed her eyes and died away elinor shrieked oswald supported her but their cares were a long time ineffectual at length the countess raised her languid front and breathed a heartfelt sigh he was then disloyal said she  a noble lady  was she noble  but alas i fear heaven has severely punished his guilt oswald now perceived his own imprudence and would have offered comfort but the countess was wholly engaged by her own sad thoughts he repeatedly pressed and enforced the danger of her present situation and the necessity of speedy departure but no attention could he gain at length turning her sadly streaming eyes slowly upon him no my friend said she these languid limbs must here find their grave  yet  it were a blessing to end my days in the mansions of devotion to hear the reverend father speak comfort to my departing spirit  but i cannot  this frame is too feeble the hand of death presses too severely upon me  o friends if ever your hearts knew pity look upon that boy he was not born to this wretchedness he has still noble friends  if you would atone to heaven for your offenses save him convey him quickly from the power of his enemies seek the place appointed for our retreat there save yourselves and him there shall the friends of his house find him rescued from cruelty and usurpation they shall protect and defend him they shall assert his rights and reward your fidelity these jewels these treasures shall reward you my son shall live to reward you  elinor kneeling before her with weeping eyes and lifted hands earnestly entreated her to collect her spirits and to pursue her intended flight uttering the most ardent and passionate vows that fear or force should never drive her from her beloved mistress  if i am beloved said the countess show me thy love and save my child think not of me i can die here and some charitable hand may perhaps be sound to close my eyes in peace here she again fainted nor could all the tender care and solicitude exerted to relieve her restore her to life and sense elinor hung weeping over her oswald was dismayed and distracted he saw the danger of this rash enterprise and could think of no resource he would have consulted with his sister but her mind was engaged only by her mistress he suddenly called to his attendant who still continued at some distance with the horses one of these he mounted the countess was raised up and placed reclining in his arms thus he proceeded gently toward a cottage which lay at some small distance whose charitable inhabitants rose at the noise of benighted travelers and admitted them the countess was disposed upon their humble couch and now once again recovered from her trance she thanked the tenderness of the afflicted elinor then calling to oswald with hands and eyes raised to heaven she earnestly conjured him by all his hopes of future happiness to fly with her son to sanctuary to proclaim his and her wrongs and particularly to seek the protection of the lord de warren his fathers noble friend who would receive and shield his helpless innocence assert his rights and control his oppressors of herself she spoke with indifference as a person on the point of finding refuge from her enemies in the arms of death oswald was so persuaded he regarded her present languid state as the last sad period of her life and looking tenderly upon his sister seemed to wish that she could fly from the resentment of lord raymond but soon were his thoughts checked by the zealous declarations of this friendly matron that no fear of power no threats of punishment no motive whatever should prevail upon her to abandon her dear mistress she urged him to obey her commands with speed and to leave them to the protection of heaven the honest heart of oswald was affected in a passionate fit of zeal he declared himself ready to fly with young william the anxious mother thanked him with her looks she clasped her son with a feeble but tender embrace and lifting her eyes devoutly toward heaven commended him to the protection of all the holy angels his looks confessed his infant fear when she delivered him to his conductor he wept and was cenveyed away some few tears dropped from the countess but the recollection of his escape and the hopes of his preservation soon gave comfort to her afflicted mind and animated her with new life and spirit her eyes were lighted up anew her voice less faltering and her frame less languid she now seemed to defy her oppressors and declared herself resolved to assume her rightful authority and state to act as mistress of her castle and domain in open defiance of the bold intruders by the dawn of morning some peasants were dispatched to the castle to give notice of her present situation and to order such conveniences as were necessary for her removal a litter together with the proper attendants was soon sent for this purpose elinor still faithful to her charge waited on the side of her beloved lady who now again entered her own stately hall and was laid with care and tender offices of duty upon her own couch  sect v in the mean time confusion had spread among the domestics morning discovered the desertion of oswald and scarcely had messengers been dispatched to inform lord raymond of this event and the arrival of the two strangers when they learned the situation of the countess and were directed to conduct her back to her apartnient a second message was instantly dispatched to their lord with this alarming intelligence and ere long he appeared in view goating the sides of his courser whilst a few attendants stretched after him at some distance in vain striving to keep pace with his impatience he entered the castle with looks wild and disordered and flew toward the apartment of the countess but was stopped by some of her maidens who were directed to inform him that her present weakness and malady required rest and could not permit him to approach he called for elinor who appeared before him trembling he sternly reproached her with presumptuous treachery and disobedience and demanded to know where her brother lay concealed whither and for what purpose he had fled elinor still trembled and was silent raymond thundered out terrible denunciations of vengeance when the countess who heard his rage from the adjacent chamber suddenly sent to desire his presence he rushed in with glaring looks of fury and distraction when rising her head gently from her pillow ela thus accosted him proud lord thy power is at an end i am above thy oppression i am hastening to the mansions of peace my son is safe yes that honest man has conveyed him to the neighboring monastery whose hallowed sanctuary shall protect him from thee and thy minions thither thou can not force thy way thence shall our wrongs be boldly and loudly echoed through the land and soon shall the noble friends of salisbury appear to end thy usurpation to chastise thy ministers of cruelty and to revenge the injuries done even to the meanest of elas attendants  thus speaking she turned away with marks of scorn again reclined her head nor deigned the least regard to his extravagant expressions of vexation and furptize he burst away in mad disorder and confusion he ranged wildly through the galleries started and endeavored to collect his thoughts and allay his passions cursed his own rash folly which had tempted him abroad afforded this opportunity of detecting and defeating his designs and threatened to cover him with shame and scorn then again he rushed forward in an agony of rage and vexation when one of the messengers from hubert approached with respectful obeisance and obliged him to assume some appearance of ease and composure  from him lord raymond learned the several particulars which his companion had before imparted to oswald but as this man was admitted more intimately into the confidence of hubert he was farther directed to declare that the friends to the house of salisbury began to express their fears that the longprotracted residence of raymond in this castle without any intelligence being received of the dispositions of the countess any assurances of her consent to accept his hand had raised jealousies and suspicions in their minds and that hubert therefore urged him to renew his efforts if he still continued unsuccessful to improve those rumors about earl william into full and certain assurances of his death and with all possible speed and earnestness to hasten on his own nuptials with the countess he thanked the stranger and commended his fidelity he requested him to retire for a while promising to confer more fully with him at better leisure then resigned himself to the disorder of his mind which this information and advice served to inflame and irritate he now saw the misguided course which he had pursued he formed the most dreadful presages of that dishonor which must attend his violence and unlawful oppression his passion for the countess was still alive and for a while he seemed resolved once more to try the gentle arts of love and tenderness but the recollection of her rigor and disdain her wrongs and sufferings in a moment dashed all his hopes and he resolved to fall at her feet to implore her pardon and to retire from her castle for this purpose he again approached her apartment and demanded admittance elinor appeared before him kneeled and with many tears implored his indulgence for the weak state of her unhappy lady heaven only knows said the kind attendant whether she has yet a few days of life remaining let not thy noble nature afflict the already too severely afflicted let her die in peace or if she may yet live break not on that tranquillity which may be the happy means of restoring her wretch cried raymond wildly surveying her as she humbled herself before him thou have undone me accursed be the slave who has assisted thee to betray me but why do i think of thee thou reptile come lead me to this lady let me dispel her maladies let me give her peace and leave her  elinor started up confounded and astonished at this mysterious language earnest for an explanation yet too much awed and terrified to speak her wishes raymond sternly repeated his orders and in that moment the inhuman gray with all marks of haste and impatience rushed impetuously into the apartment  he had heard of the escape and return of the countess and of the flight of oswald he had spurred on with wild speed to learn more particularly the reason and purpose of these alarming events his own conscious guilt had raised dreadful presages in his mind nor were these allayed by the disorder in which he now found lord raymond to him he addressed some hasty and impersect questions raymond gazed on him for a while with an aspect which plainly discovered an inward strife and doubt whether to accuse this man as his evil counselor or to entreat his assistance as a faithful friend at length as if bowed down by violence of passion he reclined on his arm and was led away into another apartment there he distinctly recounted the advices he had received from hubert and the jealousies expressed by the friends of the house of salisbury which must now be enflamed and confirmed by the false oswald who had fled to sanctuary with young william he spoke with pity and tenderness of the countess whom his own cruelty had driven from her castle and whose flight had been prevented only by her malady and weakness he expressed his fears of detection and dishonor that his unwarrantable usurpation and attempt upon the constancy of ela must now cover him with shame he therefore declared himself resolved to implore her forgiveness and to retire the coward heart of gray felt all the terrors that raymond had expressed with double force he was instantly filled with the imagination of that power and protection which were soon to support the injured countess he trembled at the recollection of his own share of guilt and oppression he commended the purpose of lord raymond and urged him to resign his pretensions without delay but amidst
