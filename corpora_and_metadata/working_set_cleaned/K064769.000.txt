clements church strand london mdcclxxxvii  romans v   god commends his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us the awful event which we this day commemorate is by far the most important of any that ever took place upon the theater of this world  it is that which from the transgression of our first parents a long line of prophets were commissioned to predict which priests and sacrifices were appointed to prefigure and which the revolutions of empires were contrived to introduce it is that which reconciled us unto god rescuing us from the tyranny of sin and the power of the grave yet in the whole gospel there is nothing against which the pride of human reason and the perverseness of human prejudices have more obstinately opposed themselves than the sacrifice of the everlasting and equal son of god as a full perfect and sufficient satisfaction for the sins of the whole world  in the very first age of christianity and while the precious blood of the worlds redeemer was yet recently shed at jerusalem there sprang up in the church a sect which ashamed of being the disciples of one who had been crucified as a malefactor boldly affirmed that their master had not suffered but that without tasting death he was taken up into heaven whilst pilate and the jews wreaked their impotent malice upon an airy phantom in his similitude  to these heretics after a few centuries succeeded the impostor of arabia  who from motives of policy denied the sufferings of christ the great scheme of universal redemption commenced with the fall and its gracious design was by degrees to restore mankind to that state which they had forfeited in adam  but the sagacious deceiver well knew that if the death and resurrection were admitted that design would be seen to be completed and that his own pretensions of being divinely commissioned to close the seal of prophecy and to communicate the last offer of mercy and instruction to lapsed humanity must instantly fall to the ground  with an effrontery then peculiar to himself he denied the truth of a fact on which christians reposed all their hopes in which the jews exulted with malicious triumph and of which the history was spread over the whole civilized world  the success of mahomet is well known and it is likewise known that ever since his days the christian church has been infested with a pestilent race of men who though they believe not in the inspiration of the koran and though they deny not the sufferings of him at whose name st paul directs that every knee should bow yet do they lay no more stress on those sufferings than upon the sufferings of socrates or any other man who has laid down his life in attestation of the truth if the mohammedan denies like the phantomist of more ancient times the reality of the death of christ the socinian by denying its efficacy sinks it to the level of common martyrdom and though the fact itself be not questioned its end and design is in his creed totally lost  there is a living writer a teacher of the gospel and if you will believe his adherents a sincere christian who supports this horrid heresy with all his abilities and who labors to disseminate it with astonishing zeal whose followers are scattered all over england and against whom as they insinuate themselves into every company and commonly make their attacks upon the ignorant and the halflearned every christian ought to be upon his guard  against socinians arians and all other enemies of the truth the surest defense will be found to be the sword of the spirit which is the word of god would mankind take their faith from the holy scriptures and not rest it upon the unstable foundation of human systems and would no man presumptuously aim at being wise beyond what is written heresies would soon vanish away  but instead of pursuing a conduct so suitable to blind and erring mortals we find the teachers of christianity split into a thousand sects and laboring each to support by every art and every sophism the particular tenets of his human leader  the followers of calvin who style themselves the orthodox most unwarrantably presume to circumscribe the goodness of god when they confidently affirm that although the sacrifice upon the cross made a satisfaction of value sufficient to ransom a thousand worlds yet that however it was not offered for all mankind but only for the elected few and that all but those few were according to the unsearchable counsel of gods will and for the glory of his sovereign power passed by and ordained to dishonor and wrath  now that any man who loves his brethren who are upon earth and entertains just notions of his father who is in heaven should believe such doctrines as these is absolutely impossible it is indeed always to be dreaded lest he upon whom in early youth these tenets have been inculcated as the truths of god should by the proneness of mankind to run from one extreme to another be led in the maturity of age to deny the efficacy of christs death altogether and to attempt to bring down that adorable person from the dignity of the uncreated redeemer of the world to the level of an ordinary martyr  such was the origin and progress of the person who is at present busied in perverting the faith of these nations he was educated he informs us in the firm persuasion that the horrible opinions which have been enumerated are the doctrine of the prophets and apostles and without giving himself the trouble as it should seem to inquire whether these things be really so he has thought proper in order to get rid of what in his riper years he finds it impossible to believe to abandon the inspiration of the scriptures and has not scrupled to call st paul an inconclusive reasoner  but if we search the bible from genesis to the book of st johns revelation we shall not find any of its inspired writers presuming to say what the almighty could or could not have done gods ways are indeed often declared to be past finding out but there is enough of them revealed to satisfy us that they are all founded in infinite wisdom that they all flow from perfect goodness that he who made us is no respecter of persons that he will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth and that he commends his love toward us in that while were yet sinners christ died for us  the evangelical prophet teaches that the soul of the messiah was made an offering for sin that he was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquity that the chastisement of our peace was upon him and that by his stripes we are healed and the great instrument of the worlds conversion informs us that god even our father has loved us and given us everlasting consolation through grace that christ also has loved us and given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice unto god for a sweet smelling favor and st peter adds that there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved neither prophets nor apostles presume to limit this great and glorious and on gods part this finished salvation to a chosen few on the contrary we are expressly taught that our redeemer gave himself a ransom for all that he was made a little lower than the angels that by the grace of god he should taste of death for every man that the lord is long suffering toward us not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance in the volume of inspiration we learn concerning the blessed friend of sinners that in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily and this is a faithful saying intended to exhilarate alike the hearts of all adams sons that christ promised jesus exhibited came into the world to save sinners without any exception whatever whether of persons or cases  such being the infinite love of god to mankind in christ jesus we cannot wonder that when first manifested to the world it produced its proper effects that it put an end to all selfishness and division and indeed under the real influence and full belief of this great mystery of divine love there seems to be no room left for any thing else amongst christians but returns of love to god and emanations of love toward one another  christianity one would think needs but to be fairly stated in order to its being found worthy of universal acceptance as an act of grace sealed with the royal signet of heaven proposing and providing the second adam as a second parent or proxy for lapsed mankind immediately when the first adam had without our consent forfeited the inestimable privilege of a glorious immortality our holy religion when attentively considered in this true point of light will ever be found equally comfortable delightful and interesting to men of all descriptions every individual of which is on the christian plan readmitted to the same covenant of grace with god that adam himself enjoyed in paradise  persons who meditate with frequency and attention upon these glad tidings will not fail to experience their efficacy to fill agreeably the vacuity of human life when our spirits droop these truths of god will cheer them when the stings of conscience torment us if we be truly penitent they will dispel our fears confirm and augment our hopes disarm the king of terrors and will open a joyous prospect beyond the grave into the heavenly canaan and the new jerusalem in which city of our reconciled father there are mansions many mansions for receiving them who through faith and patient continuance in welldoing seek for glory and immortality  the plain and numerous declarations of holy writ on this subject militate so forcibly against the calvinist who denies the universality of christs satisfaction as well as against the socinian who denies that satisfaction altogether that it would be astonishing how either of those sects should have gained ground in the world did not daily experience evince that mankind are more ready to torture every thing into an agreement with their own preconceived opinions than to try the truth of those opinions by the word of god  but if christ died for all men why it may be asked have we not reason to expect that all men shall be saved is it not detracting from the merits of the great sacrifice of this day to suppose that it was offered for any one person who shall not ultimately reap all the benefits which it was intended to purchase by no means the obstinate rejection of christs gospel by an incorrigible sinner may make him miserable but the rejection cannot detract either from the mercy of the father or from the merits of the son there have been instances and amongst our own fellow subjects and in the passing century of men redeemed from slavery who have yet refused to quit the place of their captivity and who defeated though surely without lessening the beneficence of him who paid their stipulated ransom it is even so with us the full price of our redemption from sin and satan has been paid but if we refuse to change our masters if we will not accept the glorious liberty of the sons of god when offered to us without money and without price our ruin must be imputed to ourselves and not to our merciful creator who desires not the misery of his creatures nor to our adorable redeemer who gave his life a ransom for all  the first great purpose for which christ died was to pay the penalty of our first parents transgression to rescue us from the everlasting power of the grave and to put us anew into a capacity of obtaining and of relishing that happiness in the next world which is to be considered as in some sort the natural effect of holiness in this  christ our passover by his own oblation of himself once offered has without any cooperation of ours completed this mighty work for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all even the wicked as well as the righteous be made alive but observe the righteous only shall rise to happiness  our blessed lord suffered to redeem us from death and to purchase for us the grace of the gospel covenant but it was no part of his design nor is it any part of that covenant to cancel the eternal obligations of piety and virtue these were in force before man fell  they are equally in force now that he is redeemed and by them shall we be tried at that great day for which all other days were made for tribulation and anguish says the book of truth must be the portion of every soul of man that does evil of the jew first and also of the gentile  such is the nature of the redemption wrought by christ such the gracious terms of that covenant of mercy which by his precious bloodshedding he has obtained for us this is all that is expressly revealed concerning it and it is all that we are required to believe  from the disproportion between a finite and an infinite mind it seems improbable that even in heaven itself the one should ever be in circumstances to judge of all the proceedings of the other because a certain judgment of the justice and goodness of god any more than of any other governor cannot be formed from a partial view of his dispensations  christ really was all that the mosaic ritual exhibited in types and instead of having been a sacrifice only in figure all the sacrifices which preceded him were merely figurative of him  christ is styled our passover  he is said to have been sacrificed for us and we may reasonably conclude that without a necessity for such a process it would never have existed now if christ is our passover his blood must do for us what the blood of the paschal lamb did for the hebrews in egypt but that blood was expiatory and therefore so is christs  believe not then i pray you assertions however confident that such an atonement was altogether needless and that therefore the passages of scripture which seem to teach it are nothing more than metaphorical expressions but rather reflect that you are taught by unerring wisdom concerning the redemption of your souls that it is a mystery into which even the angels who surely knew more of the divine counsels than the most acute socinian on earth desire to look and do not fully comprehend and therefore we may well rest contented with the plain though narrow view of it which is laid before us prying into this mystery like gazing on the sun begins in pain and ends in blindness  it must surely be granted that forgiveness of sin on account of the vicarious sufferings of our blessed lord is indeed a method admirably calculated at once to repress presumption to discourage men from repeating their transgressions to give them a deep sense of the odiousness of sin and to convince them of the excellency of the divine laws and the indispensable necessity of paying a willing obedience to them  in this dispensation mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other and whilst a guilty world was received into the divine favor the most awful warning was held out to that world  and indeed to the whole intelligent creation which it was possible even for omnipotence itself to give  if after having seen our savior in the garden deprecating in vain that fearful cup which we had deserved if after having beheld him hanging on the cross and heard him in the agony of his soul crying out my god my god why have thou forsaken me if after all this we can still continue unmoved it does not appear probable that we should be persuaded to forsake our sins and follow our savior by a prospect either of the joyful effects of piety or the miserable consequences of guilt and how in the name of common sense can we hope to escape wretchedness in the extreme if we neglect so great salvation  what then remains but that in the strength of our everblessed redeemer we cast away from us all our transgressions whereby we have transgressed and make us a new heart and a new spirit that so we may on the approaching festival receive the holy communion of the body and blood of our savior christ with a full trust in gods mercy and with a quiet conscience  what our repentance is weak and unworthy and fit to be repented of and all our righteousness is as filthy rags how then dare we appear in the presence of god there is nothing before us but condemnation there is nothing in ourselves whence any comfort or assurance can arise all is darkness but as the serpent was lifted up in the wilderness so ought we to look by faith unto our great high priest who was lifted up upon the cross for us that whoever believes in him should have eternal life and although our faith be weak yet for our comfort be it remembered the virtue is not in our faith which is merely the band that reaches the medicine to us the whole virtue is in the medicine in the allsufficient satisfaction which emanuel has made for us in his own person wholly without us though applied inwardly by faith which itself is also the gift of god remains but that we should this day return unto the lord our god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and repents him of the evil  we believe lord help thou our unbelief father we have sinned against heaven and before thee and are no more worthy to be called thy sons but thou art the same lord whose property is always to have mercy and to forgive grant us therefore gracious lord whenever we approach thy holy table so to eat the flesh of thy dear son jesus christ and to drink his blood that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body and our souls washed through his most precious blood and that we may evermore dwell in him and he in us  now unto god that loved us and has given us everlasting consolation through grace  unto the holy and undivided trinity  to father son and holy ghost be ascribed equal honor by the church militant on earth and triumphant in heaven  finis
