an account of the great and generous actions of james butler  duke of ormond  dedicated to the famous university of oxford  london printed for j moore near st pauls and sold by the booksellers price sixpence  an humble dedication to the university of oxford etc clarissimi and doctissimi the famous university of oxford having been of all the universities in europe the most ancient and for many ages the most celebrated fountain of learning the seat of the muses the honor of the protestant world and the particular glory of great britain the author of these sheets comes prepared to lay this tract at her feet with all the decency and respect that the most affectionate duty of an admirer of virtue and literature can oblige him to  for this reason and from the sense of justice to so learned and excellent a society he grounds this dedication upon an assurance next to a demonstration that nothing like what common fame has slanderously loaded this famous body with can be her due that it is not possible without the most manifest injustice to fix such things upon the university as are at this time wickedly alleged by her enraged enemies and that therefore it is every honest mans duty to assist in her vindication  as nothing is more certain so nothing is more pleasing to those who honor and wish well to the university of oxford than to hear that the said university has always been a constant asserter of loyal principles and a deep sufferer for her steady adherence in practice to those principles always distinguishing herself by her loyalty to her sovereign in the worst of times history is full of the particulars there we read with pleasure how she has frequently stripped her self of her ornaments to supply the necessities of her princes and suffered several sieges and various distresses in defense of the monarchy in the times of rebellion and usurpation  her churches and the several chapels of her colleges have constantly resounded with the learned discourses of the heads of houses fellows graduates etc in defense of those ancient and orthodox doctrines of submission to our lawful sovereigns being subject to the higher powers for conscience sake and of their abhorrence of that damnable position that it is lawful upon any pretense whatsoever to take up arms against the king  nor can it be pleaded against her without great injustice as i hear it is now that this was the usage in oxford several years ago but that she has intermitted the same and professed other principles since on the contrary it is affirmed that she never deviated from the profession of a due absolute subjection to her kings and we cannot believe that she can have forgot to practice conformable to the said profession and therefore it seems the more reasonable to expose at this time the attempts which some people make to lay reproach and scandal upon her as if she or any of her body had avowedly acted undutifully to our present sovereign raised tumults mobbs and rebellion things so inconsistent with the christian rule so directly opposite to the principles of the protestant religion and particularly of the church of england to all which the university of oxford has been and is still esteemed so great an ornament that it cannot without great want of charity be suggested that the said university has any ways been concerned that way  permit therefore reverend and learned that an humble advocate for your injured reputation should expostulate with your enemies on the injustice they offer you when they propagate such scandalous things as are daily suggested against you and against the honor and reputation of your university  as if you were now less loyal and less submissive to the higher powers than formerly  as if you had forgotten your professed principles of obedience or could dispense with the conformity of your practice to your profession  as if the university was capable of being corrrupted with faction or were less loyal and dutiful to king george than they were to queen anne  as if it were possible the contagion of jacobitism which is perjury could infect the university or that the sons of the prophets could thus commence children of disobedience  as if it were possible that the university of oxford could be tainted with rellellion which is as the sin of witchcraft  these things i am satisfied can never be it cannot consist with common charity to think much less to prompt others to think so absurdly of so glorious a body of men illuminated with the sublimest knowledge divine and humane instructed by a succession of learned pious and truly reverend divines and openly professing principles diametrically opposite to what they are now charged with  and therefore excellent and venerable permit the author in this dedication briefly to enter into the particulars from whence these suggestions are maliciously drawn and from thence how easy will it be to show the improbability there is that the university should be in the least concerned in or guilty of the facts laid to her charge  as first the black charge of riots and tumults in the streets of the university breaking the kings peace and turning the usual assembly of the learned members of the university such as students graduates etc into a rabble a rout a rebellious and tumultuous mobb  such is the good government of the university in general such the rigorous execution of their private and statutary laws such the honesty and vigilance of the reverend the vice chancellor such the fidelity and diligence of the underofficers of the university all concurring as well to restrain as to resent that it is well known how impracticable such a thing is that it cannot be that the power of the said vice chancellor is such in causing the doors of the colleges to be kept shut and a strict account to be taken of all the students both of the egress and regress that it is not possible for any to be absent or if any are they may be publicly and severely called to an account for the same seeing then that on all the most strict enquiries which have been made so few have been found out and punished for being absent from their chambers at the time of the said riot it must certainly follow undeniably follow that if there was any such riot and tumult in the streets of oxford it must be made by and made up of the rabbles and people of the town the canaille and the crowds of the villages adjacent and the like and that not one scholar of the town was among them for if there had it cannot be doubted but the vice chancellor by his known vigilance and diligence and his irresistible authority could have detected them and have rusticated or otherwise exposed them all as they deserved  it is then farther alleged that the persons of whom these riotous assemblies were composed committed diverse sorts of violences such as breaking windows pulling down bonefires built up for public rejoicings on the day of the kings birth accession or coronation or on days appointed for thanksgiving for such things as those and after this to march in an armed and violent manner and pull down and demolish the meeting house or place of religious worship belonging to the dissenters alas how do men give themselves a liberty to fall upon and to asperse the most innocent and inoffensive of their brethren can it be rational to believe that a body of gentlemen many of them of quality most of them of good families and all of them of good proficiency in breeding and manners entered into particular societies for learning for polishing their understandings for adorning their souls with principles of religion and virtue with rules for good manners to qualify them for gentlemen and for instructors of others is it possible i say that these can be guilty of the streetmadness here talked of and can deviate into mobbs and rabbles it cannot be it is not rational to suggest it of them again when we call to mind that the students of the university are generally made up of such as have set their faces toward jerusalem who have the temple and the altar in their view and are learning the divine style of the pulpit that are to serve at the altar and minister in holy things is it reasonable to imagine that these can sink into clamor and tumult and dishonor their dignity so far as to herd in with the disturbers of the civil peace it can never be we cannot we must not believe it  it is well known that the most pure doctrine of the church of england preached upon all occasions by her most reverend divines and practiced in times of the greatest extremity by her most sincere disciples is a sacred pattern of obedience to the civil magistrate as to the power which is ordained of god and the breaking out into riot and tumult which is rebellion is as inconsistent with the said doctrine of the church that the church herself has in all ages held such in abomination who have thought fit to break into such unchristian courses maintaining with her utmost endeavor that blessed scripturerule lest upon record by st paul let every soul be subject to the higher powers this then having been the avowed principle of obedience professed in and owned by the church of england we humbly appeal to you excellent and learned the heads fellows graduates and students of the famous university of oxford whether we ought in justice or charity to believe that any members of your body especially of those who are preparing themselves for the service of the holy altar can be guilty of such scandalous crimes as those of rabble tumult breaking the peace etc or that if they were those offenses would not meet with the utmost resentment and severest punishment from those whose duty it is to take cognizance thereof  it cannot but be grateful to the university of oxford to remind the reader of these sheets that within those sacred walls have for many ages been professed preached and to the immortal glory of the university been practiced those most christian and heavenly doctrines of nonresistance and passive obedience and that in their full and most extended sense and meaning and it would be the absurdest thing in the world for us to suggest that the professors of those sublime principles can be guilty of any thing so diametrically opposite thereto as is the mobbing together against law and against the power of the legal magistrate which is indeed no less than against the king himself and therefore we can by no means think any other but that all the reports we have had of these things are mere forgeries and fictitious stories contrived by the enemies of our holy mother the church of england to brand her most obedient sons with the most hateful of crimes and which are most repugnant to her establishment and professed doctrine  furthermore as the charge descends to yet greater and greater offenses so much stronger are the arguments against our entertaining any suspicion of their being true even as lycurgus in his spartan constitution omitted laws against certain crimes as what he would not suppose it possible his citizens could commit with what face can the enemies of your most reverend body pretend to make mention of the extravagancies of the common people in falling upon their brethren and neighbors merely for their professing to serve god in some manner differing from the established rites and with violence and the rudest kind of persecution pull down and demolish their chapel or meetinghouse notwithstanding the same are allowed to them by the law and are legally qualified that the poor ignorant deluded and abused people the plebeii of the city and the adjacent villages might in the heat of an enraged multitude and perhaps intoxicated by liquor run upon things so extravagant and unchristian i will not dispute but to be sure not one member of the famous university of oxford could be so weak so ignorant or so wicked as to be found in the streets at that time  it is impossible heaven forbid so uncharitable a thought should be harbored in any mans breast that calls himself a christian good god what men of religion to demolish places of worship men breeding up for the pulpit to make a bonefire of pulpits men set apart to serve at the altar to pull down altars it is impossible what the sons of the prophets thus become sons of belial it can never be sure no christian can believe it without breach of the great rule of christian charity and that in an unusual manner when i say it is impossible to believe these things and it cannot be true and we can by no means entertain such thoughts it must be understood that it is impossible etc without at the same time branding the university with the blackest mark of infamy and believing her degenerated to all that is vile and contemptible believing the best constituted foundations to be converted into a rabble of licentiousness and the most excellent collegegovernment to be deviated into the worst kind of confusion supposing the beauty and comeliness of that most excellent seminary of learning to be defaced all the order and economy of the respective houses inverted and overwhelmed their pretenses to religion shamefully abandoned their claim to a wellordered society given up their discipline neglected and in a word the whole university descended to a crowd government dissolved subordination which is the very fabric of order blended with superiority and both together sunk into the worst disorder the church of england turned rebels protestants turned persecutors and the most famous seminary of religion turned a nest of phanaticks  pardon me excellent and reverend that some warmth most naturally attends such a thought as this it is only by the liveliest description of what these crimes would produce to evince the truth of what i have advanced in your defense and to show how reasonable it is that we should not in any kind give credit to the scandalous stories which your enemies suggest against you  i come now to the most malicious of all the reflections yet made and this is their fathering the voice of the rabble upon the university making the learned students of your colleges join in with the shouts of the peasants and boors and fouling their mouths with the course jargon of the street crying an ormond an ormond no king george highchurch etc and the like  i should not care to repeat words so ungrateful to loyal ears were i not well satisfied that the members of your honorable society were not capable of being so far demented not capable of uttering words so inconsistent with common sense as well as with common manners and that i may the more effectually vindicate the university from the suggestion i need do no more than to enquire into the rationality of these exclamations for if i prove the words to have neither consistency honesty or meaning i hope no body will contend about the vniversitys being in the least concerned in them  it is to be observed first that in the very connection of the words a certain opposition is placed between the center and the two extremes   ormond ormond no king george   take them the other way no king george highchurch  so that in short king george is placed in direct opposition to ormond and in direct opposition to highchurch and which is still more extraordinary ormond and highchurch are both placed in opposition to king george now we all know that this is no university language the learned and reverend members of your several colleges use quite another dialect king george being legally enthroned crowned by the lawful authority of the kingdom is now become the lords anointed as much and as effectually as any of his predecessors and as such has been recognized by the university and now to cry no king george is to make their loyalty a mere witchs prayer ring their bells backward and raise rebellion against their only lawful sovereign  now it can never be thought that the university of oxford can do thus unless we shall own she is turned phanatick has embraced the presbyterian principles of    and is actually engaged in rebellion to depose the lords anointed and bring their lawful sovereign to destruction for we have always allowed that to raise war against our sovereign and to kill murder and destroy the sovereign differ not at all in the treason and have no other specific difference than there is between the endeavor which is treason in the overt act and the perpetration which is treason completed  sure it cannot be called a compliment to the university to believe she cannot be guilty of any thing so unnatural as this so contrary to her avowed principles and steady practice for many ages  as to the name of ormond which has been the catchword of the rabble in the several streettumults which have of late so much disturbed the nation there is so much incongruous nonsense in the cry that it has helped to make those mobbs odious and hateful to the country and has shown the people that they have none to look to beyond the king upon the throne for why do they cry an ormond an ormond they will not pretend that the duke of ormond makes any claim to the crown if then they have any one to talk of next to the king why do they not name him this they dare not do because that would be to own fairly what they mean the pretender and this openly professed would open the peoples eyes too soon for did they openly and avowedly cry out the pretender the pretender no king george no hanover i say would they cry thus their own mobb would forsake them and therefore having nothing else to say they cry ormond ormond whether with a meaning or without a meaning that they may have something to fill the mouths of the people with for to have a mobb and no halloo would be a mobb and no mobb and would signify nothing for rabbles are always raised by murmur and kept alive by shouts noise is as essential to a mobb as ammunition is to an army they could do nothing without  but certainly this can never be the university of oxford we all know the veneration the university has for ormond and how entirely they are in his personal interest and they cannot be ignorant of his late graces present circumstances and the mischief such use made of his name would be to him how it would suppose him either to be for the pretender or to have the vanity to accept of this elevation of his name by the mobb in opposition to the king and so to set up for a pretender himself which would be equally ridiculous and in the end equally fatal to him nor can the university be ignorant how this would expose him to the superior power of his enemies and put the government to the necessity of prosecuting him for those other things in which they were before inclined to show him favor how it seems to set a subject in competition with his sovereign and make it absolutely necessary to crush him for that dangerous popularity which other men put upon him whether it be with his consent or no now the university of oxford who have so entire an affection for the person of their late chancellor cannot without great injustice be supposed so unconcerned for his safety and so little interested in him as to expose him to so just a reproach as this would bring upon him  on the other hand to do the late duke a piece of justice which he so much stands in need of at this time i have been credibly informed that he received the account of these things with a just indignation that he disowned it in every part that he potested openly it was what he abhorred and was so far from approving that he hoped all his friends would clear him of having any concern in it and above all that he expressed himself particularly pleased and satisfied when it was told him that the university was not in the least to be supposed to be concerned in it and that his graces opinion was the same as ours is and as all others must be who are friends to the university viz that the university could not be so distracted it was impossible  but to leave his grace to protest against it thus mobbing his name in the streets and entituling him to a crime worse than the greatest of those for which he already stands impeached i cannot but engage a little in behalf of the university as to the other cry no hanover no king george highchurch highchurch  what the meaning of the words highchurch highchurch is in the original with the various readings thereof and more particularly how they are to be understood as placed by way of antithesis against hanover and king george i leave to the decision of the university to be determined in full convocation for doubtless the university would give the true etimology of them as they are now made use of nor would it a little contribute to the enlightening the world in that matter on this eminent occasion and especially to vindicate the university her self from many wicked and malicious calumnies by which her enemies think to charge her with being in the interest of the pretender now whether the words high chvrch as now used are synonimous to the words popery right line indefeasible hereditary right and so are to be understood that highchurch are for the pretender or whether they are otherwise to be understood and how is it possible they should be otherwise understood these are the questions and indeed they are questions worthy the public decision of the university by either explaining or exploding which the university would bring to her self immortal fame of one sort or other  to leave therefore the discourse of this nature and leave the ridiculous jargon of the mobb to the just censure of the university it remains only to mention the said tumults with the same just abhorrence that the said university look on them with and having thus cleared the university of being any way guilty either of abetting or encouraging such preposterous things i come next by way of an humble address to the university to recommend to them the necessity there seems to be of their giving the world such testimony as to their great wisdom shall seem meet of their utter dislike and detestation of these wicked and pernicious practices with necessary assurances that not the colleges no nor any members thereof had the least concern therein  this seems necessary at this time because as it was a misfortune to the university to have these riots and tumults approach so near them as to be within the walls of the same city where they reside so other people being made to believe however falsely that the university have some way or other directly or indirectly been concerned in or assistant and encouraging to the said rebellious doings have taken encouragement from hence to soment the like in many parts of his majestys dominions and have given the example of oxford as their precedent  now although some are as the author hereof professes to be well assured that the university has had no confederacy in this wicked affair nor that any of her reverend members could reasonably be imagined to show themselves among the said rabbles on those unhappy occasions yet for the sakes of some who have not the same charity having been deluded by evildisposed persons whose actions required to have such a cover for them and who have therefore believed that abundance of the students graduates fellows and even of the reverend and excellent superiors of the university have given countenance to the rabbles and have even appeared in the streets of the city of oxford in the said rebellious tumults for these reasons and for ever to establish the reputation of the famous university in the opinion of all good men it is most humbly represented how necessary it would be to have the university declare themselves on these heads  this would do more than all the vindications of their friends can pretend to this would perhaps do more to prevent future riots and tumults in other parts of the kingdom even than horse and dragoons  on the other hand  if the university is willing the slanders of her enemies should take place  if she is contented that it should be believed both by natives at home and by foreigners abroad that she has forsaken the loyalty of her principles abandoned the ancient doctrines of the church of england and the profession made by her learned and pious predecessors  if she is desirous to have it believed that the university of oxford is a pattern of rebellion and that she has imbibed the fanatic principles of     if she would be thought to have declared war against king george and openly to have espoused the interest of the pretender  if she desires that the rabbles and tumults lately raised in her streets should be called by her name and should as in her name be recommended to the rest of the distracted people of this nation in a word  if the university glories in the first violence offered to the peaceable establishment of the house of hanover and a glorious protestant race of princes and declares her self to be for the forcible introductoin of a popish frenchbred thoroughly provoked resolved to be revenged pretender she has no more to do than to sit still and take no notice of this address her silence being all the favor that is asked by those who she desires should take it all in the affirmative  an account etc if illustrious ancestors high birth a capital fortune glorious titles and the true merit of a long race of men beloved by their princes and by their country were the things by which the character of his grace the duke of ormond was now to be set forth our business would be to look into the history not of the duke himself but of his noble and illustrious house and to lay down not only a line of their noble descent but a long detail of their glorious actions in which it must in justice be owned that the present duke has as much to value himself upon as most families of the nobility can boast of  but as this kind of honor has been for some ages pretty much out of fashion with wise men and that now personal merit seems something necessary to qualify men of quality for the esteem of the age wherein they live we must be content to wave all the pretenses which may be justly made to the honor of the family now before us to bury the trophies of ancestors and begin our history with the personal conduct the bravery the generous principles the great actions the fidelity the prudence policy gallantry and other distinguishing virtues of the person of his grace the duke of ormond for which he has been so justly beloved by the english nation and from hence if a faithful account be drawn we shall soon see whether the people of these nations have not with great reason so much distinguished his grace in their affections in these days of his declining circumstances and thus we shall if true merit appears build his grace the most lasting monument of glory because founded upon his own personal merit according to that of juvenal englished by mr dryden  ergo ut miremur te nec tua primum aliquid da juven sat viii that we may therefore you not yours admire first sir some honor of your own acquire and first to the honor of his first appearance in the field we find his grace the duke of ormond one of the first of the english nobility who appeared volunteer in the field in the first war against the french where he made his first campaign under the trulyglorious king william  if the example of such a king and his majestys special affection to the duke inspired his soul with vigorous principles and his natural courage joined to them prompted him to great actions nothing is more certain than that this virtue had its early reward in the distinction with which his majesty treated the duke upon all occasions the favor he showed him and that particular affection which the king showed to him in several remarkable cases  i know it has been suggested that the king who all men know was a politic prince and found out the inside of men as soon as any prince in the world could do did not show his grace so much favor singly upon his own account but that finding but few of the nobility at that time inclined to a military life and being very desirous by any means to invite and encourage them to come into the field he put the duke in such a posture and figure in his camp as was enough to move any man of honor to love the war for his sake wherein the king seemed as they said to treat the duke as if he had been the representative of the nobility and that they might see with what distinction an englishman would be used in the army for said they the king was not so ill read in men as not to know that there were many who might lay as great a claim to his favor on account of merit as the duke  during the first year therefore of the war the greatest part of the dukes fame consisted in those favors which the king did him and the honors which he received from foreigners on that account for whom the king honored it was no wonder at all to see honored by others  the duke was but a young man when he went into the army which was in the year    0 when he went over to ireland and we read of him at the battle of the boyn but all we have of him in that action terminates in this that the day after the battle he was sent with some troops to take possession of dublin and though this was as is noted but to take possession for the citizens of dublin had already taken arms and turned out the irish and sent to the king to receive them into his protection yet was monsieur overkirk sent with the troops so that the duke had no command but was sent with them as being a person by name honored in ireland for his family and for the great estate which he possessed in that kingdom so that hitherto the duke s history began principally on the fame of his birth and no merit of his own other than that he was a brisk promising young gentleman and having the advantage of such a tutor as the king gave hopes that in time if his understanding proved equal to his courage he would be a very great man in the mean time he was made one of the privy council in ireland an honor every one knows was the consequence of his birth and of the rank which he bore among the nobility of that kingdom in which if my memory fails me not there was not any man of the rank of a duke but himself at least who embraced king williams party  the next time we hear of his grace was in holland for we do not find any thing of him in the campaign of limerick or that he quitted the court to go any more into the field but the king having appointed the next year that famous congress of princes at the hague the like of which the world has not seen for many ages his grace and the late duke of norfolk were the only two english dukes who appeared at court on that occasion in which all that we read of his grace the duke of ormond amounts to this   that he made the greatest show of any of the english nobility and even beyond some sovereign princes that appeared there   that at the great feast which the king made au maison du bois at the hague his grace had a cushion given him and sat at table with the king next to the elector of brandenburg and on the kings right hand and that the elector of brandenburg drank to his grace and not to any other of the english noblemen  these were his graces first campaigns for these honors and such like may well be said to take up the first three year of his graces being abroad with the king but the war coming on apace and the service being like to be very warm he that was thus honored to be near the king at his table could not expect but in the field where it was well known his majesty never spared himself he must be equally exposed and that nothing but the utmost gallantry and love of action could recommend him to his majesty and as the gallantry of the duke had not yet been tried but promised fair his grace prepared himself for the field with a resolution to venture his life with the king in the quality of such an officer as time and the favor of his prince should offer him  the king who was a known encourager as well as rewarder of generous and gallant spirits soon found the duke was master of as much personal gallantry as was requisite for a general officer and rather strove upon all occasions to add a due proportion of phlegm to the great quantity of fire that nature and his high birth had given this young duke that so he might by weighing and by restraining his forwardness bring him to act with temper as well as feat and procure him that necessary qualification of a general viz a cool head to a warm heart how far his majesty went in this part and with what success time has shown  the first appearance however that his late grace made in the army was very particular that is for its extraordinary magnificence his grace affecting to make his quarters the general rendezvous of the english officers where he kept a table like a prince feasted all that came to him and lived at an expense superior not only to all the other generals but even to the king himself his majesty though he never affected that part himself nor did at that time much approve of it as what tended rather to effeminate his men than to qualify them for the fatigues of the campaign yet was pleased to indulge this popular humor in the duke and to make him a particular allowance to support the charge what the effects of that allowance was every one who was present on those occasions knows viz that the duke was so far from letting that allowance be an assistance or relief to his private fortunes that it only served to increase the luxuriant expense and he failed not to run out with such a boundless profusion as consumed all his majestys allowance and all that his own estate could supply also and not only that but to contract immenso debts such as it may be feared the creditors would gladly know now how to have secured to them  it cannot be forgotten that some people took so much offense at this excess as to speak to the king of it more than once and even to suggest that it seemed so much to affect popularity in the army that it might be of dangerous consequence in the end but that his majesty was always pleased to put it by and to express himself in favor of the dukes honesty more than in favor of his understanding intimating that he was a man without design  this however is noted for the readers observation and whereby he may see that the popularity of this great man seems to have its rise and beginning rather in the profusion of his expenses his contempt of money and an unwary extravagance than in the glory and merit of his actions and if such a monstrous extravagance can entitle a person to the affection so as to set him above the national justice then is the reward of vice greater than the reward of virtue  but be that as it will the way of living above naturally brought to the duke a multitude of hangers on and by consequence just so many flatterers who made it their business to trumpet praises and fulsome things of their benefactor and were requited again with the bounty and beneficence of the general on all occasions and what wonder if this behavior in an army full of needy persons and men of fortune and that by this and a general affability and condescending even to a familiarity to the soldiery he became exceedingly beloved by the army  it is not for this short discourse to enter into an enquiry how far a true fame can be raised upon actions really not justifiable in themselves and whether a person being to an excess profuse as well of his own as of other mens shall be esteemed an inimitable virtue i remember it was objected by some satirical people in this city against a reverend prelate of our church that his charity was carried up to such a height that it became criminal and that he would borrow money though he knew himself unable to repay it and that when borrowed he would give it away to relieve the poor clergy and this the censorious part of the world reproached him with calling it robbery for burnt offering but much more would this have been criminal had it been borrowed to keep a profuse table and to spend in luxurious treats what offers in his favor is that it was the mere effect of the generous bounty of his temper without any design of evil to any one and that though he impaired his estate by it yet his grace was always ready to yield to reasonable retrenchments at home and even to alienate his estate for the satisfaction of his just debts and that he has testified this by particular examples more than once  if this should be granted it will go far indeed to recommend the generous spirit of the duke in doing just things at last but it will be hard even for the university of oxford it self to convince the world that such a thoughtless bounty which should reduce a man of such a figure not only to expend the greatest allowance any king of england ever made to a general but to a necessity of alienating his inheritance and beggering his posterity i say that such a thoughtless bounty should entitle a man to a popular reputation and erect him in the thoughts of the people as a person qualified to be cried up even against the king himself  but perhaps this is not all for who indeed can think it should let us look farther into his history and the next thing we hear of the duke of ormond is that when the great battle of landen was fought the duke who commanded the troops of the english household and was by this time a lieutenant general was taken prisoner by the french and carried to namure where to his great good fortune he was immediately exchanged for the duke of berwick who was taken by the kings army after which he served with a due applause for all will allow him to be personally brave and to be able to act under another general with as much vigor as can be desired  no sooner was the late queen come to the crown and the war renewed against france with this addition that spain was now against us as it had been before for us but her majesty having resolved upon an expedition against spain where hopes were given that the spaniards would by the help of the almirante de castile declare against king philip on sight of an english fleet and army but her majesty had made choice of the duke of ormond to command in that expedition  how his grace brought the army to the bay of cadiz landed at port st marys and how for want of his graces being a less goodnatured man and more a general that rich town was entirely sacked and plundered and the innocent spanish merchants houses miserably plundered of an immense treasure contrary to the queens design and indeed by a base violence of inferior generals presuming on the easiness and good temper of their general this is well known to most men as well as it is that the spaniards were so far from being brought to favor the design of the english after that as was expected that they for ever after hated us and omitted no occasion of showing the most implacable aversion to the english nation and even to king charles iii for our sakes as was possible and which never abated till the battle of almanza where they paid us home for it neither did it abate then insomuch that it was thought fit afterward to act in catalonia rather with germans or indeed with any nations troops than with english  this was what we may call the effect of what some call a goodnatured gentleman which in a soldier may sometimes be fatal and deserve a meaner title  it is true fortune remembered the duke in the same voyage and kindly made him a present of the vigo fleet with the conquest of which coming fresh grown with laurels the people who thought he had brought much more money than he did shouted him through the streets with infinite acclamations and indeed had his grace had more soldiers and fewer thieves in his army that had been a happy voyage for england equal to that of sir francis drake but alas never was so much lost and so little got as by that voyage the great disaster whereof is by some said to be owing to the easy temper of the general who having no value for money himself seemed almost entirely to forget of what use it was to his country or that there were some at home who knew how to employ it though perhaps he did not  from this time his late gra appeared very little in the field b enjoyed the full benefits of peace  the midst of a bloody war having the profits heaped upon him of many advantageous posts such as that of the first troop of horseguards lord lieutenant of ireland and the like all which his natural profusion remaining to him have been so ill able to supply him that added to his own estate they have been far from preserving him from an immense debt which it is believed exceeds all that any english nobleman has contracted within the memory of man the old duke of buckingham only excepted  it is not my design to load the person of the late duke with reflections at a time when he is already under the resentment of the parliament and people of great britain fled his country and attainted of treason and for this reason i forbear to enter into any part of his history during his late general command of the army under the queen nor is it needful the application of the present discourse turning upon another point and rather respecting the people of great britain than the duke of ormond and the question which occurs from all that has been said is properly directed to them to enquire what there has been in all the history of this late noble person that entitles him to the affection of the common people or that should make him be beloved much less that should set him up to be the idol of the mob and to have his health drunk in a sort of opposition to the kings as the weak and unthinking people have been taught to do  and it is very well worth observation that if you ask one of the best informed among the common people what it is they admire the late duke of ormond for what are his virtues what have been the particulars of his life they have little to say nothing but that he is a good natured generous freehearted man so that in a few words to spend a mans estate without forecast without bounds and in a manner which no prudent man can do is the true way to be admired and the most egregious folly the foundation of popularity  but is it a virtue to squander away immense sums of money is spending a great estate a valuable thing and fit to recommend a man to the esteem of the people of england why then none but beggars must be the peoples favorites and to have a great multitude of creditors is to become truly popular i cannot see upon what foundation such men can claim the favor of the people but what the inhabitants of the fleet and mint have as good a title to in their proportion and it is a most unanswerable reflection upon the judgment of our people and the methods they take to place their particular favors that they are guided by those accomplishments in the persons admired which only tend to vice and degeneracy and that they are best pleased with that which ought to destroy not attract their affection it is true that generous principles and a bountiful open hand justly recommends a noble person to our good opinion especially when selfish narrow principles are grown so general in the world but in my opinion a man ceases to be generous that is open to profusion and he that can set no bounds to his bounty instead of being a wise man may rather be said to squander away his money like a fool a man of honor ought to know the value of what he bestows and of what he expends otherwise he becomes bountiful to a vice and throws away his money not for want of avarice but for want of understanding  and for what can this be said to recommend him unless he shall be said to become popular merely on the same account that the people fall into rabbles and tumults not because they are wise but because they are mad  it is time for the people of england then to consider the particular case and if they will not remove their acclamations and cry of tumult from the person of the duke yet for their own reputation let them remove it from his vice and find out some of his virtues to fix it upon for certainly a mere making ducks and drakes of his money cannot recommend him or if it does it must be only to those who can give no reason for what they do  it has been alleged by some that this popularity of the dukes has risen from the accident of circumstances and that it has not been at all of the dukes seeking or desiring or from any greater esteem than was before shown him but because the party who have of late shown themselves opposers of the government and of the house of hanover had no body else to name to the mobb who they durst mention in public  if this should be true the duke has very little obligation to those people and moreover it is the severest satyr upon the jacobite interest that it could be possible to mention being a clear testimony that their pretender has no share in the affections of the people and that they could hope for no favor among the commons if they did so much as name him  upon the whole it appears that first as the duke has no peculiar accomplishments of his own which can be said to recommend him to the mobb so all that has been done to render him popular has been done not only without any personal merit of his own but which is worse from a private piece of policy making him a cover to their jacobite design and no better than a mere tool for the pretender  finis
