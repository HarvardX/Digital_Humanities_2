satisfaction to a person who has the honor to subscribe himself  with the most profound respect my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant j w thompson  to the public the title of this pamphlet required that it should be written in the plainest and most simple language which i have endeavored to do by avoiding as much as possible all technical words a few excepted and those by no means essential to many whether they understand them or not as they cannot be embarrassed for want of knowing them in the use of the pills the directions for which are clear and intelligible to the lowest capacity but what may be found in an english dictionary to which such as read can have recourse and they who are so unfortunate as not to be able will receive information from those that can which i am certain every truly generous mind will be happy to give them for the preceding reasons the author trusts that such recapitulations as the judicious reader meets with in the course of this work will be excused his wish being to render every thing respecting the medicine it treats of etc as plain and easy as possible to the common reader  the antibilious alterative pills is a most incomparable remedy for all indispositions of the stomach and bowels arising from bile foulness indigestion worms acidity ardor ventriculi or heartburn so called predigestion flatulency that many headed monster costiveness etc etc which last often produces several of the foregoing as well as many other complaints owing to the feces or excrement becoming highly putrid from too long retention in the body thereby forming a nidus or nest of predisposing putrefaction which meeting with malignant exhalations in the air or those arising from infected persons or places etc etc etc the most dreadful fevers agues inflammatory disorders of various kinds scurvy erysipelas or st anthonys fire rheumatism leprosy jaundice cruptive complaints and numberless others are occasioned hence arises the necessity of paying the most religious attention to the first passages of the body which the able and judicious physician never fails to make the first object of his consideration the stomach is the grand reservoir which receives and prepares whatever is to support and nourish the whole machine consequently if that is out of repair or diseased from any of the beforementioned causes or others whatever is taken into such a stomach must assuredly fail more or less of producing the natural and intended effect and instead of properly nourishing the body sends periodically into the circulation  since blood is made from what we eat and drink  a portion of diseased matter which congregating by degrees must inevitably occasion various disorders in the system and although the efforts of nature to relieve herself from the variety of attacks made upon her are often great and wonderful and always should be attended to yet without the assistance of art seasonably and properly administered she frequently finks under the burden the same allgood being that provided remedies for the brute part of the creation made them also for man the former are directed by instinct to theirs the latter should have recourse to reason and experience  those pills then which in conscious rectitude i now venture to offer to the public are the attentive result of thirty years extensive practice in various parts of the world upwards of twenty of which i passed in his majestys service in the army the officers and soldiers of which to whom i have the honor to be known and whom i beg leave in this humble little pamphlet to invoke will i doubt not do me the justice to speak as i presume to think my conduct and character merit that of being indefatigable attentive and candid in my profession and successful in my practice i have the same expectations from those amongst whom i have now practiced above ten years in this capital  i am however well aware that this address and the object of it is likely to subject me to the sarcastical sneers of some of the wonderful geniuses of the faculty many of whom owe however perhaps their most exalted fame to the secret use of dr jamess powder and other medicines of that description there are besides i make no doubt some other thrusts i must be prepared to parry from those uninformed contracted minds who term every medicine the constituent parts of which the proprietor keeps in secret a quack medicine and refuse to take it on that account at the same time swallow abundantly the prescriptions of the apothecary and physician of which they have just as much knowledge as of the ingredients that compose my pills but to such i shall only observe that they are totally ignorant of the true meaning of the word quack that epithet being only applicable to illiterate pretenders not properly bred to the profession and unacquainted with its practice otherwise it must necessarily follow that every man of whatever art science or profession who improves an old or invents any new thing because he will not divulge the secret becomes indisputably a quack consequently there must be quack lawyers and preachers who profit well by keeping mankind in secret darkness quack painters cobblers tinkers and tailors and it may not be unfair to add quack physicians of state who notwithstanding their feeling regard for his majestys loyal subjects will not blush to crib a shillings worth of pills out of the poor mans medicine chest stamp duty to administer to the hectic constitution of the state and relieve the canine appetite of minions placemen and pensioners here stop for a moment humanity and reflect upon what the sensations of that mans heart must be who first suggested this benevolent tax extorted from the painful afflictions and miseries of the sick particularly the lower orders of society who are frequently obliged to seek relief from what are termed quack medicines after perhaps having spent nearly their little all in vain endeavors to obtain it from the most eminent gentlemen of the faculty  a nostrum they may term my medicine if they please for such it is and of which most of the faculty have to boast a few but which i shall be ready to make known to the public for a proper gratuity whenever it shall be found to answer as i am confident it will do to all such as give it a fair and impartial trial  i should not have presumed to take up so much of the readers time as i have done in this address or have appeared so much my own panegyrist as most probably i shall be thought but with a view to remove as much as possible the prejudices which generally and sometimes justly attend on addresses of this sort particularly when unsanctioned by a voluminous publication entered at stationers hall  a mode quite in fashion with modern practitioners who begin their career that way to attract public notice in works of which description the press already teems with too many in the medical line the mere offspring of lectures and stuffed with the writers own and borrowed hypotheses unestablished and inadmissible in practice serving only to bewilder and lead the public into fatal errors  hippocrates says the description of the causes and treatment of diseases should not be the suppositions of ingenious men for all hypotheses says that learned father of the faculty i reject as useless nay dangerous in physic but from certain means often tried on human bodies the effects of which bear evident proof to our senses all our reasonings should be drawn not but i ever wish to see in print the welldigested sentiments of able and experienced men of the profession it is their duty to give them and the world are indebted to them for such  such as will stand the test and command the sanction of the critical reviewer without fear partiality or bribe  in short in my private opinion the study of physic is by no means so difficult or involved in such labyrinths as many writers would make the world believe a proper knowledge of the human system with strict attention to the efforts and operations of nature joined to a quick perceptibility on the part of the practitioner to watch and catch the critical period when she cannot relieve herself and then to assist her cautiously by the proper and experienced use of such aid as providence has provided for that purpose is the only task of a physician  having now said as much as i think is necessary to offer in this place to a discerning public in behalf of my box of pills etc i shall proceed to give as clear and concise directions as possible for their use in the complaints already mentioned and some others making some farther remarks as i go along  directions for a grown person a common dose of these pills is three one to be taken going to bed and two the next morning strong constitutions may take two night and morning and some have taken three night and morning but in general one at night and two in the morning is sufficient and many require only one night and morning  a child of one year old may take a third part of one of the pills from three years to five half a pill and from five to ten a whole pill and so on in proportion to age and strength as it may be difficult to make children swallow a pill it may be dissolved in any simple liquid or mixed with a little pap or current jelly  my reason for preferring part of the dose to be taken over night is that by gradually dissolving whilst the body is at rest it mixes more readily with the offending matter in the stomach etc thereby exciting it into action renders the remaining part of the dose more effectual and speedy in its operation in the morning  as these pills are a declared enemy to bile whenever that is in the stomach they never fail to vomit and sometimes one pill in the course of the night will operate both ways not owing to the violence or strength of the medicine as some may be induced to think but from the great soulness and plenitude of the stomach and bowels at the time being overloaded with bilious filth or toolongretained feces  a selfevident position which must appear clear to every intelligent capacity  therefore should the night pill only operate by vomit the patient must not be deterred from taking more in the morning for after the stomach has been well cleansed of its contents two or three more pills will only occasion as many stools without any farther sickness if after the first dose any part of the cause which induced taking them should appear to remain they may be taken daily or every other day until all the offending matter is carried off  during their operation it will be proper to drink a draught of gruel beef or chamomile tea or some such simple liquid to sacilitate each operation and render it more effectual which the patient will do well to have in readiness previous to taking the pills  this efficacious medicine though sometimes so brisk in operating is notwithstanding i do aver as innocent and as safe as a dose of salts rhubarb or a common emetic and may be taken at all times and seasons with as little risk or danger as they will always find their way out of the body by vomit stool or urine and quietly by the latter unless when they meet with such humors in their passage as required being carried off by the other outlets  the advantages then arising from these pills according to this unvarnished account must be many and great  first by effectually cleansing the stomach that grand reservoir is put in a proper state to perform the important offices for which nature intended it of digestion etc secondly by removing all longretained feces and bilious slimy matter from the lower bowels fevers jaundice agues cholic worms flatulency inslammatory tendency rhcumatism etc etc are cut off in the bud and destroyed thirdly in filtering by the kidneys and urinary passages gravelly concretions dropsy etc are happily relieved and prevented and lastly by conveying accumulated salts and other acrid and feculant humors out of the blood by this channel leprosy scurvy scrophulous humors and many eruptive complaints and other foulnesses of the blood arising from thence as well as all that tribe of complaints termed nervous originating from the same source since the nerves as well as the rest of the body receive their nourishment from the blood are prevented and often cured hence it will appear that these pills are not only an effectual cleanser of the stomach and bowels but also a most powerful alterative  to which end after having properly prepared the body by two or three common doses taken in the space of a week or ten days the patient should then enter on the alterative course first by taking one pill at night for four or five nights successively afterward take one night and morning continuing these as long as any part of the cause or effect which induced taking them appears to remain and it will not be amiss to continue them some little time longer for it sometimes happens that causes remain after effects vanish and frequently it happens as for instance in the small pox that effects such as a redness of the skin etc remain for some time after the cause is removed observing to increase the night or morning dose occasionally to keep the body gently open it having been already remarked that after the stomach has been well cleansed they cease to act as an emetic for as the bodies of some are constitutionally costive it may become necessary in such habits to increase the dose as just mentioned yet in general a pill night and morning not only relieves the most costive habits but one will prove sufficient in most constitutions for that purpose here it may not be improper to remark that costive habits are more subject than others to offensive and fetid breath particularly children whose powers of digestion are by no means equal to the too great quantity of strong and improper food they commonly take in which idea perhaps may be one motive why the french have such frequent recourse to lavement or clyster i say it has been already observed that our blood is made from what we take into the stomach from whence is prepared that milky liquid called chyle which forms the basis of the blood the whole process of which is performed within the space of twentyfour hours after which period the feces or excrement can answer no good purpose by remaining in the body since all their nutritive and essential parts good or bad which depends upon the nature of the food so taken in and state of the stomach has been extracted for the above purpose now as the feces in the most healthy constitutions are rendered highly offensive when discharged at the end or in the course of that time how much more putrid must they inevitably become if retained for days or weeks as is very often the case in relaxed and weak habits more especially such as lead sedentary and inactive lives  during the alterative course it will be highly necessary for the patient to observe such mode in diet as is calculated to aid and assist the intention of the medicine by avoiding all salted highseasoned and inflammatory food yet notwithstanding to partake of such proper innocent and nourishing food as is sufficient to keep up the bodily strength and produce good juices for my wish is not to reduce the patients strength only to conquer the disease and by supporting the constitution properly they will be the better enabled to obtain that end but as it is impossible to give a bill of fare suitable to every constitution palate and situation in life suffice it therefore to say that the food should be simple easy of digestion nutritive plain dressed and moderately taken that is not to load the stomach with too much at one time but rather to eat as instinctive animals do in a state of nature little and often  a hint from thence is no bad precedent for nature will ever be found to exceed the best philosophical reasonings of art  after what has been already said i think it almost unnecessary to add that such as are accustomed to take physic in the spring and autumn will find this the best they can have recourse to indeed no person however healthy would be the worse for employing this friendly scavenger once or twice a month and all such who are so unfortunate as to labor under a very fashionable disease will find these pills a most certain remedy taken agreeable to the alterative course just laid down without having their bodies loaded like a barometer with mercury owing to the too liberal use of which in the present practice many unsortunate beings though cured of that disease are left a wreck subject like the mathematical instrument to every vicissitude of weather to trail out a miserable existence  women also at the turn of life would do well to pay strict attention to this medicine being in every respect calculated to carry off the humors which nature often embarrassed with at that critical period throws on the legs and other parts of the body rendering the remainder of their days painful and often burdensome  and even women with child need not be afraid to take these pills because they sometimes vomit to remove that costiveness they are commonly subject to in that situation since vomiting is a natural attendant upon pregnant women and sometimes violently so particularly in their first pregnancy which the wisdom of providence has so ordered no doubt for the best of ends and if any danger was likely to ensue from that operation we might surely expect it at that time when all the bowels are more than ordinarily compressed from the extension of the uterus and weight of the foetus yet who ever heard of any such women being injured by vomiting  in the course of my practice i never met with any instance of the kind on the contrary i always found it relieved and made them more cheerful and easy again how frequently do people at sea go through that operation several times a day for weeks together without any bad consequences from the operation itself and even hectic people and others who have been to all appearance at the last gasp and given over by their physician by making a sea voyage have been effectually relieved by that operation and returned home to the astonishment of all that knew them perfectly sound and hearty and yet notwithstanding all these evident proofs before their eyes most people are terrisied at taking an emetic  as the greatest inconveniency which attends this operation particularly in costive habits arises from wind pent up in the bowels which sometimes occasion griping pains therein during the action of an emetic that might in a great measure if not altogether be prevented by administering the following or some such clyster previous to taking any thing of the emetic kind viz take about half a pint of gruel or broth of any kind a table spoonful of common salt three large spoonsuls of vinegar and as much of oil mixed makes one for a grown person in short wind being from that necessary delicacy observed in society often kept back when nature is disposed to discharge it lays the foundation of innumerable tormenting complaints the wind so restrained i have frequently when sitting in company heard rumbling for a considerable time in the bowels of a person several seats from me and once traveling in a stage coach from stamford to london a poor woman therein from a circumstance of this sort was greatly embarrassed and put to the blush from the tittering of two unfeeling young men farmers to appearance fellow travelers she soon after grew pale and was about to faint when i stopped the coach and got her out in the air upon which she fell into a strong hysteric fit that held above half an hour in the course of which she expelled an immense deal of wind both upwards etc which contributed to her recovery i mention this just to prove how little a matter will put the boasted human machine out of sorts and to reprobate the unfeeling conduct of such as can enjoy a laugh at the painful misfortunes of their fellow creatures particularly of that sex who command our most humane and affectionate attention being from the peculiar restraint their modesty lays them under liable to many inconveniences which men are not  in the year    0 the following extraordinary case occurred at mahon in the island of minorca  william kearns a soldier of the old buffs was sitting on a stone seat by the guardroom door between the hours of nine and ten at night with several others of the guard his comrade on passing by him to the guard room in play put himself in a boxing attitude saying have at you kearns i can lick you now upon which kearns threw his head back suddenly against the wall the distance about six inches which made him call out seemingly dipleased damn you messmate that is no joke  i believe you have made me break my sconce then taking off his hat he rubbed the back of his head with his hand saying i will be up with you for this the other ran laughing into the guard room  kearns continued afterward above half an hour sitting at the door talking as usual to the other men without appearing the least indisposed or saying any thing more about his head he then went in and laid down on the guard bed at twelve oclock being to go sentinel and not turning out with the relief the corporal thinking he was asleep went in to rouse him and sound him lying on his side foaming at the mouth speechless and his eyes wide open the corporal then called to some of the men to come and see him and they tried to raise him up upon which he fetched a deep groan and expired one of the men ran to mr duffy surgeon to the   th regiment who lived almost opposite the guard house and another to me about half a mile distant mr duffy went to him immediately and opened the temple artery but it was too late  he was dead upon my arrival soon after i learnt the preceding account we then out off his hair and carefully examined the head and every part but could not perceive the smallest external injury whatsoever except a very slight extravasation of blood behind the left ear the side he lay on the guard bed about one oclock that day i opened the head of the deceased in presence of dr monro physician to the garrison mr duffy and anoher surgeon when we found about two ounces not more of coagulated blood on the right anterior hemisphere of the brain which appeared to have issued from a vessel of the dura matter every other part of the membranes brain ventricles etc etc were in as sound and perfect a state as possible the head was uncommonly full of brain and the scull remarkably thin and in many places quite diaphanous  dr monro immediately waited on general johnston the governor of the island to report his own and our opinion of this case and mr duffy and i proceeded to open the body not in expectation of finding any thing farther relative to the cause of this mans death but from a custom i always followed of opening the body of every soldier that died upon raising the breast bone a very uncommon fullness appeared on the left side about the heart and on dividing the pericardium a great quantity of very fetid wind issued forth and about four table spoonfuls of clear lymph the heart of this man who was a very stout wellmade soldier thirtytwo years of age and about five feet eight inches high was uncommonly small indeed weighing only fifteen ounces five drams troy and looked as if it had been parboiled the lungs liver stomach and all the other entrails were in as sound and perfect a state as possible and in every other respect formed as much for longevity as any i ever saw in my life i have been the more particular in stating all the circumstances of this case from the supposed cause of his death and the very extraordinary contents of the pericardium and state of the heart leaving the decision of the real cause of this mans death to those whose superior skill and microscopic discernment may enable them to give a better solution to it than i choose to risk my opinion in giving at the same time to show that windy complaints are what i have already said of them numerous wonderful and often puzzling and therefore how necessary it is that all dead bodies should be opened for information sake since the dead cannot be injured and the living may benefit by it  this case i have singled out from several others which i have in my possession relative to windy tumors discovered by dissection i beg leave to add that this man had once or twice been troubled with a slight asthmatic complaint but in every other respect was as healthy to all appearance as any soldier in the regiment  to return again to the subject of emetics  some time ago i was called to a gentleman a very free liver and an extraordinary hard drinker who i make no doubt had a hundred times in his life vomited most severely from inebriety infinitely more so than he would have done from any common emetic given by the faculty notwithstanding which upon my proposing a vomit for him which his situation absolutely required he immediately held up his hands begging for gods sake he might not take an emetic that he was too weak that it would strain him to pieces and kill him he however got an emetic and obtained the wanted relief  i say again that after all these incontrovertible examples it seems to me most strange that a rational being should be so much afraid of this operation when many of the brute part of the creation that feed carnivorously take such things as instinct directs them to in order to discharge the offending contents of their stomach that way and i have seen a hawk disgorge the contents of his craw but i believe no person ever saw an ox or an ass a goat or gander vomit of course nature never intended it  here by the by though foreign to the subject of these leaves permit me however to offer a hint about the treatment of horses which noble animal i am clearly of opinion has been often tortured if not killed by having things of the emetic kind administered since a horse can no more vomit than an ass though i once heard a gentleman declare that he saw a dead horse vomit after having dr jamess powders given him when alive but as this is a matter i may perhaps treat more at large on some future day i shall close it here only adding that i am satisfied from all i have seen and heard that many medicines that are used by mankind are totally improper and highly dangerous for such animals as feed granivorously and cannot vomit but how this erroneous method of treating horses as human beings has become the practice could be very easily accounted for  vomiting is i must however confess a very unpleasant operation but believe me it is a much more speedy and effectual method of relieving the stomach of its offending contents than carrying it off by the other channel through all the turnings festoonings and curvatures of the lower bowels in the cells of which some of the feces will frequently stick and lodge for weeks nay months together forming that nidus of mischief i have before mentioned of which the following is a case in point  a soldier of the third regiment of foot in which i served several years was seized with a cholic in the latter end of september      at exeter where we were at that time quartered after returning from minorca which place we left in the month of may preceding and arrived in england the beginning of june as we were in a cider country i suspected his complaint might arise from drinking that liquor but he assured me that he had not drank any cider that he did not like it however after taking a few doses of rhubarb and some other little things his complaint went off and he returned to his duty but being a few days after attacked again with the same disorder in a most violent degree he was taken into the hospital  every thing he took came off his stomach immediately and in spite of every effort no passage could be procured downwards being now exceedingly alarmed for the safety of my patient i directed one of my pills to be given every hour until they should operate by stool the two first pills made him rather sick but did not vomit him after taking six they began to operate downwards and in one of the discharges he brought off a great quantity near a handful of grape skins highly putrid and offensive from that hour his violent pain went off and in a week he was perfectly recovered  questioning him now about this appearance and evident cause of his complaint i asked if he had eat any raisins either alone or in pudding he assured me he had not taken any thing of the kind since he was on ship board but that on his leaving minorca a friend gave him several pounds of dried grapes by way of sea stock that he eat them all on his passage and from that time had never tasted any thing of the kind he remembered he said that the grapes griped him often in the same place as when he first applied to me but not so much as to occasion an application then as the pain generally went off with a motion and he thought they did him good however it is very clear that a part of this trash remained in his body near four months besides this several other similar cases have occurred to me in the course of practice  gouty habits and all those who live freely either in eating or drinking for the reasons already stated concerning the stomach and bowels will find this a sovereign remedy for the sudden and violent attacks which such are often subject to  perhaps it will be asked how can any one medicine be good for so many different complaints as the author has mentioned to which i answer because it is an alterative by which it is meant that all such offending humors in the body as nature is not able of herself to throw off are by means of this medicine so changed disposed and rendered capable of expulsion by the proper channels or outlets as to assist her efforts in removing them effectually  and now i beg leave in turn to ask of all those good folks who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel how it happens that antimony bark mercury and even several insignificant and other medicines which i could mention are made use of by all and every physician and medical practitioner as general remedies for almost every disease that falls under their cognizance and lastly though often too late why the patient is recommended to that universal remedy bath water etc when the doctor can do no more for him  i shall not however presume to impose so far upon the understanding of the public as to endeavor to maintain that my pills are an infallible remedy for all the diseases to which human nature is incident but thus much i venture positively and boldly to assert that i do not believe it is in the power of chemical or medical art to compose a better medicine a milder and more complete alterative out of the drugs etc in present use but what future time may produce i cannot pretend to say  surgeons of the army and navy without derogating from their abilities by providing themselves with these pills would have a remedy immediately at hand which their situations sometimes will not admit them to get seasonably prepared by which means many valuable lives might be saved and themselves spared much trouble and expense but particularly masters of merchant ships who have no medical assistance more especially such as visit warm climates where bilious complaints are most prevalent and also those who live in the country remote from such aid would find the poor mans medicine chest what i have justly termed it a most invaluable remedy  here it may not be improper to give a little advice to those also who visit margate and other watering places in the season for the benefit of their healths from whence many return worse than they went and numbers lose their lives from injudicious bathing though i am convinced from experience that the use of the cold bath when properly applied is of the highest importance toward preserving of health yet it should never be had recourse to until the body is first properly prepared not by a few doses of salt water as is usually the case which slips quickly through the bowels leaving behind the longretained feces etc which i have so pointedly described possessing no powers to act upon them effectually for give me leave to acquaint those who think that one thing that opens the body is as good as another that they are most egregiously mistaken for in fact there is as much difference between one purgative and another as between wine and water for though both of these will allay thirst yet they will not equally exhilerate the spirits and produce intoxication permit me therefore most humbly to recommend to all such as visit those places for their healths sake previously to prepare themselves for a fortnight or three weeks with my pills agreeable to the alterative course laid down in page  0 convinced they will find their advantage in so doing afterward i have no objection to their drinking occasionally a dose of salt water if they like it to keep the body gently open being perfectly proper the body should be so kept during a course of bathing  there is one hint more and that of no small importance which i shall presume to offer to bathers which is to live temperately and regularly whilst they are seeking relief from the bath and not go into it hissing hot like an iron out of a smiths forge plunged into his trough after sitting up all night and partaking most unmercifully of all the luxuries of the season which misconduct i am fully persuaded has brought numbers to an untimely grave  i could offer some other useful remarks upon this subject but as it would extend this little work beyond the limits proposed i shall reserve them for another place for the same reason i shall also omit many respectable and wellauthenticated vouchers which i have in my possession of the wonderful effects my pills have already produced but indeed i could rather wish they should establish themselves by their future good works than endeavor to support them by anterior authorities  before i conclude i think it a duty i owe the public as well as myself to make a remark or two more and although it is neither my talent nor wish to depreciate the productions of others with a view to enhance the value of my own yet it is but justice to draw a fair line between mine and some of the pills which are at present in muchesteemed use not doubting at the same time but such are justly entitled to the approbation they have obtained from the benefit those who used them have experienced and who think themselves no doubt as much indebted to them for such relief as they would have been to the prescriptions of the late sir richard jebb or any great physician of the present day of the ingredients of whose prescriptions they had no more knowledge than of those that constituted such pills and therefore i humbly presume it is of very little consequence to the party who is so relieved whether obtained from sir jeffery dunstan mayor of garratt or the vicar of bray but as one watch excels another in regulating time so may one medicine surpass another in momentous essicacy many of those pills then which i shall forbear to call by name lest i should incur the appellation of being envious and increase the number of my opponents being only calculated to act merely as a purgative can by no means come in competition with what i have asserted and on which i pledge my reputation mine will be sound to persorm consequently a medicine of this sort has long been wanting therefore without entertaining an iota of doubt but i shall in due time receive from a generous public the approbation i seek for the offering made i shall now conclude with an old but just proverb    siquid novisti reslius islis candidus imperti si non his utere meum having entitled my box of pills the poor mans medicine chest it remains for me to maintain that appellation these pills then are put up in boxes at four shillings and six pence and ton shillings and six pence slamps included the small box contains fortyeight pills or twelve large doses now as a common dose is but three and some require only two pills it will often happen that this box may contain twenty doses and whoever is obliged to have recourse to an apothecary for an equal number of doses of medicine would have at least twenty shillings to pay exclusive of some consideration for his trouble and attendance and perhaps not receive as much benefit from the whole as from one dose of these pills the large box contains one hundred and twenty pills or thirty large doses  for the present the pills will be sold by the proprietor only at his patent baume of arquebusade warehouse no    leicester street leicester square the use of which baume has been found as will appear by the annexed letters of the highest importance but as soon as proper persons are appointed to vend them their names will be affixed to this publication and the better to prevent impositions each box is sealed with his coat of arms  motto confido in deo  the public are requested to pay strict attention to these circumstances since there are a number of medicasters and other piratical wretches ever ready to obtrude on the world their own dangerous imitations for the works of others preying like the hornet on the honey of the industrious be under a pretense of being able to analyze without knowing the nature of that arduous and nice process and many of those pretenders not even the meaning of the word by which means a most valuable medicine loses its reputation and the public are deceived  letters the baume was first made public in february      since which time the following are a part of upwards of a hundred letters addressed to the patentee originals of which are now in his possession by those who have experienced its happy effects facts are stubborn things which speak for themselves sir woolwich aug         i should think myself lost to all sense of gratitude if i did not acknowledge that under god you have been the saver of my life by the use of your baume darquebusade and i am now happy in acquainting you that all those violent pains in my stomach and bowels as well as my loins and kidneys disagreeable belchings cold clammy sweats costiveness sloppage of urine restless nights etc etc occasioned by a bilious complaint which i contracted in america have all entirely left me and i am now thank god in perfect health  for the first ten or twelve days i took the baume i thought myself worse and left it off but at your particular request i began to use it again and in about a week found myself better and began to void gravel of a
