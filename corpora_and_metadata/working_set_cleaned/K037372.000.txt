landlord i dont think that twenty years of dissipation will qualify me the better for a husband i look on marriage as a sort of partnership in which i mean to engage whilst i can bring youth good

had lame horses and drunken drivers  dust from the road  extortion from the innkeepers and bad halfpence from the turnpikes  a blight upon honesty and good manners blows from this city of london to every point of the compass  it is a mere ocean of knavery with a continual springtide which infects all the streams of fresh water round the country and makes them brackish up to their very source   land it is very true your honor traveling is very dear now   whim dear with a vengeance  i remember the time when a man could be choked upon a dusty road for seven pence a mile but now one must pay a shilling a mile for the pleasure of being smothered because it is one of the luxuries of life  to charlotte you have not lost your watch have you   char oh no sir all is safe about me  aside except my heart   whim my pockets were all safe when i got out of the chaise i suppose i have hardly lost any thing since i came into the house   land lord sir what do you mean  in my house   whim egad i dont

talking mr whimsey   y whim i am glad of it  i never expected you would have been tired of that   mrs patt what signifies reasoning with you you are so thoughtless so dissipated  keep such company and

mrs pattypan what do you think of my son  how do you like him for a lodger   mrs patt indeed sir he seems to be a mighty civil agreeable young gentleman  quite the reverse of my late lodger  a dissipated goodfornothing  but give me leave to show you the apartments maam   whim mrs pattypan let us have tea as soon as you can  i am rather fatigued with my journey exeunt mrs pattypan and charlotte whim solus in faith i like jacks lodgings mightily  here are all the pictures i gave him and the library of books  he has taken great care of them i see  all look as good as new and not a volume displaced  he is a careful reader i dare say  i shall fancy myself quite at home among my old acquaintance looking round but who have we here   monford speaking as he enters let me know the moment the lady comes   whim aside some friend of my sons i suppose  to him sir your most obedient  very pretty apartments sir   monf yes sir  i dont dislike them   whim i beg sir you will be seated

expect my son presently  you will stay to tea sir    monf ha ha ha i believe i shall sir  aside a most impudent old fellow this seems to be   whim aside believe i shall  he might as well have said thank ye   frank aside a curious acquaintance my master seems to have picked up   exit monf sir i should be exceedingly sorry to be guilty of any rudeness to you  but i apprehend you are not apprized who has taken these lodgings   whim oh yes i am sir   monf in short i expect my sister from the country every moment and perhaps the presence of a third person might not be quite agreeable to her   whim oh as to that i expect my daughter every moment too and we may all drink tea together tea brought in by nancy  to nancy do tell my daughter to make haste exit nancy  aside there can be no harm to invite him as he is a friend of jacks  may i ask your name sir   monf monford sir   whim aside monford  the very fellow who wants to run away with charlotte   enter frank frank aside to monford miss whimsey is now in the house sir   monf in the house  here frank kick this damned portmanteau down stairs frank offers to take it but whimsey prevents him you must really pardon me sir  any other time

hold you in my arms again  to whimsey give me leave sir to introduce you to my sister   char aside good heavens what an adventure   whim a fine girl mr monford  pray are you both by the same father   monf sir   whim i am sure till this moment i did not know i could boast of such a hopeful offspring as you  exit frank char hear me my dear father   monf aside his daughter  a curse on my unlucky stars   whim dont be disappointed young man  you have had a devilish lucky escape in missing my daughter i assure you  for not a shilling would i have given her had she thrown herself away on you   monf aside what the devil shall i say   whim i suppose you are muttering curses against the old fellow because he will not suffer you to hum him  come use no ceremony  let me hear what i am   monf aside i have it  you are sir indeed a friend   whim for depriving you of your wife  that is indeed the part of a modern friend   monf i thank you for your candor  you have discovered to me my mistake   whim you expected then that the old codger would have whimperd a little joined your hands and have given you half his fortune for making a fool of him   monf i own it  but i see i was in an error miss charlotte i thought you were a woman of fortune  your father has convinced me that you will no longer be such if you marry me i should therefore be guilty of the greatest injustice in wishing to sacrifice your happiness to the gratification of my passion   char sir  you  you are perfectly in the right  i feel the delicacy of your conduct  and  you may be sure i approve it  exit charlotte whim give me your hand monford  egad i begin to think you are a devilish sensible fellow   monf between you and i mr whimsey it will not do for younger brothers like me to fall in love   whim certainly not it may well be called falling in love it is in truth a false step and many a man who has once met with the accident has found the ill effects of it ever afterward   monf right sir suppose now you were to recommend me to a wife  a rich widow for instance   whim eh why what say you to the lady of this mansion mrs pattypan  my son jack tells me in his letters she is worth a round sum   monf a good thought sir with your permission i will step to miss whimsey and tell her my resolution of courting the old lady directly   whim dont trouble yourself  i will step to miss whimsey myself and return immediately to have a little more talk with you on the subject odso but while i am looking after my daughter i may lose my portmanteau  exit whimsey and drags off his portmanteau enter frank frank so sir you are in a fine hobble here this old man is the father of your mistress   monf even so frank  luckily a thought occurred to me which i flatter myself has put him off his guard  i have pretended to give up his daughter and pay my addresses to the old pastrycook below stairs   frank lord sir this scheme is too absurd to pass on any man however credulous he may be   monf to be sure  but if i can make him believe this absurdity but for a few hours all may yet be well  i think i can easily find means to convey my dear girl out of the reach of her fathers power this evening  go instantly frank and order a chaise to be at the corner of the street exactly at twelve oclock  exit frank enter mrs pattypan mrs patt sir your most obedient humble servant  i did not understand that you expected your father in town   monf nor i neither madam  aside so i must pass for the old fellows son i find   mrs patt i hope sir you like the lodgings and dont think them dear at three guineas a week   monf certainly not   enter whimsey mrs patt aye i knew we should agree sir ha ha ha   whim egad he has put the question to her  aside monford i perceive you have begun the attack   monf and have conquered too  only dont interrupt me in my victory   whim not i  you may say what you will before me   monf aye but the lady will not care to speak before you pray now sir leave us to ourselves   mrs patt to whim your servant sir we had come to terms before you came in   whim oh you had   mrs patt yes we were proceeding to settle every thing   whim then i am sure i wont interrupt you and so good bye  aside i will take the liberty of listening to their conversation however  nothing but the evidence of my own ears can remove my suspicions  exit monf dont mind my father mrs pattypan old folks have their peculiarities   mrs patt true sir  i dare say it will be the same with you and i when we grow old  enter whimsey and retires to the back scene but however to return to business  right reckoning makes long friends as i used to tell my first husband    monf aye i dare say we shall be very happy together   whim aside happy together   mrs patt i presume sir you generally dine out   monf constantly   whim aside zounds that is odd enough not to dine at home during the honeymoon at least   mrs patt and you keep good hours i hope sir   monf oh yes you will always find me in bed by twelve oclock   whim aside that is a material article   monf i think you have no family mrs pattypan   mrs patt no sir i never had any yet  but as i think of altering my situation it may happen that    monf i understand you  but that will make no sort of difference to me   mrs patt indeed i am very happy to hear it  for you know sir some gentlemen have an objection to children   whim aside egad there can be no deceit in all this  it will be a match i see that  coming forward aloud i wish you both joy with all my soul  dont be confused mrs pattypan  you know this is nt the first bargain of the sort you have struck   mrs patt oh dear no sir nor i hope it will not be the last   whim aside d  d good encouragement for a man to venture on her i suppose she expects to bury two or three husbands yet   monf aside to whim well sir what do you say to all this   whim aside why  why  why  you are a bold man that is all  aloud come as it is a bargain take hands on it  take hands  nay salute her  come kiss her my boy   mrs patt aside my boy  the old gentleman seems mighty fond of his son   monf aside egad i wish this ceremony were well over i shall never be able to carry on the farce salutes her   whim joining their hands may you live long together and may no domestic quarrels obtrude on your happiness  may you mrs pattypan be surrounded by a numerous and lovely offspring   mrs patt aside a numerous offspring   monf pray my dear sir drop the subject  you see it distresses her and you know one must consult a womans feelings on some occasions   whim certainly certainly   monf i am sure i should be sorry to hurt mrs pattypans delicacy   whim so should i  when a woman has but just enough left for her immediate use it would be cruel indeed to damage that  i will change the subject monford depend upon it he converses with mrs pattypan in dumb show   enter frank frank aside to monf sir it is an impossibility for you to procure an interview with miss charlotte   monf impossible frank   frank absolutely so  she is so closely watched  but i have engaged one in your interest who will take any message to her for you no less a person than mr timothy tartlett   monf but how can he assist me   frank by communicating to your mistress any message you wish he will never be suspected   monf not a bad thought in faith   frank he is waiting to speak to you below stairs  slip away from the old gentlemen directly   whim now what the devil can they be whispering about  i always suspect a man to be a rogue when i see him whisper whimsey interrupts and looks anxiously at them eh why you have not changed your mind as to matrimony have you  exit frank monf not in the least i promise you sir  i am now going on some business which i flatter myself will hasten the match and a few hours will i hope cure all your suspicions  exit whim egad though i will ask the old woman some questions about him there can be no harm in that  pray mrs pattypan if i dont hurt your delicacy by the question how long may you have been acquainted with this young man whom you are going to marry   mrs patt aside young man whom i am going to marry how the deuce could he hear of my intending to marry tim tartlett   whim you will excuse my curiosity  but pray is not he rather wild   mrs patt aside yes yes  he means tim  to him why sir i fear he is rather flighty  he has his little gallantries   whim look ye mrs pattypan  as to his little gallantries as you call them perhaps i know more of the matter than you do   mrs patt dear sir you awaken my curiosity   whim but really when i consider how disagreeable a task it is to interfere between man and wife  for such i consider you to be    mrs patt it is very true sir  in all the quarrels that i had with my poor dear soul that is dead and gone and many they were we never admitted any body to interfere but fought them out by ourselves   whim however on this occasion my friendship for you overcomes every other consideration  in a word your intended husband has made love to my daughter   mrs patt what do i hear i shall certainly faint   whim attempting to support her for heavens sake dont faint yet for i cannot support you upon my soul   mrs patt an ungrateful fellow  who owes all he has in the world to me   whim then of course all he has in the world ought to be at your disposal but he did nt own to me that he was even acquainted with you   mrs patt i have been a mother to him   whim perhaps he thought you fitter to be his mother than his wife   mrs patt oh sir it is not to be repeated what i have done for that young man   whim if it is not to be repeated i am sure i dont wish to hear it mrs pattypan  but between you and me  i suspect the girl is fond of him   mrs patt fond of him   whim indeed i dont wonder at it  he is a handsome dog   mrs patt he is to be sure a likely young fellow  not that i consider his person  the mind is my choice  what are fine eyes  flowing locks  brilliant complexions    whim interrupting her mighty pretty things to look at mrs pattypan  aside though you never found them in your glass   mrs patt but what are they compared to the beauties of the mind   whim faith i dont know  comparisons are odious and therefore i shall not attempt them   mrs patt beauty is but skin deep    whim aside then in faith your skin conceals it more effectually than any skin i ever saw in my life   mrs patt but pray sir how did you first discover this affair  tell me all the particulars    whim i would if i had thought of it a little sooner  but for aught i know at this moment your scapegrace may be explaining to my daughter some particulars of which i should wish her at present to remain ignorant  so it behooves me to look about me  exit mrs patt sola  why here they come  yes to be sure  madam ogles and simpers how ugly she looks when she smiles   retreats to the back of the stage enter charlotte and tim char and what time is the chaise to be ready   tim at twelve oclock miss  that was the time squire monford fixed ah how he will be in the fidgets  i know what it is to be a true lovier myself as our nancy can vitness   char oh mr timothy i own to you my courage fails me now i come to the point   mrs patt aside i think your ladyship seems to have a pretty good share of courage to come to the point so soon   tim as to the matter of that miss as i told you before i am as much in love as you are    mrs patt aside a mutual declaration of love   tim never mind  by this time tomorrow you will be out of your fathers reach   mrs patt aside gracious me he is going to elope with her   tim how the old gentleman vill storm   char you know as people grow in years their sentiments of love affairs naturally change   tim ecod though  that is not the case with old mistress   mrs patt old mistress indeed   tim by all accounts she is just as loving now as she was thirty years ago   mrs patt aside his ears shall pay for this   tim if the old girl was to hear me now  what would she say to it ha ha ha  well miss i will take my leave of you till twelve oclock i am just a going to make merry with a few friends for an hour or two  i will take care that you

years have taught us how to remedy the defect they treat our improvement with contempt  exit end of the first act act ii scene a room in mrs pattypans house with two windows in the back scene enter
