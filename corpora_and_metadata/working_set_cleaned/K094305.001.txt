pauls book i chap i of old st pauls it will be proper first to inform my young readers that upon the same spot of ground on which st pauls now stands there was formerly a fine old church built by ethelbert king of kent in the year of our lord six hundred and ten and dedicated to the same apostle this church suffered many times by lightning fire and other accidents which was as often repaired and such parts of it as fell to decay through age were rebuilt till at last it was destroys in the great fire of london in      and one thousand and fiftysix years from its first building  chap ii of the foundation building and situation of the present church the old church of st pauls having been destroyed as mentioned in the first chapter and the ruins and rubbish of it cleared in about eight or nine years after the first foundation stone of this present church was laid by mr strong a mason and the second by mr long land on the twenty first of june      at the northeast corner facing cheapside from which time it was not completely finished till the year      being about fortynine years in building it was begun and finished by the same architect sir christopher wren and by the same mason mr strong abovementioned the charge of which is said to amount to one million of money or upwards the whole building is encompassed with strong iron palisades all curiously turned about five and twenty hundred in number which cost fifteen thousand pounds  this magnisicent structure which stands upon the highest ground in the city near to the west gate called ludgate is the first cathedral in england built according to the rules of architecture its walls are of fine portland stone rustic work two ranges of pilasters adorn the outside one above the other the lower consists of about an hundred and twenty with their entablatues of the corinthian order and the upper of as many of the composite or roman order besides twenty columns at the west and four at the east end and those of the porticos etc  the spaces between the arches of the windows and the architrave of the lower order are filled with great variety of curious enrichments such as cherubims festoons of flowers etc and at the east end is the cipher of w r within a garter on which are the words honi soit qui maly pense in english evil be to him that evil thinks and this within a fine compartment of palmbranches and placed under an imperial crown etc all finely cut in stone  all the parts of this grand church both within and without are built with such proportion and art that the eye is charmed with the exact order of its pillars which support the porticos dome etc the beauty of their capitals the rich cornish wherewith they are embellished the number of spacious windows etc in short the whole fabric is full of beauty and harmony and in bigness strengh of building figure and other enrichments in wood stone iron etc equal if not superior to any church in europe  chap iii of the length breadth height and other dimensions of st pauls church its lenght within the wall from east to west is five hundred feet  the breadth of the west end is a hundred and sixty two feet  the breadth between the north and south porticos or doors within the walls is two hundred and forty nine feet  the breadth of the rest is about a hundred and seventeen feet  the circuit of the walls outwardly is two thousand two hundred and ninety two feet  the ground plot that this great church stands upon is two acres sixteen perches twenty three yards and one foot  its height within over the middle isle is eightyeight feet  to the top of the west pediment under the figure of st paul a hundred and twenty feet  the height of the two towers at the west front two hundred and eight feet  to the gallery of the cupolo two hundred and eight feet  to the upper gallery two hundred and seventy six feet and from thence to the top of the cross sixty four feet  the height of the cross from the ball is ten feet the diameter of the ball is six feet its circumference eighteen feet and it will contain ninety bushels and i have been told that since it has been up sixteen men have been drinking in it at one time i suppose to the good health of all their friends round about st pauls  four indian kings   chap iv of the strange conceptions four indian kings had of this great building and how they imagined it at first to be one grent rock that grew in that place sa ga yean qua rash tow one of the four indian kings who were in this country about thirtytwo years ago amongst other curious remarks which he made whilst he was in england left behind him the following concerning st pauls church  there stands says he on the most rising part of the town a huge house big enough to contain the whole nation of which i am king  our good brother e tow o koam king of the rivers is of opinion it was made by the hands of the great god to whom it is consecrated  meaning st paul  the kings of granajah and of the six nations believe that it was created with the earth and produced on the same day with the sun and moon  but says he for my own part and from the best information that i can get of this matter i am apt to think that this vast temple was fashioned into the shape it now bears by several tools and instruments of which they have a wonderful variety in this country  i imagine it was at first only an huge misshapen rock that grew upon the top of the hill which the natives of the country after having cut it into a kind of regular figure bored and hollowed with incredible pains and industry till they had wrought in it all those beautiful vaults and caverns into which it is divided at this day  as soon as this rock was thus curiously scooped to their liking then a prodigious number of hands must have been employed in chipping the outside of it and smoothing the surface which is in several places hewn out into pillars that stand like the trunks of so many trees bound about the top with garlands of leaves  it is probable says this indian monarch that when this great work was begun which must have been many hundred years ago there was some religion among this people for they give it the name of a temple and have a tradition that it was designed for men to pay their devotions in  and indeed there are several reasons which make us think that the natives of this country had formerly among them some sort of worship for they set apart every seventh day as sacred but upon my going into one of those holy houses on that day i could not observe any circumstance of devotion in their behavior there was indeed a man in black who mounted above the rest seemed to utter something with great vehemence but as for those underneath him instead of paying their worship to the deity of the place they were most of them bowing and curtefying to one another and a great number of them fall asleep  whether these were the real thoughts of those royal strangers i will not take upon me to answer but what wonder is it that such savage kings whose dwellings are in huts and thickets should form such wild notions of this prodigious structure when we ourselves who see it daily are filled with astonishment at the magnitude and grandeur of this glorious building and how such a work could be performed by mortal hands  we shall now proceed to examine the particular curiosities of this church  chap v of the fine statue of the late queen anne before the west front of this grand cathedral is a spacious yard in which upon a lofty pedestal stands the effigy of the late queen anne with four supporters representing those dominions in her title  queen anne   she has her crown upon her head the scepter in her right hand and the globe in her left her dress is very rich and the workmanship of it exceeding curious  on her right hand is britannia who appears with a very lovely and cheerful countenance she has a crown of laurel upon her head a spear in her right hand and her left reaching to the royal arms in the front of the pedestal  on her left hand is france she seems much dejected very thoughtful and in a languishing state her right hand rests upon a truncheon and her left holds a crown which lies down in her lap she is clothed with a very rich robe adorned with flower de lis and upon her head she has a warriors cap or helmet  behind the queen is ireland with her harp in her lap her looks are amiable and pleasant  the fourth is america in the habit of her country her body being almost naked she has upon her head a crown of curious feather a bow in her left hand and a quiver of arrows on her back she has the head of an european under her foot with an arrow sticking in it supposed to have been just shot from her bow there is likewise an allegator creeping from beneath her feet being an animal very common in some parts of america and which lives both on the land and in the water  the queens and all the other figures are of fine italian statuary marble the pedestal of veined marble  the former were all cut out of one solid rough block of marble which was taken by one of our english ships during the late war in its passage from leghorn to france and was designed for the effigy of lewis the fourteenth on horseback  the carver was the late ingenious mr francis bird  the foot of the pedestal is encircled with three marble steps and the whole encompassed with beautiful strong iron palisades  this royal statue on account of its grand supporters fines pedestal and curious workmanship is esteemed superior to all others in europe  chap vi of the west front of st pauls my young readers having satisfied their curiosities in examining the queens statue etc from thence they have a full view of this grand church whrer they may behold the beauty and majesty of the whole and the just symmetry of all its parts  observe first the twelve large pillars which support the portico each four feet thick and eight and forty in height of the corinthian order  second the eight ebove which support the pediment of the composite or roman order each three feet and a half thick and about thirty four feet in height  see in the large triangular pediment a lively representation of st pauls conversion in his journey to damascus carved in relievo by the ingenious hand of the late mr bird the history of which my young readers will see hereaster  over the pitch or too of this pediment is the figure of st paul wi  sword in his hand  his right hand is st peter with a cock and on his left st james  in the front of the two losty and beautiful towers are the four evangelists in the north st matthew with an angel and st mark with a lion in the south st luke with an ox and st john with an eagle  these two towers are each adorned with circular ranger of columns of the corinthian order with domes on the upper part and on the top of each a gilded pine apple  in the south tower is the famours large clock the bell of which weighs four ton and four hundred and four pounds and its sound may be heard at five or six miles distance the work of this clock is large and curious it is kept in excellent good order and generally nerally carries the hour of the day very exectly a skilful person being appointed to look after it for that purpose  observe likewife the fine carvings and other rich embellishments over the whole front of this noble structure  and lastly you ascend to the great door by twenty four spacious stone steps the first ten of which extend in width above forty yards each and the other fourteen full thirty six yards  the door case is white marble and over the entrance is cut in relievo the history of st paul preaching to the bereans it consists of a group of nine sigures besides that of st paul with books etc these bereans were a sort of people ingenous and mild and who spent great part of their time in reading the scriptures observing whether what paul taught was agreeable with what the scriptures say of the messiah and many of whom from his preaching cheerfully embraced the faith acts xvii     under the arch on the right hand in a panel is st pauls imprisonment and on the left hand in the panel his preaching to the athenians with some other scripture stories all neatly carved in stone by the same hand as the conversion  my young readers will find the history of st pauls imprisonment in the sixteenth chapter of the acts and his preaching to the athenians in the seventeenth chapter both beautifully related  chap vii of the north portico of st pauls the ascent to the north portico is by twelve circular steps of black marble the dome of the portico is supported and adorned with six very spacious columns of the corinthian order above the doorcase is a large urn with festoons etc over this is a large pediment where are the royal arms with the regalia supported by two angels with each a palmbranch in their hands under whose feet appear the figures of the lion and unicorn and over the pediment on the top of this north front are the effigies of five apostles carved in stone  chap viii of the south portico of st pauls you ascend to the south portico by twenty five steps the ground on this side of the church being lower than that on the norsh the portico is supported with six grand losty columns like those of the west an north fronts and is in most other respects like the latter  in the pediment over it is the figure of a phoenix with her wings expanded arising out of the flames which emblem signifies a new church arising out of the old one under which is the word resurgam that is i shall rise again  phoenix resurgam    on the top of the pediment is the effigy of st andrew and those of two other saints on each hand of him  these five figures with those on the north and west fronts represent the four evangelists and the rest of the apostles they bear in their hands the several instruments whereby they suffered death or such remarkable ensigns as allude to some important incident of their lives  these images are each about eleven feet high and their pedestals about four feet they were all carved by the late mr bird before mentioned and are reckoned to be well done  chap ix of what is remarkable in going up the cupola ar top of st pauls having examined what is most curious on the outside of st pauls i shall next endeavor to ascend the cupola and in my journey to the top of it take notice of what i meet with most worthy of my young readers attention  to go up st pauls you must enter a door at the south side which stands open all the day long for that purpose  after you have ascended a few steps you come to a door which will not open till each person pays twopence  the whole number of steps to the upper gallery is five hundred and thirty four of which the first two hundred and sixty are so exceeding easy that a child might go up them they being but about four or five inches deep  the other two hundred and seventy four steps are pretty steep and in many places from the large stone gallery to the upper gallery very dark so that one person can scarce discern another  in this place we have a glimmering sight of such prodigious works in iron stone and timber which hold together the dome cupola etc that it is impossible to convey an idea of it to my readers and though these amasing works are very curious to see yet my young masters and misses must not by any means venture themselves here without a guide  the iron gallery on the top of the cupola is the highest any one is suffered to go above that are the lantern ball and cross to the top of which from the gallery just mentioned is sixty four feet and the passage thither by ladders very difficult and dangerous to ascend  from this gallery in fine clear weather we may agreeably observe the vast extent of this great city and suburbs the great number of churches steeples public buildings and houses that present themselves which way soever we turn our eyes as also the ships in the river that look like a huge forest and the vessels boats etc spread allover the thames here likewise we have a delightful prospect of the country for many miles round about  chap x of the whisperinggallery and fine paintings within the cupola in your return from the top of st pauls you will be asked to see the whisperinggallery which will cost twopence each person  this gallery is a very great curiosity it is a large circle which runs round the bottom of the inside of the dome of about an hundred and forty three feet in diameter or cross the widest part it is railed in with iron of very fine workmanship gilt with gold the walls all around are painted and gilded with great beauty but the greatest curiosity of all is the whisperingplace where leaning your head against the wall you may easily hear all that is said though it be ever so low and at the most distant place from you in the gallery which affords great matter of surprise and innocent diversion to all young persons who come to amuse themselves with this curiosity  here you have the best view of the eight pieces of history on the inside of the dome painted by the late sir james thornhill with inimitable art and beauty  the first represents the conversion of st paul acts ix    the second elymas the sorcerer struck with blindness acts xiii    third the priest of jupiter offering sacrifice to paul and barnabas acts xiv     fourth the jailer converted acts xvi  0  fifth paul preaching at athens acts xvii    sixth the conjuring books burnt acts xix     seventh king agrippa almost persuaded to be a christian acts xxvi     eighth st pauls shipwreck on the island of melita acts xxviii    conversion of st paul   chap xi of the conversion of st paul st paul before his conversion having been principally concerned in the death of st stephen and his bloody mind not satisfied with this cruelty threatens nothing less than prisons and death to the christians wherever he found them and to qualify himself the better for the execution of this bloody purpose he goes to the high priest to enlarge his commission and having obtained power to seize all christians and send them bound to jerusalem to be tried he immediately sets out for damascus to put it in practice but whilst he was on the road entertaining himself with the bloody prospect god in mercy to him and those he went to persecute takes him off from his wicked design a bright shining cloud encompassed him which struck him with great terror as at the presence of god and threw him prostrate on the ground where as he lay he heard a voice out of it saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me this increased his amazement and being desirous to know the meaning of this vision he asks who art thou lord the voice replied i am jesus whom thou presecutest it is in vain for thee to resist the decrees of providence therefore be no longer disobedient but hearken to the commands that shall be given thee at this saul full of fear and trembling cried out lord instruct me what thou would have me to do the voice returned go to damascus and there thou shall know my will  those who attended paul on this journey were struck dumb with fear and amazement wondering that they should hear a voice but e no man speakings therefore taking up saul they led him to the city and by this miraculous vision he was converted to the christian says  this history is the subject of the first piece of painting  chap xii elymas the sorcerer struck blind paul and mark as they traveled through the sorcerer struck blind isle of cyprus came to the city of paphos where the temple of venus was at which place they met with elymas a noted forcerer who being intimate with sergius paulue the proconsul a prudent virtuous man and inclinable to receive the faith did all he could to divert him from the conversation of these two apostles but paul in an holy rage casting his eyes on elymas this expressed his abhorrence o thou vile sorcerer like the devil by whom thou workest thou art an enemy to all goodness will thou persist in sorcery in defiance of the faith of christ which comes armed with a much greater power of miracles than those to which thou falsely pretendest thou shall soon see the vengeane of heaven upon thee for thou that perversely hold out against the light of the gospel shall lose thy sight which by the immediate power of god shall be taken from thee for some time and immediately he was struck blind begging the aid of tome kind hand to lead him and the proconsul convinced by this miracle was converted to the christian faith  this is the subject of the second piece of painting  chap xiii the priest of jupiter offering sacrifice to paul and barnabas whilst those apostles were preaching at lystra a poor cripple lame from the hour of his birth being one of their paul and barnabas hearers was observed by st paul who said to him stand upright on thy feet and by the bare speaking of the word his feet were made so strong that he leaped and walked  when they saw it they concluded this miracle could not be done but by the immediate presence of the deity and therefore running about in great confusion they cried out that the gods had put on human shape and were come down among them  they looked on barnabas as jupiter the supreme god and paul as mercury the interpreter of the will of the gods because he spoke more than barnabas  but as soon as this miracle came to the ear of the priest of jupiter he came to paul and barnabas bringing oxen with garlands of flowers being such victims as they offered to the gods they worshipped intending to offer sacrifice to the apostles but they abhorring such idolatry rent their garments endeavoring by arguments drawn from some of the plainest instances of nature such as day night summer winter etc to convince them that worship was due only to that god who was the author of all those blessings yet this discourse so pressingly urged by the apostles could scarce restrain those poor idolaters from sacrificing to them  this is the history of the third piece of painting in the cupola  chap xiv the jailer converted it happened one day as st paul was going to the house of prayer there met him a young maid possessed with an evil spirit which spoke from her by which means telling strange things whether past or to come she had gained her masters much jailer converted money this maid paul cures by casting out the evil spirit when her masters saw that all hope of future gain from her divination was gone they apprehended paul and his companion and brought them before the magistrates complaining that these men occasioned great disturbance in the city upon which a tumult arising the magistrates ordered them to be scourged and committed to prison strictly charging the jailor to put them in irons and secure them in the strongest part of the prison where they spent their midnight hours in prayers and praises to god and whilst they thus enjoyed themselves the earth began to tremble the very foundation of the prison shook the prison doors flew open and every prisoners chains dropped from him the jailor waking with the fright and seeing the prisondoors open concluded that all the prisoners had made their escape and thinking with himself that this would be imputed to his neglect in despair drew his sword with design to kill himself which paul happily prevents telling him his prisoners were all secure then calling for a light e came into the presence of the two saints trembling and prostrating himself before them beseeches them to instruct him in the way of salvation  this is the history of the fourth piece of painting in the cupola of st pauls  the other paintings in the cupolo and numerous beauties in the church blow must all into my second
