a collection of poems  the second edition  vol i  a collection of poems in four volumes  by several hands    london printed for g perch no    cheapside mdcclxx  advertisement in an age like the present wherein literary merit of every kind so much abounds and is at the same time so much encouraged many poetical performances which deserve a longer remembrance than fugitive pieces usually meet with are daily thrown upon the public and left to perish in oblivion to select these from the trifling productions of the day has ever been considered as an useful employment and the favorable reception which mr dodsleys elegant collection of poems obtained from the public is sufficient to encourage any person who has the means in his power to continue that deservedly esteemed miscellany several attempts of this sort have been made but none have acquired so much reputation as to render the present undertaking useless or unnecessary twelve years are now elapsed since the last volumes of that work were published in which time it is not to be supposed that there has been so great a dearth of genius but that many pieces have made their appearance which are not inferior to the best preserved in that miscellany of the truth of this observation the editor appeals to the following collection which is compiled from the best productions published within that time which mr dodsley had not the opportunity of seeing with the addition of many other pieces which with all his diligence were overlooked by him with what degree of judgment this collection is made the editor submits to the determination of the public the greater part of the poetical pieces of the last thirty years have passed through his hands and as of them the following volumes are composed he hopes they will not be considered as in improper supplement to the work of which they are designed as a continuation he flatters himself that he has not suffered private friendship to obtrude any piece into this collection which is unworthy of the rest and great care has been taken to prevent the insertion of any performance which has not been approved by gentlemen of distinguished reputation but as he is sensible that the taste of persons is very different he expects not after all that every piece will meet with equal applause being convinced of the truth of mr dodsleys observation that it is impossible to furnish out an entertainment of this nature where every part shall be relished by every guest  argument abelard and eloisa flourished in the twelfth century they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion after a long course of calamities they retired each to a several convent and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion it was many years after this separation that a letter of abelard to a friend which contained the history of his misfortunes fell into the hands of eloisa this occasioned those celebrated letters out of which the following is partly extracted which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature virtue and passion  isaac tailor del et sculp    abelard to eloisa by mr cawthorne master of tunbridgeschool ah why this boding start this sudden pain that wings my pulse and shoots from vein to vein what mean regardless of yon midnight bell these earthborn visions saddening over my cell what strange disorder prompts these thoughts to glow these sighs to murmur and these tears to flow it is she it is eloisas form restored once a pure saint and more than saints adored she comes in all her killing charms confessed glares through the gloom and pours upon my breast bids heavens bright guard from paraclete remove and drags me back to misery and love enjoy thy triumphs dear illusion see this sad apostate from his god to thee see at thy call my guilty warmths return flame through my blood and steal me from my urn yet yet frail abelard one effort try ere the last lingering spark of virtue die the deadly charming sorceress control and spite of nature tear her from thy soul long has that soul in these unsocial woods where anguish muses and where horror broods from loves wild visionary wishes strayed and sought to lose thy beauties in the shade faith dropped a smile devotion lent her fire woke the keen pang and sanctified desire led me enraptured to the blessed abode and taught my heart to glow with all its god but oh how weak fair faith and virtue prove when eloisa melts away in love when her fond soul impassioned rapt unveiled no joy forgotten and no wish concealed flows through her pen as infant softness free and fiercely springs in ecstasies to me ye heavens as walking in yon sacred fane with every seraph warm in every vein just as remorse had roused an aching sigh and my torn soul hung trembling in my eye in that kind hour thy fatal letter came i saw i gazed i shivered at the name the conscious lamps at once forgot to shine prophetic tremors shook the hallowed shrine priests censors altars from thy genius fled and heaven itself shut on me while i read dear smiling mischief art thou still the same the still pale victim of too soft a flame warm as when first with more than mortal shine each melting eyeball mixed thy soul with mine have not thy tears for ever taught to flow the glooms of absence and the pangs of woe the pomp of sacrifice the whispered tale the dreadful vow yet hovering over thy veil drove this bewitching fondness from thy breast curbed the loose wish and formed each pulse to rest and can thou still still bend the suppliant knee to loves dread shrine and weep and sigh for me then take me take me lock me in thy arms spring to my lips and give me all thy charms no fly me fly me spread the impatient sail steal the larks wing and mount the swiftest gale skim the last ocean freeze beneath the pole renounce me curse me root me from thy soul fly fly for justice bares the arm of god and the grasped vengeance only waits his nod are these my wishes can they thus aspire does phrenzy form them or does grace inspire can abelard in hurricanes of zeal betray his heart and teach thee not to feel teach thy enamored spirit to disown each human warmth and chill thee into stone ah rather let my tenderest accents move the last wild tumults of unholy love on that dear bosom trembling let me lie pour out my soul and in fierce raptures die rouse all my passions act my joys anew farewell ye cells ye martyred saints adieu sleep conscience sleep each awful thought be drowned and sevenfold darkness veil the scene around what means this pause this agonizing start this glimpse of heaven quickrushing through my heart methinks i see a radiant cross displayed a wounded savior bl eds along the shade around

every wish betrayed and left my laurels withering in the shade let me forget that while deceitful fame grasped her shrill trump and filled it with my name thy stronger charms empowered by heaven to move each saint each blessed insensible to love at once my soul from bright ambition won i hugged the dart i wished to be undone no more pale science durst my thoughts engage insipid dullness hung on every page the midnight lamp no more enjoyed its blaze no more my spirit flew from maze to maze thy glances bade philosophy resign her throne to thee and every sense was thine but what could all the frosts of wisdom do opposed to beauty when it melts in you since these dark cheerless solitary caves deathbreathing woods and dailyopening graves misshapen rocks wild images of woe for ever howling to the deeps below ungenial deserts where no vernal shower wakes the green herb or paints the unfolding flower the imbrowning glooms these holy mansions shed the nightborn horrors brooding over my bed

the aids of art to blot thy dear idea from my heart delusive sightless god of warm desire why would thou wish to set a wretch on fire why lives thy soft divinity where woe heaves the pale sigh and

may thou see low prostrate at thy throne devoted slaves and victims all thy own each villageswain the turfbuilt shrine shall raise and kings command whole hecatombs to blaze o memory ingenious to revive each fleeting hour and teach the past to live witness what conflicts this frail bosom tore what griefs i suffered and what pangs i bore how long i struggled labored strove to save an heart that panted to be still a slave when youth warmth rapture spirit love and flame seized every sense and burnt through all my frame from youth warmth rapture to these wilds i fled my food the herbage and the rock my bed there while these venerable cloisters rise over the bleak surge and gain upon the skies my wounded soul indulged the tear to flow over all her sad vicissitudes of woe profuse of life and yet afraid to die guilt in my heart and horror in my eye with ceaseless prayers the whole artillery given to win the mercies of offended heaven each hill made vocal echoed all around while my torn breast knocked bleeding on the ground yet yet alas though all my moments fly stained by a tear and darkened in a sigh though meagre fasts have on my cheek displayed the dusk of death and sunk me to a shade spite of myself the stillimpoisoning dart shoots through my blood and drinks up all my heart my vows and wishes wildly disagree and grace itself mistakes my god for thee athwart the glooms that wrap the midnight sky my eloisa steals upon my eye for ever rises in the solar ray a phantom brighter than the blaze of day wherever i go the visionary guest pants on my lip or sinks upon my breast unfolds her sweets and throbbing to destroy winds round my heart in luxury of joy while loud hosannas shake the shrines around i hear her softer accents in the sound her idolbeauties on each altar glare and heaven muchinjurd has but half my prayer no tears can drive her hence no pangs control for every object brings her to my soul last night reclining on yon airy steep my busy eyes hung brooding over the deep the breathless whirlwinds slept in every cave and the soft moonbeam danced from wave to wave each former bliss in this bright mirror seen with all my glories dawned upon the scene recalled the dear auspicious hour anew when my fond soul to eloisa flew when with keen speechless ecstasies oppressed thy frantic lover snatched thee to his breast gazed on thy blushes armed with every grace and saw the goddess beaming in thy face saw thy wild trembling ardent wishes move each pulse to rapture and each glance to love but lo the winds descend the billows roar foam to the clouds and burst upon the shore vast peals of thunder over the ocean roll the flamewingd lightning gleams from pole to pole at once the pleasing images withdrew and more than horrors crowded on my view thy uncles form in all his ire arrayed serenely dreadful stalked along the shade pierced by his sword i sunk upon the ground the spectre ghastly smiled upon the wound a group of black infernals round me hung and tossed my infamy from tongue to tongue detested wretch how impotent thy age how weakthy malice and how kind thy rage spite of thyself inhuman as thou art thy murdering hand has left me all my heart left me each tender fond affection warm a nerve to tremble and an eye to charm no cruel cruel exquisite in ill thou thought it dull barbarity to kill my death had robbed lost vengeance of her toil and scarcely warmed a scythian to a smile sublimer furies taught thy soul to glow with all their savage mysteries of woe taught thy unfeeling poniard to destroy the powers of nature and the source of joy to stretch me on the racks of vain desire each passion throbbing and each wish on fire mad to enjoy unable to be blessed fiends in my veins and hell within my breast aid me fair

voluptuous love and leave no anguish there oblivion be thy blackest plume displayed over all my griefs and hide me in the shade and thou too fondly idolized attend while awful reason whispers in the friend friend did i say immortals what a name can dull cold friendship own so wild a flame no let thy lover whose enkindling eye shot all his soul between thee and the sky whose warmths bewitched thee whose unhallowed song called thy rapt ear to die upon his tongue now strongly rouse while heaven his zeal inspires diviner transports and more holy fires calm all thy passions all thy peace restore and teach that snowy breast to heave no more torn from the world within dark cells immured by angels guarded and by vows secured to all that once awoke thy fondness dead and hope pale sorrows last sad refuge fled why will thou weep and sigh and melt in vain brood over false joys and hug thideal chain say can thou wish that madly wild to fly from yon bright portal opening in the sky thy abelard should bid his god adieu pant at thy feet and taste thy charms anew ye heavens if to this tender bosom wooed thy mere idea harrows up my blood if one faint glimpse of eloise can move the fiercest wildest agonies of love what shall i be when dazzling as the light thy whole effulgence flows upon my sight look on thyself consider who thou art and learn to be an abbess in thy heart see while devotions evermelting strain pours the loud organ through the trembling fane yon pious maids each earthly wish disown kiss the dread cross and crowd upon the throne o let thy soul the sacred charge attend their warmths inspirit and their virtues mend teach every breast from every hymn to steal the seraphs meekness and the seraphs zeal to rise to rapture to dissolve away in dreams of heaven and lead thyself the way till all the glories of the blessed abode blaze on the scene and every thought is god while thus thy exemplary cares prevail and make each vestal spotless as her veil the eternal spirit over thy cell shall move in the soft image of the mystic dove the longlost gleams of heavenly comfort bring peace in his smile and healing on his wing at once remove affliction from thy breast melt over thy soul and hush her pangs to rest o that my soul from loves cursed bondage free could catch the transports that i urge to thee o that some angels more than magic art would kindly tear the hermit from his heart extinguish every guilty sense and leave no pulse to riot and no sigh to heave vain fruitless wish still still the vigorous flame bursts like an earthquake through my shattered frame spite of the joys that truth and virtue prove i feel but thee and breathe not but to love repent in vain scarce wish to be forgiven thy form my idol and thy charms my heaven yet yet my fair thy nobler efforts try lift me from earth and give me to the sky let my lost soul thy brighter virtues feel warmed with thy hopes and winged with all thy zeal and when low bending at the hallowed shrine thy contrite heart shall abelard resign when pitying heaven impatient to forgive unbars the gates of light and bids thee live seize on thauspicious moment ere it flee and ask the same immortal boon for me then when these black terrific scenes are over and rebel nature chills the soul no more when on thy cheek the expiring roses fade and thy last lustres darken in the shade when armed with quick varieties of pain or creeping dully slow from vein to vein pale death shall set my kindred spirit free and these dead orbs forget to dote on thee some pious friend whose wild affections glow like ours

would we trace with reasons erring clue the darksome paths of destiny aright in vain the task were easier to pursue the trackless wheelings of the swallows flight from mortal ken himself the almighty shrouds paviliond in thick night and circumambient clouds a descriptive poem addressed to two ladies miss lowthers daughters of the late lord lonsdale  at their return from viewing the mines near whitehaven by dr dalton welcome to light adventurous pair thrice welcome to the balmy air from sulfurous damps in caverns deep from sulfurous damps etc the coal mines near whitehaven are greatly infested with fulminating damps large quantities of them being frequently collected in those deserted works which are not ventilated with perpetual currents of fresh air and in such works they often remain for a long time without doing any mischief but when by some accident they are set on fire they then produce dreadful explosions very destructive to the miners and bursting out of the pits with great impetuosity like the fiery eruptions from burning mountains force along with them ponderous bodies to a great height in the air  where subterranean thunders sleep or waked with dire aetnaean sound bellow the trembling mountain round till to the srighted realms of day through flaming mouths they force their way from bursting streams from bursting streams etc the coal in these mines has several times been set on fire by the fulminating damp and has continued burning for many months until large streams of water were conducted into the mines and suffered to fill those parts where the coal was on fire by such fires several collieries have been entirely destroyed of which there are instances near newcastle and in other parts of england and in the shire of fife in scotland in some of which places the fire has continued burning for ages but more mines have been ruined by inundations  and burning rocks from natures fierce inteine shocks from the dark mansions of despair welcome once more to light and air but why explore that world of night concealed till then from female sight such grace and beauty why confine one moment to a dreary mine was it because your curious eye the secrets of the earth would spy how interveind rich minerals glow how bubbling fountains learn to flow or rather that the sons of day already owned your rightful sway and therefore like young ammon you another world would fain subdue what though sage prospero attend while you the cavernd hill descend though warned by him with bended head you shun the shelving roof and tread with cautious foot the rugged way while tapers strive to mimic day though he with hundred gates and chains the demons of the mine restrains the demons of the mine restrains etc in order to prevent as much as possible the collieries from being filled with those pernicious damps it has been found necessary carefully to search for those crevises in the coal from whence they issue out and at those places to confine them within a narrow space and from those narrow spaces in which they are confined to conduct them through long pipes into the open air where being set on fire they consume in perpetual flames as they continually arise out of the earth  to whom their parent jealous earth to guard her hidden stores gave birth at which while kindred furies sung with hideous joy pale orcus rung though boiling with vain rage they sit fixed to the bottom of the pit while at his beck the spirits of air with breath of heaven their taints repair or if they seek superior skies through ways assigned by him they rise troop after troop at day expire in torments of perpetual fire though he with furyquelling charms the whole infernal host disarms and summons and summons etc those who have the direction of these deep and extensive works are obliged to use great care and art in keeping them continually ventilated with perpetual currents of fresh air which afford the miners a constant supply of that vital fluid and expel out of the mines damps and other noxious exhalations together with such other burnt and foul air as is become poisonous and unfit for respiration to your guarded sides a squadron of etherial guides you still when we together view the dreadful enterprise and you the public care and wonder go of all above and all below for at your presence toil is over the restless miner works no more nor strikes the flint nor strikes the flint etc it having been observed by mr spedding who superintends these collieries and to whom the author here gives the name of prospero that the fulminating damp could only be kindled by flame and that it was not liable to be set on fire by redhot iron nor by the sparks produced by the collision of flint and steel he invented a machine in which while a steel wheel is turned round with a very rapid motion and flints are applied thereto great plenty of fiery sparks are emitted that afford the miners such a light as enables them to carry on their work in close places where the flame of a candle or lamp would occasion dreadful explosions without some invention of this sort the working of these mines so greatly annoyed with these inflammable damps would long ago have been impracticable  nor whirls the steel of that strange sparkemitting wheel which formed by prosperos magic care plays harmless in the sulphurous air without a flame diffuses light and makes the grisly cavern bright his task secure the miner plies nor hears tartarian tempests rise but quits it now and hastes away to this great stygian holiday agape the sooty collier stands his axe suspended in his hands his ethiopian teeth the while  grin horribly a ghastly smile to see two goddesses so fair descend to him from fields of air not greater wonder seized the abode of gloomy dis infernal god with pity when the orphean lyre did every iron heart inspire soothed tortured ghosts with heavenly strains and respited eternal pains but on you move but on you move etc the reader may suppose that he has entered these mines by the opening at the bottom of a hill and has already passed through a long adit hewn in the rock and arched over with brick which is the principal road into them for men and for horses and which by a steep descent leads down to the lowest vein of coal being arrived at the coal he may suppose himself still to descend by ways less steep till after a journey of a mile and a half he arrives at the profoundest parts of the mine the greatest part of this descent is through spacious galleries which continually intersect other galleries all the coal being cut away except large pillars which in deep parts of the mine are three yards high and about twelve yards square at the base such great strength being there required to support the ponderous roof through ways less steep to loftier chambers of the deep whose jetty pillars seem to groan beneath a ponderous roof of stone then with increasing wonder gaze the dark inextricable maze where cavern crossing cavern meets city of subterraneous streets where in a triple a triple story etc there are here three strata of coal which lie at a considerable distance one above another the mines wrought in these parallel strata have a communication by pits and are compared by the author to the different stories of a building story end mines that over mines by flights ascend but who in order can relate what terror still your steps await how issuing from the sulphurous coal thick acherontic rivers thick acherontic rivers etc the water that flows from the coal is collected into one stream which runs toward the fireengines this water is yellow and turbid from a mixture of ocher and so very corrosive that it quickly consumes iron roll how in close center of these mines where orient morning never shines nor the winged zephyrs ever resort infernal darkness holds her court how breathless with faint pace and slow how breathless with faint pace and slow etc those who descend into these mines find them most close and sultry in the middle parts that are most remote from the pits and adits and perceive them to grow cooler the nearer they approach to those pits which are sunk to the deepest parts of the mines down which pits large streams of fresh air are made to descend and up which the water is drawn out by means of fireengines  through her grim sultry realm you go till purer rising gales dispense their cordials to the sickening sense your progress next the wondering muse through narrow galleries pursues where earth where earth etc the vein of coal is not always regularly continued in the same inclined plane but instead thereof the miners frequently meet with hard rock which interrupts their further progress at such places there seem to have been breaks in the earth from the surface downwards one part of the earth seeming to have sunk down while the part adjoining has remained in its ancient situation in some of these places the earth may have sunk ten or twenty fathoms or more in other places less than one fathom these breaks the miners call dykes and when they come at one of them their first care is to discover whether the starta in the part adjoining be higher or lower than in the part where they have been working or to use their own terms whether the coal be cast down or cast up if it be cast down they sink a pit to it but if it be cast up to any considerable height they are oftentimes obliged with great labor and expense as at the place here described to carry forwards a level or long gallery through the rock until they again arrive at the stratum of coal  the miners way to close did once the massy rock oppose in vain his daring axe he heaves toward the black vein a passage cleaves disseverd by the nitrous blast the stubborn barrier bursts at last thus urged by hungers clamorous call incessant labor conquers all in spacious rooms once more you tread whose roofs whose roofs etc these colors with which the freestone roof of the mines is beautifully variegated in many places and which have the appearance of clouds seem to proceed from exsudations of salts other and other earthy substances with figures quaint overspread wild nature paints with various dies with such as tinge the evening skies a different scene to this succeeds the dreary road abruptly leads down to the cold and humid caves where hissing fall the turbid waves resounding deep through glimmering shades the clank of chains your ears invades through pits profound from distant day scarce travels down lights languid ray high on huge axis heaved above see balanced beams unwearied move while pent within the iron womb while pent within the iron womb etc the author has here taken occasion to celebrate the fireengine the invention of which does such honor to this nation he has endeavored to describe in a poetic manner the effects of the elastic steam and the great power of the atmosphere which by their alternate actions give force and motion to the beam of this engine and by it to the pumprods which elevate the water through tubes and discharge it out of the mine it appears from pretty exact calculations that it would require about   0 men or a power equal

now spread into a crystal plain then hid by pendent rocks would steal but tuneful falls his course reveal as down the bending vale he roves through yanwath woods and buckholmes groves whose broad oerspreading boughs beneath warbling he flows while zephyrs breathe here softly swells the spacious lawn where bounds the buck and skips the fawn or couched beneath the hawthorntrees in dappled groups enjoy the breeze amid yon sunny plain alone to patriarchal reverence grown an oak for many an age has stood himself a widely waving wood while men and herds with swift decay race after race have passed away see still his central trunk sustain huge boughs which round oerhang the plain and hospitable shade enclose where flocks and herds at ease repose there the brown fells ascend the sky below the green enclosures lie along their sloping sides supine the peaceful villages recline on azure roofs on azure roofs etc the houses of this country are covered with a beautiful blue slate bright

his awful frown and grateful that his goodness own if grown familiar to the sight lowther itself should less delight then change the scene to natures pride sweet sweet keswicks vale etc this delightful vale is thus elegantly described by the late ingenious dr brown in a letter to a friend in my way to the north from hagley i passed through dovedale and to say the truth was disappointed in it when i came to buxton i visited another or two of their romantic scenes but these are inferior to dovedale they are all but poor miniatures of keswick which exceeds them more in grandeur than i can give you to imagine and more if possible in beauty than in grandeur instead of the narrow slip of valley which is seen at dovedale you have at keswick a vast amphitheatre in circumference above twenty miles instead of a meagre rivulet a noble living lake ten miles round of an oblong form adorned with a variety of wooded islands the rocks indeed of dovedale are finely wild pointed and irregular but the hilis are both little and unanimated and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds morass and brushwood but at keswick you will on one side of the lake see a rich and beautiful landscape of cultivated fields rising to the eye in fine inequalities with noble groves of oak happily dispersed and climbing the adjacent hills shade above shade in the most various and picturesque forms on the opposite shore you will find rocks and cliffs of stupendous height hanging broken over the like in horrible grandeur some of them a thousand feet high the woods climbing up their steep and shaggy sides where mortal foot never yet approached on these dreadful heights the eagles build their nests a variety of waterfalls are seen pouring from their summits and tumbling in vast sheets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnificence while on all sides of this immense amphitheatre the lofty mountains rise round piercing the clouds in shapes as spiry and fantastic as the very rocks of dovedale to this i must add the frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake forming noble bays and promontories in other parts they finely retire from it and often open in abrupt chasms or clefts through which at hand you see rich and uncultivated vales and beyond these at various distance mountain rising over mountain among which new prospects present themselves in mist till the eye is lost in an agreeable perplexity  where active fancy travels beyond sense and pictures things unseen  were i to analyze the two places into their constituent principles i should tell you that the full perfection of keswick consists of three circumstances beauty horror and immensity united the second of which alone is found in dovedale of beauty it has little nature having left it almost a desert neither its small extent nor the diminutive and lifeless form of the hills admit magnificence but to give you a complete idea of these three perfections as they are joined in keswick would require the united powers of claude salvator and poussin the first should throw his delicate sunshine over the cultivated vales the scattered cots the groves the lake and wooded islands the second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs the steeps the hanging woods and foaming waterfalls while the grand pencil of poussin should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountains  so much for what i would call the permanent beauties of this astonishing seen were i not afraid of being tiresome i could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties i would sail round the lake anchor in every bay and land you on every promontory and island i would point out the perpetual change of prospect the woods rocks cliffs and mountains by turns vanishing or rising into view now gaining on the sight hanging over our heads in their full dimensions beautifully dreadful and now by a change of situation assuming new romantic shapes retiring and lessening on the eye and insensibly losing themselves in an azure mist i would remark the contrast of light and shade produced by the morning and evening sun the one gilding the western the other the eastern side of this immense amphitheatre while the vast shadow projected by the mountains buries the opposite part in a deep and purple gloom which the eye can hardly penetrate the natural variety of coloring which the several objects produce is no less wonderful and pleasing the ruling tincts in the valley being those of azure green and gold yet ever various arising from an intermixture of the lake the woods the grass and cornfieldsd these are finely contrasted by the gray rocks and cliffs and the whole heightened by the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains sometimes a serene air and clear sky disclose the tops of the highest hills at others you see the clouds involving their summits resting on their sides or descending to their base and rolling among the valleys as in a vast furnace when the winds are high they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder then too the clouds are seen in vast bodies sweeping along the hills in gloomy greatness while the lake joins the tumult and tosses like a sea but in calm weather the whole scene becomes new the lake is a perfect mirror and the landscape in all its beauty islands fields woods rocks and mountains are seen inverted and floating on its surface i will now carry you to the top of a cliff where if you dare approach the ridge a new scene of astonishment presents itself where the valley lake and islands seem lying at your feet where this expanse of water appears diminished to a little pool amidst the vast and immeasurable objects that surround it for here the summits of more distant hills appear beyond those you have already seen and ising behind each other in successive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken steeps form an immense and awful picture which can only be expressed by the image of a tempestuous sea of mountains let me now conduct you down again to the valley and conclude with one circumstance more which is that a walk by still moonlight at which time the distant waterfalls are heard in all their variety of sound among these enchanting dales open such scenes of delicate beauty repose and solemnity as exceed all description     keswicks vale the muse will guide the muse who trod thinchanted ground who sailed the wondrous lake around with you will haste once more to hail the beauteous brook of borrodale from savage parent gentle stream be thou the muses

away from such a rude unequal fray through thine own native dale where rise tremendous rocks amid the skies thy waves with patience slowly wind till they the smoothest channel find soften the horrors of the scene and through confusion flow serene horrors like these at first alarm but soon with savage grandeur charm and raise to noblest thoughts your mind thus by thy fall lodore reclined the cragged cliff impendent wood whose shadows mix over half the flood the gloomy clouds which solemn sail scarce lifted by the languid gale over the cappd hill and darkened vale the ravening kite and bird of jove which round the aereal ocean rove and floating on the billowy sky with full expanded pennons fly their fluttering or their bleating prey thence with deathdooming eye survey channels by

philosophic social sense surveyed the noonday sky in brighter colors shone and softer over the dewy landscape played the peaceful radiance of the silent moon those hours are vanished with the changing year and dark december clouds the summer scene perhaps alas for ever vanished here no more to bless distinguished life again yet not like those by thoughtless folly drowned in blank oblivions sullen stagnant deep where never more to pass their fated bound the ruins of neglected being sleep but lasting traces mark the happier hours which active zeal in lifes great task employs which science from

less by friendship than by genius fired then let her happier more persuasive art explain the agreeing dictates of my heart sweet may her fame to late remembrance bloom and everlasting laurels shade her tomb whose spotless verse with genuine force expressed the brightest passion of the human breast in what blessed clime beneath what favoring skies did thy fair form propitious friendship rise with mystic sense the poets tuneful tongue there were two venuses among the ancients one called pandemus to whom they attributed the love of wild disorderly pleasures the other named urania the patroness and inspirer of friendship knowledge and virtue uranias birth in glittering fiction sung that paphos first her smiling presence owned which wide diffused its happy influence round with hands united

let thy genius aid my lays unpracticed pour into my verse the flow harmonious while the enchanted muse relates the charms which over the yielding heart perpetual reign and hold resistless sway diffusive nature who with liberal hand scatters her bounties round and decks the spring in all its gay attire the virgins cheek flushes with beauty and adorns her brow with charms attractive shapes her faultless form with skill unerring on her breast bestows the snowy hue while over her shining neck in wanton ringlets flows her ebon hair dishevelled graceful and her sparkling eyes dart kindling flame majestic on she moves conscious of native worth and smiling love alluring hither ye whose hardened hearts never felt a lovers pangs ah hither come to feel the force of beauty here survey in radiant luster the bewitching grace which from the dawn of time over nature held her soft domain since first the vital spark awaked the human breast and man arose to conscious being the fair female form dazzled his eye and through his panting breast shot beautys ray when in primaeval spring life uncorrupted rolled its golden hours free from the attacks of vice as yet unsourd with pain corroding nor disease had reared her snaky crest to blast their blooming days then beauty reigned and formed the sacred tie connubial often amid the green retreat where fanning zephrys played the joyous hour fled on the wings of love here innocence and balmy peace and friendship heavenborn power by beauty heightened over the human pair their choicest influence shed nor beauty less through long succeeding ages over the heart her conquest held devoted man attests the pleasing truth while at the siren voice of music thrilling the enchanting note he prostrate falls the fond distracted prey of passions raging through the enfeverd heart so nature wills and while increasing strength braces the nerves and through the swelling veins the blood fierceboiling flows subduing love still reigns in man to polish and refine his barbarous mind nor till the soothing flame has seized his heart and thawed his frozen soul ever can he relish the sublime delight of social transport nor consenting feel the sympathetic bliss nor taste the sweets of hallowed friendship nor affected hear the voice of woe as often she vents her moan in wailings loud the soft relenting heart kind pitys tear the allprofusive hand of charity the generous flow of soul these are not his who never yet has felt the pangs of love over whom the enchanting power of beauty never reigned whose sullen breast never glowed with transport and the anxious throbs which panting lovers know but all his soul is solitary gloom untaught to pour the friendly fervor and with heart enlarged to breathe the warm benevolence of love come ye who now your gayest moments pass and graceful flourish midst the shining throng whilst life flies joyous and your youthful years roll placid on before the radiant throne of beauty kneel whatever warms the breast with noble purpose what informs the heart to melt and moulds you into social man is beautys power from her poetic heat derives new fire and taught by her often paints the visionary scene and touches all the springs of passion hers each winning grace and comely gesture hers enfrozen age bending to earth beneath the weight of years with wrinkled front and venerable hair melts at her fair approach he feels warm blood run through his withered veins erect he lifts his hoary head and on his aged brow unusual gladness smiles while his cold heart warmed into fervor glows her kindling voice all rural nature hears and starts amazed to polished life thus when the rustic alluding to drydens beautiful fable of cymon and iphigenia swain saw sleeping beauty on the grassy bank reclined at ease and careless beaming round her charms attractive while upon her face played all the laughing loves surpised he gazed and felt a thousand transports shoot along his shivering nerves now his unfeeling heart unused to pant with soft emotion heaves he trembling viewed and all his soul was love and ye fair offspring of the bounteous hand of nature ye arrayed in all the charms of vernal youth flushed on your comely cheek by beautys balmy breath while yielding man to you resigns his heart and eager sighs low at your feet and tells the moving tale of plaintive love how sleepless on his couch he counts the tedious hours or slumbering starts from flattering visions which delusive swim before his eyes how busy fancy paints your beauteous figure in resplendent robes luxuriant floating as you graceful move in all the airs of love and while he grasps the imagined form how lost in empty air the fair illusion flies how taste forgets the poignant relish and the spicy gale to him no odours wafts cheerless and sad he wanders pensive to the lonely shade to blend his moanings with the whispering breeze while sympathetic glides the weeping rill in many currents by and there to thought devotes the gloomy hour complaining often in tender strains how fair amanda scorns his melting heart how slights the mournful tale of fond despairing love nor here can long indulge his woe but restless with the crowd impatient mingles solace there to find amidst the tumult of a maddening world still haunts the phantom still his bosom burns with unremitted pain and love resumes his tyrant empire how his altered looks meagre and pale speak the distracting fiend which on his vitals preys how strength forsakes his quivering limbs how wrapped in awful gloom frail sickening nature pines away in woe  o gently then ye lovely conquerors use your unresisted sway forth stretch your arms to raise from abject plight the fainting slave and on his tortured soul propitious pour the balm of hope and now delighted taste loves fond delights while passion eager pants in every vein and warms your glowing breasts with fairy prospects of transporting joys nor gay amanda though with sighs to you the plaintive damon kneels and vents his soul in softly swelling strains yet let not these dilate your heart nor look with scornful air on the gay rivals who with you contest fair beautys prize and vie supreme to shine midst the soft circles where indulgent flow the soothing hours where music gently wakes symphonious every passion and attunes the soul to rapture while diffusive joy spreads through the melting throng for beauty still by taste is proved by her capricious law it blooms or withers you who long have held the willing strephon over the obdurate heart of damon never reigned while he subdued by bright amanda sighs his soul away in unavailing moan far from your breast be banished pride the high assuming air ill suits the brow where tenderness and love should dwell distinguished nor can reason judge whose charms superior shine some dazzling grace still nameless flashes on the admiring eye beyond description fairer than her sex to me dorinda seems how darts her eye its souldissolving fires how over neck gracefully careless falls her auburn hair her mien how soft can the pure mountain snow with her warm bosom rising to the throbs of undissembled love compare its white the rose its red with hers nor strephon less adores his blooming bride she fairer she is beautys self and as she gently moves her limbs proportioned with unerring skill a thousand radiant graces in her train alluring dance each nameless charm is hers and love and joy and virtue sit enthroned in every look and smile not varied more the human face with different features stamped by natures forming hand than taste which views in objects different various beauties glow o while ye glory in your youthful prime and yield attention to the siren voice of praise in that soft season when the breast a strange enchantment feels when pleasure pants in every vein and sparkles in the eye superfluous health then guard your rebel hearts against seducing love suspend ye fair these softer cares and listen while the muse rises superior to the fading glare of mortal charms and now essays to touch the heart and open to the enraptured soul more lasting beauty moral and divine which grows in age nor at the pale approach of death decays but with unblasted grace for ever blossoms hail bright virtue hail propitious come inspire my glowing breast to sing of thee without thee what are all

cherubs when they strike their golden harps in sacred concert while the sky resounds symphonious hence ye fond delusive dreams of fleeting pleasure she the heart distends with more enduring bliss kindled by her the generous bosom breathes the social sire and beats responsive to the woes of man now native peace and harmony divine dwell in the soul to reasons powerful law each passion yields and her resistless sway struggling corruption owns nor dares assault a heart confirmed by her and now the fame of nature conquered by the informing voice of reason through celestial mansions flies on wings angelic through the winding paths of life fair prudence guides and points the road to happiness and peace while in the breast untainted innocence and freedom reign these are the charms of virtue these will bloom when time shall cease even beautys self by these more lovely seems she looks with added grace and smiles seraphic nor shall hoary age their blossoms wither but perpetual spring here shed her influence while a showy world its varnish losing shall deceive no more and nature sickening at approaching fate shall sink beneath its doom whatever adorns the female breast whatever can move the soul with fervent rapture every winning grace and mild endearment tenderness and love in fair aspasia  character in mr johnsons irene shine it is hers to charm with elocution sweet and all the flow of soft persuasion while the sensual heart refines and feels fair virtue dawning there nor ye gay glittering tribe who ofttimes drink of circes poisoned cup and down the stream of soothing pleasure all resistless flow enervate deem unworthy of your wish the charms of virtue while ye restless seek the phantom pleasure where indulgence plays her midnight gambols over unstable paths ye heedless wander as she points the way through her enchanting maze the illusive form conceals destruction while with eager hope and mad impatience in a fond embrace  her panting lo the sorceress darts

hours in sweet improvement pass and still return auspicious for with thee the beating heart feels fond emotion and the soul dissolves in speechless transport of increasing joy ye lovely fair while flowery chaplets bind your youthful brows and over the verdant paths of gently gliding life ye graceful sweep arrayed in purple pride as on your breast the diamond shines and in your floating train the ruby glows and emeralds around beset the flying robe while dazzling thus in orient pomp forgive if yet the muse in moralizing strains essays to draw the evening veil over all the glittering show vain is their blaze which like the noontide day dazzles the eye so flaunt the gaudy flowers in vernal glory wide diffusing round their odoriferous sweets and shoot profuse their blossoms forth and flourish in their may in natures livery clad but when the sun beams in his pride they droop their blushing heads their blossoms wither and their varied tints fade with his sultry rays behold ye fair your gay delusions read in natures book their transitory life how quickly fleets the dream of pleasure at the pale approach of death grim blasting all your pictured hopes so fell amynta in her bloom of days joy flushed her brow and expectation swelled her beating bosom love its tribute paid to her bewitching charms about to taste connubial transports and in damons arms to share the licensed bliss while virtues self beheld complacent the indulging pair elated thus the fair amynta felt the pangs of love her wishes winged their flight to future periods in idea all lifes softest blessings revelld in her heart often did the lovers court the lonely shade reclusely happy there to mingle sighs in natures warmth thrown on the flowery lap of the fresh earth where roses blush around they breathed their mutual vows and tasted all the endearing sweets of uncorrupted love dear hapless fair amidst her warmest hopes when fancy figured all the tender scene of mutual rapture she devoted fell the mournful victim of the conquering hand of unrelenting death he dread approached and nature trembled at his ghastly mien her damon now in moving strains laments and sadly pensive to her sacred tomb he often repairs there drops a lovers tear while fond remembrance opens all the scene of past delight calls forth his beauteous bride in visionary bloom once more to blaze in allattractive charms till lost again the phantom glides in air all nature wears to him a face of woe the valleys round reecho doleful to his moving moan so beauty fades so fleets its showy life as droops the lily clad in all its pride of rich array yet while the pensive muse touches the springs of grief may no dark gloom overwhelm your souls for innocence survives to bloom eternal and while life invites to view its gayer scenes amidst the pomp of radiant courts still cheerful move along its flowery walks and lead with jovial heart the laughing moments on for beauty shines first in the gaudy circles and commands fond admiration as britannias sons excel in every virtue manly brave amidst the alarms of fate generous sincere by glory kindled may her virgins too supremely fair midst beautys brightest blaze in soft perfections shine may hymen wave his purple wings and over the sacred couch his azure mantle spread as down ye sink in wedlocks chaste embrace and often renew the hallowed rapture thus may peaceful life flow undisturbed nor jarring feud invade your happy hours and ye gay circles now forgive the muse which daring thus has sung of beautys triumphs though unequal far to the delightful theme yet beauty charmed my soul and poured into my glowing breast her fascination led me through the maze of love nor unambitious of applause she courts your smiles yours is her pleasing song to you she warbles and devoted pays her fond oblation to your radiant charms but chief indulgent midst the shining throng will fair dorinda smile she first inspired my heart with love to her my early muse her infant raptures poured happy if now sweet flow my numbers on her judging ear and steal persuasive to her virgin breast il pacifico written on the conclusion of the peace of aixlachapelle mdccxlviii by

in fire precipitate retire while mad bellona cracks her snaky thong and hurries headlong on to achrons brink and phlegethons flaming flood but hail fair peace so mild and meek with polished brow and rosy cheek that on thy fleecewhite cloud descending hither softeyd queen art tending gently over thy favorite land to wave thy genial myrtle wand to shake from off thy turtle wing the ambrosial dews of endless spring spring like that which poets feign gilded saturns easy reign for saturns first born daughter thou unless as later bards avow the youthful god with spangled hair closely clasped harmonia fair for banished erst heavens starpavd floor as sings my legendary lore as phoebus fat by weeping brook with shepherds scrip and shepherds crook pensive midst a savage train for savage then was all the plain fair harmonia left her bower to join her radiant paramour hence did thou spring and at thy birth lenient zephyrs fanned the earth rumbling thunders growld no more prowling wolves forgot to roar and man from fiercer rage possessed smiled dissension from his breast she comes she comes ye nymphs prepare gay floral wreaths to bind your hair ye swains inspire the mellow flute to dulcet strains which aptly suit the featlyfooted saraband of phillis trim and marian bland when nimbly light each simpering lass trips it over the pliant grass but see her social smiling train now invests the inrapturd plain plentys treasure teeming horn showers its fruits its flowers its corn commerce spreads his amplest sail strongnervd labor lift his flail sylvanus too attends it is he that bears the rootpluckd cypress tree he shall my youngling footsteps lead through tufted lawn and fringed mead by scooped valley heaped hill level river dancing rill where the shepherds all appear to shear and wash their fleecy care which bleating stand the streams around and whiten all the closecropt ground or when the maids in bonnets sheen cock the hay upon the green or up yon steep rough road the swains drive slow along their rolling wains where laughing ceres crowns the stack and makes the ponderous axle crack then to the village on the hill the barns capacious jaws to fill where the answering flails rebound beating bold with thundering sound enchanted with this rural scene here let me weave my arbrets green here arch the woodbine mantling neat over my noontide cool retreat or bind the oak with ivytwine or wed the elm and purpling vine but if my vagrant fancy pants for charms which simple nature wants grant power beningn admittance free to some ranged academy there to give to arts refined all the impulse of my mind and often observant take my stand where the painters magic hand from sketches rude with gradual art calls dawning life to every part till with nice tints all labored high each starting hero meets the eye often too o let me nice inspect the draughts of justest architect and hence delighted let me pass where others mould the ductile brass or teach the parian stone to wear a lettered sages musing air but ah these arts have fixed their home in roman or in gallic dome though strange beseems that arts should spread where frowns black slaverys baleful shade and stranger far that arts decay where freedom deals her warmest ray this then denied i will swift retreat where camus winds with murmur sweet there teach me piercing lock to explore the busy minds ideal store there heavenrapt newton guide my way mid rolling worlds through floods of day to mark the vagrant comets road and through his wonders trace the god then to unbend my mind i will roam amidst the cloisters silent gloom or where ranked oaks their shades diffuse hold dalliance with my darling muse recalling often some heavenborn strain that warbled in augustan reign or turn well pleased the grecian page if sweet theocritus engage or blithe anacreon mirthful wight caroll his easy lovelay light yet let not all my pleasure lie confined to one phoebeian joy but ever give my fingers wings lightly to skim the trembling strings and from some bower to tune the lay while listening birds crowd every spray or hovering silent over my head their quivering wings exulting spread save but the turtles they alone with tender plaintive faithful moan shall tell to all the secret grove their soft thickwarbled tale of love sweet birds your mingling bliss pursuing ever billing ever cooing ye constant pair i love to note your hoarse strain gurgling in your throat and ye unheard from sidelong hills the liquid lapse of whispering rills i hist to hear such sounds diffuse sweet transports to the thoughtful muse thus summer sees me brisk and light till winter spreads her kerchief white then to the citys social walls where tolling clock to business calls there the weavers shuttle speeds nimbly through the finespun threads there the vocal anvil rings while the smith his hammer swings and every man and every boy briskly join in warm employ through such thronged scenes

transplanted to the worlds tempestuous clime must learn each passions boisterous breath to bear there if ambition pestilent and pale or luxury should taint their vernal glow if cold selfinterest with

dews when chaunts the milkmaid at her balmy pail and weary reapers whistle over the vale charmed by the murmurs of the quivering shade over isis willowfringed banks i strayed and calmly musing through

yon streams unfailing stores supply where are the flowers that made the garden gay where is their beauty where their fragrance sled their stems relax fast fall their leaves away they fade and mingle

spray and dreary winter reigns over earth and air no mark of vegetable life is seen no bird to bird repeats his tuneful call save the dark leaves of some rude evergreen save the lone redbreast on the mossgrown wall where are the sprightly scenes by spring supplied the mayflowerd hedges scenting every breeze the white flocks scattering over the mountain side the woodlarks warbling on the blooming trees where is gay summers sportive insect train that in green fields on painted pinions played the herd at morn widepasturing over the plain or throagd at noontide in the willow shade where is brown

through green savannahs flow where brighter suns and ever tranquil skies bid new fruits ripen and new flowrets blow let truth these fairer happier lands survey there half the year descends in watery storms or nature sickens in the blaze of day and one brown hue the sunburned plain deforms there often as toiling in the mazy fields or homeward passing on the shadeless way his joyless life the weary

wondrous turn of mind our fate whatever the season or the place possessed we ever murmur at our present state and yet the thought of parting breaks our rest why else when heard in evenings solemn gloom does the sad knell that sounding over the plain tolls some poor lifeless body to the tomb thus thrill my breast with melancholy pain the voice of reason echoes in my ear thus thou ere long must join thy kindred clay no more these nostrils breathe the vital air no more these eyelids open on the day o winter round me spread thy joyless reign thy threatening skies in dusky horrors dressed of thy dread rage no longer i will complain nor ask an eden for a transient guest enough has heaven indulged of joy below to tempt our tarriance in this loved retreat enough has heaven ordained of useful

muchloyd health  squire rubbing his hands  with all my heart  allen and ella a fragment by  on the banks of that crystalline stream where thames often his current delays and charms more than poets can dream in his richmonds bright villa surveys fair ella of all the gay throng the fairest that nature had seen now drew every village along from the day she first danced on the green ah boast not of beautys fond power for short is the triumph ye fair not fleeter the bloom of each flower and hope is but gilded despair his affection each swain now behold by riches endeavors to prove but ella still cries what is gold or wealth when compared to his love yes allen together well wield our sickles in summers bright day together well lease over the field and smile all our labors away in winter i will winnow the wheat as it falls from thy flail on the ground that flail will be music as sweet when thy voice in the labor is drowned how often would he speak of his bliss how often would he call her his maid and allen would seal with a kiss every promise and vow that he said but hark over the grasslevel the village of petersham land the village bells sound on the plain false allen this morn gave his hand and ellas sond tears are in vain sad ella too soon heard the tale too soon the sad cause she was told that his was a nymph of the vale that he broke his sond promise for gold as she walked by the margin so green which befringes the sweet rivers side how often was she languishing seen how often would she gaze on the tide by the clear river then as she sat which reflected herself and the mead awhile she bewept her sad fate and the green turf still pillowd her head there there is it ella i see it is ella the lost undone maid ah no it is some ella like me some hapless young virgin betrayed like me she has sorrowd and wept like me she has fondly believed like me her true promise she kept and like me too is justly deceived i come dear companion in grief gay scenes and fond pleasures adieu i come and well gather relief from bosoms so chaste and so true like you i have mourned the long night and wept out the day in despair like you i have banished delight and bosomed a friend in my care ye meadows so lovely farewell your velvet still allen shall tread all deaf to the sound of that knell which tolls for his ella when dead your wish will too sure be obeyed nor allen her loss shall bemoan soon soon shall poor ella be laid where her heart shall be cold as your own then twined in the arms of that fair whose wealth has been ellas sad fate as together ye draw the free air and a thousand dear pleasures relate if chance over my turf as ye tread ye dare to affect a fond sigh the primrose will shrink her pale head and the violet languish and die ah weep not fond maid it is in vain like the tears which you lend to the stream tears are lost in that watery plain and your sighs are still lost upon him scarce echo had gathered the sound but she plunged from her grassspringing bed the liquid stream parts to the ground and the mirror closed over her head the swains of the village at eve often meet at the darkspreading yew there wonder how man could deceive a bosom so chaste and so true with garlands of every flower which ella herself should have made they raise up a shortliving bower and sighing cry peace to her shade then handlockdinhand as they move the greenplatting hillock around they talk of poor ella and love and freshen with tears the fair ground nay wish they had never been born or lived the sad moment to view when her allen could thus be forsworn and his
