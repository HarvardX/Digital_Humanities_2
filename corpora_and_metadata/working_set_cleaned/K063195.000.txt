designs etc    designs by mr r bentley for six poems by mr t gray  frontispiece to first ode  london printed for r dodsley in pall mall mdccliii   ode lo where the rosybosomd hours fair venus train appear disclose the longexpecting flowers and wake the purple year the attic warbler pours her throat responsive to the cuckows note the untaught harmony of spring while whispering pleasure as they fly cool zephyrs through the clear blue sky their gathered fragrance fling wherever the oaks thick branches stretch a broader browner shade wherever the rude and mossgrown beech oercanopies the glade beside some waters rushy brink with me the muse shall sit and think at ease reclined in rustic state how vain the ardour of the crowd how low how little are the proud how indigent the great still is the toiling hand of care the panting herds repose yet hark how through the peopled air the busy murmur glows the insect youth are on the wing eager to taste the honied spring and float amid the liquid noon some lightly over the current skim some show their gaylygilded trim quickglancing to the sun to contemplations sober eye such is the race of man and they that creep and they that fly shall end where they began alike the busy and the gay but flutter through lifes little day in fortunes varying colors dressed brushed by the hand of rough mischance or chilled by age their airy dance they leave in dust to rest methinks i hear in accents low the sportive kind reply poor moralist and what art thou a solitary fly thy joys no glittering female meets no hive have thou of hoarded sweets no painted plumage to display on hasty wings thy youth is flown thy sun is set thy spring is gone  we frolic while it is may  a favorite has no friend  tg rb   ode on the death of a favorite cat drowned in a tub of gold fishes it was on a lofty vases side where chinas gayest art had died the azure flowers that blow demurest of the tabby kind the pensive selima reclined gazed on the lake below her conscious tail her joy declared the fair round face the snowy beard the velvet of her paws her coat that with the tortoise vies her ears of jet and emerald eyes she saw and purrd applause still had she gazed but midst the tide two angel forms were seen to glide the genii of the stream their scaly armours tyrian hue through richest purple to the view betrayed a golden gleam the hapless nymph with wonder saw a whisker first and then a claw with many an ardent wish she stretched in vain to reach the prize what female heart can gold despise what cats averse to fish presumptuous maid with looks intent again she stretched again she bent nor knew the gulf between malignant fate sat by and smiled the slippery verge her feet beguiled she tumbled headlong in eight times emerging from the flood she mewed to every watery god some speedy aid to send no dolphin came no nereid stirred nor cruel tom or susan heard a favorite has no friend from hence ye beauties undeceived know one false step is never retrieved and be with caution bold not all that tempts your wandering eyes and heedless hearts is lawful prize nor all that glisters gold  ah tell them they are men  j s muller sc   ode on a distant prospect of eton college ye distant spires ye antique towers that crown the watery glade where grateful science still adores her henrys holy shade and ye that from the stately brow of windsors heights the expanse below of grove of lawn of mead survey whose turf whose shade whose flowers among wanders the hoary thames along his silverwinding way ah happy hills ah pleasing shade ah fields beloved in vain where once my careless childhood strayed a stranger yet to pain i feel the gales that from ye blow a momentary bliss bestow as waving fresh their gladsome wing my weary soul they seem to sooth and redolent of joy and youth to breath a second spring say father thames for thou have seen full many a sprightly race disporting on thy margent green the paths of pleasure trace who foremost now delight to cleave with pliant arm thy glassy wave the captive linnet which enthrall what idle progeny succeed to chase the rolling circles speed or urge the flying ball while some on earnest business bent their murmuring labors ply against graver hours that bring constraint to sweeten liberty some bold adventurers disdain the limits of their little reign and unknown regions dare descry still as they run they look behind they hear a voice in every wind and snatch a fearful joy gay hope is theirs by fancy fed less pleasing when possessed the tear forgot as soon as shed the sunshine of the breast theirs buxom health of rosy hue wild wit invention evernew and lively cheer of vigor born the thoughtless day the easy night the spirits pure the slumbers light that fly the approach of morn alas regardless of their doom the little victims play no sense have they of ills to come nor care beyond today yet see how all around em wait the ministers of human fate and black misfortunes baleful train ah show them where in ambush stand to seize their prey the murderous band ah tell them they are men these shall the fury passions tear the vulturs of the mind disdainful anger pallid fear and shame that sculks behind or pineing love shall waste their youth or jealousy with rankling tooth that inly gnaws the secret heart and envy wan and faded care grimvisagd comfortless despair and sorrows piercing dart ambition this shall tempt to rise then whirl the wretch from high to bitter scorn a sacrifice and grinning infamy the stings of falsehood those shall try and hard unkindness altered eye that mocks the tear it forced to flow and keen remorse with blood defiled and moody madness laughing wild amidst severest woe lo in the vale of years beneath a griesly troop are seen the painful family of death more hideous than their queen this racks the joints this fires the veins that every laboring sinew strains those in the deeper vitals rage lo poverty to fill the band that numbs the soul with icy hand and slowconsuming age to each his sufferings all are men condemned alike to groan the tender for anothers pain the unfeeling for his own yet ah why should they know their fate since sorrow never comes too late and happiness too swiftly flies thought would destroy their paradise no more where ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise  j s muller sc   a long story in britains isle

armor and veiled their weapons bright and keen in pity to the countryfarmer fame in the shape of mr pt by this time all the parish know it had told that thereabouts there lurked a wicked imp they call a poet who prowld the country far and near bewitched the children of the peasants dried up the cows and lamed the deer and sucked the eggs and killed the pheasants my lady heard their joint petition swore by her coronet and ermine she would issue out her high commission to rid the manor of such vermin the heroines undertook the task throlanes unknown over styles they ventured raped at the door

imbroglio under a teacup he might lie or creased like dogsears in a folio on the first marching of the troops the muses hopeless of his pardon conveyed him underneath their hoops to a small closet in the garden so rumor says who will believe but that they left the door ajarr where safe and laughing in his sleeve he heard the distant din of war short was his joy he little knew the power of magic was no fable out of the window whisk they flew but left a spell upon the table the words too eager to unriddle the poet felt a strange disorder transparent birdlime formed the middle and chains invisible the border so cunning was the apparatus the powerful pothooks did so move him that will he nill he to the greathouse he went as if the devil drove him yet on his way no sign of grace for folks in fear are apt to pray to phoebus he preferred his case and begged his aid that dreadful day the godhead would have backed his quarrel but with a blush on recollection owned that his quiver and his laurel against four such eyes were no protection the court was sat the culprit there forth from their gloomy mansions creeping the lady janes and joans repair and from the gallery stand peeping such as in silence of the night come sweep along some winding entry  the housekeeper styack has often seen the sight or at the chappeldoor stand sentry in peaked hoods and mantles tarnishd sour visages enough to scare ye high dames of honor once that garnished the drawing room of fierce queen mary the peeress comes the audience stare and doff their hats with due submission she curtsies as she takes her chair to all the people of condition the bard with many an artful fib had in imagination fenced him disproved the arguments of groom of the chambers squib and all that the steward groom could urge against him but soon his rhetoric forsook him when he the solemn hall had seen a sudden fit of ague shook him he stood as mute as poor a famous highwayman hanged the week before macleane yet something he was heard to mutter how in the park beneath an oldtree without design to hurt the butter or any malice to the poultry he once or twice had penned a sonnet yet hoped that he might save his bacon numbers would give their oaths upon it he never was for a conjrer taken the ghostly prudes with hagged face already had condemned the sinner my lady rose and with a grace  she smiled and bid him come to dinner jesumaria madam bridget why what can the vicountess mean cried the square hoods in woeful fidget the times are altered quite and clean decorums turned to mere civility her air and all her manners show it commend me to her affability speak to a commoner and poet  here  00 stanzas are lost  and so god save our noble king and guard us from longwinded lubbers that to eternity would

they disperse and with them go the summer friend the flattering foe by vain prosperity received to her they vow their truth and are again believed wisdom in sable garb arrayed immersed in rapturous

the sadlypleasing tear oh gently on thy suppliants head dread goddess lay thy chastning hand not in thy gorgon terrors clad nor circled with the vengeful band as by the impious thou art seen with

be there to soften not to wound my heart the generous spark extinct revive teach me to love and to forgive exact my own defects to scan what others are to feel and know myself a man  c grignion sculp  c grignion sculp  elegy written in a country church yard the curfew tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd wind slowly over the lea the plowman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivymantled tower the mopeing owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy call of incensebreathing morn the swallow twittring from the strawbuilt shed the cocks shrill clarion or the ecchoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy houswife ply her evening care no children run to lisp their sires return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share often did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow often the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how bowed the woods beneath their study stroke let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor the boast of heraldry the pomp of power and all that beauty all that wealth ever gave awaits alike the inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory over their tomb no trophies raise where through the longdrawn isle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honors voice provoke the silent dust or flattery sooth the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have swayed or waked to ecstasy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did never unroll chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some villagehampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood the applause of listening senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty over a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muses flame far from the madding crowds ignoble strife their sober wishes never learned to stray along the cool sequestered vale of life they kept the noiseless tenor of their way yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture decked implores the passing tribute of a sigh their name their years spelt by the unlettered muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to dye for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being ever resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind on some fond breast the parting soul relies some pious drops the closing eye requires even from the tomb the voice of nature cries even in our ashes live their wonted fires for thee who mindful of the unhonourd dead do in these lines their artless tale relate if chance by lonely contemplation led some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate happily some hoaryheaded swain may say oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the sun upon the upland lawn there at the foot of yonder nodding beech that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high his listless length at noontide would he stretch and pore upon the brook that babbles by hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn muttring his wayward fancies he would rove now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn or crazed with care or crossed in hopeless love one morn i missed him on the customd hill along the heath and near his favorite tree another came nor yet beside the rill nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he the next with dirges due in sad array slow through the church way path we saw him born approach and read for thou can read the lay gravd on the stone beneath you aged thorn the epitaph here rests his head upon the lap of earth a youth to fortune and to fame unknown fair science frowned not on his humble birth and melancholy marked him for her own large was his bounty and his soul sincere heaven did a recompense as largely send he gave to misery all he had a tear he gained from heaven it was all he wished a friend no farther seek his merits to disclose or
