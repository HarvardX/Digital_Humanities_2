and g g and j robinson london   price    s in boards        history of british birds  vol i  preface to those who attentively consider the subject of natural history as displayed in the animal creation it will appear that though much has been done to explore the intricate paths of nature and follow her through all her various windings much yet remains to be done before the great economy is completely developed notwithstanding the laborious and not unsuccessful inquiries of ingenious men in all ages the subject is far from being exhausted systems have been formed and exploded and new ones have appeared in their stead but like skeletons injudiciously put together they give but an imperfect idea of that order and symmetry to which they are intended to be subservient they have their use but it is the skilful practitioner who is chiefly enabled to profit by them to the less informed they appear obscure and perplexing and too frequently deter him from the great object of his pursuit  to investigate with any tolerable degree of success the more retired and distant parts of the animal economy is a task of no small difficulty an inquiry so desirable and so eminently useful would require the united efforts of many to give it the desired success men of leisure of all descriptions residing in the country could scarcely find a more delightful employment than in attempting to elucidate from their own observations the various branches of natural history and in communicating them to others something like a society in each county for the purpose of collecting a variety of these observations as well as for general correspondence would be extremely useful and necessary much might be expected from a combination of this kind extending through every part of the kingdom a general mode of communication might be thereby established in order to ascertain the changes which are continually taking place particularly among the feathered tribes the times of their appearing and disappearing would be carefully noted the differences of age sex food etc would claim a particular degree of attention and would be the means of correcting a number of errors which have crept into the works of some of the most eminent ornithologists and of avoiding the confusion arising from an overanxious desire of increasing the numbers of each particular kind but it is reserved perhaps for times of greater tranquillity when the human mind undisturbed by public calamities shall find leisure to employ itself without interruption in the pursuit of those objects which enlarge its powers and give dignity to its exertions to carry into the fullest effect a plan for investigations of this sort  in this respect no author has been more successful than the celebrated count de buffon  despising the restraints which methodical arrangements generally impose he ranges at large through the various walks of nature and describes her with a brilliancy of coloring which the most lively imagination only could suggest it must however be allowed that in many instances that ingenious philosopher has overstepped the bounds of nature and in giving the reins to his own luxuriant fancy has been too frequently hurried into the wild paths of conjecture and romance the late mr white of selborne has added much to the general stock of knowledge on this delightful subject by attentively and faithfully recording whatever fell under his own observations and by liberal communications to others  as far as we could consistently with the plan laid down in the following work we have consulted and we trust with some advantage the works of these and other naturalists in the arrangement of the various classes as well as in the descriptive part we have taken as our guide our ingenious countryman mr pennant to whose elegant and useful labors the world is indebted for a fund of the most rational entertainment and who will be remembered by every lover of nature as long as her works have power to charm the communications with which we have been favored by those gentlemen who were so good as to notice our growing work have been generally acknowledged in their proper place it remains only that we be permitted to insert this testimony of our grateful sense of them  in a few instances we have ventured to depart from the usual method of classification by placing the hardbilled birds or those which live chiefly on seeds next to those of the pie kind there seems to be a more regular gradation downwards a few anomalous birds such as the cuckoo hoopoe nuthatch etc only intervening the softbilled birds or those which subsist chiefly on worms insects and such like are by this means placed all together beginning with those of the lark kind to this we must observe that by dividing the various families of birds into two grand divisions viz land and water a number of tribes have thereby been included among the latter which can no otherwise be denominated water birds than as they occasionally seek their food in moist places by small streamlets or on the seashore such as the curlew woodcock snipe sandpiper and many others these with such as do not commit themselves wholly to the waters are thrown into a separate division under the denomination of waders to these we have ventured to remove the kingfisher and the water ouzel the former lives entirely on fish is constantly found on the margins of still waters and may with greater propriety be denominated a water bird than many which come under that description the latter seems to have no connection with those birds among which it is usually classed its business being wholly among rapid running streams in which it chiefly delights and from whence it derives its support  this work of which the first volume is all that is now offered to the public will contain an account of all the various tribes of birds either constantly residing in or occasionally visiting our island accompanied with representations of almost every species faithfully drawn from nature and engraven on wood it may be proper to observe that while one of the editors of this work was engaged in preparing the engravings the compilation of the descriptions was undertaken by the other subject however to the corrections of his friend whose habits had led him to a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of natural history the compiler therefore is answerable for the defects which may be found in this part of the undertaking concerning which he has little to say but that it was the production of those hours which could be spared from a laborious employment and on that account he hopes the severity of criticism will be spared and that it will be received with that indulgence which has been already experienced on a former occasion  newcastle upon tyne september       introduction in no part of the animal creation are the wisdom the goodness and the bounty of providence displayed in a more lively manner than in the structure formation and various endowments of the feathered tribe the symmetry and elegance discoverable in their outward appearance although highly pleasing to the sight are yet of much greater importance when considered with respect to their peculiar habits and modes of living to which they are eminently subservient  instead of the large head and formidable jaws the deep capacious chest the brawny shoulders and sinewy legs of the quadrupeds we observe the pointed beak the long and pliant neck the gently swelling shoulder the expansive wings the tapering tail the light and bony feet all which are wisely calculated to assist and accelerate their motion through the yielding air every part of their frame is formed for lightness and buoyancy their bodies are covered with a soft and delicate plumage so disposed as to protect them from the intense cold of the atmosphere through which they pass their wings are made of the lightest materials and yet the force with which they strike the air with then is so great as to impel their bodies forward with astonishing rapidity whilst the tail serves the purpose of a rudder to direct them to the different objects of their pursuit the internal structure of birds is no less nicely adapted to the same wise and useful purposes all their bones are light and thin and all the muscles except those which are appropriated to the purpose of moving the wings are extremely delicate and light the lungs are placed close to the backbone and ribs the air entering into them by a communication from the windpipe passes through and is conveyed into a number of membranous cells which lie upon the sides of the pericardium and communicate with those of the sternum in some birds these cells are continued down the wings and extend even to the pinions thigh bones and other parts of the body which can be filled and distended with air at the pleasure of the animal  the extreme singularity of this almost universal diffusion of air through the bodies of birds naturally excited a strong desire to discover the intention of nature in producing a conformation so extraordinary the ingenious mr hunter imagined that it might be intended to assist the animal in the act of flying by increasing its bulk and strength without adding to its weight this opinion was corroborated by considering that the feathers of birds and particularly those of the wings contain a great quantity of air in opposition to this he informs us that the ostrich which does not fly is nevertheless provided with air cells dispersed through its body that the woodcock and some other flying birds are not so liberally supplied with these cells yet he elsewhere observes that it may be laid down as a general rule that in birds of the highest and longest flights as eagles this extension or diffusion of air is carried further than in others and with regard to the ostrich though it is deprived of the power of flying it runs with amazing rapidity and consequently requires similar resources of air it seems therefore to be proved evidently that this general diffusion of air through the bodies of birds is of infinite use to them not only in their long and laborious flights but likewise in preventing their respiration from being stopped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion through a resisting medium were it possible for man to move with the swiftness of a swallow the actual resistance of the air as he is not provided with internal reservoirs similar to those of birds would soon suffocate him may not this universal diffusion of air through the bodies of birds account for the superior heat of this class of animals the separation of oxygen from respirable air and its mixture with the blood by means of the lungs being supposed by the ingenious dr crawford to be the efficient cause of animal hent   birds may be distinguished like quadrupeds into two kinds or classes granivorous and carnivorous like quadrupeds too there are some that hold a middle nature and partake of both granivorous birds are furnished with larger intestines and proportionally longer than those of the carnivorous kinds their food which consists of grain of various kinds is conveyed whole and entire into the first stomach or craw where it undergoes a partial dilution by a liquor secreted from glands spread over its surface it is then received into another species of stomach where it is further diluted after which it is transmitted into the gizzard or true stomach consisting of two very strong muscles covered externally with a tendinous substance and lined with a thick membrane of prodigious power and strength in this place the food is completely triturated and rendered fit for the operation of the gastric juices the extraordinary powers of the gizzard in comminuting the food so as to prepare it for digestion would exceed all credibility were they not supported by incontrovertible facts founded upon experiments in order to ascertain the strength of these stomachs the ingenious spalanzani made the following curious and very interesting experiments  tin tubes full of grain were forced into the stomachs of turkies and after remaining twenty hours were found to be broken compressed and distorted in the most irregular manner spalanzanis dissertation vol   page    in proceeding further the same author relates that the stomach of a cock in the space of twentyfour hours broke off the angles of a piece of rough jagged glass and upon examining the gizzard no wound or laceration appeared twelve strong needles were firmly fixed in a ball of lead the points of which projected about a quarter of an inch from the surface thus armed it was covered with a case of paper and forced down the throat of a turkey the bird retained it a day and a half without showing the least symptom of uneasiness the points of all the needles were broken off close to the surface of the ball except two or three of which the stumps projected a little the same author relates another experiment seemingly still more cruel he fixed twelve small lancets very sharp in a similar ball of lead which was given in the same manner to a turkeycock and left eight hours in the stomach at the expiration of which the organ was opened but nothing appeared except the naked ball the twelve lancets having been broken to pieces the stomach remaining perfectly sound and entire from these curious and wellattested facts we may conclude that the stones so often found in the stomachs of many of the feathered tribe are highly useful in comminuting the grain and other hard substances which constitute their food the stones says the celebrated dr hunter assist in grinding down the grain and by separating its parts allow the gastric juices to come more readily into contact with it thus far the conclusion coincides with the experiments which have been just related we may observe still farther that the stones thus taken into the stomachs of birds are seldom known to pass with the faeces but being ground down and separated by the powerful action of the gizzard are mixed with the food and no doubt contribute very much to the health as well as nutriment of the animal  granivorous birds partake much of the nature and disposition of herbivorous quadrupeds in both the number of their stomachs the length and capacity of their intestines and the quality of their food are very similar they are likewise both distinguished by the gentleness of their tempers and manners contented with the seeds of plants with fruits insects and worms their chief attention is directed to procuring food hatching and rearing their offspring and avoiding the snares of men and the attacks of birds of prey and other rapacious animals they are a mild and gentle race and are in general so tractable as easily to be domesticated man ever attentive and watchful to every thing conducive to his interest has not failed to avail himself of these dispositions and has judiciously selected from the numbers which every way surround him those which are most prolific and consequently the most profitable of these the hen the goose the turkey and the duck are the most considerable and form an inexhaustible store of rich wholesome and nutritious food  carnivorous birds are distinguished by those endowments and powers with which they are furnished by nature for the purpose of procuring their food they are provided with wings of great length the muscles which move them being proportionally large and strong whereby they are enabled to keep long upon the wing in search of their prey they are armed with strong hooked bills sharp and formidable claws they have also large heads short necks strong and brawny thighs and a sight so acute and piercing as to enable them to view their prey from immeasureable heights in the air upon which they dart with inconceiveable swiftness and undeviating aim their stomachs are smaller than those of the granivorous kinds and their intestines are much shorter the analogy between the structure of rapacious birds and carnivorous quadrupeds is obvious both of them are provided with weapons which indicate destruction and rapine their manners are fierce and unsocial and they seldom herd together in flocks like the inoffensive granivorous tribes when not on the wing rapacious birds retire to the tops of sequestered rocks or the depths of extensive forests where they conceal themselves in sullen and gloomy solitude those which feed on carrion are endowed with a sense of smelling so exquisite as to enable them to scent dead and putrid carcases at astonishing distances  beside these great divisions of birds into granivorous and rapacious kinds there are numerous other tribes to whom nature has given suitable organs adapted to their peculiar habits and modes of living like amphibious animals a great variety of birds live chiefly in the water and feed on fishes insects and other aquatic productions to enable them to swim and dive in quest of food their toes are connected by broad membranes or webs with which they strike the water and are driven forward with great force the seas the lakes and rivers abound with innumerable swarms of birds of various kinds all which find an abundant supply in the immeasurable stores with which the watery world is every where stocked there are other tribes of aquatic birds frequenting marshy places and the margins of lakes and rivers which seem to partake of a middle nature between those which live wholly on land and those which are entirely occupied in waters some of these feed on fishes and reptiles others derive nourishment by thrusting their long bills into soft and muddy substances where they find worms the eggs of insects and other nutritious matter they do not swim but wade in quest of food for which purpose nature has provided them with long legs bare of feathers even above the knees their toes are not connected by webs like those of the swimmers but are only partially furnished with membranaceous appendages which are just sufficient to support them on the soft and doubtful ground which they are accustomed to frequent  most of these kinds have very long necks and bills to enable them to search for and find their concealed food to these tribes belong the crane the heron the bittern the stork the spoonbill the woodcock the snipe and many others  without the means of conveying themselves with great swiftness from one place to another birds could not easily subsist the food which nature has so bountifully provided for them is so irregularly distributed that they are obliged to take long journies to distant parts in order to gain the necessary supplies at one time it is given in great abundance at another it is administered with a very sparing hand and this is one cause of those migrations so peculiar to the feathered tribe besides the want of food there are two other causes of migration viz the want of a proper temperature of air and a convenient situation for the great work of breeding and rearing their young such birds as migrate to great distances are alone denominated birds of passage but most birds are in some measure birds of passage although they do not migrate to places remote from their former habitations at particular times of the year most birds remove from one country to another or from the more inland districts toward the shores the times of these migrations or flittings are observed with the most astonishing order and punctuality but the secrecy of their departure and the suddenness of their reappearance have involved the subject of migration in general in great difficulties much of this difficulty arises from our not being able to account for the means of subsistence during the long flights of many of those birds which are obliged to cross immense tracts of water before they arrive at the places of their destination accustomed to measure distances by the speed of those animals with which we are well acquainted we are apt to overlook the superior velocity with which birds are carried forward in the air and the ease with which they continue their exertions for a much longer time than can be done by the strongest quadruped  our swiftest horses are supposed to go at the rate of a mile in somewhat less than two minutes and we have one instance on record of a horse being tried which went at the rate of nearly a mile in one minute but that was only for the small space of a second of time see history of quadrupeds page    d edition in this and similar instances we find that an uncommon degree of exertion was attended with its usual consequences debility and a total want of power to continue it to the same extent but the case is very different with birds their motions are not impeded by the same causes they glide through the air with a quickness superior to that of the swiftest quadruped and they can continue on the wing with the same speed for a considerable length of time now if we can suppose a bird to go at the rate of only half a mile in a minute for the space of twentyfour hours it will have gone over in that time an extent of more than seven hundred miles which is sufficient to account for almost the longest migration but if aided by a favorable current of air there is reason to suppose that the same journey may be performed in a much shorter space of time to these observations we may add that the sight of birds is peculiarly quick and piercing and from the advantage they possess in being raised to considerable heights in the air which is well known to be the case with the stork bittern and other kinds of birds they are enabled with a sagacity peculiar to instinctive knowledge to discover the route they are to take from the appearance of the atmosphere the clouds the direction of the winds and other causes so that without having recourse to improbable modes it is easy to conceive from the velocity of their speed alone that most birds may transport themselves to countries laying at great distances and across vast tracts of ocean  the following observations from catesby are very applicable and will conclude our remarks on this head the manner of their journeyings may vary according as the structure of their bodies enables them to support themselves in the air birds with short wings such as the redstart blackcap etc may pass by gradual and slower movements and there seems no necessity for a precipitate passage as every day affords an increase of warmth and a continuance of food it is probable these itinerants may perform their journey in the nightime in order to avoid ravenous birds and other dangers which daylight may expose them to the flight of the smaller birds of passage across the seas has by many been considered as wonderful and especially with regard to those with short wings among which quails seem by their structure little adapted for long flights nor are they ever seen to continue on the wing for any length of time and yet their ability for such flights cannot be doubted the coming of these birds is certain and regular from every years experience but the cause and manner of their departure have not always been so happily accounted for in short all we know of the matter ends in this observation  that providence has created a great variety of birds and other animals with constitutions and inclinations adapted to their several wants and necessities as well as to the different degrees of heat and cold in the several climates of the world whereby no country is destitute of inhabitants and has given them appetites for the productions of those countries whose temperature is suited to their nature as well as knowledge and ability to seek and find them out  the migration of the swallow tribe has been noticed by almost every writer on the natural history of birds and various opinions have been formed respecting their disappearance and the state in which they subsist during that interval some naturalists suppose that they do not leave this island at the end of autumn but that they lie in a torpid state till the beginning of summer in the banks of rivers in the hollows of decayed trees in holes and crevices of old buildings in sand banks and the like some have even asserted that swallows pass the winter immersed in the waters of lakes and rivers where they have been found in clusters mouth to mouth wing to wing foot to foot and that they retire to these places in autumn and creep down the reeds to their subaqueous retreats in support of this opinion mr klein very gravely asserts on the credit of some countrymen that swallows sometimes assembled in numbers clinging to a reed till it broke and sunk with them to the bottom that their immersion was preceded by a song or dirge which lasted more than a quarter of an hour sometimes they laid hold of a straw with their bills and plunged down in society and that others formed a large mass by clinging together by the feet and in this manner committing themselves to the deep it requires no great depth of reasoning to refute such palpable absurdities or to show the physical impossibility of a body specifically lighter than water employing another body lighter than itself for the purpose of immersion but admitting the possibility of this curious mode of immersion it is by no means probable that swallows or any other animal in a torpid state can exist for any length of time in an element to which they have never been accustomed and are besides totally unprovided by nature with organs suited to such a mode of subsistence  the celebrated mr john hunter informs us that he had dissected many swallows but found nothing in them different from other birds as to the organs of respiration and therefore concludes that it is highly absurd to suppose that terrestrial animals can remain any long time under water without drowning it must not however be denied that swallows have been sometimes found in a torpid state during the winter months but such instances are by no means common and will not support the inference that if any of them can survive the winter in that state the whole species is preserved in the same manner there are various instances on record which bear the strongest marks of veracity of swallows having been taken out of water and of their having been so far recovered by warmth as to exhibit evident signs of life so as even to fly about for a short space of time but whilst we admit the fact we are not inclined to allow the conclusion generally drawn from it viz that swallows at the time of their disappearance frequently immerse themselves in seas lakes and rivers and at the proper season emerge and reassume the ordinary functions of life and animation for it should be observed that in those instances which have been the best authenticated see forsters translation of kalms travels into north america p   0  note it appears that the swallows so taken up were generally found entangled amongst reeds and rushes by the sides or in the shallowest parts of the lakes or rivers where they happened to be discovered and that having been brought to life so far as to fly about they all of them died in a few hours after from the facts thus stated we would infer that at the time of the disappearance of swallows the reedy grounds by the sides of rivers and standing waters are generally dry and that these birds especially the later hatchings which frequent such places for the sake of food retire to them at the proper season and lodge themselves among the roots or in the thickest parts of the rank grass which grows there that during their state of torpidity they are liable to be covered with water from the rains which follow and are sometimes washed into the deeper parts of the lake or river where they have been accidentally taken up and that probably the transient signs of life which they have discovered on such occasions have given rise to a variety of vague and improbable accounts of their immersion etc that other birds have been found in a torpid state may be inferred from the following curious fact which was communicated to us by a gentleman who saw the bird and had the account from the person who found it a few years ago a young cuckoo was found in the thickest part of a close whin bush when taken up it presently discovered signs of life but was quite destitute of feathers being kept warm and carefully fed it grew and recovered its coat of feathers in the spring following it made its escape and in flying across the river tyne it gave its usual call we have observed a single swallow so late as the latter end of october mr white in his natural history of selborne mentions hating seen a house martin flying about in november long after the general migration had taken place many more instances might be given of such late appearances which added to the wellauthenticated accounts of swallows having been actually found in a torpid state leave us no room to doubt that such young birds as have been late hatched and consequently not strong enough to undertake a long voyage to the coast of africa are left behind and remain concealed in hiding places till the return of spring on the other hand that actual migrations of the swallow tribes do take place has been fully proved from a variety of wellattested facts most of which have been taken from the observations of navigators who have been eyewitnesses of their flights and whose ships have sometimes afforded a resting place to the weary travelers  to the many on record we shall add the following which we received from a very sensible master of a vessel who whilst he was sailing early in the spring between the islands of minorca and majorca saw great numbers of swallows flying northward many of whom alighted on the rigging of the ship in the evening but disappeared before morning after all our inquiries into this branch of natural economy much yet remains to be known and we may conclude in the words of the ingenious mr white that whilst we observe with delight with how much ardour and punctuality those little birds obey the strong impulse toward migration or hiding imprinted on their minds by their great creator it is with no small degree of mortification that we reflect that after all our pains and inquiries we are not yet quite certain to what regions they do migrate and are still farther embarrassed to find that some do not actually migrate at all  amusive birds say where your hid retreat when the frost rages and the tempests beat whence your return by such nice instinct led when spring sweet season lifts her bloomy head such baffled searches mock mans prying pride the god of nature is your secret guide most birds at certain seasons live together in pairs the union is formed in the spring and generally continues whilst the united efforts of both are necessary in forming their temporary habitations and in rearing and maintaining their offspring eagles and other birds of prey continue their attachment for a much longer time and sometimes for life the nests of birds are constructed with such exquisite art as to exceed the utmost exertion of human ingenuity to imitate them their mode of building the materials they make use of as well as the situations they select are as various as the different kinds of birds and are all admirably adapted to their several wants and necessities birds of the same species whatever region of the globe they inhabit collect the same materials arrange them in the same manner and make choice of similar situations for fixing the places of their temporary abodes to describe minutely the different kinds of nests the various substances of which they are composed and the judicious choice of situations would swell this part of our work much beyond its due bounds every part of the world furnishes materials for the aerial architects leaves and small twigs roots and dried grass mixed with clay serve for the external whilst moss wool fine hair and the softest animal and vegetable downs form the warm internal part of these commodious dwellings the following beautiful lines from thomson are highly descriptive of the busy scene which takes place during the time of nidification  some to the holly hedge nestling repair and to the thicket some etc etc see thomsons seasons  spring  after the business of incubation is over and the young are sufficiently able to provide for themselves the nests are always abandoned by the parents excepting those of the eagle kind  the various gifts and endowments which the great author of nature has so liberally bestowed upon his creatures in general demand in a peculiar manner the attention of the curious naturalist amongst the feathered tribe in particular there is much room in this respect for minute and attentive investigation in pursuing our inquiries into that system of economy by which every part of nature is upheld and preserved we are struck with wonder in observing the havoc and destruction which every where prevail throughout the various orders of beings inhabiting the earth our humanity is interested in that law of nature which devotes to destruction myriads of creatures to support and continue the existence of others but although it is not allowed us to unravel the mysterious workings of nature through all her parts or unfold her deep designs we are nevertheless strongly led to the consideration of the means by which individuals as well as species are preserved and multiplied the weak are frequently enabled to elude the pursuits of the strong by flight or stratagem some are screened from the pursuit of their enemies by an arrangement of colors happily assimilated to the places which they most frequent and where they find either food or repose thus the wryneck is scarcely to be distinguished from the bark of the tree on which it feeds or the snipe from the soft and mossy ground by the springs of water which it frequents the great plover finds its greatest security in stony places to which its colors are so nicely adapted that the most exact observer may be very easily deceived  the attentive ornithologist will not fail to discover numerous instances of this kind such as the partridge plover quail etc some are indebted to the brilliancy of their colors as the means of alluring their prey of this the kingfisher is a remarkable instance and deserves to be particularly noticed this beautiful bird has been observed in some sequestered places near the edge of a rivulet exposing the vivid colors of its breast to the full rays of the sun and fluttering with expanded wings over the smooth surface of the water the fish attracted by the brightness and splendor of the appearance are detained whilst the wily bird darts down upon them with unerring certainty we do not say that the mode of taking fish by torchlight has been derived from this practiced by the kingfisher but every one must be struck by the similarity of the means others again derive the same advantage from the simplicity of their exterior appearance of this the heron will serve as an example he may frequently be seen standing motionless by the edge of a piece of water waiting patiently the approach of his prey which he never fails to seize as soon as it comes within reach of his long neck he then reassumes his former position and continues to wait with the same patient attention as before  most of the smaller birds are supported especially when young by a profusion of caterpillars small worms and insects with which every part of the vegetable world abounds which is by this means preserved from total destruction contrary to the commonly received opinion that birds particularly sparrows do much mischief in destroying the labors of the gardener and the husbandman it has been observed that a single pair of sparrows during the time they are feeding their young will destroy about four thousand caterpillars weekly they likewise feed their young with butterflies and other winged insects each of which if not destroyed in this manner would be productive of several hundreds of caterpillars swallows are almost continually upon the wing and in their curious winding flights destroy immense quantities of flies and other insects which are continually floating in the air and which if not destroyed by these birds would render it unfit for the purposes of life and health that active little bird the tomtit which has generally been supposed hostile to the young and tender buds which appear in the spring when attentively observed may be seen running up and down amongst the branches and picking the small worms which are concealed in the blossoms and which would effectually destroy the fruit as the season advances various other small birds such as the redbreast wren winter fauvette or hedgesparrow whitethroat redstart etc are all engaged in the same useful work and may be observed examining every leaf and feeding upon the insects which they find beneath them  these are a few instances of that superintending providential care which is continually exerted in preserving the various ranks and orders of beings in the scale of animated nature and although it is permitted that myriads of individuals should every moment be destroyed not a single species is lost but every link of the great chain remains unbroken  great britain produces a more abundant variety of birds than most northern countries owing to the various condition of our lands from the highest state of cultivation to that of the wildest most mountainous and woody the great quantities of berries and other kinds of fruit produced in our hedges heaths and plantations bring small birds in great numbers and birds of prey in consequence our shores and the numerous little islands adjacent to them afford shelter and protection to an infinite variety of almost all kinds of water fowl to enumerate the various kinds of birds that visit this island annually will not we presume be unacceptable to our readers nor improper in this part of our work the following are selected chiefly from mr whites

insects remain with us during the whole year viz the redbreast winter fauvette and wren which frequent outhouses and gardens and eat spiders small worms crumbs etc the pied the yellow and the gray wagtail which frequent the heads of springs where the waters seldom freeze and feed on the aureliae of insects usually deposited there besides these the whinchat the stonechatter and the goldencrested wren are seen with us during the winter the latter though the least of all the british birds is very hardy and can endure the utmost severity of our winters the white rump though not common sometimes stays the winter with us  of the winter birds of passage the following are the principal viz    the redwing or wind thrush    the fieldfare  both these arrive in great numbers about michaelmas and depart about the end of february or beginning of march    the hooded or sea crow visits us in the beginning of winter and departs with the woodcock    the woodcock appears about michaelmas and leaves us about the beginning of march    snipes are considered by mr white as birds of passage though he acknowledges that they frequently breed with us mr pennant remarks that their young are so frequently found in britain that it may be doubted whether they ever entirely leave this island    the judcock or jack snipe    the wood pigeon of the precise time of its arrival we are not quite certain but suppose it may be some time in april as we have seen them in the north at that time    the wild swan frequents the coasts of this island in large flocks but is not supposed to breed with us it has been chiefly met with in the northern parts and is said to arrive at lingey one of the hebrides in october and remains there till march when it retires more northward to breed    the wild goose passes southward in october and returns northward in april  with regard to the duck kind in general they are mostly birds of passage mr pennant observes of the numerous species that form this genus we know of no more than five that breed here viz the tame swan the tame goose the shield duck the eider duck and a very small number of the wild ducks the rest contribute to form that amazing multitude of water fowl that annually repair from most parts of europe to the woods and lakes of lapland and other arctic regions there to perform the functions of incubation and nutrition in full security they and their young quit their retreats in september and disperse themselves over europe with us they make their appearance in the beginning of october circulate first round our shores and when compelled by severe frost betake themselves to our lakes and rivers  in winter the bernacles and brent geese appear in vast flocks on the northwest coast of britain and leave us in february when they migrate as far as lapland greenland or spitzbergen  the solon geese or gannets are birds of passage their first appearance is in march and they continue till august or september the longlegged plover and sanderling visit us in winter only and it is worthy of remark that every species of the curlews woodcocks sandpipers and plovers which forsake us in the spring retire to sweden poland prussia norway and lapland to breed and return to us as soon as the young are able to fly the frosts which set in early in those countries depriving them totally of subsistence  besides these there is a great variety of birds which perform partial migrations or flittings from one part of the country to another during hard winters when the surface of the earth is covered with snow many birds such as larks snipes etc withdraw from the inland parts of the country toward the seashores in quest of food others as the wren the redbreast and a variety of small birds quit the fields and approach the habitations of men the bohemian chatterer the grosbeak and the crossbill are only occasional visitors and observe no regular times in making their appearance great numbers of the former were taken in the county of northumberland the latter end of the years      and    0 before which they had not been observed so far south as that county and since that time have never been seen there  the ages of birds are various and do not seem to bear the same proportion to the time of acquiring their growth as has been remarked with regard to quadrupeds most birds acquire their full dimensions in a few months and are capable of propagation the first summer after they are hatched in proportion to the size of their bodies birds are much more vivacious and live longer than either man or quadrupeds notwithstanding the difficulties which arise in ascertaining the ages of birds there are instances of great longevity in many of them geese and swans have been known to attain the age of one hundred or upwards ravens are very longlived birds and are said sometimes to exceed a century eagles are supposed to arrive at a great age pigeons are known to live more than twenty years and even linnets and other small birds have been kept in cages from fifteen to twenty years  to the practical ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification in being able to discern the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance whether at rest or during their flight for not only every species has something peculiar to itself but each genus has its own appropriate marks upon which a judicious observer may discriminate with almost unerring certainty of these the various modes of flight afford the most certain and obvious means of distinction and should be noted with the most careful attention from the bold and lofty flight of the eagle to the short and sudden flittings of the sparrow or the wren there is an ample field for the curious investigator of nature on which he may dwell with inexpressible delight tracing the various movements of the feathered nations which every where present themselves to his view the notes or as it may with more propriety be called the language of birds whereby they are enabled to express in no inconsiderable degree their various passions wants and feelings must be particularly noticed whites selborne the great power of their voice by which they can communicate their sentiments and intentions to each other and by that means are able to act by mutual concert added to that of the wing by which they can remove from place to place with inconceivable celerity and dispatch is peculiar to the feathered tribes it gives them a decided superiority over every species of quadrupeds and affords them the greatest means of safety from those attacks to which their weakness would otherwise expose them the social instinct among birds is peculiarly lively and interesting and likewise proves an effectual means of preservation from the various arts which are made use of to circumvent and destroy them individuals may perish and the species may suffer a diminution of its numbers but its instincts habits and economy remain entire

numerous than ravenous quadrupeds and it seems wisely provided by nature that their powers should be equally confined and limited as their numbers for if to the rapid flight and penetrating eye of the eagle were joined the strength and voracious appetite of the lion the tiger or the glutton no artifice could evade the one and no speed could escape the other  the characters of birds of the ravenous kind are particularly strong and easily to be distinguished the formidable talons the large head the strong and crooked beak indicate their ability for rapine and carnage their dispositions are fierce and their nature untractable unsociable and cruel they avoid the haunts of civilization and retire to the most melancholy and wild recesses of nature where they can enjoy in gloomy solitude the effects of their depredatory excursions the fierceness of their nature extends even to their young which they drive from the nest at a very early period the difficulty of procuring a constant supply of food for them sometimes overcomes the feelings of parental affection and they have been known to destroy them in the fury of disappointed hunger different from all other kinds the female of birds of prey is larger and stronger than the male naturalists have puzzled themselves to assign the reason of this extraordinary property but the final cause at least is obvious  the care of rearing her young being solely entrusted to the female nature has furnished her with more ample powers to provide for her own wants and those of her offspring  this formidable tribe constitutes the first order among the genera of birds those of our own country consist only of two kinds viz the falcon and the owl  we shall begin with the former  the falcon tribe the numerous families of which this kind is composed are found in almost every part of the world from the frigid to the torrid zone they are divided into various classes or tribes consisting of eagles kites buzzards hawks etc and are readily known by the following distinguishing characteristics  the bill is strong sharp and much hooked and is furnished with a naked skin or cere situated at the base in which are placed the nostrils the head and neck are well clothed with feathers which sufficiently distinguish it from every one of the vulture kind the legs and feet are scaly claws large and strong much hooked and very sharp birds of this species are also distinguished by their undaunted courage and great activity buffon speaking of the eagle compares it with the lion and ascribes to it the magnanimity the strength and the forbearance of that noble quadruped the eagle despises small animals and disregards their insults he seldom devours the whole of his prey but like the lion leaves the fragments to other animals though famished with hunger he disdains to feed on carrion the eyes of the eagle have the glare of those of the lion and are nearly of the same color the claws are of the same shape and the cry of both is powerful and terrible destined for war and plunder they are equally fierce bold and untractable such is the resemblance which that ingenious and fanciful writer has pictured of these two noble animals the characters of both are striking and prominent and hence the eagle is said to extend his dominion over the birds as the lion over the quadrupeds  the same writer also observes that in a state of nature the eagle never engages in a solitary chase but when the female is confined to her eggs or her young at this season the return of the smaller birds affords plenty of prey and he can with ease provide for the sustenance of himself and his mate at other times they unite their exertions and are always seen close together or at a short distance from each other those who have an opportunity of observing their motions say that the one beats the bushes whilst the other perched on an eminence watches the escape of the prey they often soar out of the reach of human sight and notwithstanding the immense distance their cry is still heard and then resembles the barking of a small dog though a voracious bird the eagle can endure the want of sustenance for a long time a common eagle caught in a fox trap is said to have passed five whole weeks without the least food and did not appear sensibly weakened till toward the last week after which a period was put to its existence    the golden eagle  falco chrysaetos linnaeus  le grand aigle buffon is the largest of the genus it measures from the point of the bill to the extremity of the toes upwards of three feet and in breadth from wing to wing above eight and weighs from sixteen to eighteen pounds the male is smaller and does not weigh more than twelve pounds the bill is of a deep blue color the cere yellow the eyes are large deep sunk and covered by a projecting brow the iris is of a fine bright yellow and sparkles with uncommon luster the general color is deep brown mixed with tawny on the head and neck the quills are chocolate with white shafts the tail is black spotted with ash color the legs are yellow and feathered down to the toes which are very scaly the claws are remarkably large the middle one is two inches in length  this noble bird is found in various parts of europe it abounds most in the warmer regions and has seldom been met with farther north than the fiftyfifth degree of latitude it is known to breed in the mountainous parts of ireland it lays three and sometimes four eggs of which it seldom happens that more than two are prolific mr pennant says there are instances though rare of their having bred in snowdon hills mr wallis in his natural history of northumberland says it formerly had its aerie on the highest and steepest part of cheviot in the beginning of january      a very large one was shot near warkworth which measured from point to point of its wings eleven feet and a quarter  the ringtailed eagle  falco fulvus lin  laigle commun buff this is the common eagle of buffon and according to that author includes two varieties the brown and the black eagle they are both of the same brown color distinguished only by a deeper shade and are nearly of the same size in both the upper part of the head and neck is mixed with rust color and the base of the larger feathers marked with white the bill is of a dark horn color the cere of a bright yellow the iris hazel and between the bill and the eye there is a naked skin of a dirty brown color the legs are feathered to the toes which are yellow and the claws black the tail is distinguished by a white ring which covers about two thirds of its length the remaining part is black  the ringtailed eagle is more numerous and diffused than the golden eagle and prefers more northern climates it is found in france germany switzerland great britain and in america as far north as hudsons bay    the whitetailed eagle great erne  cinereous eagle  falco albiulla lin  le grand pygargue buff of this there appear to be three varieties which differ chiefly in size and consist of the following the great erne or cinereous eagle of latham and pennant the small erne or lesser whitetailed eagle and the whiteheaded erne or bald eagle the two first are distinguished only by their size and the last by the whiteness of its head and neck  the whitetailed eagle is inferior in size to the golden eagle the beak cere and eyes are of a pale yellow the space between the beak and the eye is of a blueish color and thinly covered with hair the sides of the head and neck are of a pale ash color mixed with reddish brown the general color of the plumage is brown darkest on the upper part of the head neck and back the quill feathers are very dark the breast is irregularly marked with white spots the tail is white the legs which are of a bright yellow are feathered a little below the knees the claws are black  this bird inhabits all the northern parts of europe and is found in scotland and many parts of great britain it is equal in strength and vigor to the common eagle but more furious and is said to drive its young ones from the nest after having fed them only a very short time it has commonly two or three young and builds its nest upon lofty trees  the sea eagle  falco ossifragus lin  lorfraie buff this bird is nearly as large as the golden eagle measuring in length three feet and a half but its expanded wings do not reach above seven feet its bill is large much hooked and of a blueish color its eye is yellow a row of strong bristly feathers hangs down from its under bill next to its throat from whence it has been termed the bearded eagle the top of the head and back part of the neck are dark brown inclining to black the feathers on the back are variegated by a lighter brown with dark edges the scapulars are pale brown the edges nearly white the breast and belly whitish with irregular spots of brown the tail feathers are dark brown the outer edges of the exterior feathers whitish the quill feathers and thighs are dusky the legs and feet yellow the claws which are large and form a complete semicircle are of a shining black it is found in various parts of europe and america it is said to lay only two eggs during the whole year and frequently produces only one young one it is however widely dispersed and was met with at botany island by captain cook it lives chiefly on fish its usual haunts are by the seashore it also frequents the borders of large lakes and rivers and is said to see so distinctly in the dark as to be able to pursue and catch its prey during the night the story of the eagle brought to the ground after a severe conflict with a cat which it had seized and taken up into the air with its talons is very remarkable mr barlow who was an eyewitness of the fact made a drawing of it which he afterward engraved  the osprey bald buzzard sea eagle or fishing hawk  falco haliaetus lin  le balbuzard buff the length of this bird is two feet its breadth from tip to tip above five its bill is black with a blue cere and its eye is yellow the crown of its head is white marked with oblong dusky spots its cheeks and all the under parts of its body are white slightly spotted with brown on its breast from the corner of each eye a streak of brown extends down the sides of the neck toward the wing the upper part of the body is brown the two middle feathers of the tail are brown the others are marked on the inner webs with alternate bars of brown and white the legs are very short and thick being only two inches and a quarter long and two inches in circumference they are of a pale blue color the claws black the outer toe is larger than the inner one and turns easily backward by which means this bird can more readily secure its slippery prey  buffon observes that the osprey is the most numerous of the large birds of prey and is scattered over the extent of europe from sweden to greece and that it is found even in egypt and nigritia its haunts are on the sea shore and on the borders of rivers and lakes its principal food is fish it darts upon its prey with great rapidity and with undeviating aim the italians compare its descent upon the water to a piece of lead falling upon that element and distinguish it by the name of auguista piumbina or the leaden eagle it builds its nest on the ground among reeds and lays three or four eggs of an elliptical form rather less than those of a hen the carolina and cayenne ospreys are varieties of this species  the common buzzard  falco buteo lin  la buse buff m buffon distinguishes the kites and the buzzards from the eagles and hawks by their habits and dispositions which he compares to those of the vultures and places them after those birds though possessed of strength agility and weapons to defend themselves they are cowardly inactive and slothful they will fly before a sparrowhawk and when overtaken will suffer themselves to be beaten and even brought to the ground without resistance  the buzzard is about twenty inches in length and in breadth four feet and a half its bill is of a lead color eyes pale yellow the upper parts of the body are of a dusky brown color the wings and tail are marked with bars of a darker hue the upper parts pale variegated with a light reddish brown the legs are yellow claws black this wellknown bird is of a sedentary and indolent disposition it continues for many hours perched upon a tree or eminence from whence it darts upon the game that comes within its reach it feeds on birds small quadrupeds reptiles and insects its nest is constructed with small branches lined in the inside with wool and other soft materials it lays two or three eggs of a whitish color spotted with yellow it feeds and tends its young with great assiduity ray affirms that if the female be killed during the time of incubation the male buzzard takes the charge of them and patiently rears the young till they are able to provide for themselves birds of this species are subject to greater variations than most other birds scarcely two being alike some are entirely white of others the head only is white and others again are mottled with brown and white  we were favored with one of these birds by john trevelyan esquire of wallington in the county of northumberland by whom it was shot in the act of devouring its prey which consisted of a partridge it had just killed the flesh was entirely separated from the bones which with the legs and wings were afterward discovered laying at a small distance from the place where it had been shot  the honey buzzard  falco apivorus lin  la bondree buff is as large as the buzzard measuring twentytwo inches in length its wings extend above four feet its bill is black and rather longer than that of the buzzard its eyes are yellow its head is large and flat and of an ash color upper parts of the body dark brown the under parts white spotted or barred with rusty brown on the breast and belly tail brown marked with three broad dusky bars between each of which are two or three of the same color but narrower the legs are stout and short of a dull yellow color claws black this bird builds its nest similar to that of the buzzard and of the same materials its eggs are of an ash color with small brown spots it sometimes takes possession of the nests of other birds and feeds its young with wasps and other insects it is fond of field mice frogs lizards and insects it does not soar like the kite but flies low from tree to tree or from bush to bush it is found in all the northern parts of europe and in the open parts of russia and siberia but is not so common in england as the buzzard  buffon observes that it is frequently caught in the winter when it is fat and delicious eating    moor buzzard duck hawk or whiteheaded harpy  falco aeruginosus lin  le busard buff length above twentyone inches the bill is black cere and eyes yellow the whole crown of the head is of a yellowish white lightly tinged with brown the throat is of a light rust color the rest of the plumage is of a reddish brown with pale edges the greater wing coverts tipped with white the legs are yellow claws black our figure and description are taken from a very fine living bird sent us by john silvertop esquire of minsteracres in the county of northumberland which very nearly agreed with that figured in the planches enluminees birds of this kind vary much  in some the crown and back part of the head are yellow and in one described by mr latham the whole bird was uniformly of a chocolate brown with a tinge of rust color it preys on rabbits young wild ducks and other water fowl and likewise feeds on fish frogs reptiles and even insects its haunts are in hedges and bushes near pools marshes and rivers that abound with fish it builds its nest a little above the surface of the ground or in hillocks covered with thick herbage the female lays three or four eggs of a whitish color irregularly sprinkled with dusky spots  though smaller it is more active and bolder than the common buzzard and when pursued it meets its antagonist and makes a vigorous defense    the kite puttok forktailed kyte or glead  falco milous lin  le milan royal buff this bird is easily distinguished from the buzzard by its forked tail which is its peculiar and distinguishing feature its length is about two feet its bill is of a horn color furnished with bristles at its base its eyes and cere are yellow the feathers on the head and neck are long and narrow of a hoary color streaked with brown down the middle of each the body is of a reddish brown color the margin of each feather being pale the quills are dark brown the legs yellow and the claws black it is common in england and continues with us the whole year it is found in various parts of europe in very northern latitudes from whence before winter it retires toward egypt in great numbers it is said to breed there and return in april to europe where it breeds a second time contrary to the nature of rapacious birds in general the female lays two or three eggs of a whitish color spotted with pale yellow and of a roundish form though the kite weighs somewhat less than three pounds the extent of its wings is more than five feet its flight is rapid and it soars very high in the air frequently beyond the reach of our sight  yet at this distance it perceives its food distinctly and descends upon its prey with irresistible force its attacks are confined to small animals and birds it is particularly fond of young chickens but the fury of their mother is generally sufficient to drive away the robber    the goshawk  falco palumbarius lin  lautour buff this bird is somewhat longer than the buzzard but slenderer and more beautiful its length is one foot ten inches its bill is blue tipped with black cere green eyes yellow over each eye there is a whitish line the head and all the upper parts of the body are of a deep brown color each side of the neck being irregularly marked with white the breast and belly are white with a number of wavy lines or bars of black the tail is long of an ash color and crossed with four or five dusky bars the legs are yellow and the claws black the wings are much shorter than the tail m de buffon who brought up two young birds of this kind a male and a female makes the following observations that the goshawk before it has shed its feathers that is in its first year is marked on the breast and belly with longitudinal brown spots but after it has had two moultings they disappear and their place is occupied by transverse bars which continue during the rest of its life he observes further that though the male was much smaller than the female it was fairer and more vicious the goshawk feeds on mice and small birds and eagerly devours raw flesh it plucks the birds very neatly and tears them into pieces before it eats them but swallows the pieces entire and frequently disgorges the hair rolled up in small pellets  the goshawk is found in france and germany it is not very common in this country but is more frequent in scotland it is likewise common in north america russia and siberia in chinese tartary there is a variety which is mottled with brown and yellow they are said to be used by the emperor of china in his sporting excursions when he is usually attended by his grand falconer and a thousand of inferior rank every bird has a silver plate fastened to its foot with the name of the falconer who had the charge of it that in case it should be lost it may be restored to the proper person but if he should not be found the bird is delivered to another officer called the guardian of lost birds who to make his situation known erects his standard in a conspicuous place among the army of hunters in former times the custom of carrying a hawk on the hand was confined to men of high distinction so that it was a saying among the welsh you may know a gentleman by his hawk horse and greyhound even the ladies in those times were partakers of this gallant sport and have been represented in sculpture with hawks on their hands at present this noble diversion is wholly laid aside in this country the advanced state of agriculture which every where prevails and the consequent improvement and enclosure of lands would but ill accord with the pursuits of the falconer who requires a large and extensive range of country where he may pursue his game without molestation to himself or injury to his neighbor the expense which attended this sport was very considerable which confined it to princes and men of the highest rank in the time of james i sir thomas monson is said to have given a thousand pounds for a cast of hawks in the reign of edward iii it was made felony to steal a hawk to take its eggs even in a persons own ground was punishable with imprisonment for a year and a day together with a fine at the kings pleasure such was the pleasure our ancestors took in this royal sport and such were the means by which they endeavored to secure it  besides the bird just described there are many other kinds which were formerly in high estimation for the sports of the field these were principally the jerfalcon the falcon the lanner the sacre the hobby the kestril and the merlin these are called the longwinged hawks and are distinguished from the goshawk the sparrowhawk the kite and the buzzard which are of shorter wing flower in their motions more indolent and less courageous than the others    the sparrowhawk  falco nisus lin  lepervier buff the length of the male is twelve inches that of the female fifteen its bill is blue furnished with bristles at the base which overhang the nostrils the color of the eye is bright orange the head is flat at the top and above each eye is a strong bony projection which seems as if intended to secure it from external injury from this projection a few scattered spots of white form a faint line running backward toward the neck the top of the head and all the upper parts of the body are of a dusky brown color on the back part of the head there is a faint line of white the scapulars are marked with two spots of white on each feather the greater quill feathers and the tail are dusky with four bars of a darker hue on each the inner edges of all the quills are marked with two or more large white spots the tips of the tail feathers are white the breast belly and under coverts of the wings and thighs are white beautifully barred with brown the throat is faintly streaked with brown the legs and feet are yellow claws black  the above description is that of a female the male differs both in size and color the upper part of his body being of a dark lead color and the bars on his breast more numerous the sparrowhawk is a bold and spirited bird and very numerous in various parts of the world from russia to the cape of good hope the female builds her nest in hollow trees high rocks or lofty ruins sometimes in old crows nests and generally lays four or five eggs spotted with reddish spots at the longer end the sparrowhawk is obedient and docile and can be easily trained to hunt partridges and quails it makes great destruction among pigeons young poultry and small birds of all kinds which it will attack and carry off in the most daring manner    the jerfalcon  falco gyrfalco lin  le gerfaut buff this is a very elegant species and equals the goshawk in size its bill is much hooked and yellow the iris is dusky the throat white as is likewise the general color of the plumage spotted with brown the breast and belly are marked with lines pointing downwards the spots on the back and wings are larger the feathers on the thighs are very long and of a pure white those of the tail are barred the legs are of a pale blue and feathered below the knee this bird is a native of the cold and dreary climates of the north being found in russia norway and iceland it is never seen in warm and seldom in temperate climates it is found but rarely in scotland and the orkneys buffon mentions three varieties of the jerfalcon the first is brown on all the upper parts of the body and white spotted with brown on the under this is found in iceland the second is very similar to it and the third is entirely white next to the eagle it is the most formidable the most active and the most intrepid of all voracious birds and is the dearest and most esteemed for falconry it is transported from iceland and russia into france italy and even into persia and turkey  nor does the heat of these climates appear to diminish its strength or blunt its vivacity it boldly attacks the largest of the feathered race the stork the heron and the crane are easy victims it kills hares by darting directly upon them the female as in all other birds of prey is much larger and stronger than the male which is used in falconry only to catch the kite the heron and the crow  the gentilfalcon  falco gentilis lin this bird is somewhat larger than the goshawk its bill is lead color cere and irides yellow the head and back part of the neck are rusty streaked with black the back and wings are brown scapulars tipped with rusty the quills dusky the outer webs barred with black the lower part of the inner webs marked with white the tail is long and marked with alternate bars of black and ash color and tipped with white the legs are yellow and the claws black the wings do not extend farther than half the length of the tail  naturalists have enumerated a great variety of falcons and in order to swell the list they have introduced the same bird at different periods of its life and have not unfrequently substituted accidental differences of climate as constituting permanent varieties so that as buffon observes with his usual acuteness one would be apt to imagine that there were as many varieties of the falcon as of the pigeon the hen and other domestic birds in this way new species have been introduced and varieties multiplied without end an overanxious desire of noting all the minute differences existing in this part of the works of nature has sometimes led the too curious inquirer into unnecessary distinctions and has been the means of introducing confusion and irregularity into the systems of ornithologists our countryman latham makes twelve varieties of the common falcon of which one is a young falcon or yearling  another is the haggard or old falcon  whilst others differ only in some unessential point arising from age sex or climate buffon however reduces the whole to two kinds  the gentil which he supposes to be the same with the common falcon differing only in season and the peregrine or passenger falcon this last is rarely met with in britain and consequently is but little known with us it is about the size of the common falcon its bill is blue black at the point cere and irides yellow the upper parts of the body are elegantly marked with bars of blue and black the breast is of a yellowish white marked with a few small dusky lines the belly thighs and vent of a greyish white crossed with dusky bands the quills are dusky spotted with white the tail is finely barred with blue and black the legs are yellow the claws black  the lanner  falco lanarius lin  le lanier buff this bird is somewhat less than the buzzard its bill is blue cere inclining to green eyes yellow the feathers on the upper parts of the body are brown with pale edges above each eye there is a white line which runs toward the hind part of the head and beneath it is a black streak pointing downwards toward the neck the throat is white the breast of a dull yellow marked with brown spots thighs and vent the same the quill feathers are dusky marked on the inner webs with oval spots of a rust color the tail is spotted in the same manner the legs are short and strong and of a blueish color the lanner is not common in england it breeds in ireland and is found in various parts of europe it derives its name from its mode of tearing its prey into small pieces with its bill    the henharrier dovecoloured falcon or blue hawk  falco cyaneus lin  loiseau st martin buff the length seventeen inches breadth from tip to tip somewhat more than three feet the bill is black and covered at the base with long bristly feathers the cere irides and edges of the eyelids are yellow the upper parts of the body are of a blueish gray color mixed with light tinges of rusty the breast and under coverts of the wings are white the former marked with rusty colored streaks the latter with bars of the same color the greater quills are black the secondaries and lesser quills ashcolored on the latter in some birds a spot of black in the middle of each feather forms a bar across the wing the two middle feathers of the tail are gray the three next are marked on their inner webs with dusky bars the two outermost are marked with alternate bars of white and rust color the legs are long and slender and of a yellow color these birds vary much of several which we have been favored with from john silvertop esquire some were perfectly white on the under parts and of a larger size than common  we suppose the difference arises from the age of the bird it has been supposed that this and the following are male and female but the repeated instances of henharriers of both sexes having been seen leaves it beyond all doubt that they constitute two distinct species   the henharrier feeds on birds lizards and other reptiles it breeds annually on cheviot and on the shady precipices under the roman wall by craglake walliss natural history of northumberland it flies low skimming along the surface of the ground in search of its prey the female makes her nest on the ground and lays four eggs of a reddish color with a few white

 falco tinnunculus lin  la cresserelle buff the male of this species differs so much from the female and is so rarely seen that we have given a figure of it from one we had in our possession its length is fourteen inches breadth two feet three inches its bill is blue cere and eyelids yellow eyes black the forehead dull yellow the top of the head back part of the neck and sides as far as the points of the wings are of a lead color faintly streaked with black the cheeks are paler from the corner of the mouth on each side there is a dark streak pointing downwards the back and coverts of the wings are of a bright vinous color spotted with black quill feathers dusky with light edges all the under part of the body is of a pale rust color streaked and spotted with black thighs plain the tail feathers are of a fine blue gray with black shafts toward the end there is a broad black bar both on the upper and under sides the tips are white the legs are yellow and the claws black  the female kestrel this beautiful bird is distinguished from every other hawk by its variegated plumage its bill is blue cere and feet yellow eyes dark colored surrounded with a yellow skin its head is rust colored streaked with black behind each eye there is a bright spot the back and wing coverts are elegantly marked with numerous undulated bars of black the breast belly and thighs are of a pale reddish color with dusky streaks pointing downwards vent plain the tail is marked by a pretty broad black bar near the end a number of smaller ones of the same color occupying the remaining part the tip is pale  the kestrel is widely diffused throughout europe and is found in the more temperate parts of north america it is a handsome bird its sight is acute and its flight easy and graceful it breeds in the hollows of trees and in the holes of rocks towers and ruined buildings it lays four or five eggs of a pale reddish color its food consists of small birds field mice and reptiles after it has secured its prey it plucks the feathers very dexterously from the birds but swallows the mice entire and discharges the hair at the bill in the form of round balls this bird is frequently seen hovering in the air and fanning with its wings by a gentle motion or wheeling slowly round at the same time watching for its prey on which it shoots like an arrow it was formerly used in great britain for catching small birds and young partridges    the hobby  falco subbuteo lin  le hobreau buff the length of the male is twelve inches breadth about two feet the bill is blue cere and orbits of the eyes yellow the irides orange over each eye there is a light colored streak the top of the head coverts of the wings and back are of a dark brown in some edged with rust color the hind part of the neck is marked with two pale yellow spots a black mark extends from behind each eye forming almost a crescent and extending downwards on the neck the breast and belly are pale marked with dusky streaks the thighs rusty with long dusky streaks the wings brown the two middle feathers of the tail are of a deep dove color the others are barred with rusty and tipped with white the female is much larger and the spots on her breast more conspicuous than those of the male the legs and feet are yellow  the hobby breads with us but is said to emigrate in october it was formerly used in falconry chiefly for larks and other small birds the mode of catching them was singular when the hawk was cast off the larks fixed to the ground through fear became an easy prey to the fowler by drawing a net over them buffon says that it was used in hunting partridges and quails    the merlin  falco aesalon lin  lemerillon buff the merlin is the smallest of all the hawk kind scarcely exceeding the size of a blackbird its bill is blue cere yellow irides very dark the head is rust color streaked with black back and wings of a dark blueish ash color streaked and spotted with rust color quill feathers dark marked with reddish spots the breast and belly are of a yellowish white with streaks of brown pointing downwards the tail is long and marked with alternate dusky and reddish bars the wings when closed do not reach quite to the end of the tail the legs are yellow claws black  the merlin though small is not inferior in courage to any of the falcon tribe it was used for taking larks partridges and quails which it would frequently kill by one blow striking them on the breast head and neck buffon observes that this bird differs from the falcons and all the rapacious kind in the male and female being of the same size the merlin does not breed here but visits us in october it flies low and with great celerity and ease it preys on small birds and breeds in woods laying five or six eggs    of the owl the owl is distinguished among birds of the rapacious kind by peculiar and striking characters its outward appearance is not more singular than are its habits and dispositions unable to bear the brighter light of the sun the owl retires to some obscure retreat where it passes the day in silence and obscurity but at the approach of evening when all nature is desirous of repose and the smaller animals which are its principal food are seeking their nestling places the owl comes forth from its lurking holes in quest of its prey its eyes are admirably adapted for this purpose being so formed as to distinguish objects with greater facility in the dusk than in broad daylight its flight is rapid and silent during its nocturnal excursions and it is then known only by its frightful and reiterated cries with which it interrupts the silence of the night during the day the owl is seldom seen but if forced from his retreat his flight is broken and interrupted and he is sometimes attended by numbers of small birds of various kinds who seeing his embarrassment pursue him with incessant cries and torment him with their movements the jay the thrush the blackbird the redbreast and the titmouse all assemble to hurry and perplex him during all this the owl remains perched upon the branches of a tree and answers them only with awkward and insignificant gestures turning its head its eyes and its body with all the appearance of mockery and affectation all the species of owls however are not alike dazzled and confused with the light of the sun some of them being able to fly and see distinctly in open day  nocturnal birds of prey are generally divided into two kinds  those which have horns or ears and those which are earless or without horns these horns consist of small tufts of feathers standing up like ears on each side of the head which may be erected or depressed at the pleasure of the animal and in all probability are of use in directing the organs of hearing which are very large to their proper object both kinds agree in having their eyes so formed as to be able to pursue their prey with much less light than other birds the general character of the owl is as follows the eyes are large and are surrounded with a radiated circle of feathers of which the eye itself is the center the beak and talons are strong and crooked the body very short but thick and well covered with a coat of the softest and most delicate plumage the external edges of the outer quill feathers in general are serrated or finely toothed which adds greatly to the smoothness and silence of its flight  we shall now proceed to mention those particular species which are found in this country and shall begin with the largest of them  the greateared owl  strix bubo lin  le grand duc buff this bird is not much inferior in size to an eagle its head is very large and is adorned with two tufts more than two inches long which stand just above each eye its bill is strong and much hooked its eyes large and of a bright yellow the whole plumage is of a rusty brown finely variegated with black and yellow lines spots and specks its belly is ribbed with bars of a brown color confusedly intermixed its tail short marked with dusky bars its legs are strong and covered to the claws with a thick close down of a rust color its claws are large much hooked and of a dusky color its nest is large being nearly three feet in diameter it is composed of sticks bound together by fibrous roots and lined with leaves it generally lays two eggs somewhat larger than those of a hen and variegated like the bird itself the young ones are very voracious and are well supplied with various kinds of food by the parents this bird has been found though rarely in great britain it builds its nest in the caverns of rocks in mountainous and almost inaccessible places and is seldom seen in the plain or perched on trees it feeds on young hares rabbits rats mice and reptiles of various kinds  the longeared owl horn owl  strix otus lin  le hibou buff its length is fourteen inches breadth somewhat more than three feet its bill is black irides of a bright yellow the radiated circle round each eye is of a light cream color in some parts tinged with red between the bill and the eye there is a circular streak of a dark brown color another circle of a dark rusty brown entirely surrounds the face its horns or ears consist of six feathers closely laid together of a dark brown color tipped and edged with yellow the upper part of the body is beautifully penciled with fine streaks of white rusty and brown the breast and neck are yellow finely marked with dusky streaks pointing downwards the belly thighs and vent feathers are of a light cream color upon each wing there are four or five large white spots the quill and tail feathers are marked with dusky and reddish bars the legs are feathered down to the claws which are very sharp the outer claw is moveable and may be turned backwards  this bird is common in various parts of europe as well as in this country its usual haunts are in old ruined buildings in rocks and in hollow trees m buffon observes that it seldom constructs a nest of its own but not unfrequently occupies that of the magpie it lays four or five eggs the young are at first white but acquire their natural color in about fifteen days    the shorteared owl  strix brachyotos phil trans vol    p     length fourteen inches breadth three feet the head is small and hawklike bill dusky the eyes are of a bright yellow which when the pupil is contracted shine like gold the circle round each eye is of a dirty white with dark streaks pointing outward immediately round the eye there is a circle of black the two horns or ears in those we have examined consist of not more than three feathers of a pale brown or tawny color with a dark streak in the middle of each the whole upper part of the body is variously marked with dark brown and tawny the feathers being mostly edged with the latter the breast and belly are of a pale yellow marked with dark longitudinal streaks which are most numerous on the breast the legs and feet are covered with feathers of a pale yellow color the claws are much hooked and black the wings are long and extend beyond the tail the quills are marked with alternate bars of a dusky and pale brown the tail is likewise marked with bars of the same color the middle feathers of which are distinguished by a dark spot in the center of the yellow space the tip is white of several of these birds both male and female which we have been favored with by our friends we have observed that both had the upright tufts or ears in one of these which was alive in our possession they were very conspicuous and appeared more erect while the bird remained undisturbed but when frightened were scarcely to be seen  in the dead birds they were hardly discernible  mr pennant seems to be the first describer of this rare and beautiful bird which he supposes to be a bird of passage as it only visits us the latter end of the year and returns in the spring to the places of its summer residence it is found chiefly in wooded or mountainous countries its food is principally field mice of which it is very fond  the female horned owl this bird was somewhat larger than the former the colors and marks were the same but much darker and the spots on the breast larger and more numerous the ears were not discernible being a dead bird and having not seen any other at the time it was in our possession we supposed it to be a distinct kind  but having since seen several both males and females we are convinced of our mistake  the white owl barn owl church owl gillihowlet or screechowl  strix flammea lin  leffraie ou la fresaie buff length fourteen inches bill pale horn color eyes dark the radiated circle round the eye is composed of feathers of the most delicate softness and perfectly white the head back and wings are of a pale chestnut beautifully powdered with very fine gray and brown spots intermixed with white the breast belly and thighs are white on the former are a few dark spots the legs are feathered down to the toes which are covered with short hairs the wings extend beyond the tail which is short and marked with alternate bars of dusky and white the claws are white birds of this kind vary considerably of several which we have had in our possession the differences were very conspicuous the colors being more or less faint according to the age of the bird the breast in some was white without spots  in others pale yellow the white owl is well known and is often seen in the most populous towns frequenting churches old houses maltings and other uninhabited buildings where it continues during the day and leaves its haunts in the evening in quest of its prey its flight is accompanied with loud and frightful cries from whence it is denominated the screech owl during its repose it makes a blowing noise resembling the snoring of a man it makes no nest but deposits its eggs in the holes of walls and lays five or six of a whitish color it feeds on mice and small birds which it swallows whole and afterward emits the bones feathers and other indigestible parts at its mouth in the form of small round cakes which are often found in the empty buildings which it frequents  the tawny owl common brown ivy owl or howlet  strix stridula lin  le chathuant buff is about the size of the last its bill is white eyes dark blue the radiated feathers round the eyes are white finely streaked with brown the head neck back wing coverts and scapulars are of a tawny brown color finely powdered and spotted with dark brown and black on the wing coverts and scapulars are several large white spots regularly placed so as to form three rows the quill feathers are marked with alternate bars of light and dark brown the breast and belly are of a pale yellow marked with narrow dark streaks pointing downwards and crossed with others of the same color the legs are feathered down to the toes the claws are large much hooked and white this species is found in various parts of europe it frequents woods and builds its nest in the hollows of trees  the little owl  strix passerina lin  la cheveche ou petite chouette buff this is the smallest of the owl kind being not larger than a blackbird its bill is brown at the base and of a yellow color at the tip eyes pale yellow the circular feathers on the face are white tipped with black the upper part of the body is of an olive brown color the top of the head and wing coverts are spotted with white the breast and belly white spotted with brown the feathers of the tail are barred with rust color and brown and tipped with white the legs are covered with down of a rusty color mixed with white the toes and claws are of a brownish color it frequents rocks caverns and ruined buildings and builds its nest which is constructed in the rudest manner in the most retired places it lays five eggs spotted with white and yellow it sees better in the daytime than other nocturnal birds and gives chase to swallows and other small birds on the wing it likewise feeds on mice which it tears in pieces with its bill and claws and swallows them by morsels it is said to pluck the birds which it kills before it eats them in which it differs from all the other owls it is rarely met with in england it is sometimes found in yorkshire flintshire and in the neighborhood of london    of the shrike the last class we shall mention of birds of the rapacious kind is that of the shrike which as m buffon observes though they are small and of a delicate form yet their courage their appetite for blood and their hooked bill entitle them to be ranked with the boldest and the most sanguinary of the rapacious tribe this genus has been variously placed in the systems of naturalists sometimes it has been classed with the falcons sometimes with the pies and has even been ranked with the harmless and inoffensive tribes of the passerine kind to which indeed in outward appearance at least it bears no small resemblance conformable however to the latest arrangements we have placed it in the rear of those birds which live by rapine and plunder and like most of the connecting links in the great chain of nature it will be found to possess a middle quality partaking of those which are placed on each side of it and making thereby an easy transition from the one to the other  the shrike genus is distinguished by the following characteristics the bill is strong straight at the base and hooked or bent toward the end the upper mandible is notched near the tip and the base is furnished with bristles it has no cere the tongue is divided at the end the outer toe is connected to the middle one as far as the first joint to these exterior marks we may add that it possesses the most undaunted courage and will attack birds much larger and stronger than itself such as the crow the magpie and most of the smaller kinds of hawks if any of these should fly near the place of its retreat the shrike darts upon them with loud cries attacks the invader and drives it from its nest the parent birds will sometimes join on such occasions and there are few birds that will venture to abide the contest shrikes will chase all the small birds upon the wing and sometimes will venture to attack partridges and even young hares thrushes blackbirds and such like are their common prey they fix on them with their talons split the skull with their bill and feed on them at leisure  there are three kinds found in this kingdom of which the following is the largest    great ashcolored shrike murdering pie or great butcher bird  lanius excubitor lin  la piegriesche grise buff the length about ten inches its bill is black and furnished with bristles at the base the upper parts of its plumage are of a pale blue ash color the under parts white a black stripe passes through each eye the greater quills are black with a large white spot at the base forming a bar of that color across the wing the lesser quills are white at the top the scapulars are white the two middle feathers of the tail are black the next on each side are white at the ends which gradually increases to the outermost which are nearly white the whole when the tail is spread forms a large oval spot of black the legs are black the female differs little from the male it lays six eggs of a dull olive green spotted at the end with black our figure and description were taken from a very fine specimen sent us by lieut h f gibson of the  th dragoons it is rarely found in the cultivated parts of the country preferring the mountainous wilds among furz and thorny thickets for its residence m buffon says it is common in france where it continues all the year it is met with likewise in russia and various parts of europe it preys on small birds which it seizes by the throat and after strangling fixes them on a sharp thorn and tears them in pieces with its bill mr pennant observes that when kept in the cage it sticks its food against the wires before it will eat it it is said to imitate the notes of the smaller singing birds thereby drawing them near its haunts in order more securely to seize them    the redbacked shrike lesser butcher bird or flusher  lanius collurio lin  lecorcheur buff is somewhat less than the last being little more than seven inches long its bill is black irides hazel the head and lower part of the back are of a light gray color the upper part of the back and coverts of the wings are of a bright rusty red the breast belly and sides of a fine pale rose or bloom color the throat is white a stroke of black passes from the bill through each eye the two middle feathers of the tail are black the others are white at the base the quills are of a brown color the legs black  the female is somewhat larger than the male the head is of a rust color mixed with gray the breast belly and sides of a dirty white the tail deep brown the exterior web of the outer feathers white it builds its nest in hedges or low bushes and lays six white eggs marked with a reddish brown circle toward the larger end its manners are similar to the last it frequently preys on young birds which it takes in the nest it likewise feeds on grasshoppers beetles and other insects like the last it imitates the notes of other birds in order the more surely to decoy them  when sitting on the nest the female soon discovers herself at the approach of any person by her loud and violent outcries  the woodchat  la piegriesche rousse buff is said to equal the last in point of size its bill is horncoloured feathers round the base whitish head and hind part of the neck bright bay from the base of the bill a black streak passes through each eye inclining downwards on the neck back dusky under parts of a yellowish white quills black near the bottom of each a white spot the two middle feathers of the tail are black the outer edges and tips of the others are white the legs black the description of this bird seems to have been taken from a drawing by mr edwards in the sloanian museum and is not unlike the least butcher bird of that celebrated naturalist which it resembles in size and in the distribution of its colors m buffon supposes it may be a variety of the redbacked shrike as they both depart in september and return at the same time in the spring the manners of both are said to be the same and the difference of colors not very material the female is somewhat different the upper parts of the plumage being of a reddish color transversely streaked with brown the under parts of a dirty white marked in the same manner with brown the tail is of a reddish brown with a dusky mark near the end tipped with red    birds of the pie kind constitute the next order in the arrangement of the feathered part of the creation they consist of a numerous and irregular tribe widely differing from each other in their habits appetites and manners as well as in their form size and appearance in general they are noisy restless and loquacious and of all other kinds contribute the least toward supplying the necessities or the pleasures of man at the head of these we shall place the crow and its affinities well known by its sooty plumage and croaking note from every other tribe of the feathered race birds of this kind are found in every part of the known world from greenland to the cape of good hope and though generally disliked for their disgusting and indiscriminating voracity yet in many respects they may be said to be of singular benefit to mankind not only by devouring putrid flesh but principally by destroying great quantities of noxious insects worms and reptiles rooks in particular are fond of the erucae of the hedgechafer or chestnut brown beetle for which they search with indefatigable pains these insects appear in hot weather in formidable numbers disrobing the fields and trees of their verdure blossoms and fruit spreading desolation and destruction wherever they go  they appeared in great numbers in ireland during a hot summer and committed great ravages in the year      whole meadows and cornfieldsd were destroyed by them in suffolk  the decrease of rookeries in that county was thought to be the occasion of it the many rookeries with us is in some measure the reason why we have so few of these destructive animals  walliss history of northumberland they are often accused of feeding on the corn just after it has been sown and various contrivances have been made both to kill and frighten them away but in our estimation the advantages derived from the destruction which they make among grubs earthworms and noxious insects of various kinds will greatly overpay the injury done to the future harvest by the small quantity of corn they may destroy in searching after their favorite food in general they are sagacious active and faithful to each other they live in pairs and their mutual attachment is constant they are a clamourous race mostly build in trees and form a kind of society in which there appears something like a regular government a sentinel watches for the general safety and give notice on the appearance of danger on the approach of an enemy or a stranger they act in concert and drive him away with repeated attacks on these occasions they are as bold as they are artful and cunning in avoiding the smallest appearance of real danger of this the disappointed fowler has frequently occasion to take notice on seeing the birds fly away before he can draw near enough to shoot them from this circumstance it has been said that they discover their danger by the quickness of their scent which enables them to provide for their safety in time but of this we have our doubts and would rather ascribe it to the quickness of their sight by which they discover the motions of the sportsman  the general characters of this kind are well known and are chiefly as follow  the bill is strong and has a slight curvature along the top of the upper mandible the edges are thin and sharp or cultrated in many of the species there is a small notch near the tip the nostrils are covered with bristles tongue divided at the end three toes forward one behind the middle toe connected to the outer as far as the first joint    the raven great corbie crow  corvus corax lin  le corbeau buff is the largest of this kind its length is above two feet breadth four its bill is strong and very thick at the base it measures somewhat more than two inches and a half in length and is covered with strong hairs or bristles which extend above half its length covering the nostrils the general color of the upper parts is of a fine glossy black reflecting a blue tint in particular lights the under parts are duller and of a dusky hue  the raven is well known in all parts of the world and in times of ignorance and superstition was considered as ominous foretelling future events by its horrid croakings and announcing impending calamities in these times the raven was considered as a bird of vast importance and the various changes and modulations of its voice were studied with the most careful attention and were made use of by artful and designing men to mislead the ignorant and unwary it is a very longlived bird and is supposed sometimes to live a century or more it is fond of carrion which it scents at a great distance it is said that it will destroy rabbits young ducks and chickens it has been known to seize on young lambs which have been dropped in a weak state and pick out their eyes while yet alive it will suck the eggs of other birds it feeds also on earthworms reptiles and even shellfish when urged by hunger it may be rendered very tame and familiar and has been frequently taught to pronounce a variety of words it is a crafty bird and will frequently pick up things of value such as rings money etc and carry them to its hiding place it makes its nest early in the spring and builds in trees and the holes of rocks laying five or six eggs of a pale blueish green color spotted with brown the female sits about twenty days and is constantly attended by the male who not only provides her with abundance of food but relieves her by turns and takes her place in the nest  the natives of greenland eat the flesh and make a covering for themselves with the skins of these birds which they wear next their bodies  the carrion crow midden crow or blacknebbed crow  corvus corone lin  la corneille buff is less than the raven but similar to it in its habits color and external appearance it is about eighteen inches in length its breadth above two feet birds of this kind are more numerous and as widely spread as the raven they live mostly in woods and build their nests on trees the female lays five or six eggs much like those of a raven they feed on putrid flesh of all sorts likewise on eggs worms insects and various sorts of grain they live together in pairs and remain with us during the whole year    the hooded crow royston crow  corvus cornix lin  le corneille mantelee buff is somewhat larger and more bulky than the rook measuring twentytwo inches in length and twentythree in breadth its bill is black and two inches long the head forepart of the neck wings and tail are black the back and all the under parts are of a pale ash color the legs black this bird arrives with the woodcock and on its first coming frequents the shores of rivers and departs in the spring to breed in other countries but it is said that they do not entirely leave us as they have been seen during the summer months in the northern parts of our island where they frequent the mountainous parts of the country and breed in the pines in more northern parts it continues the whole year and subsists on seaworms shellfish and other marine productions with us it is seen to mix with the rook and feeds in the same manner with it during the breeding season they live in pairs lay six eggs and are said to be much attached to their offspring    the rook  corvus frugilegus lin  le freux buff this bird is about the size of the carrion crow and excepting its more glossy plumage very much resembles it the base of the bill nostrils and even round the eyes are covered with a rough scabrous skin in which it differs from all the rest occasioned it is said by thrusting its bill into the earth in search of worms but as the same appearance has been observed in such as have been brought up tame and unaccustomed to that mode of subsistence we are inclined to consider it as an original peculiarity we have already had occasion to observe that they are useful in preventing a too great increase of that destructive insect the chafer or dorbeetle and by that means make large recompense for the depredations they may occasionally make on the corn fields rooks are gregarious and fly in immense flocks at morning and evening to and from their roosting places in quest of food during the breeding time they live together in large societies and build their nests on trees close to each other frequently in the midst of large and populous towns these rookeries however are often the scenes of bitter contests the new comers being frequently driven away by the old inhabitants their halfbuilt nests torn in pieces and the unfortunate couple forced to begin their work anew in some more undisturbed situation  of this we had a remarkable instance in newcastle in the year      a pair of rooks after an unsuccessful attempt to establish themselves in a rookery at no great distance from the exchange were compelled to abandon the attempt and take refuge on the spire of that building and although constantly interrupted by other rooks they built their nest on the top of the vane and brought forth their young undisturbed by the noise of the populace below them the nest and its inhabitants were consequently turned about by every change of the wind they returned and built their nest every year on the same place till      after which the spire was taken down  the jackdaw  corvus monedula lin  le choucas buff this bird is considerably less than the rook being only thirteen inches in length its bill is black eyes white the hind part of the head and neck are of a hoary gray color the rest of the plumage is of a fine glossy black above beneath it has a dusky hue the legs are black  the daw is very common in england and remains with us the whole year in other countries as in france and various parts of germany it is migratory they frequent churches old towers and ruins in great flocks where they build their nests the female lays five or six eggs paler than those of the crow and smaller they rarely build in trees  in hampshire they sometimes breed in the rabbit burrows whites natural history of selborne they are easily tamed and may be taught to pronounce several words they will conceal part of their food and with it small pieces of money or toys they feed on insects grain fruit and small pieces of meat and are said to be fond of partridge eggs there is a variety of the daw found in switzerland having a white collar round its neck in norway and other cold countries they have been seen perfectly white    the magpie pianet  corvus pica lin  la pie buff its length is about eighteen inches bill strong and black eyes hazel the head neck and breast are of a deep black which is finely contrasted with the snowy whiteness of the breast and scapulars the neck feathers are very long extending down the back leaving only a small space of a greyish ash color between them and the tail coverts which are black the plumage in general is glossed with green purple and blue which catch the eye in different lights its tail is very long and wedgeshaped the under tail coverts thighs and legs are black on the throat and part of the neck there is a kind of feathers mixed with the others resembling strong whitish hairs this beautiful bird is every where very common in england it is likewise found in various parts of the continent but not so far north as lapland nor farther south than italy it is met with in america but not commonly and is migratory there it feeds like the crow on almost every thing animal as well as vegetable the female builds her nest with great art leaving a hole in the side for her admittance and covering the whole upper part with a texture of thorny branches closely entangled thereby securing her retreat from the rude attacks of other birds but it is not safety alone she consults the inside is furnished with a sort of mattrass composed of wool and other soft materials on which her young repose she lays seven or eight eggs of a pale green color spotted with black  the magpie is crafty and familiar and may be taught to pronounce words and even short sentences and will imitate any particular noise which it hears it is addicted like other birds of its kind to stealing and will hoard up its provisions it is smaller than the jackdaw and its wings are shorter in proportion accordingly its flight is not so lofty nor so well supported it never undertakes distant journies but flies only from tree to tree at moderate distances  the redlegged crow cornish chough  corvus graculus lin  le coracias buff this bird is about the size of the jackdaw the bill is long much curved sharp at the tip and of a bright red color the iris of the eye is composed of two circles the outer one red the inner light blue the eyelids are red the plumage is altogether of a purplish violet black the legs are as red as the bill the claws are large much hooked and black  buffon describes this bird as of an elegant figure lively restless and turbulent but it may be tamed to a certain degree it builds on high cliffs by the sea side and chiefly frequents the coasts of devonshire and cornwall and likewise many parts of wales a few are found on the dover cliffs and some in scotland the female lays four or five white eggs spotted with yellow it is a voracious bold and greedy bird and feeds on insects and berries it is said to be particularly fond of the juniper berry its manners are like those of a jackdaw it is attracted by glittering objects buffon says that it has been known to pull from the fire lighted pieces of wood to the no small danger of the house    the nutcracker  corvus caryocatacles lin  le casse noix buff the length of this bird is thirteen inches the bill is about two inches long and black the eyes hazel the upper part of the head and back part of the neck are black its general color is that of a dusky brown covered with triangular spots of white the wings are black greater wing coverts tipped with white the tail is white at the tip the rest black rump white legs and claws black  there are very few instances known of this bird having been seen in england it is common in germany is found also in sweden and denmark and frequents the most mountainous parts of those countries it makes its nest in holes of trees and feeds on nuts acorns and the kernels of the pine apple it is said to pierce the bark of trees with its bill like the woodpecker our drawing was made from a stuffed specimen in the museum of george allan esquire  the jay  corvus glandarius lin  le geai buff this most beautiful bird is not more than thirteen inches in length its bill is black eyes white the feathers on the forehead are white streaked with black and form a tuft on its forehead which it can erect at pleasure the chin is white and from the corners of the bill on each side proceeds a broad streak of black which passes under the eye the hinder part of the head neck and back are of a light cinnamon color the breast is of the same color but lighter

bases of some of them white lesser quills black those next the body chestnut the rump is white tail black with pale brown edges legs dirty pale brown  the jay is a very common bird in great britain and is found in various parts of europe it is distinguished as well for the beautiful arrangement of its colors as for its harsh grating voice and restless disposition upon seeing the sportsman it gives by its cries the alarm of danger and thereby defeats his aim and disappoints him  the jay builds in woods and makes an artless nest composed of sticks fibers and tender twigs the female lays five or six eggs of a greyish ash color mixed with green and faintly spotted with brown mr pennant observes that the young ones continue with their parents till the following spring when they separate to form new pairs birds of this species live on acorns nuts seeds and various kinds of fruits they will eat eggs and sometimes destroy young birds in the absence of the old ones when kept in a domestic state they may be rendered very familiar and will imitate a variety of words and sounds we have heard one imitate so exactly the sound made by the action of a saw that though it was on a sunday we could hardly be persuaded but that the person who kept it had a carpenter at work in the house  a jay kept by a person we were acquainted with at the approach of cattle had learned to hound a cur dog upon them by whistling and calling upon him by his name at last during a severe frost the dog was by that means excited to attack a cow big with calf when the poor animal fell on the ice and was much hurt the jay being complained of as a nuisance its owner was obliged to destroy it    the chatterer silk tail or waxen chatterer  ampelis garrulus lin  le jaseur de boheme buff this beautiful bird is about eight inches in length its bill is black and has a small notch at the end its eyes which are black and shining are placed in a band of black which passes from the base of the bill to the hind part of the head its throat is black the feathers on the head are long forming a crest all the upper parts of the body are of a reddish ash color the breast and belly inclining to purple vent and upper tail coverts nearly white the tail feathers are black tipped with pale yellow the quills are black the third and fourth tipped on their outer edges with white the five following with straw color the secondaries with white each being tipped or pointed with a flat horny substance of a bright vermillion color these appendages vary in different subjects  in one of those we had in our possession we counted eight on one wing and six on the other the legs are short and black it is said the female is not distinguished by the little red waxen appendages at the ends of the second quills but this we are not able to determine from our own observations  this rare bird visits us only at uncertain intervals in the year    0 and      several of them were taken in northumberland and durham as early as the month of november since that time we have not heard of any being seen here the summer residence of these birds is supposed to be the northern parts of europe within the arctic circle from whence they spread themselves into other countries where they remain during winter and return in the spring to their usual haunts the general food of this bird is berries of various kinds in some countries it is said to be extremely fond of grapes one which we saw in a state of captivity was fed chiefly with quickentree berries but from the difficulty of providing it with a sufficient supply of its natural food it soon died this is the only bird of its kind found in europe all the rest are natives of america  the roller  coracias garrula lin  le rollier deurope buff this rare bird is distinguished by a plumage of most exquisite beauty it vies with the parrot in an assemblage of the finest shades of blue and green mixed with white and heightened by the contrast of graver colors from whence perhaps it has been called the german parrot although in every other respect it differs from that bird and rather seems to claim affinity with the crow kind to which we have made it an appendage in size it resembles the jay being somewhat more than twelve inches in length its bill is black beset with short bristles at the base the eyes are surrounded with a ring of naked skin of a yellow color and behind them there is a kind of wart the head neck breast and belly are of a light pea green the back and scapulars reddish brown the points of the wings and upper coverts are of a rich deep blue the greater coverts pale green the quills are of a dusky hue inclining to black and mixed with deep blue the rump is blue the tail is somewhat forked the lower part of the feathers are of a dusky green middle part pale blue tips black the legs are short and of a dull yellow  this is the only one of its kind found in europe it is very common in some parts of germany but is so rare in this country as hardly to deserve the name of a british bird the author of the british zoology mentions two that were shot in england and these we may suppose have been only stragglers our drawing was made from a stuffed specimen in the museum of the late mr tunstall at wycliffe  the roller is wilder than the jay and frequents the thickest woods it builds its nest chiefly on birch trees buffon says it is a bird of passage and migrates in the months of may and september in those countries where it is common it is said to fly in large flocks in the autumn and is frequently seen in cultivated grounds with rooks and other birds searching for worms small seeds roots etc it likewise feeds on berries caterpillars and insects and is said in cases of necessity to eat young frogs and even carrion the female is described by aldrovandus as differing very much from the male its bill is thicker and its head neck breast and belly are of a chestnut color bordering on a greyish ash the young ones do not attain their brilliant colors till the second year  this bird is remarkable for making a chattering kind of noise from whence it has obtained the name of garrulus    the starling stare  sturnus vulgaris lin  letourneau buff the length of this bird is somewhat less than nine inches the bill is strait sharppointed and of a yellowish brown  in old birds deep yellow the nostrils are surrounded by a prominent rim the eyes are brown the whole plumage is dark glossed with blue purple and copper each feather being marked at the end with a pale yellow spot which is smaller and more numerous on the head and neck the wing coverts are edged with yellowish brown the quill and tail feathers dusky with light edges the legs are of a reddish brown  from the striking similarity both in form and manners observable in this bird and those more immediately preceding we have no scruple in removing it from its usual place as it evidently forms a connecting link between them and in a variety of points seems equally allied to both  few birds are more generally known than the stare being an inhabitant of almost every climate and as it is a familiar bird and easily trained in a state of captivity its habits have been more frequently observed than those of most other birds the female makes an artless nest in the hollows of trees rocks or old walls and sometimes in cliffs overhanging the sea she lays four or five eggs of a pale greenish ash color the young birds are of a dusky brown color till the first moult in the winter season these birds fly in vast flocks and may be known at a great distance by their whirling mode of flight which buffon compares to a sort of vortex in which the collective body performs an uniform circular revolution and at the same time continues to make a progressive advance the evening is the time when the stares assemble in the greatest numbers and betake themselves to the sens and marshes where they roost among the reeds they chatter much in the evening and morning both when they assemble and disperse so attached are they to society that they not only join those of their own species but also birds of a different kind and are frequently seen in company with redwings fieldfares and even with crows jackdaws and pigeons their principal food consists of worms snails and caterpillars they likewise eat various kinds of grain seeds and berries and are said to be particularly fond of cherries in a confined state they eat small pieces of raw flesh bread soaked in water etc the starling is very docile and may easily be taught to repeat short phrases or whistle tunes with great exactness and in this state acquires a warbling superior to its native song    the rose colored ouzel  turdus roseus lin  le merle couleur de rose buff is the size of a starling its bill is of a carnation color blackish at the base irides pale the feathers on the head are long forming a crest the head neck wings and tail are black glossed with shades of blue purple and green its back rump breast belly and lesser wing coverts pale rose color marked with a few irregular dark spots legs pale red claws brown  this bird has been so rarely met with in england that it will scarcely be admitted amongst such as are purely british there are however a few instances of its being found here and although not a resident it sometimes visits us on which account it must not be passed over unnoticed it is found in various parts of europe and asia and in most places is migratory it seems to delight most in the warmer climates it is fond of locusts and frequents the places where those destructive insects abound in great numbers on which account it is said to be held sacred by the inhabitants    the ring ouzel  turdus torquatus lin  le merle a plastron blanc buff this bird very much resembles the blackbird its general color is of a dull black or dusky hue each feather being margined with a greyish ash color the bill is dusky corners of the mouth and inside yellow eyes hazel its breast is distinguished by a crescent of pure white which almost surrounds the neck and from whence it derives its name its legs are of a dusky brown the female differs in having the crescent on the breast much less conspicuous and in some birds wholly wanting which has occasioned some authors to consider it as a different species under the name of the rock ouzel  ring ouzels are found in various parts of this kingdom chiefly in the wilder and more mountainous parts of the country its habits are similar to those of the blackbird the female builds her nest in the same manner and in similar situations and lays four or five eggs of the same color they feed on insects and berries of various kinds are fond of grapes and buffon observes during the season of vintage are generally fat and at that time are esteemed delicious eating the same author says that in france they are migratory and in some parts of this kingdom they have been observed to change places particularly in hampshire where they are known generally to stay not more than a fortnight at one time our representation was taken from one killed near bedlington in northumberland    the black ouzel blackbird turdus merula lin  le merle buff the length of the blackbird is generally about ten inches its plumage is altogether black the bill inside of the mouth and edges of the eyelids are yellow as are also the soles of the feet the legs are of a dirty yellow the female is mostly brown inclining to rust color on the breast and belly the bill is dusky and the legs brown its song is also very different so that it has sometimes been mistaken for a bird of a different species  male blackbirds during the first year resemble the females so much as not easily to be distinguished from them but after that they assume the yellow bill and other distinguishing marks of their kind the blackbird is a solitary bird frequenting woods and thickets chiefly of evergreens such as pines firs etc especially where there are perennial springs which afford it both shelter and subsistence wild blackbirds feed on berries fruits insects and worms they never fly in flocks like thrushes they pair early and begin to warble sooner than any other of the songsters of the grove the female builds her nest in bushes or low trees and lays four or five eggs of a blueish green color marked irregularly with dusky spots the young birds are easily brought up tame and may be taught to whistle a variety of tunes for which their clear loud and spirited tones are well adapted they are restless and timorous birds easily alarmed and difficult of access but buffon observes that they are more restless than cunning and more timorous than suspicious as they readily suffer themselves to be caught with birdlime nooses and all sorts of snares they are never kept in aviaries for when shut up with other birds they pursue and harass their companions in slavery unceasingly for which reason they are generally confined in cages apart in some counties of england this bird is called the ouzel  missel thrush missel bird or shrite  turdus viscivorus lin  la draine buff the length of this bird is about eleven inches the bill is dusky the base of the lower bill yellow the eyes hazel the head back and lesser coverts of the wings are of a deep olive brown the latter tipped with white the lower part of the back and rump tinged with yellow the cheeks are of a yellowish white spotted with brown as are also the breast and belly which are marked with larger spots of a dark brown color the quills are brown with pale edges tail feathers the same the three outermost tipped with white the legs are yellow claws black the female builds her nest in bushes or low trees and lays four or five eggs of a dirty flesh color marked with blood red spots its nest is made of moss leaves etc lined with dry grass strengthened on the outside with small twigs it begins to sing very early often on the turn of the year in blowing showery weather from whence in some places it is called the stormcock its note of anger is very loud and harsh between a chatter and a shriek which accounts for some of its names it feeds on various kinds of berries particularly those of the misletoe of which birdlime is made it was formerly believed that the the plant of that name was only propagated by the seed which passed the digestive organs of this bird from whence arose the proverb  turdus malum sibi cacat it likewise feeds on caterpillars and various kinds of insects with which it also feeds its young this bird is found in various parts of europe and is said to be migratory in some places but continues in england the whole year and frequently has two broods    the fieldfare  turdus pilaris lin  la litorne ou tourdelle buff this is somewhat less than the missel thrush its length ten inches the bill is yellow each corner of the mouth is furnished with a few black bristly hairs the eye is light brown the top of the head and back part of the neck are of a light ash color the former spotted with black the back and coverts of the wings are of a deep hoary brown the rump ashcolored the throat and breast are yellow regularly spotted with black the belly and thighs of a yellowish white the tail brown inclining to black legs dusky yellowish brown in young birds yellow  the fieldfare is only a visitant in this island making its appearance about the beginning of october in order to avoid the rigorous winters of the north from whence it sometimes comes in great flocks according to the severity of the season and leaves us about the latter end of february or the beginning of march and retires to russia sweden norway and as far as siberia and kamschatka buffon observes that they do not arrive in france till the beginning of december that they assemble in flocks of two or three thousand and feed on ripe cervices of which they are extremely fond during the winter they feed on haws and other berries they likewise eat worms snails and slugs  fieldfares seem of a more social disposition than the throstles or the missels they are sometimes seen singly but in general form very numerous flocks and fly in a body and though they often spread themselves through the meadows in search of food they seldom lose sight of each other but when alarmed fly off and collect together upon the same tree we have seen a variety of this bird of which the head and neck were of a yellowish white the rest of the body was nearly of the same color mixed with a few brown feathers the spots on the breast were faint and indistinct the quill feathers were perfectly white except one or two on each side which were brown the tail was marked in a similar manner  the throstle thrush or mavis turdus musicus lin  la grive buff this is larger than the redwing but much less than the missel to which it bears a strong resemblance both in form and colors a small notch is observable at the end of the bill which belongs to this and every bird of the thrush kind the throat is white and the spots on the breast more regularly formed than those of the missel thrush being of a conical shape the inside of the wings and the mouth are yellow as are also the legs the claws are strong and black  the throstle is distinguished among our singing birds by the clearness and fullness of its note it charms us not only with the sweetness but variety of its song which begins early in the spring and continues during part of the summer this bold and pleasing songster from his high station seems to command the concert of the grove whilst in the beautiful language of the poet the jay the rook the daw and each harsh pipe discordant heard alone aid the full concert while the stockdove breathes a melancholy murmur through the whole   the female builds her nest generally in bushes it is composed of dried grass with a little earth or clay intermixed and lined with rotten wood she lays five or six eggs of a pale blue color marked with dusky spots although this species is not considered as migratory with us it has nevertheless been observed in some places in great numbers during the spring and summer where not one was to be seen in the winter which has induced an opinion that they either shift their quarters entirely or take shelter in the more retired parts of the woods  that the throstle is migratory in france we have the authority of that nice observer of nature m de buffon who says that it appears in burgundy about the end of september before the redwing and fieldfare and that it feeds upon the ripe grapes and sometimes does much damage to the vineyard the females of all the thrush kind are very similar to the males and differ chiefly in a lesser degree of brilliancy in the colors  the redwing swinepipe or wind thrush turdus iliacus lin  le mauvis buff is not more than eight inches in length the bill is of a dark brown color eyes deep hazel the plumage in general is similar to that of the thrush but a white streak over the eye distinguishes it from that bird the belly is not quite so much spotted and the sides of the body and under the wings are tinged with red which is its peculiar characteristic from whence also it derives its name  these birds make their appearance a few days before the fieldfare a redwing was taken up november  th      at six oclock in the morning which on its approach to land had flown against the lighthouse at tynemouth and was so stunned that it fell to the ground and died soon after the light most probably had attracted its attention and are generally seen with them after their arrival they frequent the same places eat the same food and are very similar to them in manners like the fieldfare it leaves us in the spring for which reason its song is quite unknown to us but it is said to be very pleasing the female builds its nest in low bushes or hedges and lays six eggs of a greenish blue color spotted with black this and the former are delicate eating the romans held them in such estimation that they kept thousands of them together in aviaries and fed them with a sort of paste made of bruised figs and flour and various other kinds of food to improve the delicacy and flavor of their flesh these aviaries were so contrived as to admit light barely sufficient to direct them to their food every object which might tend to remind them of their former liberty was carefully kept out of sight such as the fields the woods the birds or whatever might disturb the repose necessary for their improvement under this management these birds fattened to the great profit of their proprietors who sold them to roman epicures for three denarii or about two shillings sterling each  the cuckoo the gowk  cuculus canorus lin  le coucou buff length fourteen inches breadth twentyfive its bill is black and somewhat bent eyes yellow inside of the mouth red its head neck back and wing coverts are of a pale blue or dove color which is darkest on the head and back and palest on the fore part of the neck and rump its breast and belly are white elegantly crossed with wavy bars of black the quill feathers are dusky their inner webs marked with large oval white spots the tail is long the two middle feathers are black with white tips the others dusky marked with alternate spots of white on each side the shaft the legs are short and of a yellow color toes two forward two backward claws white  the cuckoo visits us early in the spring  its wellknown cry is generally heard about the middle of april and ceases the latter end of june its stay is short the old cuckoos being said to quit this country early in july cuckoos never pair they build no nest and what is more extraordinary the female deposits her solitary egg in that of another bird by whom it is hatched the nest she chooses for this purpose is generally selected from the following viz the hedgesparrow the waterwagtail the titlark the yellowhammer the green linnet or the whinchat of these it has been observed that she shows a much greater partiality to the hedgesparrow than to any of the rest  we owe the following account of the economy of this singular bird in the disposal of its egg to the accurate observations of mr edward jenner communicated to the royal society and published in the   th volume of their transactions part ii he observes that during the time the hedgesparrow is laying her eggs which generally takes up four or five days the cuckoo contrives to deposit her egg among the rest leaving the future care of it entirely to the hedgesparrow this intrusion often occasions some discomposure for the old hedgesparrow at intervals whilst she is sitting not only throws out some of her own eggs but sometimes injures them in such a way that they become addle so that it frequently happens that not more than two or three of the parent birds eggs are hatched with that of the cuckoo and what is very remarkable it has never been observed that the hedgesparrow has either thrown out or injured the egg of the cuckoo when the hedgesparrow has sat her usual time and disengaged the young cuckoo and some of her own offspring from the shell her own young ones and any of her eggs that remain unhatched are soon turned out the young cuckoo remaining in full possession of the nest and the sole object of the future care of her foster parent the young birds are not previously killed nor the eggs demolished but all are left to perish together either entangled in the bush which contains the nest or lying on the ground under it mr jenner next proceeds to account for this seemingly unnatural circumstance and as what he has advanced is the result of his own repeated observations we shall give it nearly in his own words on the   th june      mr j examined the nest of a hedgesparrow which then contained a cuckoos and three hedgesparrows eggs on inspecting it the day following the bird had hatched but the nest then contained only a young cuckoo and one young hedgesparrow the nest was placed so near the extremity of a hedge that he could distinctly see what was going forward in it and to his great astonishment he saw the young cuckoo though so lately hatched in the act of turning out the young hedgesparrow the mode of accomplishing this was curious the little animal with the assistance of its rump and wings contrived to get the bird upon its back and making a lodgement for its burden by elevating its elbows clambered backwards with it up the side of the nest till it reached the top where resting for a moment it threw off its load with a jerk and quite disengaged it from the nest after remaining a short time in this situation and feeling about with the extremities of its wings as if to be convinced that the business was properly executed it dropped into the nest again mr j made several experiments in different nests by repeatedly putting in an egg to the young cuckoo which he always found to be disposed of in the same manner it is very remarkable that nature seems to have provided for the singular disposition of the cuckoo in its formation at this period for different from other newly hatched birds its back from the scapulae downwards is very broad with a considerable depression in the middle which seems intended by nature for the purpose of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the hedgesparrow or its young one while the young cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest when it is above twelve days old this cavity is quite filled up the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general and at that time the disposition for turning out its companion entirely ceases the smallness of the cuckoos egg which in general is less than that of the housesparrow the cuckoo eggs which have come under out observation were nearly of the size of those of the thrush is another circumstance to be attended to in this surprising transaction and seems to account for the parent cuckoos depositing it in the nests of such small birds only as have been mentioned if she were to do this in the nest of a bird which produced a larger egg and consequently a larger nestling its design would probably be frustrated the young cuckoo would be unequal to the task of becoming sole possessor of the nest and might fall a sacrifice to the superior strength of its partners  mr jenner observes that it sometimes happens that two cuckoos eggs are deposited in the same nest and gives the following instance of one which fell under his observation two cuckoos and a hedgesparrow were hatched in the same nest one hedgesparrows egg remaining unhatched in a few hours a contest began between the cuckoos for possession of the nest which continued undetermined till the afternoon of the following day when one of them which was somewhat superior in size turned out the other together with the young hedgesparrow and the unhatched egg this contest he adds was very remarkable the combatants alternately appeared to have the advantage as each carried the other several times nearly to the top of the nest and then sunk down again oppressed with the weight of its burden till at length after various efforts the strongest prevailed and was afterward brought up by the hedgesparrow it would carry us beyond the limits of our work to give a detail of the observations made by our ingenious inquirer we must therefore refer our reader to the work itself in which he will find a variety of matter entirely new respecting this singular bird whose history has for ages been enveloped in fable and mixed with unaccountable stories founded in ignorance and superstition at what period the young cuckoos leave this country is not precisely known mr jenner supposes they go off in succession and leave us as soon as they are capable of taking care of themselves that some of them remain here in a torpid state we have already had occasion to observe see the introduction but this cannot be the case with the greater part of those which leave this country and retire to milder climates to avoid the rigours of winter buffon mentions several instances of young cuckoos having been kept in cages which probably for want of proper nutriment did not survive the winter we knew of one which was preserved through the winter by being fed with worms insects soaked bread and small pieces of flesh the plumage of the cuckoo varies greatly at different periods of its life in young cuckoos the bill legs and tail are nearly the same as in the old ones the eye is blue the throat neck breast and belly are elegantly barred with a dark brown on a light ground the back is of a lead color mixed with brown and faintly barred with white the tail feathers are irregularly marked with black light brown and white and tipped with white its legs are yellow    the wryneck  jynx torquilla lin  le torcol buff the principal colors which distinguish this beautiful little bird consist of different shades of brown but so elegantly arranged as to form a picture of the most exquisite neatness from the back part of the head down to the middle of the back there runs an irregular line of dark brown inclining to black the rest of the back is ashcolored streaked and powdered with brown the throat and under side of the neck are of a reddish brown crossed with fine bars of black the breast belly and thighs are of a light ash color marked with triangular spots irregularly dispersed the larger quill feathers are marked on the outer webs with alternate spots of dark brown and rust color which when the wing is closed give it the appearance of chequered work the rest of the wing and scapulars are nicely freckled and shaded with brown spots of different sizes the tail feathers are marked with irregular bars of black the intervening spaces being finely freckled and powdered with dark brown spots its bill is rather long sharppointed and of a pale lead color its eyes are light brown but what chiefly distinguishes this singular bird is the structure of its tongue which is of considerable length of a cylindrical form and capable of being pushed forwards or drawn into its bill again it is furnished with a horny substance at its end with which it secures its prey and brings it to its mouth its legs are short and slender the toes placed two before and two behind the claws sharp much hooked and formed for climbing the branches of trees on which it can run in all directions with great facility it makes an artless nest of dry grass upon dusty rotten wood in holes of trees the entrance to which is so small as scarcely to admit the hand on which account its eggs are come at with difficulty according to buffon they are perfectly white and from eight to ten in number  this carious bird though similar in many respects to the woodpecker seems to constitute a genus of itself it is found in various parts of europe and generally appears with us a few days before the cuckoo its food consists chiefly of ants and other insects of which it finds great abundance lodged in the bark and crevices of trees the stomach of one which we opened was full of indigested parts of ants it is said to frequent the places where ant hills are into which it darts its tongue and draws out its prey though nearly related to the family of the woodpeckers in the formation of its bill and feet it never associates with them but seems to form a small and separate family the wryneck holds itself very erect on the branch of the tree where it sits its body is almost bent backward whilst it writhes its head and neck by a slow and almost involuntary motion not unlike the waving wreaths of a reptile it is a very solitary bird and leads a sequestered life it is never seen with any other society but that of its female and it is only transitory for as soon as the domestic union is dissolved which is in the month of september they retire and migrate by themselves    the woodpeckers of these only three or four kinds are found in these kingdoms their characters are striking and their manners singular the bill is large strong and fitted for its employment the end of it is formed like a wedge with which it pierces the bark of trees and bores into the wood in which its food is lodged its neck is short and thick and furnished with powerful muscles which enable it to strike with such force as to be heard at a considerable distance its tongue is long and taper at the end of it there is a hard bony substance which penetrates into the crevices of trees and extracts the insects and their eggs which are lodged there the tail consists of ten stiff sharppointed feathers bent inwards by which it secures itself on the trunks of trees while in search of food for this purpose its feet are short and thick and its toes which are placed two forward and two backward are armed with strong hooked claws by which it clings firmly and creeps up and down in all directions m buffon with his usual warmth of imagination thus describes the seemingly dull and solitary life of the woodpecker  of all the birds which earn their subsistence by spoil none leads a life so laborious and painful as the woodpecker nature has condemned it to incessant toil and slavery while others freely employ their courage or address and either shoot on rapid wing or lurk in close ambush the woodpecker is constrained to drag out an insipid existence in boring the bark and hard fibers of trees to extract its humble prey necessity never suffers any intermission of its labors never grants an interval of sound repose often during the night it sleeps in the same painful posture as in the fatigues of the day it never shares the sports of the other inhabitants of the air it joins not their vocal concerts and its wild cries and saddening tones while they disturb the silence of the forest express constraint and effort its movements are quick its gestures full of inquietude its looks coarse and vulgar it shuns all society even that of its own kind and when it is prompted to seek a companion its appetite is not softened by delicacy of feeling    the green woodpecker woodspite highhoe hewhole or pickatree wallis in his history of northumberland observes that it is called by the common people pickatree also rain fowl from its being more loud and noisy before rain the old romans called them pluvia aves for the same reason  picus viridis lin  le pic verd buff this is the largest of the british kinds being thirteen inches in length its bill is two inches long of a triangular shape and of a dark horn color the outer circle of the eye is white surrounding another of red the top of the head is of a bright crimson which extends down the hinder part of the neck ending in a point behind the eye is surrounded by a black space and from each corner of the bill there is a crimson streak pointing downwards the back and wing coverts are of an olive green the rump yellow the quill feathers are dusky barred on the outer web with black and white the bastard wing is spotted with white the sides of the head and all the under parts of the body are white slightly tinged with green the tail is marked with bars like the wings the legs are greenish the female differs from the male in not having the red mark from the corner of the mouth she makes her nest in the hollow of a tree fifteen or twenty feet from the ground buffon observes that both male and female labor by turns in boring through the living part of the wood sometimes to a considerable depth until they penetrate to that which is decayed and rotten where she lays five or six eggs of a greenish color marked with small black spots  the green woodpecker is seen more frequently on the ground than the other kinds particularly where there are anthills it inserts its long tongue into the holes through which the ants issue and draws out these insects in abundance sometimes with its feet and bill it makes a breach in the nest and devours them at its ease together with their eggs the young ones climb up and down the trees before they are able to fly they roost very early and repose in their holes till day  greater spotted woodpecker witwall  picas

hazel a black stroke passes over each eye from the bill extending down the side of the neck as far as the shoulder all the upper part of the body is of a fine blue gray color the cheeks and chin are white breast and belly of a pale orange color sides marked with streaks of chestnut quills dusky its tail is short the two middle feathers are gray the rest dusky three of the outermost spotted with white the legs pale yellow the claws large sharp and much bent the back claw very strong when extended the foot measures one inch and three quarters  this like the woodpecker frequents woods and is a shy and solitary bird the female lays her eggs in holes of trees frequently in those which have been deserted by the woodpecker during the time of incubation she is assiduously attended by the male who supplies her with food she is easily driven from her nest but on being disturbed hisses like a snake the nuthatch feeds on caterpillars beetles and various kinds of insects it likewise eats nuts and is very expert in cracking them so as to come at the contents having placed a nut fast in a chink it takes its stand a little above and striking it with all its force breaks the shell and catches up the kernel like the woodpecker it moves up and down the trunks of trees with great facility in search of food it does not migrate but in the winter approaches nearer inhabited places and is sometimes seen in orchards and gardens the young ones are esteemed very good eating    the hoopoe  upupa epops lin  le hupe ou puput buff its length is twelve inches breadth nineteen the bill is above two inches long black slender and somewhat curved the eyes hazel the tongue very short and triangular the head is ornamented with a crest consisting of a double row of feathers of a pale orange color

scapulars and wings are crossed with broad bars of black and white the lesser coverts of the wings light brown the rump is white the tail consists of ten feathers each marked with white which when closed assumes the form of a crescent the horns pointing downwards the legs are short and black  this is the only one of its kind found in these kingdoms it is not very common with us being seen only at uncertain periods our representation was taken from a very fine one shot near bedlington northumberland and sent us by the rev mr cotes in its stomach were found the claws and other indigestible parts of insects of the beetle tribe it was alive some time after being shot and walked about erecting its tail and crest in a very pleasing manner the female is said to have two or three broods in the year she makes no nest but lays her eggs generally about four or five in number in the hollow of a tree and sometimes in a hole in the wall or even on the ground buffon says that he has sometimes found a soft lining of moss wool or feathers in the nests of these birds and supposes that in that case they may have used the deserted nest of some other bird its food consists chiefly of insects with the remains of which its nest is sometimes so filled as to become extremely offensive it is a solitary bird two of them being seldom seen together in egypt where they are very common they are seen only in small flocks its crest usually falls behind on its neck except when it is surprised or irritated and it then stands erect  the creeper  certhia familiaris lin  le grimpereau buff its length is five inches and a half the body is about the size of that of the wren its bill is long slender and much curved the upper one brown the lower whitish eyes hazel the head neck back and wing coverts are of a dark brown variegated with streaks of a lighter hue the throat breast and belly are of a silvery white the rump tawny the quills are dusky edged with tawny and marked with bars of the same color the tips are white above each eye a small dark line passes toward the neck above which there is a line of white the tail is long and consists of twelve stiff feathers of a tawny color pointed and forked at the end the legs are short and of a brown color the claws are long sharp and much hooked which enable it to run with great facility on all sides of small branches of trees in quest of insects and their eggs which constitute its food although very common it is not seen without difficulty from the ease with which on the appearance of any one it escapes to the opposite side of the tree it builds its nest early in the spring in the hole of a tree the female lays from five to seven eggs of an ash color marked at the end with spots of a deeper hue    of the passerine order this numerous class constitutes the fifth order in mr pennants arrangement of british birds and includes a great variety of different kinds of these we have detached the stare the thrush and the chatterer and have joined them to the pies to which they seem to have a greater affinity those which follow are distinguished by their lively and active dispositions their beautiful plumage and delightful melody of this order consist those amazing flocks of small birds of almost every description  those numerous families which universally diffused throughout every part of the known world people the woods the fields and even the largest and most populous cities in countless multitudes and every where enliven diversify and adorn the face of nature these are not less conspicuous for their usefulness than their numbers and variety they are of infinite advantage in the economy of nature in destroying myriads of noxious insects which would otherwise teem in every part of the animal and vegetable systems and would pervade and choke up all the avenues of life and health insects and their eggs worms berries and seeds of almost every kind form the varied mass from whence these busy little tribes derive their support  the characters of the passerine order which are as various as their habits and dispositions will be best seen in the description of each particular kind it may be necessary however to observe that they naturally divide themselves into two distinct kinds namely the hardbilled or seed birds and the slender or softbilled birds the former are furnished with stout bills of a conical shape and very sharp at the point admirably fitted for the purpose of breaking the hard external coverings of the seeds of plants from the kernels which constitute the principal part of their food the latter are remarkable for the softness and delicacy of their bills their food consists altogether of small worms insects the larvae of insects and their eggs which they find deposited in immense profusion on the leaves and bark of trees in chinks and crevices of stones and even in small masses on the bare ground so that there is hardly a portion of matter that does not contain a plentiful supply of food for this diligent race of beings  full nature swarms with life the flowery leaf wants not its soft inhabitants secure within its winding citadel the stone holds multitudes but chief the forestboughs that dance unnumberd to the playful breeze the downy orchard and the melting pulp of mellow fruit the nameless nations feed of evanescent insects of the grosbeak this genus is not numerous in these kingdoms and of those which we call ours most of them are only visitors making a short stay with us and leaving us again to breed and rear their young in other countries they are in general shy and solitary living chiefly in woods at a distance from the habitations of men their vocal powers are not great and as they do not add much to the general harmony of the woods which they inhabit they are consequently not much known or sought after their most conspicuous character consists in the thickness and strength of their bills which enables them to break the stones of various kinds of fruits and other hard substances on which they feed their general appearance is very similar to birds of the finch kind of which they may be reckoned the principal branch    the crossbill shelapple  loxia curvirostra lin  le bec croise buff this bird is about the size of a lark being nearly seven inches in length it is distinguished by the peculiar formation of its bill the upper and under mandible curving in opposite directions and crossing each other at the points this singular construction of the bill is considered by m buffon as a defect or error in nature rather than a permanent feature merely because that in some subjects the bill crosses to the left and in others to the right arising as he supposes from the way in which the bird has been accustomed to use its bill by employing either the one side or the other to lay hold of its food this mode of reasoning however must prove very defective when we consider that this peculiarity is confined to a single species no other bird in nature being subject to a similar variation from the general construction although there are many other birds which feed upon the same kinds of hard substances which nevertheless do not experience any change in the formation and structure of their bills neither has the argument drawn from the supposed exuberance of growth in the bills of these birds any better foundation as that likewise may be applied to other birds and the same question will occur  namely why is not the same effect produced this ingenious but fanciful writer in the further prosecution of his argument seems to increase the difficulties in which it is involved he observes that the bill hooked upwards and downwards and bent in opposite directions seems to have been formed for the purpose of detaching the scales of the fir cones and obtaining the seeds lodged beneath them which are the principal food of the bird it raises each scale with its lower mandible and breaks it with the upper we think there needs no stronger argument than this to prove that nature in all her operations works by various means and although these are not always clear to our limited understandings the good of all her creatures is the one great end to which they are all directed its eyes are hazel its general color is reddish mixed with brown on the upper parts the under parts are considerably paler being almost white at the vent the wings are short not reaching farther than the setting on of the tail  they are of a brown color the tail is of the same color and somewhat forked the legs are black the colors of the crossbill are extremely subject to variation amongst a great number there are hardly two of them exactly similar they likewise vary with the season and according to the age of the bird edwards paints the male with a rose color and the female with a yellowish green mixed more or less with brown both sexes appear very different at different times of the year  the crossbill is an inhabitant of the colder climates and has been found as far as greenland it breeds in russia sweden poland and germany in the mountains of switzerland and among the alps and pyrenees from whence it migrates in vast flocks into other countries it sometimes is met with in great numbers in this country but its visits are not regular we have met with it on the top of blackstonedge between rochdale and halifax in the month of august as in some years it is rarely to be seen its principal food is said to be the seeds of the pine tree it is observed to hold the cone in one claw like the parrot and when kept in a cage has all the actions of that bird climbing by means of its hooked bill from the lower to the upper bars of its cage from its mode of scrambling and the beauty of its colors it has been called by some the german parrot the female is said to begin to build as early as january she places her nest under the bare branches of the pine tree fixing it with the resinous matter which exudes from that tree and besmearing it on the outside with the same substance so that the melted snow or rain cannot penetrate it  the grosbeak hawfinch  loxia coccothraustes lin  le grosbec buff

of the head is of a reddish chestnut as are also the cheeks but somewhat paler the back part of the neck is of a greyish ash color the back and lesser wing coverts chestnut the greater wing coverts are gray in some almost white forming a band across the wing the quills are all black except some of the secondaries nearest the body which are brown the four outer quills seem as if cut off at the ends the prime quills have each of them a spot of white about the middle of the inner web the breast and belly are of a pale rust color growing almost white at the vent the tail is black except the ends of the middle feathers which are gray the outer ones are tipped with white the legs are pale brown the female greatly resembles the male but her colors are less vivid and the space between the bill and the eye is gray instead of black these birds vary considerably scarcely two of them being alike in some the head is wholly black in others the whole upper part of the body is of that color and others have been met with entirely white except the wings  this species is an inhabitant of the temperate climates from spain italy and france as far as sweden but only visits this island occasionally and generally in winter probably being driven over in its passage from its northern haunts to the milder climates of france and italy it breeds in these countries but is no where numerous buffon says it is a shy and solitary bird with little or no song it generally inhabits the woods during summer and in winter resorts near the hamlets and farms the female builds her nest in trees it is composed of small dry roots and grass and lined with warmer materials the eggs are roundish of a blueish green spotted with brown she seeds her young with insects chrysalids and other soft nutritious substances  the pine grosbeak greatest bullfinch  loxia enucleator lin  le durbec buff this exceeds the last in size being nine inches in length the bill is dusky very stout at the base and somewhat hooked at the tip the head neck breast and rump are of a rose colored crimson the back and lesser wing coverts black each seather edged with reddish brown the greater wing coverts tipped with white forming two bars on the wing the quills are black with pale edges the secondaries the same but edged with white the belly and vent are strawcoloured the tail is marked as the quills and is somewhat forked the legs are brown  this bird is sound only in the northern parts of this island and of europe it frequents the pine forests and seeds on the seeds of that tree like the crossbill it is likewise common in various parts of north america visiting the southern settlements in the winter and retiring northwards in the summer for the purpose of breeding the female makes its nest on trees at a small distance from the ground and lays four white eggs which are hatched in june  green grosbeak green finch or green linnet  loxia chloris lin  le verdier buff the bill is of a pale

quills ashcolored the vent and tail coverts the same dashed with yellow the rump yellow  this bird is common in every part of great britain and may be seen in almost every hedge especially during winter when flocks of them keep together the female makes her nest in hedges or low bushes it is composed of dry grass and lined with hair wool and other warm materials she lays five or six eggs of a pale greenish color marked at the larger end with spots of a reddish brown she is so close a sitter that she may sometimes be taken on her nest the male is very attentive to his mate during the time of incubation and takes his turn in sitting though not distinguished for its song this bird is sometimes kept in a cage and soon becomes familiar it does not migrate but in the northern parts of our island it is seldom seen in winter changing its quarters according to the season of the year    bullfinch alp or nope  loxia pyrrhula lin  le bouvreuil buff the bill is dusky eyes black the upper part of the head the ring round the bill and the origin of the neck are of a fine glossy black hence in some countries it is called monk or pope and in scotland it is not improperly denominated coally hood the back ash color the breast and belly red wings and tail black the upper tail coverts and vent are white legs dark brown the female is very similar but the colors in general are less bright and the under parts of a reddish brown the bullsinch sometimes changes its plumage and becomes wholly black during its confinement especially when fed with hemp seed in the leverian museum there is a variety of the bullsinch entirely white   this bird is common in every part of this island as well as most parts of europe its usual haunts during summer are in woods and thickets but in winter it approaches nearer to cultivated grounds and feeds on seeds winter berries etc in the spring it frequents gardens where it is usefully busy in destroying the worms which are lodged in the tender buds the female makes her nest in bushes it is composed chiefly of moss she lays five or six eggs of a dull blueish white marked at the larger end with dark spots in a wild state its note is very simple but when kept in a cage its song though low is far from being unpleasant both male and female may be taught to whistle a variety of tunes and there are instances of two bullfinches having been taught to sing in parts a wonderful instance of docility they are frequently imported into this country from germany where they are taught to articulate with great distinctness several words    of the bunting the principal difference between this species and the last consists in the formation of the bill which in the bunting is of a very singular construction the two mandibles are moveable and the edges of each bend inwards the opening of the mouth is not in a straight line as in other birds but at the base the junction is formed by an obtuse angle in the lower mandible nearly one third of its length which is received by a corresponding angle in the upper one in the last there is a hard knob of great use in breaking the harder kinds of seeds and kernels on which it feeds the tongue is narrow and tapers to a point like a toothpick the first joint of the outer toe is joined to that of the middle one    the bunting  emberiza miliaria lin  le proyer buff the length of this bird is about seven inches and a half the bill is brown iris hazel the general color resembles that of a lark the throat is white the upper parts olive brown each feather streaked down the middle with black the under parts are of a dirty yellowish white streaked on the sides with dark brown and spotted with the same on the breast the quills are dusky with yellowish edges upper coverts tipped with white tail feathers much the same as the wings and somewhat forked the legs pale brown  this bird is very common in all parts of the country and may be frequently observed on the highest part of the hedge or uppermost branch of a tree uttering its harsh and dissonant cry which it incessantly repeats at short intervals this continues during the greatest part of summer after which they are seen in great flocks and continue so for the most part during winter they are often shot in great numbers or caught in nets and from the similarity of their plumage are not unfrequently sold for larks the female makes her nest among the thick grass a little elevated above the ground she lays five or six eggs and while she is employed in the business of incubation her mate brings her food and entertains her with his frequently repeated song buffon observes that in france the bunting is seldom seen during winter but that it migrates soon after the swallow and spreads itself through almost every part of europe their food consists chiefly of grain they likewise eat variety of insects which they find in the fields and meadows    yellow bunting yellow hammer or yellow yowley  emberiza citrinella lin  le bruant buff length somewhat above six inches bill dusky eyes hazel its prevailing color is yellow mixed with browns of various shades the crown of the head in general is bright yellow more or less variegated with brown the cheeks throat and lower part of the belly are of a pure yellow the breast reddish and the sides dashed with streaks of the same color the hind part of the neck and back are of a greenish olive the greater quills are dusky edged with pale yellow lesser quills and scapulars dark brown edged with gray the tail is dusky and a little sorked the feathers edged with light brown the outermost with white the legs are of a yellowish brown it is somewhat difficult to describe a species of bird of which no two are to be found perfectly similar but its specific characters are plain and cannot easily be mistaken the colors of the female are less bright than those of the male with very little yellow about the head  this bird is common in every lane and on every hedge throughout the country flitting before the traveller as he passes along the road or uttering its simple and frequently repeated monotone on the hedges by the way side they feed on various kinds of seeds insects etc the female makes an artless nest composed of hay dried roots and moss which she lines with hair and wool she lays four or five eggs marked with dark irregular streaks and frequently has more than one brood in the season in italy where small birds of almost every description are made use of for the table they are esteemed as very good eating and are frequently fatted for that purpose like the orlotan but with us who are accustomed to grosser kinds of food they are considered as too insignificant to form any part of our repasts    the blackheaded bunting reed bunting or reed sparrow  emberiza schaeniclus lin  lortolan de roseaux buff this bird is about the size of the yellow bunting its eyes are hazel the head throat fore part of the neck and breast are black which is divided by a white line from each corner of the bill passing downward a little and meeting on the back part of the neck which it almost encircles the upper parts of the body and wings are of a reddish brown with a streak of black down the middle of each feather the under part of the body is white with brownish streaks on the sides the rump and upper tail coverts blueish ash color mixed with brown the quills are dusky edged with brown the two middle feathers of the tail are black with pale brown edges the rest wholly black except the two outer ones which are almost white the ends tipped with brown and the bases black the legs and feet dusky brown the female has no collar its throat is not so black and its head is variegated with black and rust color the white on its under parts is not so pure but is of a reddish cast  birds of this species frequent fens and marshy places where there are abundance of rushes among which it nestles the nest is composed of dry grass and lined with the soft down of the reed it is fixed with great art between four reed stalks two on each side almost close to each other and about three feet above the water the female lays four or five eggs of a pale blueish white veined irregularly with purple principally at the larger end as its chief resort is among the reeds it is supposed that the seeds of that plant are its principal food it is however frequently seen in the higher grounds near the roads and sometimes in corn fields these birds in general seek their food similar to the bunting in cultivated places they keep near the ground and seldom perch except among the bushes the male during the time of hatching has a soft melodious warbling song whilst it sits perched among the reeds and is frequently heard in the night time it is a watchful timorous bird and is very easily alarmed in a state of captivity it sings but little and only when perfectly undisturbed  birds of this species are migratory in france with us they remain the whole year and are seldom seen in flocks of more than three or four together the one from whence our figure was taken was caught during a severe storm in the midst of winter    snow bunting snowflake

on their inner webs middle feathers of the tail black the three outer ones white with a dusky spot near the ends legs black its summer dress is different the head neck and under parts of the body being marked with transverse waves of a rusty color of various strength but never so deep as in the female of which it is the predominant color the white likewise upon the under parts of her body is less pure than that of the male  the hoary mountains of spitzbergen the lapland alps the shores of hudsons bay and perhaps countries still more northerly are during the summer months the favorite abodes of this hardy bird the excessive severity of these inhospitable regions changes parts of its plumage into white in winter and there is reason to believe that the further northward they are found the whiter the plumage will be it is chiefly met with in the northern parts of this island where it is called the snowflake it appears in great flocks in the snowy season and is said to be the certain harbinger of severe weather which drives it from its usual haunts this bird has been caught in various parts of yorkshire and is frequently met with in northumberland it is found in all the northern latitudes without exception as far as our navigators have been able to penetrate great flocks of these birds having been seen by them upon the ice near the shores of spitzbergen they are known to breed in greenland where the female makes its nest in the fissures of the mountain rocks the outside is composed of grass within which is a layer of feathers and the down of the arctic fox composes the lining of its comfortable little mansion she lays five white eggs spotted with brown these birds do not perch but continue always on the ground and run about like larks to which they are similar in size manners and in the length of their hind claws from whence they have been ranged with birds of that class by some authors but with more propriety have been referred to the buntings from the peculiar structure of their bill they are said to sing sweetly sitting on the ground on their first arrival in this country they are very lean but soon grow fat and are considered as delicious food the highlands of scotland abound with them  tawny bunting great pied mountain finch or brambling the length is somewhat above six inches the bill is short of a yellow color and blackish at the point the crown of the head tawny the forehead chestnut color the hind part of the neck and cheeks the same but paler the throat sides of the neck and space round the eyes are of a dirty white the breast dull yellow the under parts white in some tinged with yellow the back and scapulars are black edged with reddish brown the quill feathers are dusky edged with white the secondaries are white on their outer edges the greater coverts are tipped with white which when the wing is closed forms a bed of white upon it the upper tail coverts are yellow the tail is a little forked the two outermost feathers are white the third black tipped with white the rest wholly black the legs are short and black the hind claws almost as long but more bent than those of the lark  our figure and description of this bird are taken from one which was caught in the high moory grounds above shotleykirk in the county of northumberland we are perfectly of opinion with mr pennant that this and the former are the same bird in their summer and winter dress vide arctic zoology number     linnaeus who must have been well acquainted with this species comprises them under one and says that they vary not only from the season but according to their age it is certain that no birds of the same species differ from each other more than they amongst multitudes that are frequently taken scarcely two being alike mr pennant supposes with great probability that the swarms which annually visit the northern parts of our island arrive from lapland and iceland and make the isles of ferro shetland and the orkneys their restingplaces during the passage in the winter of         they came in such multiludes into birsa one of the orkney isles as to cover the whole barony yet of all the numbers it could hardly be discovered that any two of them agreed perfectly in colors it is probable that the mountain bunting or lesser mountain finch of pennant and latham is the same bird in a somewhat different dress it has been sometimes found in the more southern parts of england where the little stranger would be noticed and without duly attending to its distinguishing characters has been considered as forming a distinct kind and adding one more to the numerous varieties of the feathered tribes  we have frequently had occasion to observe how difficult it is to avoid falling into errors of this sort the changes which frequently take place in the same bird at different periods of its age as well as from change of food climate or the like are so considerable as often to puzzle and sometimes to mislead the most experienced ornithologist much caution is therefore necessary to guard against these deceitful appearances lest by multiplying the species beyond the bounds which nature has prescribed we thereby introduce confusion into our system and instead of satisfying the attentive inquirer we shall only bewilder and perplex him in his researches into nature    of the finch the transition from the bunting to the finch is very easy and the shade of difference between them in some instances almost imperceptible on which account they have been frequently confounded with each other the principal difference consists in the beak which in this kind is conical very thick at the base and tapering to a sharp point in this respect it more nearly resembles the grosbeak of this tribe many are distinguished as well for the liveliness of their song as for the beauty and variety of their plumage on which accounts they are much esteemed they are very numerous and assemble sometimes in immense flocks feeding on seeds and grain of various kinds as well as insects and their eggs    the house sparrow  fringilla domestica lin  le moineau franc buff the length of this bird is five inches and three quarters the bill is dusky eyes hazel the top of the head and back part of the neck are ash color the throat fore part of the neck and space round the eyes black the cheeks are whitish the breast and all the under parts are of a pale ash color the back scapulars and wing coverts are of a reddish brown mixed with black  the latter is tipped with white forming a light bar across the wing the quills are dusky with reddish edges the tail is brown edged with gray and a little forked the legs are pale brown the female is distinguished from the male in wanting the black patch on the throat and in having a light streak behind each eye she is also much plainer and duller in her whole plumage in whatever country the sparrow is settled it is never found in desert places or at a distance from the dwellings of man it does not like other birds shelter itself in woods and forests or seek its subsistence in uninhabited plains but is a resident in towns and villages it follows society and lives at its expense granaries barns courtyards pigeonhouses and in short all places where grain is scattered are its favorite resorts it is surely saying too much of this poor proscribed species to sum up its character in the words of the count de buffon  it is extremely destructive its plumage is entirely useless its flesh indifferent food its notes grating to the ear and its familiarity and petulance disgusting but let us not condemn a whole species of animals because in some instances we have found them troublesome or inconvenient of this we are sufficiently sensible but the uses to which they are subservient in the grand economical distribution of nature we cannot so easily ascertain we have already observed see introduction that in the destruction of caterpillars they are eminently serviceable to vegetation and in this respect alone there is reason to suppose sufficiently repay the destruction they may make in the produce of the garden or the field the great table of nature is spread out alike to all and is amply stored with every thing necessary for the support of the various families of the earth it is owing to the superior industry of man that he is enabled to appropriate so large a portion of the best gifts of providence for his own subsistence and comfort let him not then think it waste that in some instances creatures inferior to him in rank are permitted to partake with him nor let him grudge them their scanty pittance but considering them only as the tasters of his full meal let him endeavor to imitate their cheerfulness and lift up his heart in grateful effusions to him who fills all things living with plenteousness  the sparrow never leaves us but is familiar to the eye at all times even in the most crowded and busy parts of a town it builds its nest under the eaves of houses in holes of walls and often about churches it is made of hay carelessly put together and lined with feathers the female lays five or six eggs of a reddish white color spotted with brown she has generally three broods in the year from whence the multiplication of the species must be immense though familiar the sparrow is said to be a crafty bird easily distinguishing the snares laid to entrap it in autumn prodigious flocks of them are seen every where both in town and country they often mix with other birds and not unfrequently partake with the pigeons or the poultry in spite of every precaution to prevent them the sparrow is subject to great varieties of plumage in the british and leverian museums there are several white ones with yellow eyes and bills others more or less mixed with brown and some entirely black a pair of white sparrows were sent us by mr walter trevelyan of st johns college cambridge  this bird as seen in large and smoaky towns is generally sooty and unpleasing in its appearance but among barns and stackyards the cock bird exhibits a very great variety in his plumage and is far from being the least beautiful of our british birds    the mountain sparrow  fringilla montana lin  le friquet buff this bird is somewhat less than the common sparrow the bill is black eyes hazel the crown of the head and hind part of the neck are of a chestnut color sides of the head white throat black behind each eye there is a pretty large black spot the upper parts of the body are of a rusty brown spotted with black the breast and under parts dusky white the quills are black with reddish edges as are also the greater coverts the lesser are bay edged with black and crossed with two white bars the tail is of a reddish brown and even at the end the legs are pale yellow  this species is frequent in yorkshire lancashire and also in lincolnshire it differs from the house sparrow in making its nest in trees and not in buildings it has not been seen further north than the abovementioned counties buffon says that it feeds on fruits seeds and insects it is a lively active little bird and when it alights has a variety of motions whirling about and jerking its tail upwards and downwards like the wagtail it is found in italy france germany and russia and is much more plentiful in many parts of the continent than in england    the chaffinch shilfa scobby skelly or shellapple  fringilla caelebs lin  le pincon buff the bill is of a pale blue tipped with black eyes hazel the forehead black the crown of the head hind

with yellow the tail which is a little forked is black the outermost feather edged with white the legs are brown the female wants the red upon the breast her plumage in general is not so vivid and inclines to green in other respects it is not much unlike the male  this beautiful little bird is every where well known it begins its short and frequentlyrepeated warble very early in the spring and continues till about the summer solstice after which it is no more heard it is a lively bird and perpetually in motion and this circumstance has given rise to the proverb  as gay as a chaffinch its nest is constructed with much art of small fibers roots and moss and lined with wool hair and feathers the female lays generally five or six eggs of a pale reddish color sprinkled with dark spots principally at the larger end the male is very assiduous in his attendance during the time of hatching seldom straying far from the place and then only to procure food chaffinches subsist chiefly on small seeds of various kinds they likewise eat caterpillars and insects with which they also feed their young they are seldom kept in cages as their song possesses no variety and they are not very apt in learning the notes of other birds the males frequently maintain obstinate combats and fight till one of them is vanquished and compelled to give way in sweden these birds perform a partial migration the females collect in vast flocks the latter end of september and leaving their mates spread themselves through various parts of europe the males continue in sweden and are again joined by their females who return in great numbers about the beginning of april to their wonted haunts with us both males and females continue the whole year mr white in his history of selborne observes that great flocks sometimes appear in that neighborhood about christmas and that they are almost entirely hens it is difficult to account for so singular a circumstance as the parting of the two sexes in this instance we would suppose that the males being more hardy and better able to endure the rigours of the northern winters are content to remain in the country and pick up such fare as they can find whilst the females seek for subsistence in more temperate regions    the mountain finch brambling  fringilla montifringilla lin  le pincon dardennes buff length somewhat above six inches bill yellow

the outermost feathers edged with white the rest black with whitish edges legs pale brown  the mountain finch is a native of northern climates from whence it spreads into various parts of europe it arrives in this country the latter end of summer and is more frequent in the mountainous parts of our island we have seen them on the cumberland hills in the middle of august great flocks of them sometimes come together they fly very close and on that account great numbers of them are frequently killed at one shot in france they are said to appear sometimes in such immense numbers that the ground where they roosted has been covered with their dung for a considerable space and in one year they were so numerous that more than six hundred dozen were killed each night during the greatest part of the winter buffon they are said to build their nests in fir trees at a considerable height it is composed of long moss and lined with hair wool and feathers the female lays four or five eggs white spotted with yellow the flesh of the mountain finch though bitter is said to be good to eat and better than that of the chaffinch but its song is much inferior and is only a disagreeable kind of chirping it feeds on seeds of various kinds and is said to be particularly fond of beech mast  the goldfinch goldspink or thistlefinch  fringilla carduelis lin  le chardonneret buff the bill is white tipped with black the forehead and chin are of a rich scarlet color which is divided by a line passing from each corner of the bill to the eyes which are black the cheeks are white top of the head black which extends downward on each side dividing the white on the cheeks from the white spot on the hind part of the head the back rump and breast are of a pale brown color belly white greater wing coverts black quills black marked in the middle of each feather with yellow forming when the wing is closed a large patch of that color on the wing the tips white the tail feathers are black with a white spot on each near the end the legs are of a pale flesh color  beauty of plumage says the lively count de buffon melody of song sagacity and docility of disposition seem all united in this charming little bird which were it rare and imported from a foreign country would be more highly valued goldfinches begin to sing early in the spring and continue till the time of breeding is over when kept in a cage they will sing the greatest part of the year in a state of confinement they are much attached to their keepers and will learn a variety of little tricks such as to draw up small buckets containing their water and food to fire a cracker and such like they construct a very neat and compact nest which is composed of moss dried grass and roots lined with wool hair and the down of thistles and other soft and delicate substances the female lays five white eggs marked with spots of a deep purple color at the larger end they feed their young with caterpillars and insects the old birds feed on various kinds of seeds particularly the thistle of which they are extremely fond  goldfinches breed with the canary this intermixture succeeds best between the cock goldfinch and the hen canary whose offspring are productive and are said to resemble the male in the shape of the bill in the colors of the head and wings and the hen in the rest of the body  the siskin aberdevine  fringilla spinus lin  le tarin buff length near five inches bill white eyes black top of the head and throat black over each eye there is a pale yellow streak back of the neck and back yellowish olive faintly marked with dusky streaks down the middle of each feather rump yellow under parts greenish yellow palest on the breast thighs gray marked with dusky streaks greater wing coverts of a pale yellowish green and tipped with black quills dusky faintly edged with yellow  the outer web of each at the base is of a fine pale yellow forming when the wing is closed an irregular bar of that color across the wing the tail is forked the middle feathers black with faint edges the outer ones yellow with black tips the legs pale brown claws white  we have given the figure and description from one which we have kept many years in a cage its song though not so loud as the canary is pleasing and sweetly various it imitates the notes of other birds even to the chirping of the sparrow it is familiar docile and cheerful and begins its song early in the mornings like the goldfinch it may easily be taught to draw up its little bucket with water and food its food consists chiefly of seeds it drinks frequently and seems fond of throwing water over its feathers it breeds freely with the canary when a siskin is paired with the hen canary he is assiduous in his attention to his mate carrying materials for the nest and arranging them and during the time of incubation regularly supplying the female with food these birds are common in various parts of europe they are in most places migratory but do not seem to observe any regular periods as they are sometimes seen in large and at other times in very small numbers buffon observes that those immense flights happen only once in the course of three or four years it conceals its nest with so much art that it is extremely difficult to discover it kramer observes that in the forests bordering on the danube thousands of young siskins are frequently found which have not dropped their first feathers and yet it is rare to meet with a nest it is not known to breed in this island nor is it said from whence they come over to us ours was caught upon the banks of the tyne in some parts of the south it is called the barleybird being seen about that seed time and in the neighborhood of london it is known by the name of the aberdevine  canary finch  fringilla canaria lin  le serin des canaries buff is somewhat larger than the last being about five inches and a half in length the bill is of a pale flesh color general color of the plumage yellow more or less mixed with gray and in some with brown on the upper parts the tail is somewhat forked legs pale flesh color  in a wild state they are found chiefly in the canary islands from whence they have been brought to this country and almost every part of europe they are kept in a state of captivity and partake of all the varieties attendant on that state buffon enumerates twentynine varieties and many more might probably be added to the list were all the changes incident to a state of domestication carefully noted and brought into the account  the breeding and rearing of these charming birds forms an amusement of the most pleasing kind and affords a variety of scenes highly interesting and gratifying to innocent minds in the places fitted up and accommodated to the use of the little captives we are delighted to see the workings of nature exemplified in the choice of their mates building their nests batching and rearing their young and in the impassionate ardour exhibited by the male whether he is engaged in assisting his faithful mate in collecting materials for her nest in arranging them for her accommodation in providing food for her offspring or in chaunting his lively and amorous songs during every part of the important business the canary will breed freely with the siskin and goldfinch particularly the former as we have already observed it likewise proves prolific with the linnet but not so readily and admits also the chaffinch yellow bunting and even the sparrow though with still more difficulty in all these instances except the first the pairing succeeds best when the female canary is introduced to the male of the opposite species according to buffon the siskin is the only bird of which the male and female propagate equally with those of the male or female canaries  the lastmentioned author in his history of birds has given a curious account of the various methods used in rearing these birds to which we must refer our readers we have thought it necessary to say thus much of a bird which though neither of british origin nor yet a voluntary visitor must yet be considered as ours by adoption the importation of canaries forms a small article of commerce great numbers are every year imported from tyrol four tyrolese usually bring over to england about sixteen hundred of these birds and though they carry them on their backs one thousand miles and pay twenty pounds for such a number they are enabled to sell them at five shillings a piece  phil trans vol    there are two kinds mentioned by buffon similar to the canary both of them smaller the former is called the serin the latter the venturon or citril they are both found in italy greece turkey and in the southern provinces of france they breed with the canary and are almost as remarkable for the sweetness of their song  the linnet gray linnet  fringilla linaria lin  la linotte buff length about five inches and a half the bill blueish gray eyes hazel the upper parts of the head neck and back are of a dark reddish brown the edges of the feathers pale the under parts are of a dirty reddish white the breast is deeper than the rest and in spring becomes of a very beautiful crimson the sides are spotted with brown the quills are dusky edged with white the tail brown likewise with white edges except the two middle feathers which have reddish margins it is somewhat forked the legs are brown the female wants the red on the breast instead of which it is marked with streaks of brown she has less white on her wings and her colors in general are less bright  this bird is very well known being common in every part of europe it builds its nest in low bushes the outside is made up of dried grass roots and moss within it is lined with hair and wool the female lays four or five eggs of a pale blue color spotted with brown at the larger end she breeds generally twice in the year the song of the linnet is beautiful and sweetly varied its manners are gentle and its disposition docile it easily adopts the songs of other birds when confined with them and in some instances has been said to pronounce words with great distinctness this we consider as a perversion of its talents and substituting imperfect and forced accents which have neither charms nor beauty in the room of the free and varied modulations of uninstructed nature linnets are frequently found in flocks during winter they feed on various sorts of seeds and are said to be particularly fond of lintseed from whence they derive their name  the greater redpole  fringilla cannabina lin  le grande linotte de vignes buff this bird is somewhat less than the last and differs principally from the linnet in being marked on the forehead by a bloodcoloured spot the breast likewise is tinged with a fine rose color in other respects it resembles the linnet so much that buffon supposes them to be the same and that the red spots on the head and breast are equivocal marks differing at different periods appearing at one time and disappearing at another in the same bird it is certain that during a state of captivity the red marks disappear entirely and that in the time of moulting they are nearly obliterated and for some time do not recover their usual luster but hour plausible this may appear it is not well founded the redpole is smaller than the linnet it makes its nest on the ground while the latter builds in furze and thorn hedges they differ likewise in the color of their eggs  that of the redpole being of a very pale green with rusty colored spots the head of the female is ashcolored spotted with black and of a dull yellow on the breast and sides which are streaked with dusky lines  redpoles are common in the northern parts of england where they breed chiefly in mountainous places  lesser redpole  fringilla linaria lin  le sizerin buff length about five inches bill pale brown point dusky eyes hazel the forehead is marked with a pretty large spot of a deep purplish red the breast is of the same color but less bright the feathers on the back are dusky edged with pale brown the greater and lesser coverts tipped with dirty white forming two light bars across the wing the belly and thighs are of a dull white the quills and tail dusky edged with dirty white the latter somewhat forked legs dusky in our bird the rump was somewhat reddish in which it agrees with the twite of mr pennant and most probably constitutes one species with it and the mountain linnet the differences being immaterial and merely such as might arise from age food or other accidental circumstances the female has no red on the breast or rump and the spot on her forehead is of a saffron color her plumage in general is not so bright as that of the male  birds of this kind are not unfrequent in this island they breed chiefly in the northern parts where they are known by the name of french linnets they make a shallow open nest composed of dried grass and wool and lined with hair and feathers the female lays four eggs almost white marked with reddish spots in the winter they mix with other birds and migrate in flocks to the southern counties they feed on small seeds of various kinds especially those of the alder of which they are extremely fond they hang like the titmouse with their back downwards upon the branches while feeding and in this situation may easily be caught with lime twigs this species is found in every part of europe from italy to the most extreme parts of the russian empire in america and the northern parts of asia it is likewise very common    of the lark amongst the various kinds of singing birds with which this country abounds there is none more eminently conspicuous than those of the lark kind instead of retiring to woods and deep recesses or lurking in thickets where it may be heard without being seen the lark is seen abroad in the fields it is the only bird which chaunts on the wing and as it soars beyond the reach of our sight pours forth the most melodious strains which may be distinctly heard at that amazing distance  the great poet of nature thus beautifully describes it as the leader of the general chorus  up springs the lark shrillvoiced and loud the messenger of morn ere yet the shadows fly he mounted sings amid the dawning clouds and from their haunts calls up the tuneful nations   from the peculiar construction of the hind claws which are very long and straight larks generally rest upon the ground those which frequent trees perch only on the larger branches they all build their nests upon the ground which exposes them to the depredations of the smaller voracious kinds of animals such as the weazel stoat etc which destroy great numbers of them the cuckoo likewise which makes no nest of its own frequently substitutes its eggs in the place of theirs  the general characters of this species are thus described  the bill is straight and slender bending a little toward the end which is sharppointed the nostrils are covered with feathers and bristles the tongue is cloven at the end tail somewhat forked the toes divided to the origin  claw of the hind toe very long and almost straight the fore claws very short and slightly curved    the skylark lavrock  alauda arvensis lin  lalouette buff length near seven inches bill dusky under mandible somewhat yellow eyes hazel over each eye there is a pale streak which extends to the bill and round the eye on the under side on the upper parts of the body the feathers are of a reddish brown color dark in the middle with pale edges the fore part of the neck is of a reddish white dashed with brown breast belly and thighs white the quills brown with pale edges tail the same and somewhat forked the two middle feathers darkest the outermost white on the outer edge the legs dusky in some of our specimens the feathers on the top of the head were long and formed a sort of crest behind the lesser crested lark of pennant and latham is perhaps only a variety of this the difference being trifling it is said to be found in yorkshire  the lark commences its song early in the spring and is heard most in the morning it rises in the air almost perpendicularly and by successive springs and hovers at a vast height its descent on the contrary is in an oblique direction unless it is threatened by birds of prey or attracted by its mate and on these occasions it drops like a stone it makes its nest on the ground between two clods of earth and lines it with dried grass and roots the female lays four or five eggs of a greyish brown color marked with darker spots she generally has two broods in the year and sits only about fifteen days as soon as the young have escaped from the shell the attachment of the parent bird seems to increase she flutters over their heads directs all their motions and is ever ready to screen them from danger the lark is almost universally diffused throughout europe it is every where extremely prolific and in some places the prodigious numbers that are frequently caught are truly astonishing in germany there is an excise upon them which has produced according to keysler the sum of  000 dollars yearly to the city of leipsic alone mr pennant says the neighborhood of dunstable is famous for the great numbers of these birds found there and that  000 dozen have been taken between september and february for the london markets yet notwithstanding the great havoc made amongst these birds they are extremely numerous the winter is the best season for taking them as they are then very fat being almost constantly on the ground feeding in great flocks whereas in summer they are very lean they then always go in pairs eat sparingly and sing incessantly while on the wing  the field lark  alauda campestris lins la spipolette buff this exceeds the titlark in size being about six inches long its bill is slender the plumage on the head neck and back is of a dark greenish brown streaked with black palest on the rump above each eye is a pale streak quill feathers dusky brown with pale edges the scapulars faintly bordered with white the throat and under parts of the body are of a dirty white the breast is yellowish and marked with large black spots the sides and thighs streaked with black the tail dusky two outer feathers white excepting a small part of the inner web the two next tipped with white the legs are of a yellowish brown the hind claws somewhat curved  though much larger than the titlark this bird is similar to it in plumage its song is however totally different as are also its haunts being found chiefly near woods and not unfrequently on trees it builds its nest like the last and in similar situations on the ground and sometimes in a low bush near the ground the male is scarcely to be distinguished from the female in its outward appearance we have occasionally met with another bird of the lark kind which we have ventured to denominate the tree lark it frequents woods and sits on the highest branches of trees from whence it rises singing to a considerable height descending slowly with its wings and tail spread out like a fan its note is full clear melodious and peculiar to its kind  the grasshopper lark  alauda trivialis lin  lalouette pipi buff this is the smallest of the lark kind and has though we think not with sufficient reason been ranked among the warblers its bill is slender and dusky the upper parts of the body are of a greenish color variegated and mixed with brown the under of a yellowish white speckled irregularly on the breast and neck the feathers of the wings and tail are of a palish dusky brown with light edges the legs pale dusky brown its hind claws though shorter and more crooked than those of the skylark sufficiently mark its kind it builds its nest on the ground in solitary spots and conceals it beneath a turf the female lays five eggs marked with brown near the larger end  in the spring the cockbird sometimes perches on a tall branch singing with much emotion at intervals he rises to a considerable height hovers a few seconds and drops almost on the same spot continuing to sing all the time his tones are soft clear and harmonious in the winter its cry is said to resemble that of the grasshopper but is rather stronger and shriller it has been called the pipit lark from its small shrill cry and in german pieplerche for the same reason mr white observes that its note seems close to a person though at an hundred yards distance and when close to the ear seems scarce louder than when a great way off it skulks in hedges and thick bushes and runs like a mouse through the bottom of the thorns evading the sight sometimes early in a morning when undisturbed it sings on the top of a twig gaping and shivering with its wings    the woodlark  alauda arborea lin  lalouette de bois buff this is somewhat smaller than the field lark but resembles it so much in the colors of its plumage as scarcely to need a separate description in general they are much paler and less distinct the streak over each eye extends backwards toward the head so as to form a sort of wreath or coronet round it which is very conspicuous the spots on its breast are larger and more distinct than those of the skylark and its tail much shorter the legs are of a dull yellow the hind claw very long and somewhat curved  the woodlark is generally found near the borders of woods from whence it derives its name it perches on trees and sings during the night so as sometimes to be mistaken for the nightingale it likewise sings as it flies and builds its nest on the ground similar to that of the skylark the female lays five eggs of a dusky hue marked with brown spots it builds very early the young in some seasons being able to fly about the latter end of march she makes two nests in the year like the skylark but is not near so numerous as that bird in autumn the woodlarks are fat and are then esteemed excellent eating    the titlark  alauda pratensis lin  la farlouse ou lalouette de prez buff this bird is less than the woodlark being not more than five inches and a half in length its bill is black at the tip and of a yellowish brown at the base its eyes are hazel over each eye is a pale streak the disposition of its colors is very similar to those of the skylark but somewhat darker on the upper parts and inclining to a greenish brown the breast is beautifully spotted with black on a light yellowish ground the belly light ash color obscurely streaked on the sides with dusky the tail is almost black the two outer feathers white on the exterior edges the outermost but one tipped with a white spot on the end the legs are yellowish feet and claws brown the female differs only in its plumage being less bright than that of the male  the titlark is common in this country and though it sometimes perches on trees is generally found in meadows and low marshy grounds  it makes its nest on the ground lining it with hair the female lays five or six eggs of a deep brown color the young are hatched about the beginning of june during the time of incubation the male sits on a neighboring tree rising at times and singing the titlark is flushed with the least noise and shoots with a rapid flight its note is fine but short and without much variety it warbles in the air like the skylark and increases its song as it descends slowly to the branch on which it chooses to perch it is further distinguished by the shake of its tail particularly whilst it eats    of the wagtail the different species of this kind are few and these are chiefly confined to the continent of europe where they are very numerous they are easily distinguished by their brisk and lively motions as well as by the great length of their tails which they jerk up and down incessantly  from whence they derive their name in almost all languages the name of this bird is descriptive of its peculiar habits in latin motacilla in french motteux la lavandiere or washer in england they are sometimes called washers from their peculiar motion in german brookstilts in italian shaketail etc etc they do not hop but run along the ground very nimbly after flies and other insects on which they feed they likewise feed on small worms in search of which they are frequently seen to flutter round the husbandman whilst at his plough and follow the flocks in search of the flies which generally surround them they frequent the sides of pools and pick up the insects which swarm on the surface they seldom perch their flight is weak and undulating and during which they make a twittering noise  the pied wagtail black and white waterwagtail  motacilla alba lin  la lavandiere buff the length of this bird is about seven inches the bill is black eyes hazel hind part of the head and neck black the forehead cheeks and sides of the neck are white the fore part of the neck and part of the breast are black bordered by a line of white in the form of a gorget the back and rump are of a deep ash color wing coverts and secondary quills dusky edged with light gray prime quills black with pale edges lower part of the breast and belly white the middle feathers of the tail are black the outermost white except at the base and tips of the inner webs which are black legs black there are slight variations in these birds some are white on the chin and throat leaving only a crescent of black on the breast the head of the female is brown  this is a very common bird with us and may be seen every where running on the ground and frequently leaping after flies and other insects on which it feeds its usual haunts are the shallow margins of waters into which it will sometimes wade a little in search of its food it makes its nest on the ground of dry grass moss and small roots lined with hair and feathers the female lays five white eggs spotted with brown the parent birds are very attentive to their young and continue to feed and train them for three or four weeks after they are able to fly they will defend them with great courage when in danger or endeavor to draw aside the enemy by various little arts they are very attentive to the cleanliness of the nest and will throw out the excrement they have been known to remove light substances such as paper or straw which has been laid as a mark for the nest it is said by some authors to migrate into other climates about the end of october with us it is known to change its quarters as the winter approaches from north to south its note is small and insignificant but frequently repeated especially while on the wing    the gray wagtail  motacilla boarula lin  la bergeronette jaune buff this bird is somewhat larger than the last owing to the great length of its tail its bill is dark brown over each eye there is a pale streak the head neck and back are of a greyish ash color the throat and chin are black the rump and all the under parts of the body are of a bright yellow wing coverts and quills dark brown the former with pale edges the secondaries which are almost as long as the greater quills are white at the base and tipped with yellow on the outer edges the middle feathers of the tail are black the outer ones white legs yellowish brown  this elegant little bird frequents the same places as the last its food is likewise similar to it it remains with us during winter frequenting the neighborhood of springs and running waters the female builds her nest on the ground and sometimes in the banks of rivulets it is composed of nearly the same materials as the last she lays from six to eight eggs of a dirty white marked with yellow spots she differs from the male in having no black on the throat  the yellow wagtail  motacilla flava lin  la bergeronette de printems buff length six inches and a half bill black eyes hazel the head and all the upper parts of the body are of an olive green palest on the rump the under parts are of a bright yellow dashed with a few dark spots on the breast and belly over each eye there is a pale yellow streak and beneath a dusky line curving upwards toward the hind part of the head wing coverts edged with pale yellow quills dusky tail black except the outer feathers which are white the legs are black hind claws very long  buffon observes that this bird is seen very early in the spring in the meadows and fields amongst the green corn where it frequently nestles it haunts the sides of brooks and springs which never freeze with us during winter the female lays five eggs of a pale lead color with dusky spots irregularly disposed    of the flycatchers of those birds which constitute this class we only find two kinds which inhabit this island and these are not the most numerous of the various tribes with which this country abounds the useful instincts and propensities of this little active race are chiefly confined to countries under the more immediate influence of the sun where they are of infinite use in destroying those numerous swarms of noxious insects engendered by heat and moisture which are continually upon the wing these though weak and contemptible when individually considered are formidable by their numbers devouring the whole produce of vegetation and carrying in their train the accumulated ills of pestilence and famine thus to use the words of an eminent naturalist buffon we see that all nature is balanced and the circle of generation and destruction is perpetual the philosopher contemplates with melancholy this seemingly cruel system and strives in vain to reconcile it with his ideas of benevolence but he is forcibly struck with the nice adjustment of the various parts their mutual connection and subordination and the unity of plan which pervades the whole  the characters of this genus with us are somewhat equivocal and not well ascertained neither do we know of any common name in our language by which it is distinguished mr pennant describes it thus bill flatted at the base almost triangular notched at the end of the upper mandible and beset with bristles at its base we have placed the flycatcher here as introductory to the numerous class which follows to which they are nearly related both in respect to form habits and modes of living the affinity between them is so great as to occasion some confusion in the arrangement of several of the individuals of each kind for which reason we have placed them together    the pied flycatcher coldfinch  muscicapa atricapilla lin  le traquet d angleterre buff length near five inches bill black eyes hazel the forehead is white the top of the head back and tail are black the rump is dashed with ash color the wing coverts are dusky the greater coverts are tipped with white the exterior sides of the secondary quills are white as are also the outer feathers of the tail all the under parts from the bill to the tail are white the legs are black the female is brown where the male is black it likewise wants the white spot on the forehead this bird is no where common it is in most plenty in yorkshire lancashire and derbyshire since the cut which was done from a stuffed specimen was finished we have been favored with a pair of these birds shot at benton in northumberland we suppose them to be male and female as one of them wanted the white spot on the forehead in other respects it was similar to the male the upper parts in both were black obscurely mixed with brown the quill feathers dark reddish brown tail dark brown the exterior edge of the outer feather white legs black  spotted flycatcher beambird  muscicapa grisola lin  le gobemouche buff length near five inches and three quarters bill dusky base of it whitish and beset with short bristles inside of the mouth yellow the head and back light brown obscurely spotted with black the wings dusky edged with white the breast and belly white the throat and sides under the wings tinged with red the tail dusky legs black  mr white observes that the flycatcher of all our summer birds is the most mute and the most familiar it visits this island in the spring and disappears in september it builds in a vine or sweetbriar against the wall of a house or on the end of a beam and sometimes close to the post of a door where people are going in and out all day long it returns to the same place year after year the female lays four or five eggs marked with small rusty spots the nest is carelessly made and consists chiefly of moss frequently mixed with wool and strong fibers so large says buffon that it appears surprising how so small an artificer could make use of such stubborn materials this bird feeds on insects which it catches on the wing it sometimes watches for its prey sitting on a branch or post and with a sudden spring takes it as it flies and immediately returns to its station to wait for more it is likewise fond of cherries mr latham says it is known in kent by the name of the cherrysucker it has no song but only a sort of inward wailing note when it perceives any danger to itself or young it breeds only once and retires early when its young are able to fly it retires with them to the woods where it sports with them among the higher branches sinking and rising often perpendicularly among the flies which hum below    of the warblers this very numerous class is composed of a great variety of kinds differing in size from the nightingale to the wren and not a little in their habits and manners they are widely dispersed over most parts of the known world some of them remain with us during the whole year  others are migratory and visit us annually in great numbers forming a very considerable portion of those numerous tribes of singing birds with which this island so plentifully abounds some of them are distinguished by their manner of flying which they perform by jerks and in an undulating manner others by the whirring motion of their wings the head in general is small the bill is weak and slender and beset with bristles at the base the nostrils are small and somewhat depressed and the outer toe is joined to the middle one by a small membrane    the nightingale  motacilla luscinia lin  le rossignol buff this bird so deservedly esteemed for the excellence of its song is not remarkable for the variety or richness of its colors it is somewhat more than six inches in length its bill is brown yellow on the edges at the base eyes hazel the whole upper part of the body is of a rusty brown tinged with olive the under parts pale ash color almost white at the throat and vent the quills are brown with reddish margins legs pale brown the male and female are very similar  although the nightingale is common in this country it never visits the northern parts of our island and is but seldom seen in the western counties of devonshire and cornwall it leaves us some time in the month of august and makes its regular return the beginning of april it is supposed during that interval to visit the distant regions of asia this is probable as they do not winter in any part of france germany italy greece etc neither does it appear that they stay in africa but are seen at all times in india persia china and japan in the latter place they are much esteemed for their song and sell at great prices they are spread generally throughout europe even as far north as siberia and sweden where they are said to sing delightfully they however are partial to particular places and avoid others which seem as likely to afford them the necessary means of support it is not improbable however that by planting a colony in a wellchosen situation these delightful songsters might be induced to haunt places where they are not at present seen the experiment might be easily tried and should it succeed the reward would be great in the rich and varied song of this unrivalled bird the following animated description of it is taken from the ingenious author of the histoire des oiseaux  the leader of the vernal chorus begins with a low and timid voice and he prepares for the hymn to nature by essaying his powers and attuning his organs by degrees the sound opens and swells it bursts with loud and vivid flashes it flows with smooth volubility it faints and murmurs it shakes with rapid and violent articulations the soft breathings of love and joy are poured from his inmost soul and every heart beats unison and melts with delicious languor but this continued richness might satiate the ear the strains are at times relieved by pauses which bestow dignity and elevation the mild silence of evening heightens the general effect and not a rival interrupts the solemn scene  these birds begin to build about the end of april or the beginning of may they make their nest in the lower part of a thick bush or hedge the female lays four or five eggs of a greenish brown color the nest is composed of dry grass and leaves intermixed with small fibers and lined with hair down and other soft and warm substances the business of incubation is entirely performed by the female whilst the cock at no great distance entertains her with his delightful melody so soon however as the young are hatched he leaves off singing and joins her in the care of providing for the young brood these birds make a second hatch and sometimes a third and in hot countries they are said to have four  the nightingale is a solitary bird and never unites in flocks like many of the smaller birds but hides itself in the thickest parts of the bushes and sings generally in the night its food consists principally of insects small worms eggs of ants and sometimes berries of various kinds nightingales though timorous and shy are easily caught snares of all sorts are laid for them and generally succeed they are likewise caught on lime twigs  young ones are sometimes brought up from the nest and fed with great care till they are able to sing it is with great difficulty that old birds are induced to sing after being taken for a considerable time they refuse to eat but by great attention to their treatment and avoiding every thing that might agitate them they at length resume their song and continue it during the greatest part of the year    the dartford warbler  le pitchou de provence buff this bird measures above five inches in length of which the tail is about one half its bill is long and slender and a little bent at the tip it is of a black color whitish at the base its eyes are reddish eyelids deep crimson all the upper parts are of a dark rusty brown tinged with dull yellow the breast part of the belly and thighs are of a deep red inclining to rust color the middle of the belly is white the bastard wing is also white the tail is dusky except the exterior web of the outer feather which is white the legs are yellow  this seems to be a rare bird in this country and owes its name with us to the accident of a pair of them having been seen near dartford in kent a few years ago they have since been observed in greater numbers and are supposed sometimes to winter with us buffon says they are natives of provence where they frequent gardens and feed on flies and small insects our representation was taken from a stuffed specimen in the wycliffe museum now in the possession of geo allan esquire of the grange near darlington  the redbreast robinredbreast or ruddock  motacilla rubecola lin  le rougegorge buff this general favorite is too well known to need a very minute description its bill is slender and delicate its eyes are large black and expressive and its aspect mild its head and all the upper parts of its body are brown tinged with a greenish olive its neck and breast are of a fine deep reddish orange a spot of the same color marks its forehead its belly and vent are of a dull white its legs are dusky  during the summer the redbreast is rarely to be seen it retires to woods and thickets where with its mate it prepares for the accommodation of its future family its nest is placed near the ground by the roots of trees in the most concealed spot and sometimes in old buildings it is constructed of moss intermixed with hair and dried leaves and lined with feathers in order more effectually to conceal it the bird covers its nest with leaves leaving only a narrow winding entrance under the heap the female lays from five to nine eggs of a dull white marked with reddish spots during the time of incubation the cock sits at no great distance and makes the woods resound with his delightful warble he keenly chases all the birds of his own species and drives them from his little settlement for as faithful as they are amorous it has never been observed that two pairs of these birds were ever lodged in the same bush unum arbustum non alit duos erithacos the redbreast prefers the thick shade where there is water it feeds on insects and worms its delicacy in preparing the latter is somewhat remarkable  it takes it by one end in its beak and beats it on the ground till the inward part comes away then taking it by the other in like manner cleanses it from all its impurities eating only the outward part or skin  although the redbreast never quits this island it performs a partial migration as soon as the business of incubation is over and the young are sufficiently grown to provide for themselves it leaves its retirement and again draws near the habitations of mankind its wellknown familiarity has attracted the attention and secured the protection of men in all ages it haunts the dwellings of the cottager and partakes of his humble fare when the cold grows severe and snow covers the ground it approaches the house taps at the window with its bill as if to entreat an asylum which is always cheerfully granted and with a simplicity the most delightful hops round the house picks up crumbs and seems to make himself one of the family  thomson has very beautifully described the annual visits of this little guest in the following lines the redbreast sacred to the household gods wisely regardful of the embroiling sky in joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves his shivering mates and pays to trusted man his annual visit half afraid he first against the window beats then brisk alights on the warm hearth then hopping over the floor eyes all the smiling family askance and pecks and starts and wonders where he is till more familiar grown the table crumbs attract his slender feet   the young redbreast when full feathered may be taken for a different bird being spotted all over with rustcoloured spots on a light ground the first appearance of the red is about the end of august but it does not arrive at its full color till the end of the following month redbreasts are never seen in flocks but always singly and when all other birds associate together they still retain their solitary habits buffon says that as soon as the young birds have attained their full plumage they prepare for their departure but in thus changing their situation they do not gather in flocks but perform their journey singly one after another which is a singular circumstance in the history of this bird its general familiarity has occasioned it to be distinguished by a peculiar name in many countries about bornholm it is called tomi liden in norway peter ronsmad in germany it is called thomas gierdet and with us robinredbreast or ruddock    the redstart redtail  motacilla phoenicurus lin  le rossignol de muraille buff this bird measures rather more than five inches in length its bill and eyes are black its forehead is white cheeks throat sore part and sides of the neck black which color extends over each eye the crown of its head hind part of its neck and back are of a deep blue gray in some subjects probably old ones this gray is almost black its breast rump and sides are of a fine glowing red inclining to orange color which extends to all the feathers of the tail except the two middle ones which are brown the belly is white feet and claws black the female differs considerably from the male the top of the head and back are of a gray ash color the chin is white and its color not so vivid  the redstart is migratory it appears about the middle of april and departs the latter end of september or beginning of october it frequents old walls and ruinous edifices where it makes its nest composed chiefly of moss lined with hair and feathers it is distinguished by a peculiar quick shake of its tail from side to side on its alighting on a wall or other place though a wild and timorous bird it is frequently found in the midst of cities always choosing the most difficult and inaccessible places for its residence it likewise builds in forests in holes of trees or in high and dangerous precipices the female lays four or five eggs not much unlike those of the hedgesparrow but somewhat longer these birds feed on flies spiders the eggs of ants small berries soft fruits and such like  the fauvette pettichaps  motacilla hippolais lin  la fauvette buff length about six inches its bill is blackish eyes dark hazel the whole upper part of the body is of a dark brown or mouse color lightly tinged with pale brown on the edges of the wing coverts and along the webs of the secondary quills the larger quills are of a dusky ash color as are also those of the tail except the outermost which are white on their exterior sides and tips over each eye there is a pale streak the throat and belly are of a silvery white legs dark brown  this bird frequents thickets and is seldom to be seen out of covert it secrets itself in the thickest parts of the bushes from whence it may be heard but not seen it is truly a mocking bird imitating the notes of various kinds generally beginning with those of the swallow and ending with the full song of the blackbird we have often watched with the utmost attention whilst it was singing delightfully in the midst of a bush close at hand but have seldom been able to obtain a sight of it we could never procure more than one specimen  its appearance with us does not seem to be regular as we have frequently been disappointed in not finding it in its usual haunts we suppose this to be the same with the fauvette of m buffon we have adopted the name of fauvette for want of a more appropriate term in our own language we apprehend this to be the flycatcher of mr pennant  br zool vol   d p       st ed  and the lesser pettichaps of latham which he says is known in yorkshire by the name of the beambird but he does not speak from his own knowledge of the bird it certainly is but little known and has no common name in this country which he places at the head of a numerous family consisting of ten distinct species many of which visit this island in the spring and leave it again in autumn these pretty warblers says he arrive when the trees put forth their leaves and begin to expand their blossoms they disperse through the whole extent of our plains some inhabit our gardens others prefer the clumps and avenues some conceal themselves among the reeds and many retire to the midst of the woods but notwithstanding their numbers this genus is confessedly the most obscure and indetermined in the whole of ornithology we have taken much pains to gain a competent knowledge of the various kinds which visit our island and have procured specimens of most if not all of them but confess that we have been much puzzled in reconciling their provincial names with the synonima of the different authors who have noticed them  the following is described by latham as a variety of the pettichaps and agrees in most respects with our specimen we conceive it to be the same as the passerinette of buffon allowing somewhat for difference of food climate etc    the lesser fauvette passerine warbler  motacilla passerina lin  le passerinette buff length nearly the same as the last bill pale brown upper parts of the body brown slightly tinged with olive green under parts dusky white a little inclining to brown across the breast quills dusky with pale edges tail dusky over each eye there is an indistinct whitish line legs pale brown the male and female are much alike the eggs are of a dull white irregularly marked with dusky and black spots  this bird is also a mocker but its song is not so powerful as the last  the winter fauvette hedge warbler hedge sparrow or dunnock  motacilla modularis lin  la fauvette dhiver buff the length of this wellknown bird is somewhat more than five inches its bill is dark eyes hazel its general appearance is that of a dusky brown most of the feathers on the back and wings being edged with reddish brown the cheeks throat and fore part of its neck are of a dull blueish ash color the belly is of a dirty white quills and tail dusky rump greenish brown sides and thighs pale tawny brown the legs are brown  this bird is frequently seen in hedges from whence it derives one of its names but it has no other relation to the sparrow than in the dinginess of its colors in every other respect it differs entirely it remains with us the whole year and builds its nest near the ground it is composed of moss and wool and lined with hair the female generally lays four or five eggs of a uniform pale blue without any spots the young are hatched about the beginning of may during the time of sitting if a cat or other voracious animal should happen to come near the nest the mother endeavors to divert it from the spot by a stratagem similar to that by which the partridge misleads the dog she springs up flutters from spot to spot and by that means allures her enemy to a safe distance in france the hedgesparrow is rarely seen but in winter it arrives generally in october and departs in the spring for more northern regions where it breeds it is supposed to brave the rigours of winter in sweden and that it assumes the white plumage common in those severe climates in that season its song is little varied but pleasant especially in a season when all the other warblers are silent its usual strain is a sort of quivering frequently repeating something like the following tittittititit from whence in some places it is called the titling we have already observed that the cuckoo frequently makes use of the nest of this bird to deposit her egg in  the reed fauvette sedge bird  motacilla salicaria lin  la fauvette de roseaux buff this elegant little bird is about the size of the blackcap its bill is dusky eyes hazel the crown of the head and back are brown marked with dusky streaks the rump tawny the cheeks are brown over each eye there is a light streak the wing coverts are dusky edged with pale brown as are also the quills and tail the throat breast and belly are white  the latter tinged with yellow the thighs are yellow legs dusky the hind claws are long and much bent  this bird is found in places where reeds and sedges grow and builds its nest there it is made of dried grass and tender fibers of plants and lined with hair and usually contains five eggs of a dirty white mottled with brown it likewise frequents the sides of rivers and ponds where there is covert it sings incessantly night and day during the breeding time imitating by turns the notes of the sparrow the swallow the skylark and other birds  from whence it is called the english mockbird buffon observes that the young ones though tender and not yet fledged will desert the nest if it be touched or even if a person go too near it this disposition which is common to all the fauvettes as well as to this which breeds in watery places seems to characterise the instinctive wildness of the whole species    the blackcap  motacilla atricapilla lin  la fauvette a tete noire buff this bird is in length somewhat above five inches the upper mandible is of a dark horn color the under one light blue  edges of both whitish top of the head black sides of the head and back of the neck ash color back and wings of an olive gray the throat and breast are of a silvery gray belly and vent white the legs are of a blueish color inclining to brown the claws black the head of the female is of a dull rust color  the blackcap visits us about the middle of april and retires in september it frequents gardens and builds its nest near the ground which is composed of dried grass moss and wool and lined with hair and feathers the female lays five eggs of a pale reddish brown sprinkled with spots of a darker color during the time of incubation the male attends the female and sits by turns he likewise procures her food such as flies worms and insects the blackcap sings sweetly and so like the nightingale that in norfolk it is called the mocknightingale buffon says that its airs are light and easy and consist of a succession of modulations of small compass but sweet flexible and blended and our ingenious countryman mr white observes that it has usually a full sweet deep loud and wild pipe yet the strain is of short continuance and its motions desultory but when this bird sits calmly and in earnest engages in song it pours forth very sweet but inward melody and expresses great variety of sweet and gentle modulations superior perhaps to any of our warblers the nightingale excepted and while they warble their throats are wonderfully distended blackcaps feed chiefly on flies and insects and not unfrequently on ivy and other berries    the whitethroat muggy  motacilla sylvia lin  la fauvette grise buff the length of this bird is about five inches and a half its bill is dark brown lighter at the base eyes dark hazel the upper part of the head and back are of a reddish ash color throat white lesser wing coverts pale brown the greater dusky brown with reddish margins breast and belly silvery white the wings and tail are dusky brown with pale edges the outer feathers white the legs pale brown the breast and belly of the female are entirely white  this bird arrives with the redstart blackcap etc in the spring and quits us in autumn about the same time with them it frequents thickets and hedges and feeds on insects and wild berries it makes its nest in thick bushes of dried grass and moss the female lays five eggs of a greenish white sprinkled with dark spots its note which is rather harsh and unpleasing is frequently repeated and is attended with a particular motion of the wings it is shy and wild and is not frequently found near the habitations of men  the yellow willow wren  motacilla trochilus lin  le pouillot ou le chantre buff length nearly five inches the bill is brown the inside and edges yellow eyes hazel the upper parts of the plumage are yellow inclining to a pale olive green the under pale yellow over each eye there is a whitish streak which in young birds we have observed to be particularly distinct the wings and tail are of a dusky brown with pale edges legs yellowish brown  the ingenious mr white observes that there are three distinct species of the willow wren of which this is the largest the two following differ in their size as well as note their form and manners are however very similar we have been fortunate in procuring specimens of each kind taken at the same time of the year and had an opportunity of noticing the difference of their song for specimens of all the birds of this kind as well as many others we are indebted to lieut h f gibson of the  th dragoons whose kind attention to our work merits our warmest acknowledgement  this bird is frequent on the tops of trees from whence it often rises singing its note is rather low but soft and sweetly varied it arrives in this country early in the spring and departs in autumn it makes its nest in holes at the roots of trees or in dry banks it is arched somewhat like that of the wren and is made chiefly of moss lined with wool and hair the female lays from five to seven eggs of a dirty white marked with reddish spots    the willow wren  le figuier brun et jaune buff this is next in size its bill is brown the upper parts of a greenish olive color darker than the last over each eye a light yellow line extends from the bill to the back part of the head the wings are brown with light yellowish edges the throat and breast are white with a pretty strong tinge of yellow the belly is whitish thighs yellow legs yellowish brown  as is likewise the inside of the bill they vary much in color  we are favored by the ingenious mr i gough of kendal with the description of a bird very similar to this which is common in westmoreland where it is known by the name of the strawsmeer it appears in the valleys in april a few days after the swallow and begins to sing immediately on its arrival and may be heard till the beginning of august it frequents hedges shrubberies and such like places its food consists of insects in search of which it is continually running up and down small branches of trees it makes an artless nest of withered grass moss and the slender stems of dried plants it is lined with feathers hair and a little wool and is commonly placed in a low thick bush or hedge the female generally lays five eggs of a dirty white marked at the larger end with numerous dark brown oval spots we suppose this to be the scotch warbler of mr pennant and the figuier bran et jaune of m buffon  the least willow wren the upper parts of the plumage of this bird are darker than the two last somewhat inclining to a mouse color its breast is of a dull silvery white from whence in some places it is called the lintywhite its legs are dark  the song of this is not so loud as the last though very similar and consists of a single strain very weak and frequently repeated they are both common in woods and coverts warbling their little simple song as they sit upon the branches of trees  the goldencrested wren  motacilla regulus lin  le roitelet buff this is supposed to be the least of all the european birds it is certainly the smallest of the british kinds being in length not quite three inches and a half the body when stripped of its feathers is not quite an inch long  buff and weighs only seventysix grains its bill is very slender and dark eyes hazel on the top of its head the feathers are of a bright orange color bordered on each side with black which forms an arch above its eyes and with which it sometimes conceals the crown by contracting the muscles of the head the upper part of the body is of a yellowish green or olive color all the under parts are of a pale reddish white tinged with green on the sides the greater coverts of the wings are of a dusky brown edged with yellow and tipped with white quills dusky edged with pale green as are also the feathers of the tail but lighter the legs are of a yellowish brown the female is distinguished by a pale yellow crown the whole plumage is less vivid than that of the male  this curious little bird delights in the largest trees such as oaks elms tall pines and firs particularly the first in which it finds both food and shelter in these it builds its nest which is of a round form having an aperture on one side and is composed chiefly of moss lined with the softest down mixed with slender filaments the female lays six or seven eggs scarcely larger than peace which are white sprinkled with very small spots of a dull color these birds are very agile and are almost continually in motion fluttering from branch to branch creeping on all sides of the trees clinging to them in every situation and often hanging like the titmouse their food consists chiefly of the smallest insects which they find in the crevices of the bark of trees or catch nimbly on the wing they also eat the eggs of insects small worms and various sorts of seeds the goldencrested wren is dissused throughout europe it has also been met with in various parts of asia and america and seems to bear every change of temperature from the greatest degree of heat to that of the severest cold it stays with us the whole year but mr pennant observes that it crosses annually from the orknies to the shetland isles where it breeds and returns before winter  a long flight of sixty miles for so small a bird its song is said to be very melodious but weaker than that of the common wren it has besides a sharp shrill cry somewhat like that of the grasshopper    the wren kitty wren  motacilla troglodytes lin  le troglodyte buff length three inches and a half the bill is slender and a little curved upper mandible and tips of a brownish horn color the under one and edges of both dull yellow a whitish line extends from the bill over the eyes which are dark hazel the upper parts of its plumage are of a clear brown obscurely marked on the back and rump with narrow double wavy lines of pale and dark brown colors the belly sides and thighs are the same but more distinct the throat is of a dingy white the cheeks and breast the same faintly dappled with brown the quills and tail are marked with alternate bars of a reddish brown and black the legs are of a pale olive brown  this diminutive little bird is very common in england and braves our severest winters which it contributes to enliven by its sprightly note during that season it approaches near the dwellings of man and takes shelter in the roofs of houses barns haystacks and holes in the walls it continues its song till late in the evening and not unfrequently during a fall of snow in the spring it betakes itself to the woods where it builds its nest near the ground in a low bush and sometimes on the turf beneath the trunk of a tree or in a hole in the wall its nest is constructed with much art being of an oval shape with one small aperture in the side for an entrance it is composed chiefly of moss and lined within with feathers the female lays from ten to sixteen and sometimes eighteen eggs of a dirty white dotted with red at the larger end    the whiterump wheatear  motacilla oenanthe lin  le motteux ou le culblanc buff length five inches and a half the bill is black eyes hazel from the base of the bill a black streak extends over the eyes cheeks and ears where it is pretty broad above this there is a line of white the top of the head back part of the neck and back are of a blueish gray the wing coverts and quills are dusky edged with rusty white the rump is perfectly white as is also part of the tail the rest is black the under parts are of a pale buff color tinged with red on the breast legs and feet black in the female the white line above the eye is somewhat obscure and all the black parts of the plumage incline more to brown neither is the rump of so pure a white  this bird visits us about the middle of march and from that time till some time in may is seen to arrive it frequents newtilled grounds and never fails to follow the plough in search of insects and small worms which are its principal food in some parts of england great numbers are taken in snares made of horse hair placed beneath a turf near  000 dozen are said to be taken annually in that way in one district only which are generally sold at sixpence per dozen pennant  great numbers are sent to the london markets where they are much esteemed being thought not inferior to the ortolan the whiterump breeds under shelter of a tuft or clod in newly ploughed lands or under stones and sometimes in old rabbit burrows its nest is constructed with great care it is composed of dry grass or moss mixed with wool and lined with feathers it is defended by a sort of covert fixed to the stone or clod under which it is formed the female generally lays five or six eggs of a light blue the larger end encompassed with a circle of a somewhat deeper hue they leave us in august and september and about that time are seen in great numbers by the seashore where probably they subsist some little time before they take their departure they are extended over a large portion of the globe even as far as the southern parts of asia  the whinchat  motacilla rubetra lin  le grand traquet ou le tarier buff this bird is somewhat larger than the stonechat its bill is black eyes hazel the feathers on the head neck and back are black edged with rust color a streak of white passes from the bill over each eye toward the back of the head the cheeks are blackish chin white the breast is of a rust color belly vent and thighs pale buff each wing is crossed by a white mark near the shoulder and another smaller near the bastard wing part of the tail at the base is white the rest black the two middle feathers are wholly black the legs are black the colors in general of the female are paler the white streak over the eye and the spots on the wings are much less conspicuous and the cheeks instead of being black partake of the colors on the head the whinchat is a solitary bird frequenting heaths and moors it has no song but only a simple unvaried note and in manners very much resembles the stonechat it makes its nest very similar to that bird and is generally seen in the same places during the summer months the female lays five eggs of a dirty white dotted with black in the northern parts of england it disappears in winter but its migration is only partial as it is seen in some of the southern counties at that season it feeds on worms flies and insects  about the end of summer it is very fat and at that time is said to be scarcely inferior in delicacy to the ortolan    the stonechat stonesmith moor titling  motacilla rubecola lin  le traquet buff length near five inches the bill is black eyes dark hazel the head neck and throat are black faintly mixed with brown on each side of the neck immediately above the wings there is a large white spot the back and wing coverts are of a fine velvet black margined with reddish brown the quills are dusky with pale brown edges  those next the body are white at the bottom forming a spot of that color on the wings the breast is of a bay color lightest on the belly the rump white the tail is black the outer feathers margined with rust color the legs are black the colors of the female are duller the white on the sides of the neck is not so conspicuous the breast and belly are much paler and the white spot on the rump is wanting  this solitary little bird is chiefly to be found on wild heaths and commons where it feeds on small worms and insects of all kinds it builds its nest at the roots of bushes or underneath stones it carefully conceals the entrance to it by a variety of little arts it generally alights at some distance from it and makes its approaches with great circumspection creeping along the ground in a winding direction so that it is a difficult matter to discover its retreat the female breeds about the end of march and lays five or six eggs of a blueish green faintly spotted with rust color the flight of the stonechat is low it is almost continually on the wing flying from bush to bush alighting only for a few seconds it remains with us the whole year and in winter is known to frequent moist places in quest of food buffon compares its note to the word wistrata frequently repeated mr latham observes that it seemed to him like the clicking of two stones together from whence it is probable it may have derived its name    of the titmouse this diminutive tribe is distinguished by a peculiar degree of sprightliness and vivacity to which may be added a degree of strength and courage which by no means agrees with its appearance  birds of this class are perpetually in motion they run with great celerity along the branches of trees searching for their food in every little cranny where the eggs of insects are deposited which is their favorite food during spring they are frequently observed to be very busy amongst the opening buds searching for the caterpillars which are lodged therein and are thus actively employed in preventing the mischiefs that would arise from a too great increase of these destructive insects whilst at the same time they are intent on the means of their own preservation they will likewise eat small pieces of raw meat particularly fat of which they are very fond none of this kind have been observed to migrate they sometimes make short flittings from place to place in quest of food but never entirely leave us  they are very bold and daring and will attack birds much larger than themselves with great intrepidity buffon says they pursue the owl with great fury and that in their attacks they aim chiefly at the eyes their actions on these occasions are attended with a swell of the feathers and with a succession of violent attitudes and rapid movements which strongly mark the bitterness of their rage they will sometimes attack birds smaller and weaker than themselves which they kill and having picked a hole in the skull they eat out the brains the nests of most of this kind are constructed with the most exquisite art and with materials of the utmost delicacy some species with great sagacity build them at the extreme end of small branches projecting over water by which means they are effectually secured from the attacks of serpents and the smaller beasts of prey these birds are very widely spread over every part of the old continent from the northern parts of europe to the cape of good hope as well as to the farthest parts of india china and japan they are likewise found throughout the vast continent of america and in several of the west india islands they are every where prolific even to a proverb laying a great number of eggs which they attend with great solicitude and provide for their numerous progeny with indefatigable activity all the titmice are distinguished by short bills which are conical a little flattened at the sides and very sharp pointed the nostrils are small and round and are generally covered by short bristly feathers reflected from the forehead the tongue seems as if cut off at the end and terminated by short filaments the toes are divided to their origin the back toe is very large and strong  the greater titmouse oxeye  parus major lin  le gross mesange buff the length of this bird is about five inches the bill is black as are also the eyes the head is covered with a sort of hood of a fine deep glossy black which extends to the middle of the neck the cheeks are white the belly is of a greenish yellow divided down the middle by a line of black reaching to the vent the back is of an olive green rump blue gray the quills are dusky the greater edged with white the lesser with pale green the wing coverts are of a blueish ash color the greater coverts are tipped with white which forms a bar across the wing the tail is black the exterior edge of the outer feathers is white the legs are of a dark lead color claws black  the titmouse begins to pair early in february the male and female consort for some time before they make their nest which is composed of the softest and most downy materials  they build it generally in the hole of a tree the female lays from eight to ten eggs which are white spotted with rust color buffon says that the young brood continue blind for several days after which their growth is very rapid and they are able to fly in about fifteen days after they have quitted the nest they return no more to it but perch on the neighboring trees and incessantly call on each other they generally continue together till the approach of spring invites them to pair we kept one of these birds in a cage for some time it was fed chiefly with hemp seed which instead of breaking with its bill like the linnet it held very dexterously in its claws and pecked it till it broke the outside shell it likewise ate raw flesh minced small and was extremely fond of flies which when held to the cage it would seize with great avidity it was continually in motion during the day and would for hours together dart backwards and forwards with astonishing activity its usual note was strong and simple it had besides a more varied but very low and not unpleasant song  during the night it rested on the bottom of the cage  the blue titmouse tom tit bluecap or nun  parus coeruleus lin  la mesange bleue buff the length of this beautiful little bird is about four inches and a half the bill and eyes are black crown of the head blue terminated behind with a line of dirty white sides of the head white underneath which from the throat to the back of the neck there is a line of dark blue from the bill on each side a narrow line of black passes through the eyes the back is of a yellowish green coverts blue edged with white quills black with pale blue edges the tail is blue the two middle feathers longest the under parts of the body pale yellow legs and claws black the female is somewhat smaller than the male has less blue on the head and her colors in general are not so bright  this busy little bird is seen frequently in our gardens and orchards where its operations are much dreaded by the overanxious gardener who fears lest in its pursuit after its favorite food which is often lodged in the tender buds that it may destroy them also to the injury of his future harvest  not considering that it is the means of destroying a much more dangerous enemy the caterpillar which it finds there it has likewise a strong propensity to flesh and is said to pick the bones of such small birds as it can master as clean as skeletons this bird is distinguished above all the rest of the titmice by its rancour against the owl  the female builds her nest in holes of walls or trees which it lines well with feathers she lays from fourteen to twenty white eggs if her eggs should be touched by any person or one of them be broken she immediately forsakes her nest and builds again but otherwise makes but one hatch in the year    the coletitmouse  parus ater lin  le petite charbonniere buff this bird is somewhat less than the last and weighs only two drachms its length is four inches its bill is black as are also its head throat and part of its breast from the corner of the bill on each side an irregular patch of white passes under the eyes extending to the sides of the neck a spot of the same color occupies the hind part of the head the back and all the upper parts are of a greenish ash color the wing coverts are tipped with white which forms two bars across the wing the under parts are of a reddish white legs lead color tail somewhat forked at the end  the marsh titmouse blackcapped titmouse  parus palustris lin  le mesange de marais buff its length is somewhat short of five inches its bill is black the whole crown of the head and part of the neck behind are of a deep black a broad streak of a yellowish white passes from the beak underneath the eye backwards the throat is black the breast belly and sides are of a dirty white the back is ashcolored quill feathers dusky with pale edges the tail is dusky legs dark lead color  the marsh titmouse is said to be fond of wasps bees and other insects  it lays up a little store of seeds against a season of want it frequents marshy places from whence it derives its name its manners are similar to the last and it is equally as prolific  the longtailed titmouse  parus caudatus lin  la mesange a longue queue buff the length of this bird is nearly five inches and a half of which the tail itself is rather more than three inches its bill is very short and black eyes hazel the orbits red the top of the head is white mixed with gray through each eye there is a broad black band which extends backwards and unites on the hind part of the head from whence it passes down the back to the rump bordered on each side with dull red the cheeks throat and breast are white the belly sides rump and vent are of a dull rose color mixed with white the coverts of the wings are black those next the body white edged with rose color the quills are dusky with pale edges the tail consists of feathers of very unequal lengths the four middle feathers are wholly black the others are white on the exterior edge legs and claws black  our figure was taken from one newly shot sent us by lieut h f gibson we made a drawing from a stuffed bird in the museum of the late mr tunstall at wycliffe in which the black band through the eyes was wholly wanting the back of the neck was black the back sides and thighs were of a reddish brown mixed with white we suppose it may have been a female the nest of this bird is singularly curious and elegant being of a long oval form with a small hole in the side as an entrance its outside is formed of moss wool and dry grass curiously interwoven whilst the inside is thickly lined with a profusion of the softest down in some places it is called a featherpoke  in this comfortable little mansion the female deposits her eggs to the number of sixteen or seventeen which are concealed almost entirely among the feathers they are about the size of a small bean and of a grayish color mixed with red  this bird is not uncommon with us it frequents the same places with the other species feeds in the same manner and is charged with the same misdemeanor in destroying the buds and probably with the same reason it flies very swiftly and from its slender shape and the great length of its tail it seems like a dart shooting through the air it is almost constantly in motion running up and down the branches of trees with great facility the young continue with the parents and form little flocks through the winter they utter a small shrill cry only as a call but in the spring they are said to acquire a very melodious song the longtailed titmouse is found in the northern regions of europe and from the thickness of its coat seems well calculated to bear the rigours of a severe climate mr latham says that it has likewise been brought from jamaica and observes that it appeared as fully clothed as in the coldest regions    the bearded titmouse  parus biarmicus lin  la mesange barbue buff length somewhat more than six inches the bill is of an orange color but so delicate that it changes on the death of the bird to a dingy yellow the eyes are also orange the head and back part of the neck are of a pearl gray or light ash color on each side of the head from the eye there is a black mark extending downwards on the neck and ending in a point not unlike a mustachoe the throat and fore part of the neck are of a silvery white the back rump and tail are of a light rust color as are also the belly sides and thighs the breast is of a delicate flesh color the vent black the lesser coverts of the wings are dusky the greater rust color with pale edges the quills are dusky edged with white  those next the body with rusty on the exterior web and with white on the inner the bastard wing is dusky edged and tipped with white the legs are black  the female wants the black mark on each side of the head the crown of the head is rust color spotted with black the vent feathers are not black but of the same color with the belly  the bearded titmouse is found chiefly in the southern parts of the kingdom it frequents marshy places where reeds grow on the seeds of which it feeds it is supposed to breed there though its history is imperfectly known it is said that they were first brought to this country from denmark by the countess of albemarle and that some of them having made their escape founded a colony here but mr latham with great probability supposes that they are ours ab origin and that it is owing to their frequenting the places where reeds grow and which are not easily accessible that so little has been known of them mr edwards gives a figure of this bird and describes it under the name of the least butcher bird  of the swallow of all the various families of birds which resort to this island for food and shelter there is none which has occasioned so many conjectures respecting its appearance and departure as the swallow tribe  of this we have already hazarded our opinion in the introductory part of our work to which we refer our readers the habits and modes of living of this tribe are perhaps more conspicuous than those of any other from the time of their arrival to that of their departure they seem continually before our eyes  the swallow lives habitually in the air and performs its various functions in that element and whether it pursues its fluttering prey and follows the devious windings of the insects on which it feeds or endeavors to escape the birds of prey by the quickness of its motion it describes lines so mutable so varied so interwoven and so confused that they hardly can be pictured by words  the swallow tribe is of all others most inoffensive harmless entertaining and social all except one species attach themselves to our houses amuse us with their migrations songs and mavelous agility and clear the air of gnats and other troublesome insects which would otherwise much annoy and incommode us whoever contemplates the myriads of insects that sport in the sunbeams of a summer evening in this country will soon be convinced to what a degree our atmosphere would be choked with them were it not for the friendly interposition of the swallow tribe whites selborne not many attempts have been made to preserve swallows alive during the winter and of these few have succeeded the following experiments by mr james pearson of london communicated to us by sir john trevelyan bart are highly interesting and throw great light upon the natural history of the swallow we shall give them nearly in mr pearsons own words  five or six of these birds were taken about the latter end of august      in a bat fowling net at night they were put separately into small cages and fed with nightingales food in about a week or ten days they took the food of themselves they were then put all together into a deep cage four feet long with gravel at the bottom a broad shallow pan with water was placed in it in which they sometimes washed themselves and seemed much strengthened by it one day mr pearson observed that they went into the water with unusual eagerness hurrying in and out again repeatedly with such swiftness as if they had been suddenly seized with a frenzy being anxious to see the result he left them to themselves about half an hour and on going to the cage again sound them all huddled together in a corner of the cage apparently dead the cage was then placed at a proper distance from the fire when two of them only recovered and were as healthy as before  the rest died the two remaining ones were allowed to wash themselves occasionally for a short time only but their feet soon after became swelled and inflamed which mr p attributed to their perching and they died about christmas thus the first years experiment was in some measure lost not discouraged by the failure of this mr p determined to make a second trial the succeeding year from a strong desire of being convinced of the truth respecting their going into a state of torpidity accordingly the next season having taken some more birds he put them into the cage and in every respect pursued the same methods as with the last but to guard their feet from the bad effects of the damp and cold he covered the perches with flannel and had the pleasure to observe that the birds throve extremely well they sung their song through the winter and soon after christmas began to moult which they got through without any difficulty and lived three or four years regularly moulting every year at the usual time on the renewal of their feathers it appeared that their tails were forked exactly the same as in those birds which return here in the spring and in every respect their appearance was the same these birds says mr pearson were exhibited to the society for promoting natural history on the   th day of february      at the time they were in a deep moult during a severe frost when the snow was on the ground minutes of this circumstance were entered in the books of the society these birds died at last from neglect during a long illness which mr pearson had  they died in the summer mr p concludes his very interesting account in these words jan  0       i have now in my house no    great newportstreet longacre four swallows in moult in as perfect health as any birds ever appeared to be in when moulting  the result of these experiments pretty clearly proves that swallows do not in any material instance differ from other birds in their nature and propensities but that they leave us like many other birds when this country can no longer furnish them with a supply of their proper and natural food and that consequently they seek it in other places where they meet with that support which enables them to throw off their feathers swallows are found in every country of the known world but seldom remain the whole year in the same climate the times of their appearance and departure in this country are well known they are the constant harbingers of spring and on their arrival all nature assumes a more cheerful aspect the bill of this genus is short very broad at the base and a little bent the head is flat and the neck scarcely visible the tongue is short broad and cloven tail mostly forked wings long legs short  the chimney swallow houseswallow  hirundo rustica lin  lhirondelle domestique buff length somewhat more than six inches its bill is black eyes hazel the forehead and chin are red inclining to chestnut the whole upper part of the body is black reflected with a purplish blue on the top of the head and scapulars the quills of the wings according to their different positions are sometimes of a blueish black and sometimes of a greenish brown whilst those of the tail are black with green reflections the fore part of the breast is black and the rest of the breast and belly white the inside and corners of the mouth are yellow the tail is much forked each feather except the middle ones is marked with an oval white spot on the inner web the legs are very short delicately fine and blackish  the common swallow makes its appearance with us soon after the vernal equinox and leaves us again about the end of september it builds its nest generally in chimnies in the inside within a few feet of the top or under the eaves of houses it is curiously constructed of a cylindrical shape plastered with mud mixed with straw and hair and lined with feathers it is attached to the sides or corners of the chimney and is sometimes a foot in height open at the top the female lays five or six eggs white speckled with red swallows return to the same haunts they build annually a new nest and fix it if the place admits above that occupied the preceding year buffon we are favored by sir john trevelyan bart with the following curious fact  at camerton hall near bath a pair of swallows built their nest on the upper part of the frame of an old picture over the chimney coming through a broken pane in the window of the room they came three years successively and in all probability would have continued to do so if the room had not been put into repair which prevented their access to it both this bird and the martin have generally two broods in the year the first in june the other in august or perhaps later we have seen a young swallow which was shot on the   th of september its length was scarcely five inches its tail was short and not forked the feathers were black but wanted the white spots its breast was tinged with red swallows frequently roost at night after they begin to congregate by the sides of rivers and pools of water from whence it has been supposed that they retire into that element    the martin martlet martinet or windowswallow  hirundo urbica lin  lhirondelle a cul blanc buff length about five inches and a half the bill is black eyes dark hazel inside of the mouth yellow the top of the head the wings and tail are of a dusky brown the back is black glossed with blue the rump and all the under parts of the body from the chin to the vent are of a pure white the ends of the secondary quill feathers are finely edged with white the legs are covered with white downy feathers down to the claws which are white also and are very sharp and much hooked the middle toe is much longer than the others and is connected with the inner one as far as the first joint  this bird visits us in great numbers it has generally two broods sometimes three in the year it builds its nest most frequently against the crags of precipices near the sea or by the sides of lakes and not unfrequently under the eaves of houses or close by the sides of the windows its nest is made of mud and straw on the outside and is lined within with feathers the first hatch the female lays five eggs which are white inclining to dusky at the larger end the second time she lays three or four and the third when that takes place she only lays two or three during the time the young birds are confined to the nest the old one feeds them adhering by the claws to the outside but as soon as they are able to fly they receive their nourishment on the wing by a motion quick and almost imperceptible to those who are not accustomed to observe it the martin arrives somewhat later than the swallow and does not leave us so soon we have observed them in the neighborhood of london as late as the middle of october mr white in his natural history of selborne has made some very judicious remarks on these birds with a view to illustrate the time and manner of their annual migrations the following quotation is very apposite to that purpose and serves to confirm the idea that the greatest part of them quit this island in search of warmer climates as the summer declines the congregating flocks increase in numbers daily by the constant accession of the second broods till at last they swarm in myriads upon myriads round the villages on the thames darkening the face of the sky as they frequent the aits of that river where they roost they retire in vast flocks together about the beginning of october he adds that they appeared of late years in considerable numbers in the neighborhood of selborne for one day or two as late as november the  d and  th after they were supposed to have been gone for more than a fortnight he concludes with this observation  unless these birds are very shortlived indeed or unless they do not return to the district where they have been bred they must undergo vast devastations somehow and somewhere for the birds that return yearly bear no manner of proportion to those that retire    the sand martin bank martin or sand swallow  hirundo riparia lin  lhirondelle de rivage buff length about four inches and three quarters the bill is of a dark horn color the head neck breast and back are of a mouse color over each eye there is a light streak the throat and fore part of the neck are white as are also the belly and vent the wings and tail are brown the legs are dark brown and are furnished with feathers behind which reach as far as the toes  this is the smallest of all our swallows as well as the least numerous of them it frequents the steep sandy banks in the neighborhood of rivers in the sides of which it makes deep holes and places the nest at the end it is carelessly constructed of straw dry grass and feathers the female lays five or six white eggs almost transparent and is said to have only one brood in the year  the swift black martin or deviling  hirundo apus lin  le martinet noir buff length near eight inches bill black eyes hazel its general color is that of a sooty black with greenish reflections the throat is white the wings are long measuring from tip to tip about eighteen inches the tail is much forked the legs are of a dark brown color and very short the toes stand two and two on each side of the foot and consist of two phalanges or joints only which is a conformation peculiar to this bird the female is rather less than the male her plumage inclines more to brown and the white on the throat is less distinct  the swift arrives later and departs sooner than any of the tribe from whence it is probable that it has a longer journey to take than the others it is larger stronger and its flight is more rapid than any of its kindred tribes and it has but one brood in the year so that the young ones have time to gain strength enough to accompany the parent birds in their distant excursions they have been noticed at the cape of good hope and probably visit the more remote regions of asia swifts are almost continually on the wing they fly higher and wheel with bolder wing than the swallows with which they never intermingle the life of the swift seems to be divided into two extremes the one of the most violent exertion the other of perfect inaction they must either shoot through the air or remain close in their holes they are seldom seen to alight but if by any accident they should fall upon a piece of even ground it is with difficulty they can recover themselves owing to the shortness of their feet and the great length of their wings they are said to avoid heat and for this reason pass the middle of the day in their holes in the morning and evening they go out in quest of provision they then are seen in large flocks describing an endless series of circles upon circles sometimes in close ranks pursuing the direction of a street and sometimes whirling round a large edifice all screaming together they often glide along without stirring their wings and on a sudden they move them with frequent and quickly repeated strokes swifts build their nests in elevated places lofty steeples and high towers are generally preferred sometimes they build under the arches of bridges where though the elevation is not great it is difficult of access the nest is composed of a variety of materials such as dry grass moss hemp bits of cord threads of silk and linen small shreds of gauze of muslin feathers and other light substances which they chance to find in the sweepings of towns buffon it is difficult to conceive how these birds which are never seen to alight on the ground gather these materials some have supposed that they catch them in the air as they are carried up by the wind others that they raise them by glancing along the surface of the ground whilst others assert with more probability that they often rob the sparrow of its little hoard and frequently occupy the same hole after driving out the former possessor the female lays five white eggs rather pointed and spindleshaped the young ones are hatched about the latter end of may they begin to fly about the middle of june and shortly after abandon their nests  after which the parents seem no more to regard them  swifts begin to assemble previous to their departure early in july their numbers daily increase and large bodies of them appear together they soar higher in the air with shriller cries and fly differently from their usual mode  these meetings continue till toward the middle of august after which they are no more seen  the nightjar goatsucker dorrhawk or fern owl  caprimulgus europeus lin  lengoulivent buff the length of this bird is about ten inches and a half the bill is small flat and somewhat hooked at the tip and is furnished on each side of the upper mandible with several strong bristles whereby it secures its prey the lower jaw is edged with a white stripe which extends backward toward the head the eyes are large full and black the plumage is beautifully freckled and powdered with browns of various hues mixed with rust color and white but so diversified as to exceed all description the male is distinguished by an oval spot of white on the inner webs of the three first quill feathers and at the ends of the two outermost feathers of the tail the legs are short rough and scaly and feathered below the knee the toes are connected by a membrane as far as the first joint the middle one is considerably larger than the rest and the claw is serrated in one side  to avoid as much as possible perpetuating error we have dropped the term goatsucker which has no foundation but in ignorance and superstition and have adopted one which though not universally known bears some analogy to the nature and qualities of the bird to which it relates both with respect to the time of its appearance which is always in the dusk of the evening in search of its prey as well as to the jarring noise which it utters whilst at rest perching on a tree and by which it is peculiarly distinguished the nightjar is found in every part of the old continent from siberia to greece africa and india it arrives in this country about the latter end of may being one of our latest birds of passage and departs some time in the latter end of august or the beginning of september it is no where numerous and never appears in flocks like the owl it is seldom seen in the daytime unless disturbed or in dark and gloomy days when its eyes are not dazzled by the bright rays of the sun it feeds on insects which it catches on the wing it is a great destroyer of the cockchafer or dorbeetle from whence in some places it is called the dorhawk six of these insects have been found in its stomach besides four or five largebodied moths mr white supposes that its foot is useful in taking its prey as he observed that it frequently put forth its leg whilst on the wing with which it seemed to convey something to its mouth these birds frequent moors and wild heathy tracts abounding with ferns they make no nest but the female deposits her eggs on the ground she lays only two or three which are of a dull white spotted with brown birds of this kind are seen most frequently toward autumn their motions are irregular and rapid sometimes wheeling in quick succession round a tree or other object diving at intervals as if to catch their prey and then rising again as suddenly when perched the nightjar sits usually on a bare twig its head lower than its tail and in this attitude utters its jarring note it is likewise distinguished by a sort of buzzing which it makes while on the wing which has been compared to the noise caused by the quick rotation of a spinningwheel from which in some places it is called the wheelbird sometimes it utters a small plaintive note or squeak which it repeats four or five times in succession the latter probably is its note of call by which it invites the female and which it has been observed to utter when in pursuit of her buffon says that it does not perch like other birds sitting across the branch but lengthwise it is a solitary bird and is generally seen alone two being seldom found together but sitting at a little distance from each other  of the dove kind the various families which constitute this beautiful kind are distinguished by shades and gradations so minute as to exceed all description of these by far the largest portion are the willing attendants on man and dependent on his bounty but when we consider the lightness of their bodies the great strength of their wings and the amazing rapidity of their flight it is a matter of wonder that they should submit even to a partial kind of domestication or occupy those tenements fitted up for the purpose of breeding and rearing their young it must be observed however that in these they live rather as voluntary captives or transient guests than permanent or settled inhabitants enjoying a considerable portion of that liberty they so much delight in on the slightest disappointment they abandon their mansion with all its conveniences some take refuge in the woods where impelled by instinct they resume their native manners others seek a solitary lodgment in the holes of old walls or unfrequented towers whilst others still more domesticated seldom leave their dwelling and only roam abroad to seek amusement or to procure subsistence  of these the varieties and intermixtures are innumerable and partake of all those varied hues which are the constant result of domestication  the manners of pigeons are well known few species being more universally diffused and having a very powerful wing they are enabled to perform very distant journies accordingly wild and tame pigeons occur in every climate and although they thrive best in warm countries yet with care they succeed also in very northern latitudes every where their manners are gentle and lively they are fond of society and the very emblem of connubial attachment they are faithful to their mates whom they solicit with the softest cooings the tenderest caresses and the most graceful movements the exterior form of the pigeon is beautiful and elegant the bill is weak straight and slender and has a soft protuberance at the base in which the nostrils are placed the legs are short and red and the toes divided to the origin    the wild pigeon stock dove  columba oenas lin  le biset buff length fourteen inches bill pale red the head neck and upper part of the back are of a deep blue gray color reflected on the sides of the neck with glossy green and gold the breast is of a pale reddish purple or vinous color the lower part of the back and rump light gray or ash color as are also the belly thighs and under tail coverts the primary quill feathers are dusky edged with white the others gray marked with two black spots on the exterior webs forming two bars across each wing the tail is ash color and black at the end the lower half of the two outermost feathers is white the legs are red claws black  the stock dove rock pigeon and wood pigeon with some small differences may be included under the same denomination and are probably the origin of most of those beautiful varieties which in a state of domestication are dependent upon man for food  wild pigeons are said to migrate in large flocks into england at the approach of winter from the northern regions and return in the spring many of them however remain in this country only changing their quarters for the purpose of procuring their food they build their nests in the hollows of decayed trees and commonly have two broods in the year in a state of domestication their increase is prodigious and though they never lay more than two eggs at a time yet allowing them to breed nine times in the year the produce of a single pair at the expiration of four years may amount to the enormous number of       stillingfleets tracts the male and female perform the office of incubation by turns and feed their young by casting up the provisions out of their stomachs into the mouths of the young ones to describe the numerous varieties of the domestic pigeon would exceed the limits of our work we shall therefore barely mention the names of the most noted amongst them such as tumblers carriers jacobines croppers powters runts turbits shakers smiters owls nuns etc of these the carrier pigeon is the most remarkably deserving of notice having been made use of in very early times as the means of conveying intelligence on the most trying and important occasions and with an expedition and certainty which could be equalled by no other the pigeon used on these occasions was taken from the place to which the advices were to be communicated and the letters being tied under its wings the bird was let loose and in spite of surrounding armies and every obstacle that would have effectually prevented any other means of conveyance guided by instinct alone it returned directly home where the intelligence was so much wanted there are various instances on record of these birds having been employed during a siege to convey an account of its progress of the situation of the besieged and of the probable means of relief sometimes they were the peaceful bearer of glad tidings to the anxious lover and to the merchant of the no less welcome news of the safe arrival of his vessel at the desired port  the ring dove cushat or queest  columba palumbus lin  le pigeon ramier buff this is the largest of all the pigeon tribe and measures above seventeen inches in length the bill is of a pale red color the nostrils being covered with a mealy red fleshy membrane the eyes are pale yellow the upper parts of the body are of a blueish ash color deepest on the upper part of the back the lower part of which the rump and fore part of the neck and head are of a pale ash color the lower part of the neck and breast are of a vinous ash color and the belly thighs and vent are of a dull white on the hind part of the neck is a semicircular line of white  from whence its name  above and beneath which the feathers are glossy and of a changeable hue in different lights the greater quills are dusky and all of them except the outermost edged with white from the point of the wing a white line extends downwards passing above the bastard wing the tail is ash color tipped with black the legs are red and partly covered with feathers the claws are black  our figure was taken from specimens sent us by john trevelyan esquire and mr bailey of chillingham  the ring dove is very generally diffused throughout europe it is said to be migratory but that it does not leave us entirely we are well convinced as we have frequently seen them during the winter on the banks of the tyne where they constantly breed the nest is composed of small twigs so loosely put together that the eggs may be seen through it from below the female lays two eggs and is generally supposed to have two broods in the year they feed on wild fruits herbs and grain of all kinds they will likewise eat turnips which give their flesh an unpleasant flavor the ring dove has a louder and more plaintive sort of cooing than the common pigeon but is not heard except in pairing time or during fine weather when it rains or in the gloom of winter it is generally silent their flesh is excellent especially when young  the turtle dove  columba turtur lin  la tourterelle buff length somewhat more than twelve inches the bill is brown eyes yellow encompassed with a crimson circle the top of the head is ash color mixed with olive each side of the neck is marked with a spot of black feathers tipped with white the back is ash color each feather margined with reddish brown wing coverts and scapulars reddish brown spotted with black quill feathers dusky with pale edges the fore part of the neck and breast are of a light purplish red the belly thighs and vent white the two middle feathers of the tail are brown the others dusky tipped with white the two outermost edged and tipped with white the legs are red  one of these birds which was sent us by the rev henry ridley was shot out of a flock at prestwickcarr in northumberland in the month of september      it agreed in every respect with the common turtle excepting the mark on each side of the neck which was wholly wanting we suppose it to have been a young bird the note of the turtle dove is singularly tender and plaintive in addressing his mate the male makes use of a variety of winning attitudes cooing at the same time in the most gentle and soothing accents on this account the turtle dove has been represented in all ages as the most perfect emblem of connubial attachment and constancy the turtle arrives late in the spring and departs about the latter end of august it frequents the thickest and most sheltered parts of the woods where it builds its nest on the highest trees the female lays two eggs and has only one brood in this country but in warmer climates it is supposed to breed several times in the year turtles are pretty common in kent where they are sometimes seen in flocks of twenty or more frequenting the pea fields and are said to do much damage their stay with us seldom exceeds more than four or five months during which time they pair build their nests breed and rear their young which are strong enough to join them in their retreat  of the gallinaceous kind we are now to speak of a very numerous and useful class of birds which by the bountiful disposition of providence is diffused throughout every country of the world affording every where a plentiful and grateful supply of the most delicate wholesome and nutritious food a large portion of these seem to have left their native woods to crowd around the dwellings of man where subservient to his purpose they subsist upon the pickings of the barnyard the stable or the dunghill a cheerful active race which enlivens and adorns the rural scene and requires no other care than the fostering hand of the housewife to shelter and protect it some kinds such as the partridge the pheasant and the like are found only in cultivated places at no great distance from the habitations of men and although they have not submitted to his dominion they are nevertheless subject to his controuling power and the object of his keenest attention and pursuit  whilst others taking a wider range find food and shelter in the deepest recesses of the woods and forests sometimes subsisting upon wild and heathy mountains or among rocks and precipices of the most difficult access the characters of this class are generally well known they are distinguished above all others for the whiteness of their flesh their bodies are large and bulky and their heads comparatively small the bill in all of them is short strong and somewhat curved their wings are short and concave and scarcely able to support their bodies on which account they seldom make long excursions their legs are strong and are furnished with a spur or knob behind  birds of this kind are extremely prolific and lay a great number of eggs the young follow the mother as soon as hatched and immediately learn to pick up the food which she is most assiduous in showing them on this account she generally makes her nest on the ground or in places of easy access to her young brood  our gallant chanticleer holds a distinguished rank in this class of birds and stands foremost in the list of our domestic tribes on which account we shall place him at the head    the domestic cock  phasianus gallus lin  le coq buff the cock like the dog in his present state of domestication differs so widely from his wild original as to render it a difficult matter to trace him back to his primitive stock however it is generally agreed that he is to be found in a state of nature in the forests of india and in most of the islands of the indian seas the varieties of this species are endless every country and almost every district of each country producing a different kind from asia where they are supposed to have originated they have been diffused over every part of the inhabited world america was the last to receive them it has been said that they were first introduced into brazil by the spaniards they are now as common in all the inhabited parts of that vast continent as with us of those which have been selected for domestic purposes in this country the principal are    the crested cock of which there are several varieties such as the whitecrested black ones the blackcrested white ones the gold and silver ones etc    the hamburgh cock named also velvet breeches because its thighs and belly are of a soft black buffon this is a very large kind and much used for the table    the bantam or dwarf cock a diminutive but very spirited breed its legs are furnished with long feathers which reach to the ground behind it is very courageous and will fight with one much stronger than itself    the frizzled cock the feathers in this are so curled up that they seem reversed and to stand in opposite directions they are originally from the southern parts of asia and when young are extremely sensible of cold they have a disordered and unpleasant appearance but are in much esteem for the table  we shall finish our list with the english gamecock which stands unrivalled by those of any other nation for its invincible courage and on that account is made use of as the instrument of the cruel sport of cockfighting to trace this custom to its origin we must look back into barbarous times and lament that it still continues the disgrace of an enlightened and philosophic age the athenians allotted one day in the year to cockfighting the romans are said to have learned it from them and by that warlike people it was first introduced into this island henry viii was so attached to the sport that he caused a commodious house to be erected for that purpose which though it is now applied to a very different use still retains the name of the cockpit the chinese and many of the nations of india are so extravagantly fond of this unmanly sport that during the paroxysms of their phrenzy they will sometimes risk not only the whole of their property but their wives and children on the issue of a battle  the appearance of the gamecock when in his full plumage and not mutilated for the purpose of fighting is strikingly beautiful and animated his head which is small is adorned with a beautiful red comb and wattles his eyes sparkle with fire and his whole demeanor bespeaks boldness and freedom the feathers on his neck are long and fall gracefully down upon his body which is thick firm and compact his tail is long and forms a beautiful arch behind which gives a grace to all his motions his legs are strong and are armed with sharp spurs with which he defends himself and attacks his adversary when surrounded by his females his whole aspect is full of animation he allows of no competitor but on the approach of a rival he rushes forward to instant combat and either drives him from the field or perishes in the attempt the cock is very attentive to his females hardly ever losing sight of them he leads defends and cherishes them collects them together when they straggle and seems to eat unwillingly till he sees them feeding around him when he loses them he utters his griefs and from the different inflexions of his voice and the various significant gestures which he makes one would be led to conclude that it is a species of language which serves to communicate his sentiments the fecundity of the hen is great she lays generally two eggs in three days and continues to lay through the greatest part of the year except during the time of moulting which lasts about two months after having laid about twentyfive or thirty eggs she prepares for the painful talk of incubation and gives the most certain indications of her wants by her cries and the violence of her emotions if she should be deprived of her own eggs which is frequently the case she will cover those of any other kind or even fictitious ones of stone or chalk by which means she wastes herself in fruitless efforts a sitting hen is a lively emblem of the most affectionate solicitude and attention she covers her eggs with her wings fosters them with a genial warmth changing them gently that all parts may be properly heated she seems to perceive the importance of her employment and is so intent in her occupation that she neglects in some measure the necessary supplies of food and drink she omits no care overlooks no precaution to complete the existence of the little incipient beings and to guard against the dangers that threaten them buffon with his usual elegance observes that the condition of a sitting hen however insipid it may appear to us is perhaps not a tedious situation but a state of continual joy so much has nature connected raptures with whatever relates to the multiplication of her creatures  for a curious account of the progress of incubation in the developement of the chick we refer our readers to the abovementioned author who has given a minute detail of the several appearances which take place at different stated periods till the young chick is ready to break the shell and come forth in former times the egyptians and in later days philosophers have succeeded in hatching eggs without the assistance of the hen and that in great numbers at once by means of artificial heat corresponding with the warmth of the hen the eggs are placed in ovens to which an equal and moderate degree of heat is applied and every kind of moisture or pernicious exhalation carefully avoided  by which means and by turning the eggs so that every part may enjoy alike the requisite heat hundreds may be produced at the same time    the pheasant  phasianus colchicus lin  le faisan buff is of the size of the common cock the bill is of a pale horn color the nostrils are hid under an arched covering the eyes are yellow and are surrounded by a naked warty skin of a beautiful scarlet finely spotted with black immediately under each eye there is a small patch of short feathers of a dark glossy purple the upper parts of the head and neck are of a deep purple varying to glossy green and blue the lower parts of the neck and breast are of a reddish chestnut with black indented edges the sides and lower part of the breast are of the same color with pretty large tips of black to each feather which in different lights vary to a glossy purple the belly and vent are dusky the back and scapulars are beautifully variegated with black and white or cream color speckled with black and mixed with deep orange all the feathers being edged with black on the lower part of the back there is a mixture of green the quills are dusky freckled with white wing coverts brown glossed with green and edged with white rump plain reddish brown the two middle feathers of the tail are about twenty inches long the shortest on each side less than five of a reddish brown color marked with transverse bars of black the legs are dusky with a short blunt spur on each between the toes there is a strong membrane  the female is less and does not exhibit that variety and brilliancy of colors which distinguish the male the general colors are light and dark brown mixed with black the breast and belly finely freckled with small black spots on a light ground the tail is short and barred somewhat like the male the space round the eye is covered with feathers  the ring pheasant is a fine variety of this breed its only difference consists in a white ring which encircles the lower part of the neck the colors of the plumage in general are likewise more distinct and vivid a fine specimen of this bird was sent us by the rev wm turner of newcastle from which our figure was engraven they are sometimes met with in the neighborhood of alnwick whither they were brought by his grace the duke of northumberland that they intermix with the common breed is very obvious as in those we have seen the ring has been more or less distinct in some hardly visible and in others a few feathers only marked with white appear on each side of the neck forming a white spot it is much to be regretted that this beautiful breed is likely soon to be destroyed by those who pursue every species of game with an avaricious and indiscriminating rapacity  there are great varieties of pheasants of extraordinary beauty and brilliancy of colors many of these brought from the rich provinces of china are kept in aviaries in this kingdom the common pheasant is likewise a native of the east and is the only one of its kind that has multiplied in our island pheasants are generally found in low woody places on the borders of plains where they delight to sport during the night they perch on the branches of trees they are very shy birds and do not associate together except during the months of march and april when the male seeks the female they are then easily discoverable by the noise which they make in crowing and clapping their wings which may be heard at some distance the hen breeds on the ground like the partridge and lays from twelve to fifteen eggs which are smaller than those of the common hen the young follow the mother as soon as ever they are freed from the shell during the breeding season the cocks will sometimes intermix with the common hen and produce a hybrid breed of which we have known several instances    the turkey  meleagris gallopavo lin  le dindon buff it seems to be generally allowed that this bird was originally brought from america and in its wild state is considerably larger than our domestic turkies its general color is black variegated with bronze and bright glossy green in some parts changing to purple the quills are green gold black toward the ends and tipped with white the tail consists of eighteen feathers of a brown color mottled and tipped with black the tail coverts are waved with black and white on the breast there is a tuft of black hairs eight inches in length in other respects it resembles the domestic turkey in having a bare red carunculated head and neck a fleshy dilatable appendage hanging over the bill and a short blunt spur or knob at the back part of the leg  tame turkies like every other animal in a state of domestication are of various colors of these the prevailing one is dark gray inclining to black with a little white toward the ends of the feathers some are perfectly white others black and white there is also a beautiful variety of a fine deep copper color with the greater quills pure white the tail of a dirty white in all of them the tuft of black hair on the breast is prevalent turkies are bred in great numbers in norfolk suffolk and other counties from whence they are driven to the london markets in flocks of several hundreds each the drivers manage them with great facility by means of a bit of red rag tied to a long pole which from the antipathy these birds bear to that color acts as a scourge and effectually answers the purpose the motions of the turkey when agitated with desire or inflamed with rage are very similar to those of the peacock it erects its train and spreads it like a fan whilst its wings droop and trail on the ground uttering at the same time a dull hollow sound it struts round and round with solemn pace assumes all the dignity of the most majestic of birds and thus expresses its attachment to its females or its resentment to those objects which have excited its indignation the hen turkey begins to lay early in the spring she is very attentive to the business of incubation and will produce fifteen or sixteen chicks at one time but seldom has more than one hatch in a season in this climate young turkies after their extrication from the shell are very tender and require great attention in rearing them they are subject to a variety of diseases from cold rain and dews even the sun itself when they are exposed to its more powerful rays is said to occasion almost immediate death as soon as they are sufficiently strong they are abandoned by the mother and are then capable of enduring the utmost rigor of our winters    the peacock  pavo cristatus lin  le paon buff to describe the inimitable beauties of this elegant bird in adequate terms would be a task of no small difficulty its matchless plumage says buffon seems to combine all that delights the eye in the soft and delicate tints of the finest flowers all that dazzles it in the sparkling luster of the gems and all that astonishes it in the grand display of the rainbow its head is adorned with a tuft consisting of twentyfour feathers whose slender shafts are furnished with webs only at the ends painted with the most exquisite green mixed with gold the head throat neck and breast are of a deep blue glossed with green and gold the back the same tinged with bronze the scapulars and lesser wing coverts are of a reddish cream color variegated with black the middle coverts deep blue glossed with green and gold the greater coverts and bastard wing are of a reddish brown as are also the quills some of which are variegated with black and green the belly and vent are black with a greenish hue but the distinguishing character of this singular bird is its train which rises just above the tail and when erected forms a fan of the most resplendent hues the two middle feathers are sometimes four feet and a half long the others gradually diminishing on each side the shafts which are white are furnished from their origin nearly to the end with parted filaments of varying colors ending in a flat vane which is decorated with what is called the eye this is a brilliant spot enamelled with the most enchanting colors yellow gilded with various shades green running into blue and bright violet varying according to its different positions the whole receiving additional luster from the color of the center which is a fine velvet black when pleased or delighted and in sight of his females the peacock erects his tail and displays all the majesty of its beauty all his movements are full of dignity his head and neck bend nobly back his pace is slow and solemn and he frequently turns slowly and gracefully round as if to catch the sunbeams in every direction and produce new colors of inconceiveable richness and beauty accompanied at the same time with a hollow murmuring voice expressive of desire  the peahen is somewhat less than the cock and though furnished both with a train and crest they are destitute of those dazzling beauties which distinguish the male she lays five or six eggs of a whitish color for this purpose she chooses some secret spot where she can conceal them from the male who is apt to break them she sits from twentyfive to thirty days according to the temperature of the climate and the warmth of the season peacocks have been originally brought from the distant provinces of india and from thence have been diffused over every part of the world  the first notice that has been taken of them is to be found in holy writ  d chron ix    where we are told they made part of the cargoes of the rich and valuable fleet which every three years imported the treasures of the east to solomons court they are sometimes found in a wild state in many parts of asia and africa the largest and finest are said to be met with in the neighborhood of the ganges and on the fertile plains of india where they grow to a great size under the influence of that luxuriant climate this beautiful bird exhibits its dazzling colors which seem to vie with the gems and precious stones produced in those delightful regions in colder climates they require great care in rearing and do not obtain their full plumage till the third year in former times they were considered as a delicacy and made a part of the luxurious entertainment of the roman voluptuaries  white peacocks are not uncommon in england the eyes of the train not excepted which are barely visible and may be traced by a different undulation of shade upon the pure white of the tail it is a very singular circumstance that the females of this species have been sometimes known to assume the appearance of the male by a total change of color this is said to take place after she has done laying a bird of this kind is preserved in the leverian museum  the pintado guinea hen or pearled hen  numidia meleagris lin  la pintade buff this bird is somewhat larger than the common hen its head is bare of feathers and covered with a naked skin of a blueish color on the top is a callous protuberance of a conical form at the base of the upper bill on each side there hangs a loose wattle which in the female is red and in the male of a blueish color the upper part of the neck is almost naked being very thinly furnished with a few straggling hairy feathers the skin is of a light ash color the lower part of the neck is covered with feathers of a purple hue the general color of the plumage is a dark blueish gray sprinkled with round white spots of different sizes resembling pearls  hence it has been called the pearled hen its wings are short and its tail pendulous like that of the partridge its legs are of a dark color  this species which is now very common in this country was originally brought from africa from whence it has been diffused over every part of europe the west indies and america it formed a part of the roman banquets and is now much esteemed as a delicacy especially the young birds the female lays a great number of eggs which she frequently secrets till she has produced her young brood the egg is smaller than that of a common hen and of a rounder shape it is very delicious eating the pintado is a restless and very clamorous bird it has a harsh creaking note which is very grating and unpleasant it scrapes the ground like the hen and rolls in the dust to free itself from insects during the night it perches on high places if disturbed it alarms every thing within hearing by its unceasing cry in its natural state of freedom it is said to prefer marshy places    the wood grouse cock of the wood or capercaile  tetrao urogallus lin  le grand coq de bruyere buff this bird is as large as a turkey is about two feet nine inches in length and weighs from twelve to fifteen pounds the bill is very strong unequal and of a horn color over each eye there is a naked skin of a bright red color the eyes are hazel the nostrils are small and almost hid under a covering of short feathers which extend under the throat and are there much longer than the rest and of a black color the head and neck are elegantly marked with small transverse lines of black and gray as are also the back and wings but more irregularly the breast is black richly glossed with green on the upper part and mixed with a few white feathers on the belly and thighs the sides are marked like the neck the tail consists of eighteen feathers which are black those on the sides being marked with a few white spots the legs are very stout and covered with brown feathers the toes are furnished on each side with a strong pectinated membrane the female is considerably less than the male and differs greatly in her colors the throat is red the transverse bars on the head neck and back are red and black the breast is of a pale orange color belly barred with orange and black the top of each feather being white the back and wings are mottled with reddish brown and black the scapulars tipped with white the tail is of a deep rust color barred with black and tipped with white  this beautiful kind is found chiefly in high mountainous regions and is very rare in great britain mr pennant mentions one which was shot near inverness as an uncommon instance it was formerly met with in ireland but is now supposed to be extinct there in russia sweden and other northern countries it is very common it lives in the forests of pine with which those countries abound and feeds on the cones of the fir trees which at some seasons give an unpleasant flavor to its flesh so as to render it unfit for the table it likewise eats various kinds of plants and berries particularly the juniper early in the spring the season of pairing commences during this period the cock places himself on an eminence where he displays a variety of pleasing attitudes the feathers on his head stand erect his neck swells his tail is displayed and his wings trail almost on the ground his eyes sparkle and the scarlet patch on each side of his head assumes a deeper dye at the same time he utters his wellknown cry which has been compared to the sound produced by the whetting of a scythe it may be heard at a considerable distance and never fails to draw around him his faithful mates the female lays from eight to sixteen eggs which are white spotted with yellow and larger than those of the common hen for this purpose she chooses some secret spot where she can sit in security she covers her eggs carefully over with leaves when she is under the necessity of leaving them in search of food the young follow the hen as soon as they are hatched sometimes with part of the shell attached to them  the black grouse black game or black cock  tetrao tetrix lin  le coq de bruyere a queue fourchue buff this bird though not larger than a fowl weighs near four pounds its length is about one foot ten inches breadth two feet nine the bill is black the eyes dark blue below each eye there is a spot of a dirty white color and above a larger one of a bright scarlet which extends almost to the top of the head the general color of the plumage is of a deep black richly glossed with blue on the neck and rump the lesser wing coverts are dusky brown the greater are white which extends to the ridge of the wing forming a spot of that color on the shoulder when the wing is closed the quills are brown the lower parts and tips of the secondaries are white forming a bar of white across the wing  there is likewise a spot of white on the bastard wing the feathers of the tail are almost square at the ends and when spread out form a curve on each side the under tail coverts are of a pure white the legs and thighs are of a dark brown color mottled with white the toes are toothed on the edges like the former species in some of our specimens the nostrils were thickly covered with feathers whilst in others they were quite bare which we suppose must be owing to the different ages of the birds  these birds like the former are found chiefly in high and wooded situations in the northern parts of our island they are common in russia siberia and other northern countries they feed on various kinds of berries and other fruits the produce of wild and mountainous places in summer they will frequently come down from their lofty situations for the sake of feeding on corn they do not pair but on the return of spring the males assemble in great numbers at their accustomed resorts on the tops of high and heathy mountains when the contest for superiority takes place and continues with great bitterness till the vanquished are put to flight the victors being left in possession of the field place themselves on an eminence clap their wings and with loud cries give notice to their females who immediately resort to the spot it is said that each cock has two or three hens which seem particularly attached to him the female is about onethird less than the male and differs considerably in color her tail is likewise much less forked she makes an artless nest on the ground where she lays six or eight eggs of a yellowish color with freckles and spots of a rusty brown the young males at first resemble the mother they do not acquire their full plumage till toward the end of autumn when it gradually changes to a deeper color and assumes that of a blueish black which it afterward retains    red grouse red game gorcock or moorcock  tetrao scoticus lin  lattagas buff the length of this bird is fifteen inches the weight about nineteen ounces the bill is black the eyes hazel the nostrils shaded with small red and black feathers at the base of the lower bill there is a white spot on each side the throat is red each eye is arched with a large naked spot of a bright scarlet color the whole upper part of the body is beautifully mottled with deep red and black which gives it the appearance of tortoiseshell the breast and belly are of a purpleish hue crossed with small dusky lines the tail consists of sixteen feathers of equal lengths the four middlemost barred with red the others black the quills are dusky the legs are clothed with soft white feathers down to the claws which are strong and of a light color the female is somewhat less the naked skin above each eye is not so conspicuous and the colors of its plumage in general much lighter than those of the male  this bird is found in great plenty in the wild heathy and mountainous tracts in the northern counties of england it is likewise common in wales and in the highlands of scotland mr pennant supposes it to be peculiar to britain those found in the mountainous parts of france spain italy and elsewhere as mentioned by m buffon are probably varieties of this kind and we have no doubt would breed with it we could wish that attempts were more frequently made to introduce a greater variety of these useful birds into this country to stock our waste and barren moors with a rich fund of delicate and wholesome food but till a wise and enlightened legislature shall alter or abrogate our very unequal and injudicious game laws there hardly remains a single hope for the preservation of those we have red grouse pair in the spring the female lays eight or ten eggs on the ground the young ones follow the hen the whole summer as soon as they have attained their full size they unite in flocks of forty or fifty and are then exceedingly shy and wild  white grouse white game or ptarmigan  tetrao lagopus lin  le lagopede buff this bird is nearly the same size as the red grouse its bill is black the upper parts of its body are of a pale brown or ash color mottled with small dusky spots and bars the bars on the head and neck are somewhat broader and are mixed with white the under parts are white as are also the wings excepting the shafts of the quills which are black this is its summer dress in winter it changes to a pure white except that in the male there is a black line between the bill and the eye the tail consists of sixteen feathers the two middle ones are ashcolored in summer and white in winter the two next slightly marked with white near the ends the rest are wholly black the upper tail coverts are long and almost cover the tail  the white grouse is fond of lofty situations where it braves the severest cold it is found in most of the northern parts of europe even as far as greenland in this country it is only to be met with on the summits of some of our highest hills chiefly in the highlands of scotland in the hebrides and orkneys and sometimes but rarely on the lofty hills of cumberland and wales buffon speaking of this bird says that it avoids the solar heat and prefers the biting frosts on the tops of mountains for as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains it constantly ascends till it gains the summit where it forms holes and burrows in the snow they pair at the same time with the grouse the female lays eight or ten eggs which are white spotted with brown she makes no nest but deposits them on the ground in winter they fly in flocks and are so little accustomed to the sight of man that they suffer themselves to be easily taken either with the snare or gun they feed on the wild productions of the hills which sometimes give the flesh a bitter taste but not unpalateable it is dark colored and according to m buffon has somewhat the flavor of hare  the partridge  tetrao perdix lin  le perdrix grise buff the length of this bird is about thirteen inches the bill is light brown eyes hazel the general color of its plumage is brown and ash elegantly mixed with black each feather being streaked down the middle with buff color the sides of the head are tawny under each eye there is a small saffroncoloured spot which has a granulated appearance and between the eye and the ear a naked skin of a bright scarlet which is not very conspicuous but in old birds on the breast there is a crescent of a deep chestnut color the tail is short the legs are of a greenish white and are furnished with a small knob behind the female wants the crescent on the breast and its colors in general are not so distinct and bright  partridges are chiefly found in temperate climates the extremes of heat and cold being equally unfavourable to them they are no where in greater plenty than in this island where in their season they contribute to our most elegant entertainments it is much to be lamented however that the means taken to preserve this valuable bird should in a variety of instances prove its destruction the proper guardians of the young ones and eggs tied down by ungenerous restrictions are led to consider them as a growing evil and not only connive at their destruction but too frequently assist in it partridges pair early in the spring the female lays from fourteen to eighteen or twenty eggs making her nest of dry leaves and grass upon the ground the young birds learn to run as soon as hatched frequently encumbered with part of the shell sticking to them it is no uncommon thing to introduce partridge eggs under the common hen who hatches and rears them as her own in this case the young birds require to be fed with ants eggs which is their favorite food and without which it is almost impossible to bring them up they likewise eat insects and when full grown feed on all kinds of grain and young plants the affection of the partridge for her young is peculiarly strong and lively she is greatly assisted in the care of rearing them by her mate they lead them out in common call them together point out to them their proper food and assist them in finding it by scratching the ground with their feet they frequently sit close by each other covering the chickens with their wings like the hen in this situation they are not easily flushed the sportsman who is attentive to the preservation of his game will carefully avoid giving any disturbance to a scene so truly interesting but should the pointer come too near or unfortunately run in upon them there are few who are ignorant of the confusion that follows the male first gives the signal of alarm by a peculiar cry of distress throwing himself at the same moment more immediately into the way of danger in order to deceive or mislead the enemy he flies or rather runs along the ground hanging his wings and exhibiting every symptom of debility whereby the dog is decoyed by a too eager expectation of an easy prey to a distance from the covey the female flies off in a contrary direction and to a greater distance but returning soon after by secret ways she finds her scattered brood closely squatted among the grass and collecting them with haste she leads them from the danger before the dog has had time to return from his pursuit  the quail  tetrao coturnix lin  la caille buff the length seven inches and a half bill dusky eyes hazel the colors of the head neck and back are a mixture of brown ash color and black over each eye there is a yellowish streak and another of the same color down the middle of the forehead a dark line passes from each corner of the bill forming a kind of gorget above the breast the scapular feathers are marked by a light yellowish streak down the middle of each the quills are of a lightish brown with small rust colored bands on the exterior edges of the feathers the breast is of a pale rust color spotted with black and streaked with pale yellow the tail consists of twelve feathers barred like the wings the belly and thighs are of a yellowish white legs pale brown we were favored with a very fine specimen of this beautiful bird alive by mr gilfrid ward and one shot by the rev mr brocklebank of corbridge from which our representation was made the female wants the black spots on the breast and is easily distinguished by a less vivid plumage  quails are almost universally diffused throughout europe asia and africa they are birds of passage and are seen in immense flocks traversing the mediterranean sea from italy to the shores of africa in the autumn and returning again in the spring frequently alighting in their passage on many of the islands of the archipelago which they almost cover with their numbers on the western coasts of the kingdom of naples such prodigious quantities have appeared that an hundred thousand have been taken in a day within the space of four or five miles from these circumstances it appears highly probable that the quails which supplied the israelites with food during their journey through the wilderness were sent thither on their passage to the north by a wind from the southwest sweeping over egypt and ethiopia toward the shores of the red sea quails are not very numerous in this island they breed with us and many of them remain throughout the year changing their quarters from the interior counties to the sea coast the female makes her nest like the partridge and lays to the number of six or seven in france they are said to lay fifteen or twenty  buff eggs of a greyish color speckled with brown the young birds follow the mother as soon as hatched but do not continue long together they are scarcely grown up before they separate or if kept together they fight obstinately with each other their quarrels frequently terminating in each others destruction from this quarrelsome disposition in the quail it was that they were formerly made use of by the greeks and romans as we do gamecocks for the purpose of fighting we are told that augustus punished a prefect of egypt with death for bringing to his table one of these birds which had acquired celebrity by its victories at this time the chinese are much addicted to the amusement of fighting quails and in some parts of italy it is said likewise to be no unusual practice after feeding two quails very highly they place them opposite to each other and throw in a few grains of seed between them  the birds rush upon each other with the utmost fury striking with their bills and spurs till one of them yields  the corncrake land rail or daker hen  ralluscrex lin  le rale de genet buff length rather more than nine inches the bill is light brown the eyes hazel all the feathers on the upper parts of the plumage are of a dark brown edged with pale rust color both wing coverts and quills are of a deep chestnut the fore part of the neck and breast is of a pale ash color a streak of the same color extends over each eye from the bill to the side of the neck the belly is of a yellowish white the sides thighs and vent are faintly marked with rusty colored streaks the legs are of a pale flesh color  we have ventured to remove this bird from the usual place assigned to it among those to which it seems to have little or no analogy and have placed it among others to which in most respects it bears a strong affinity it makes its appearance about the same time with the quail and frequents the same places from whence it is called in some countries the king of the quails its wellknown cry is first heard as soon as the grass becomes long enough to afford it shelter and continues till the time it is cut but is seldom seen it constantly skulks among the thickest part of the herbage and runs so nimbly through it winding and doubling in every direction that it is difficult to come near it when hard pushed by the dog it sometimes stops short and squats down by which means its too eager pursuer overshoots the spot and loses the trace it seldom springs but when driven to extremity and generally flies with its legs hanging down but never to a great distance as soon as it alights it runs off and before the fowler has reached the spot the bird is at a considerable distance  the corncrake leaves this island in winter and repairs to other countries in search of food which consists of worms slugs and insects it likewise feeds on seeds of various kinds it is very common in ireland and is seen in great numbers in the island of anglesea in its passage to that country on its first arrival in england it is so lean as to weigh less than six ounces from whence one would conclude that it must have come from distant parts before its departure however it has been known to exceed eight ounces and is then very delicious eating the female lays ten or twelve eggs on a nest made of a little moss or dry grass carelessly put together they are of a pale ash color marked with rustcoloured spots the young crakes run as soon as they have burst the shell following the mother they are covered with a black down and soon find the use of their legs  our figure was made from the living bird sent us by lieut h f gibson    great bustard  otis tarda lin  loutarde buff this very singular bird which is the largest of our land birds is about four feet long and weighs from twentyfive to thirty pounds its characters are peculiar and with those which connect it with birds of the gallinaceous kind it has others which seem to belong to the ostrich and the cassowary its bill is strong and rather unequal its eyes red on each side of the lower bill there is a tuft of feathers about nine inches long its head and neck are ashcolored in the one described by edwards there were on each side of the neck two naked spots of a violet color but which appeared to be covered with feathers when the neck was much extended the back is barred transversely with black and bright rust color the quills are black the belly white the tail consists of twenty feathers  the middle ones are rust color barred with black those on each side are white with a bar or two of black near the ends the legs are long naked above the knees and dusky it has no hind toe its nails are short strong and unequal both above and below the bottom of the foot is furnished with a callous prominence which serves instead of a heel  the female is not much more than half the size of the male the top of her head is of a deep orange the rest of the head brown her colors are not so bright as those of the male and she wants the tuft on each side of the head there is likewise another very essential difference between the male and the female the former being furnished with a sac or pouch which is situated in the sore part of the neck and is capable of containing about two quarts the entrance to it is immediately under the tongue barringtons mis p     this singular reservoir was first discovered by dr douglas who supposes that the bird fills it with water as a supply in the midst of those dreary plains where it is accustomed to wander it likewise makes a further use of it in defending itself against the attack of birds of prey on such occasions it throws out the water with such violence as not unfrequently to baffle the pursuit of its enemy  bustards were formerly more frequent in this island than at present they are now found only in the open countries of the south and east in the plains of wiltshire dorsetshire and in some parts of yorkshire they were formerly met with in scotland but are now supposed to be extinct there they are slow in taking wing but run with great rapidity and when young are sometimes taken with greyhounds which pursue them with great avidity the chase is said to afford excellent diversion the great bustard is granivorous feeding on herbs and grain of various kinds it is also fond of those worms which are seen to come out of the ground in great numbers before sunrise in the summer in winter it frequently feeds on the bark of trees like the ostrich it swallows small stones in the stomach of one which was opened by the academicians there were found besides small stones to the number of ninety doubloons all worn and polished by the attrition of the stomach  buff bits of metal and the like the female makes no nest but making a hole on the ground she drops two eggs about the size of those of a goose of a pale olive brown with dark spots she sometimes leaves her eggs in quest of food and if during her absence any one should handle or even breathe upon them she immediately abandons her nest bustards are found in various parts of europe asia and africa but have not hitherto been discovered on the new continent    little bustard  otis tetrax lin  le petite outarde buff length only seventeen inches the bill is pale brown eyes red the top of the head is black spotted with pale rust color the sides of the head chin and throat are of a reddish white marked with a few dark spots the whole neck is black encircled with an irregular band of white near the top and bottom the back and wings are rust color mottled with brown and crossed with fine irregular black lines the under parts of the body and outer edges of the wings are white the tail consists of eighteen feathers  the middle ones are tawny barred with black the others are white marked with a few irregular bands of black the legs are gray the female is smaller and wants the black collar on its neck in other respects she nearly resembles the male  this bird is very uncommon in this country we have seen only two of them both of which were females our figure was taken from one sent us by w trevelyan esquire which was taken on the edge of newmarket heath and kept alive about three weeks in a kitchen where it was fed with bread and other things such as poultry eat both this and the great bustard are excellent eating and we would imagine would well repay the trouble of domestication indeed it seems surprising that we should suffer these fine birds to run wild and be in danger of total extinction which if properly cultivated might afford as excellent a repast as our own domestic poultry or even the turkey for which we are indebted to distant countries it is very common in france where it is taken in nets like the partridge it is a very shy and cunning bird if disturbed it flies two or three hundred paces not far from the ground and then runs away much faster than any one can follow on foot the female lays her eggs in june to the number of three or four of a glossy green color as soon as the young are hatched she leads them about as the hen does her chickens they begin to fly about the middle of august  of the plover although the plover has generally been classed with those birds whose business is wholly among waters we cannot help considering the greater part of them as partaking entirely of the nature of land birds many of them breed upon our lostiest mountains and though they are frequently seen upon the seacoasts feeding with birds of the water kind yet it must be observed that they are no more water birds than many of our small birds who repair there for the same purpose  the plover is distinguished by a large full eye its bill is strait short and rather swelled toward the tip its head is large and its legs are naked above the knee the longlegged plover and the sanderling are waders and belong more immediately to the water birds to which we refer them the great plover and the lapwing we consider as entirely connected with birds of the plover kind the former has usually been classed with the bustard the latter with the sandpiper but they differ very materially from both and seem to agree in more essential points with this kind we have therefore given them a place in this part of our work where they may be considered as connecting the two great divisions of land and water birds to both of which they are in some degree allied  the great plover thickkneed bustard stone curlew norfolk plover  charadrius oedicnemus lin  le grand pluvier buff the length of this bird is about sixteen inches its bill is long yellowish at the base and black at the end its eyes and eyelids are pale yellow above each eye there is a pale streak and beneath one of the same color extends to the bill the throat is white head neck and all the upper parts of the body are of a pale tawny brown down the middle of each feather there is a dark streak the fore part of the neck and breast are nearly the same but much paler the belly thighs and vent are of a pale yellowish white the quills are black the tail is short and rounded  a dark band crosses the middle of each feather the tips are black the rest white the legs are yellow and naked above the knees which are very thick as if swelled  hence its name the claws are black  this bird is found in great plenty in norfolk and several of the southern counties but is no where to be met with in the northern parts of our island it prefers dry and stony places on the sides of sloping banks it makes no nest the female lays two or three eggs on the bare ground sheltered by a stone or in a small hole formed in the sand they are of a dirty white marked with spots of a deep reddish color mixed with slight streaks although this bird has great power of wing and flies with great strength it is seldom seen during the day except surprised when it springs to some distance and generally escapes before the sportsman comes within gunshot it likewise runs on the ground almost as swift as a dog after running some time it stops short holding its head and body still and on the least noise squats close on the ground in the evening it comes out in quest of food and may then be heard at a great distance its cry is singular resembling a hoarse kind of whistle three or four times repeated and has been compared to the turning of a rusty handle buffon endeavors to express it by the words turrlui turrlui and says it resembles the sound of a third flute dwelling on three or four tones from a flat to a sharp its food consists chiefly of worms it is said to be good eating when young the flesh of the old ones is hard black and dry mr white mentions them as frequenting the district of selborne in hampshire he says that the young run immediately from the nest almost as soon as they are excluded like partridges that the dam leads them to some stony field where they bask skulking among the stones which they resemble so nearly in color as not easily to be discovered birds of this kind are migratory they arrive in april live with us all the spring and summer and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by getting together in flocks it is supposed that they retire to spain and frequent the sheepwalks with which that country abounds    the peewit lapwing bastard plover or tewit  fringilla vanellus lin  le vanneau buff this bird is about the size of a pigeon its bill is black eyes large and hazel the top of the head is black glossed with green a tuft of long narrow feathers issues from the back part of the head some of which are four inches in length and turn upwards at the end the sides of the head and neck are white which is interrupted by a blackish streak above and below the eye the back part of the neck is of a very pale brown the fore part as far as the breast is black the back and wing coverts are of a dark green glossed with purple and blue reflections the quills are black the four first tipped with white the breast and belly are of a pure white the upper tail coverts and vent pale chestnut the tail is white at the base the end is black with pale tips the outer feathers almost wholly white the legs are red claws black hind claw very short  this bird is a constant inhabitant of this country but as it subsists chiefly on worms it is forced to change its place in quest of food and is frequently seen in great numbers by the seashores where it finds an abundant supply it is every where well known by its loud and incessant cries which it repeats without intermission whilst on the wing and from whence in most languages a name has been given to it as imitative of the sound  the peewit is a lively active bird almost continually in motion it sports and frolics in the air in all directions and assumes a variety of attitudes it remains long upon the wing and sometimes rises to a considerable height it runs along the ground very nimbly and springs and bounds from spot to spot with great agility the female lays four eggs of a dirty olive spotted with black she makes no nest but deposits them upon a little dry grass hastily scraped together the young birds run very soon after they are hatched  during this period the old ones are very assiduous in their attention to their charge on the approach of any person to the place of their deposit they flutter round his head with cries of the greatest inquietude which increases as he draws nearer the spot where the brood are squatted in case of extremity and as a last resource they run along the ground as if lame in order to draw off the attention of the fowler from any further pursuit the young lapwings are first covered with a blackish down interspersed with long white hairs which they gradually lose and about the latter end of july they acquire their beautiful plumage at this time according to buffon the great association begins to take place and they assemble in large flocks of young and old which hover in the air saunter in the meadows and after rain they disperse among the ploughed fields in the month of october the lapwings are very fat and are then said to be excellent eating their eggs are considered as a great delicacy and are sold in the london markets at three shillings a dozen  the following anecdote communicated to us by the rev j carlyle is worthy of notice as it shows the domestic nature of this bird as well as the art with which it conciliates the regard of animals differing from itself in nature and generally considered as hostile to every species of the feathered tribes two of these birds given to mr carlyle were put into a garden where one of them soon died the other continued to pick up such food as the place afforded till winter deprived it of its usual supply necessity soon compelled it to draw nearer the house by which it gradually became familiarised to occasional interruptions from the family at length one of the servants when she had occasion to go into the backkitchen with a light observed that the lapwing always uttered his cry  peewit to obtain admittance he soon grew more familiar as the winter advanced he approached as far as the kitchen but with much caution as that part of the house was generally occupied by a dog and a cat whose friendship the lapwing at length conciliated so entirely that it was his regular custom to resort to the fireside as soon as it grew dark and spend the evening and night with his two associates sitting close by them and partaking of the comforts of a warm fireside as soon as spring appeared he left off coming to the house and betook himself to the garden but on the approach of winter he had recourse to his old shelter and his old friends who received him very cordially security was productive of insolence what was at first obtained with caution was afterward taken without reserve he frequently amused himself with washing in the bowl which was set for the dog to drink out of and while he was thus employed he showed marks of the greatest indignation if either of his companions presumed to interrupt him he died in the asylum he had chosen being choked with something which he picked up from the floor during his confinement crumbs of wheaten bread were his principal food which he preferred to any thing else    the golden plover yellow plover  charadrius pluvialis lin  le pluvier door buff

paler the belly is almost white the quills are dusky the tail is marked with dusky and yellow bars the legs are black  birds of this species vary much from each other in some which we have had the breast was marked with black and white in others it was almost black but whether this difference arose from age or sex we are at a loss to determine  the golden plover is common in this country and all the northern parts of europe it is very numerous in various parts of america from hudsons bay as far as carolina migrating from one place to another according to the seasons it breeds on high and heathy mountains the female lays four eggs of a pale olive color variegated with blackish spots they fly in small flocks and make a shrill whistling noise by an imitation of which they are sometimes enticed within gunshot the male and female do not differ from each other in young birds the yellow spots are not very distinguishable the plumage inclining more to gray    the gray plover  tringa

is represented with eyes of an orange color there is likewise a dusky line extending from the bill underneath each eye and a white one above it  we have placed this bird with the plovers as agreeing with them in every other respect but that of having a hind toe but that is so small as not to render it necessary to exclude it from a place in the plover family to which it evidently belongs the gray plover is not very common in britain it appears sometimes in small flocks on the seacoasts it is somewhat larger than the golden plover its flesh is said to be very delicate  the dotterel  charadrius

sometimes seen in the month of may during the breeding season they likewise breed on several of the highland hills they are very common in cambridgeshire lincolnshire and derbyshire appearing in small flocks on the heaths and moors of those counties during the months of may and june and are then very fat and much esteemed for the table the dotterel is said to be a very stupid bird and easily taken with the most simple artifice and that it was formerly the custom to decoy them into the net by stretching out a leg or an arm which caught the attention of the birds so that they returned it by a similar motion of a leg or a wing and were not aware till the net dropped and covered the whole covey at present the more sure method of the gun has superseded this ingenious artifice    the ring
