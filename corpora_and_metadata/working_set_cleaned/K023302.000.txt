had done and bought the duchy of bremin with the money he got from england two hundred and fifty thousand pounds over and above his pay as king and having thus purchased it at the expense of england added it to his hanoverian dominions for his own private profit  in fact every nation that does not govern itself is governed as a jobb england has been the prey of jobbs ever since the revolution and

lightfoot christopher taddy robert oliphant cornelius donovan robert rolleston john lubbock richard tuckwell william porter thomas druce isaac railton henry evans counsel for the crown the attorney general the solicitor general mr bearcroft mr baldwin mr wood mr percival solicitors messrs chamberlayne and whitl  counsel for the defendant the hon tho erskine mr piggot mr shepherd mr fitzgerald mr f vaughan solicitor mr bonney  the information was opened by mr percival mr attorney general gentlemen of the jury  you will permit me to solicit and for no long space of time in the present stage of this business somewhat of your attention to a cause which considering it on its own merits only is in my humble judgment a plain a clear a short and indisputable case were it not gentlemen that certain circumstances have rendered it a case of more expectation than ordinary i do assure you that i should literally have contented myself this day with conducting myself in the manner that i did upon the last occasion that i was called upon to address a jury upon this sort of subject namely by simply reading to you the passages which i have selected and leaving it entirely to your judgment but gentlemen it so happens that the accumulated mischief which has arisen from the particular book that is now before you and the consequences which every body is acquainted with which have followed from this publication have rendered it necessary perhaps that i should say a few words more in the opening than it would have been my intention to have done had it not been for those circumstances  gentlemen in the first place you will permit me without the imputation i think of speaking of myselfa very trifling subject and always a disgusting one to others to obviate a rumor which i have heard namely that this prosecution does not correspond with my private judgment that has been said and has reached my ears from various quarters the refutation that i shall give to it is this that i should think i deserved to be with disgrace expelled from the situation with which his majesty has honored me in your service and that of all my fellow subjects had i as far as my private judgment goes hesitated for one instant to bring this enormous offender as i consider him before a jury of his country  gentlemen the publication in question was not the first of its kind which this defendant sent forth into the world this particular publication was preceded by one upon the same subjects and handling in some measure the same topics that publication although extremely reprehensible and such as perhaps i was not entirely warranted in overlooking i did overlook upon this principle that it may not be fitting and prudent at all times for a public prosecutor to be sharp in his prosecutions or to have it said that he is instrumental in preventing any manner of discussion coming under the public eye although in his own estimation it may be very far indeed from that which is legitimate and proper discussion reprehensible as that book was extremely so in my opinion yet it was ushered into the world under circumstances that led me to conceive that it would be confined to the judicious reader and when confined to the judicious reader it appeared to me that such a man would refute as he went along  but gentlemen when i found that another publication was ushered into the world still more reprehensible than the former that in all shapes in all sizes with an industry incredible it was either totally or partially thrust into the hands of all persons in this country of subjects of every description when i found that even childrens sweetmeats were wrapped up with parts of this and delivered into their hands in the hope that they would read it when all industry was used such as i describe to you in order to obtrude and force this upon that part of the public whose minds cannot be supposed to be conversant with subjects of this sort and who cannot therefore correct as they go along i thought it behoved me upon the earliest occasion which was the first day of the term succeeding this publication to put a charge upon record against its author  now gentlemen permit me to state to you what it is that i impute to this book and what is the intention that i impute to the writer of this book try it by every test that the human mind can possibly suggest and see whether when tried by all the variety of those tests you will not be satisfied in the long run that it does deserve that description which my duty obliges me to give of it  gentlemen in the first place i impute to it a wilful deliberate intention to vilify and degrade and thereby to bring into abhorrence and contempt the whole constitution of the government of this country not as introduced that i will never admit but as explained and restored at the revolution that system of government under which we this day live and which if it shall be attacked by contemptuous expressions if by dogmatical dicta if by readymade propositions offered to the understandings of men solicitous about the nature of their constitution properly so god forbid they ever should be otherwise but who at the same time may be easily imposed upon to their own destruction they may be brought to have diffidence and even abhorrence for this book goes all that length of that which is the salvation of the public and every thing which is dear to them  i impute then to this book a deliberate design to eradicate from the minds of the people of this country that enthusiastic love which they have hitherto had for that constitution and thereby to do the utmost work of mischief that any human being can do in this society  gentlemen further i impute to it that in terms the regal part of the government of this country bounded and limited as it is is represented as an oppressive and an abominable tyranny  thirdly that the whole legislature of this country is directly an usurpation  again with respect to the laws of this realm which hitherto have been our boast indiscriminately and without one single exception that they are grounded upon this usurped authority and are therefore in themselves null or to use his own words  that there is little or no law in this country  then gentlemen is it to be held out to a community of ten or twelve millions of people is it to be held out as well to the lower as to the better informed classes of these ten or twelve millions that there is nothing in this society that is binding upon their conduct excepting such portion of religion or morality as they may individually and respectively entertain  gentlemen are we then a lawless banditti have we neither laws to secure our property our persons or our reputations  is it so that every mans arms are unbound and that he may do whatever he pleases in the society  are we reduced back again to that savage state of nature i ask you the question you gentlemen know well what the answer is but gentlemen are we to say that a man who holds this out to those who are not furnished with the means of giving the answer which i know you and every gentleman who hears me at this moment will give is discussing a question can any thing add to his slander upon the constitution and upon the separate parts of the government so constituted as ours is more than that sweeping imputation upon the whole system of law that binds us together  namely that it is null and void and that there is in reality no such thing to be found  gentlemen in the several passages which i shall read to you i impute this to him also that he uses an artifice gross to those who can observe it but dangerous in the extreme to those whose minds perhaps are not sufficiently cultivated and habituated to reading to enable them to discover it the artifice in order to create disgust is neither more nor less than this  it is stating all the objections that can possibly be urged to monarchy separately and solely considered and to pure and simple aristocracy he never chooses to say a single syllable with respect to those two as combined with a democracy forbearing also to state and industriously keeping out of the way every circumstance that regards that worst of all governments an unbalanced democracy which is necessarily pregnant with a democratical tyranny this is the gross artifice and when you come to dissect the book in the careful manner that i have done i believe you and every other reader will easily detect that artifice  gentlemen to whom are the positions that are contained in this book addressed they are addressed gentlemen to the ignorant to the credulous to the desperate to the desparate all government is irksome nothing can be so palatable to their ears as the comfortable doctrine that there is neither law nor government amongst us  the ignorant and the credulous we all know to exist in all countries and perhaps exactly in proportion as their hearts are good and simple are they an easy prey to the crafty who have the cruelty to deceive them  gentlemen in judging of the malignant intention which i must impute to this author you will be pleased to take into your consideration the phrase and the manner as well as the matter the phrase i state to be insidious and artful the manner in many instances scoffing and contemptuous a short argument often a prevalent one with the ignorant or the credulous with respect to the matter in my conscience i call it treason though technically according to the laws of the country it is not  for gentlemen balance the inconvenience to society of that which is technically treason and in this country we must not thank god extend it but keep it within its most narrow and circumscribed definitions but consider the comparative difference of the mischief that may happen from spreading doctrines of this sort and that which may happen from any treason whatever  in the case of the utmost degree of treason even perpetrating the death of a prince upon the throne the law has found the means of supplying that calamity in a manner that may save the country from any permanent injury in many periods of the history of this country which you may easily recollect it is true that the reign of a good prince has been interrupted by violence  a great evil  but not so great as this the chasm is filled up instantly by the constitution of this country even if that last of treasons should be committed  but where is the power upon earth that can fill up the chasm of a constitution that has been growing  not for seven hundred years as mr pain would have you believe from the norman conquest but from time almost eternal impossible to trace that has been growing as from the symptoms julius caesar observed when he found our ancestors nearly savages in the country has been growing from that period until it was consummated at the revolution and shone forth in all its splendor  in addition to this this gentleman thinks fit even to impute to the existence of that constitution such as i have described it the very evils inseparable from human society or even from human nature itself all these are imputed to that scandalous that wicked that usurped constitution under which we the subjects of this country have hitherto mistakenly conceived that we lived happy and free  gentlemen i apprehend it to be no very difficult operation of the human mind to distinguish reasoning and well meant discussion from a deliberate design to calumniate the law and constitution under which we live and to withdraw mens allegiance from that constitution it is the operation of good sense it is therefore no difficult operation for a jury of the city of london therefore you will be pleased to observe whether the whole of this book i should rather say such part as i am at present at liberty to advert to is not of this description that it is by no means calculated to discuss and to convince but to perform the shorter process of inflammation not to reason upon any subject but to dictate and gentleman as i stated to you before to dictate in such a manner and in such phrase and with all such circumstances as cannot in my humble apprehension leave the most remote doubt upon your minds of what was passing in the heart of that man who composed that book  gentlemen you will permit me now to say a word or two upon those passages which i have selected to you first describing a little what those passages are i have thought it much more becoming much more beneficial to the public than any other course that i could take to select six or seven and no more not wishing to load the record unnecessarily of those passages that go to the very root of our constitution that is the nature of the passages which i have selected and gentlemen the first of them is in page    where you will find this doctrine  all hereditary government is in its nature tyranny an heritable crown or an heritable throne or by what other fanciful name such things may be called have no other significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property to inherit a government is to inherit the people as if they were flocks and herds  now gentlemen what is the tendency of this passage all hereditary government is in its nature tyranny so that no qualification whatever not even the subordination to the law of the country which is the only paramount thing that we know of in this country can take it out of the description of tyranny the regal office being neither more nor less than a trust executed for the subjects of this country the person who fills the regal office being understood in this country to be neither more nor less than the chief executive magistrate heading the whole gradation of magistracy  but without any qualification he states it roundly that under all circumstances whatever hereditary government must in its nature be tyranny what is that but to hold out to the people of this country that they are naught but slaves to be sure if they are living under a tyranny it is impossible to draw any other consequence  this is one of those short propositions that are crammed down the throat of every man that is accessible to their arts in this country this is one of those propositions which if he believes must have the due effect upon his mind of saying the case is come when i understand i am opressed i can bear it no longer  an heritable crown ours is an heritable crown and therefore it is comprehended in this dogma or by what other fanciful name such things may be called is that discussion contemptuous vilifying and degrading expressions of that sort are applied to that which we are accustomed to look to with reverence namely the representation of the whole body of magistracy and of the law  have no other significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property to inherit a government is to inherit the people as if they were flocks and herds  why gentlemen are the people of england to be told without further ceremony that they are inherited by a king of this country and that they are precisely in the case of sheep and oxen i leave you to judge if such gross contemptible and abominable falsehood is delivered out in bits and scraps of this sort whether that does not call aloud for punishment  gentlemen only look at the truth the converse is directly the case the king of this country inherits an office under the law he does not inherit persons we are not in a state of villenage the direct reverse to what is here pointed out is the truth of the matter the king inherits an office but as to any inheritance of his people none you know belongs to him and i am ashamed to say any thing more upon it  the next is in page    in which this man is speaking of the congress at philadelphia in      which was held because the government of that country was found to be extremely defective as at first established  this convention met at philadelphia in may      of which general washington was elected president he was not at that time connected with any of the stategovernments or with congress he delivered up his commission when the war ended and since then had lived a private citizen  the convention went deeply into all the subjects and having after a variety of debate and investigation agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution the next question was the manner of giving it authority and practice  what is the conclusion of that  they certainly agreed upon an appointment of their federal constitution in      i should have thought that a man meaning nothing more than history would have been very well contented to have stated what actually did happen upon that occasion but in order to discuss as possibly it may be called something that formerly did pass in this country he chose to do it in these inflaming and contemptuous terms  for this purpose they did not like a cabal of courtiers send for a dutch stadtholder or a german elector but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country  here again the revolution and the act of settlement stare us in the face as if the interest and the sense of the country were in no way consulted but on the contrary it was nothing more than a mere cabal of courtiers  whether that is or is not to be endured in this country your verdict will show but in order to show you how totally unnecessary this passage was except for the deliberate purpose of calumny if this passage had been left out the narration would have been quite perfect i will read three or four lines just to show how perfect it would have been  the next question was about the manner of giving it authority and practice the passage beyond that which i call a libel  they first directed that the proposed constitution should be published secondly that each state should elect a convention for the purpose of taking it into consideration and of ratifying or rejecting it and so the story goes on  but in order to explain what i mean by a dogma thrust in i call your attention to this as one of those which has no earthly connection with the subject he was then speaking of  does not this passage stand insulated between the two parts of the connected story officiously and designedly thrust in for the purposes of mischief gentlemen the artifice of that book consists also in this the different wicked passages that are meant to do mischief in this country are spread throughout it and stuck in here and there in a manner that in order to see the whole malignity of it it is necessary to have a recollection of several preceding passages but these passages when brought together manifestly show the full design of the writer and therefore extracts of it may be made to contain the whole marrow and at the same time that each passage taken by itself will do mischief enough any man reading them together will see that mischief come out much clearer than by a mere transient reading  the next passage i have to observe upon is in page    and in page    he is pleased to express himself in this manner he says  the history of the edwards and the henrys and up to the commencement of the stuarts exhibits as many instances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had restricted it the stuarts endeavored to pass those limits and their fate is well known in all these instances we see nothing of a constitution but only of restrictions on assumed power  then gentlemen from the reign of the edwards and the henrys down to the revolution it was a regular progression of tyranny not a progression of liberty but of tyranny till the stuarts stepped a little beyond the line in the gradation that was going forwards and that begot a necessity for a revolution but of the edwards i should have thought at least he might have spared the great founder of our jurisprudence king edward the first beside many other princes the glory and the boast of this country and many of them regarders of its freedom and constitution but instead of that this author would have the people of this country believe that up to that time it was a progressive tyranny and that there was nothing of a constitution only restrictions on assumed power  so that all the power that existed at that time was assumption and usurpation  he thus proceeds after this another william descended from the same stock and claiming from the same origin gained possession and of the two evils james and william the nation preferred what it thought the least so that the deliverance of this country by the prince of orange was an evil but the least of the two since from circumstances it must take one the act called the bill of rights comes here into view what is it but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers profits and privileges you shall have so much and i will have the rest and with respect to the nation it said for your share you shall have the right of petitioning this being the case the bill of rights is more properly a bill of wrongs and of insult as to what is called the convention parliament it was a thing that made itself and then made the authority by which it acted a few persons got together and called themselves by that name several of them had never been elected and none of them for the purpose  from the time of william a species of government arose issuing out of this coalition bill of rights and more so since the corruption introduced at the hanover succession by the agency of walpole that can be described by no other name than a despotic legislation  now gentlemen this is the description that this man holds out of that on which rests the property the lives and liberties and the privileges of the people of this country i wonder to god gentlemen that any british man for such this man certainly was and still is to use the words of our own poet when he spoke these words a bill of wrongs a bill of insult they did not stick in his throat what is that bill of rights it can never be too often read i will make no comment upon it because your own heads and hearts will make that comment you have a posterity to look to are desperate ruffians who are to be found in every country thus to attack the unalienable rights and privileges which are to descend undiminished to that posterity  are you not to take care that this shall be sacred to your posterity is it not a trust in your hands it is a trust in your hands as much as the execution of the law is a trust in the hands of the crown each has its guardians in this community but you are the guardians of the bill of rights  gentlemen it is this that the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal  that the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by the regal authority as it has been assumed and exercised of late is illegal  that is the law is above all  that levying money for or to the use of the crown by pretense of prerogative without grant of parliament for longer time or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted is illegal  that it is the right of the subjects to petition the king and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitions are illegal  all that you get by the bill of rights according to this mans doctrine is that the commons of this country have the right of petitioning we all know this alludes to the case of the seven bishops that was a gross violation of the rights of those subjects of this country therefore he states falsely and maliciously according to the language of the information which is perfectly correct in the present case that the whole that was obtained by the subjects of this country was the right of petitioning whereas it is declared to be their unalterable right and ever to have been so and adverts as i before stated to a gross violation of it in a recent case  that the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace unless it be with consent of parliament is against law  that the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law  that elections of members of parliament ought to be free  that the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament  that excessive bail ought not to be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted  that jurors ought to be duly impannelled and returned and jurors which pass upon men in trials for high treason ought to be freeholders  that all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before conviction are illegal and void  and that for the redress of all grievances and for the amendig strengthening and preserving of the laws parliaments ought to be held frequently  further gentlemen this bill goes on to say for the ratifying confirming and establishing the said declaration and the articles clauses matters and things therein contained by the force of a law made in due form by authority of parliament do pray it may be declared and enacted that all and singular the rights and liberties asserted and claimed in the said declaration are the true ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom and so shall be esteemed allowed adjudged deemed and taken to be and that all and every the particulars aforesaid shall be firmly and strictly holden and observed as they are expressed in the said declaration and all officers and ministers whatsoever shall serve their majestys and their successors according to the same in all times to come  such gentlemen is the bill of wrongs and of insult i shall not profane it by saying one more word upon it  now gentlemen i would ask you whether what is said by this man be reasoning or discussion or whether it is nothing else but deception and that deception consisting of a most abominable and complete suppression is there a word of this act quoted has the poor mechanic to whom this passage is addressed who is told that he has been wronged and insulted at the revolution has he this statute by him to read would it not have been fair at least to have stated what it was but instead of that unsight unseen to use a very vulgar expression this proposition is tendered to the very lowest man in this country namely that the bill of rights is a bill of wrongs and of insult  pass we then on to another if you will please to make a memorandum of page    you will find that in the same spirit and with the same design this man tells you that  the intention of the government of england here comes in another contemptuous expression  for i rather choose to call it by this name than the english government appears since its political connection with germany to have been so completely engrossed and absorbed by foreign affairs and the means of raising taxes that it seems to exist for no other purposes  the government of the country then does not exist for the purpose of preserving our lives and properties but the government i mean the constitution of the country kings lords and commons exists for no other purpose but to be the instruments of raising taxes to enter into any discussion of that is taking up your time unnecessarily  i only beg to draw your attention to the dogmatical and cavalier manner in which these things are asserted further he says  domestic concerns are neglected and with respect to regular law there is scarcely such a thing  i stand in the city of london i am addressing myself to gentlemen eminent in that city whether the legislature since the revolution has or not adverted to domestic concerns i think i may appeal to the growing prosperity of this country from the moment that the night mare has been taken off its stomach which pressed upon it up to that moment  we then proceed to page    where after the whole constitution of this country has been thus treated in gross he proceeds a little to dissect and consider the component parts of that constitution and in page    in a dogma we have this  with respect to the two houses of which the english parliament is composed they appear to be effectually influenced into one and as a legislature to have no temper of its own the minister whoever he at any time may be touches it as with an opium wand and it sleeps obedience  now gentlemen here is another dogma without a single fact without a single argument but it is held out to the subjects of this country that there is no energy or activity in either the aristocratical or democratical parts of this constitution but that they are asleep and you might just as well have statues there it is not merely said that it is so now but it is in the nature of things says he that it should be so  but if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses the difference will appear so great as to show the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it  wretched as the state of representation is in england it is manhood compared with what is called the house of lords and so little is this nickname house regarded that the people scarcely inquire at any time what it is doing it appears also to be most under influence and the furthest removed from the general interest of the nation  now gentlemen this is again speaking in this mans contemptuous manner at the expense of the aristocratical part of our constitution of government an essentially beneficial part whose great and permanent interest in the country renders them a firm barrier against any encroachment i am not to suppose that you are so ignorant of the history of your country as not to know the great and brilliant characters that have sat in that house no particular period of time is alluded to in this passage he surely cannot mean the present time but i conceive he speaks of all times and that from the very nature of our government it must everlastingly be so slander upon that very great and illustrious part of the legislature untrue at any period written in this scurrilous and contemptuous manner is distinguished greatly indeed from any sober discussion of whether an aristocratical part of government is a good or bad thing and is calculated only to mislead and inflame  if you look next to page  0  there you will find that two of the component parts of the legislature having been thus disposed of we come up to the throne itself and this man says very truly of himself  having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two houses of parliament i proceed to what is called the crown upon which i shall be very concise  it signifies a nominal office of a million a year the business of which consists in receiving the money whether the person be wise or foolish sane or insane a native or a foreigner matters not every minister acts upon the same idea that mr burke writes namely that the people must be hoodwinked and held in superstitious ignorance by some bugbear or other and what is called the crown answers this purpose and therefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from   this is more than can be said of the other two branches  the hazard to which this office is exposed in all countries including this among the rest is not from any thing that can happen to the man but from what may happen to the nation the danger of its coming to its senses  then gentlemen we have been insane for these seven or eight hundred years and i shall just dismiss this with this observation that this insanity having subsisted so long i trust in god that it is incurable  in page     you have this note  i happened to be in england at the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of      the characters of william and mary have always appeared to me detestable the one seeking to destroy his uncle and the other her father to get possession of power themselves yet as the nation was disposed to think something of that event i felt hurt at seeing it ascribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken it as a job and who besides what he otherwise got charged six hundred thousand pounds for the expense of a little fleet that brought him from holland  george the first acted the same closefisted part as william had done and bought the duchy of bremen with the money he got from england two hundred and fifty thousand pounds over and above his pay as king and having thus purchased it at the expense of england added it to his hanoverian dominions for his own private profit  in fact every nation that does not govern itself is governed as a job england has been the prey of jobs ever since the revolution  then gentlemen what he calls a nation governing itself is something extremely different from a nation having consented from time immemorial to be governed by a democracy an aristocracy and an hereditary executive supreme magistrate and moreover by a lawparamount which all are bound to obey he conceives i say that sort of government not to be a government of the people themselves but he denominates that sort of government a job and not a government  gentlemen such are the passages which i have selected to you as those that disclose the most offensive doctrines in the book that is such as go fundamentally to the overturning the government of this country  i beg pardon i have omitted one which contains more of direct invitation than any thing i have yet stated  it is in page     it is said the fraud hypocrisy and imposition of governments are now beginning to be too well understood to promise them any long career  the farce of monarchy and aristocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry and mr burke is dressing for the funeral  let it then pass quietly to the tomb of all other follies and the mourner be comforted the time is not very distant when england will laugh at itself for sending to holland hanover zell or brunswick for men at the expense of a million a year who understand neither her laws her language nor her interest and whose capacities would scarcely have fitted them for the office of parish constable  this is said of william the third  this is said of two very illustrious princes of the house of brunswick george the first and second and extends to the present sovereign upon the throne  if government could be trusted to such hands it must be some easy and simple thing indeed and materials fit for all the purposes may be found in every town and village in england  the policy of the constitution of this country has ever avoided excepting when driven to it by melancholy necessity to disturb the hereditary succession to the throne and it has wisely thought it more fitting to pursue that system even though a foreigner should be seated on the thronce of these realms than to break through it  this would insinuate that the necessary defects of an hereditary monarchy are such as outweigh the advantages attending that which i have stated is that so i would ask any man who hears me in point of history whether it is not the permanent defect of elective monarchies or sovereigns that they seldom are men of any consideration and for an obvious reason most frequently it has happened that turbulent factions after having desolated their country one of them it has so happened at least in most instances as far as my recollection goes sets up a tool whom the successful faction can themselves govern at pleasure  often has it happened that such factions when a civil war arises which must almost necessarily be the case in elective monarchies not choosing to come to the conclusion of an armed contest have chosen a very weak person each in hope of strengthening his party by the time the periodical civil war should come round i believe upon examination this will be found to be generally the case and to have prevailed in elective monarchies to a greater degree than any inconveniences that may have ever arisen from the natural infirmities of princes who succeeded to their thrones by hereditary rights in the constitution of great britain for to that this man alludes  has he stated with any sort of fairness or has he at all stated or adverted to the many many remedies we have for any defect of that sort has he stated the numerous councils of a king his council of parliament  his council of his judges in matters of law  his privy council has he stated the responsibility of all those councils some in point of character some of personable responsibility has he stated the responsibility of those immediate servants who conduct his executive government has he stated the appointment of regents has he stated all this which is indispensibly necessary toward a fair and honest discussion which this book will possibly be called of this point of his insuperable objection to hereditary monarchy can this be called any other than gross suppression and wilful misstatement to raise discontent in halfinformed minds  there does come across my mind at this moment unquestionably one illustrious exception to that doctrine i have stated of men not the most capable of government having in general been chosen in the case of elective monarchies and that is a man whom no indignities no misfortunes no disappointments no civil commotions no provocations ever forced from the full and steady possession of a strong mind which has always risen with elasticity under all the pressures that i have stated and he though not in one sense of that word a great prince yet is certainly a great man who will go down as such to the latest posterity i mean the king of poland dont imagine gentlemen that my adverting to this illustrious character is useless every gentleman who hears knows he had a considerable part of his matured education in this country here he familiarized himself with the constitution of this country here he became informed of the provisions of what this man calls the bill of wrongs and insults without disparagement to him for i believe him to be a just and wise prince of great natural faculties here it was that he saw and could alone learn how the regal government of a free people was conducted and that under a prince of the house of brunswick  gentlemen having stated thus much to you i will now for want of suitable expressions for mine are very feeble borrow from another i certainly have formed an opinion upon this subject precisely similar to deliver it in plain words would exhaust the utmost of my powers but i will borrow the words of a very able writer who has most properly for fear some ill impression should be made by this book on the weaker part of mankind in america given an answer to this book of mr pain that distinguished gentleman i have reason to believe though not the chief magistrate in that country is the second in the executive government of it that is he is second in the exercise of the regal part of the government of that country he takes care to confute accurately what mr pain says with respect to america but borrowing his words i beg to be understood that this is my opinion of the work before you and which i humbly offer for your consideration and adoption he says his intention appears evidently to be to convince the people of great britain that they have neither liberty nor a constitution that their only possible means to produce those blessings to themselves is to topple down headlong their present government and follow implicitly the example of the french  gentlemen the next passage which i beg to be understood as mine i wish i could express it as well myself is this  mr pain in reply cuts the gordian knot at once declares the parliament of      to have been downright usurpers censures them for having unwisely sent to holland for a king denies the existence of a british constitution and invites the people of england to overturn their present government and to erect another upon the broad basis of national sovereignty and government by representation as mr pain has departed altogether from the principles of the revolution and has torn up by the roots all reasoning from the british constitution by the denial of its existence it becomes necessary to examine his work upon the grounds which he has chosen to assume if we judge of the production from its apparent tendency we may call it an address to the english nation attempting to prove that they have a right to form a new constitution that it is expedient for them immediately to exercise that right and that in the formation of this constitution they can do no better than to imitate the model set before them by the french national assembly however immethodical his production is i believe the whole of its argumentative part may be referred to these three points if the subject were to affect only the british nation we might leave them to reason and act for themselves but these are concerns equally important to all mankind and the citizens of america are called upon from high authority he alludes to a gentleman in a high situation in that country who has published an opinion of this book to rally round the standard of this champion of revolutions i shall therefore now proceed to examine the reasons and so he goes on  gentlemen i would adopt with your permission a few more words from this publication  when mr pain invited the people of england to destroy their present government and form another constitution he should have given them sober reasoning and not flippant witticisms whether that is or not the case what i have read to you today will enable you to judge he should have explained to them the nature of the grievances by which they are oppressed and demonstrated the impossibility of reforming the government in its present organization he should have pointed out some possible method for them to act in their original character without a total dissolution of civil society among them he should have proved what great advantages they would reap as a nation from such a revolution without disguising the great dangers and formidable difficulties with which it must be attended so much for the passages themselves and this interpretation which i humbly submit to your consideration  the next matter upon which i shall proceed is the evidence which i propose to adduce and that evidence will go to show not only the fact of this mans being the writer of this book by his own repeated admission and by letters under his own hand but will likewise go directly to show what is his intent in such publication which appears i think most clearly and over and above that i shall produce to you a letter which this man was pleased to address to myself in which letter he avows himself in so many words the author and i shall prove it to be his handwriting and further than that there is matter in that letter apparently showing the intention with which that book was written namely to villify this constitution and to injure this country irretrievably  two other letters i shall be under the necessity of reading to you in which he has stated himself the author the one is a letter to a person of the name of jordan in which he expresses himself in this manner  february         that was the day on which the book was published for your satisfaction and my own i send you the enclosed though i do not apprehend there will be any occasion to use it if in case there should you will immediately send a line for me under cover to mr johnson st pauls church yard who will forward it to me upon which i shall come and answer personally for the work send also for mr horn took  tp   the letter enclosed was this addressed to the same man jordan the bookseller  sir should any person under the sanction of any kind of authority enquire of you respecting the author and publisher of the rights of man you will please to mention me as the author and publisher of that work and show to such person this letter i will as soon as i am acquainted with it appear and answer for the work personally  gentlemen with respect to his letter written to me it is in these terms   mr erskine my lord the attorney general states a letter in the hand writing of mr pain which establishes that he is the author i desire to know whether he means to read a letter which may be the subject of a substantive and distinct prosecution i do not mean to dispute the publication or even to give him the trouble of proving the letters which he has just stated whether the attorney general will think it consistent with the situation in which he is placed at this moment to read a letter written at a time long subsequent to the publication containing as i understand if i am mistaken in that i withdraw my objection but containing distinct clear and unequivocal libellous matter and which i in my address to the jury if i am not deceived in what i have heard shall admit to be upon every principle of the english law a libel therefore if that should turn out to be the case will your lordship suffer the mind of the jury to be entirely put aside from that matter which is the subject of the prosecution and to go into matter which hereafter may be and i cannot but suppose would be if the defendant were within the reach of the law of this country the subject of a distinct and independent prosecution   lord kenyon if that letter goes a jot to prove that he is the author of this publication i cannot reject that evidence in prosecutions for high treason where overt acts are laid you may prove overt acts not laid to prove those that are laid if it goes to prove him the author of the book i am bound to admit it  mr attorney general  the letter is thus  paris   th of november  st year of the republic  sir as there can be no personal resentment between two strangers i write this letter to you as to a man against whom i have no animosity  you have as attorney general commenced a prosecution against me as the author of the rights of man had not my duty in consequence of my being elected a member of the national convention of france called me from england i should have staid to have contested the injustice of that prosecution not upon my own account for i cared not about the prosecution but to defend the principles i had advanced in the work  the duty i am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to trouble myself about your prosecution when i have leisure i shall have no objection to meet you on that ground but as i now stand whether you go on with the prosecution or whether you do not or whether you obtain a verdict or not is a matter of the most perfect indifference to me as an individual if you obtain one which you are welcome to if you can get it it cannot affect me either in person property or reputation otherwise than to increase the latter and with respect to yourself it is as consistent that you obtain a verdict against the man in the moon as against me neither do i see how you can continue the prosecution against me as you would have done against one of your own people who had absented himself because he was prosecuted what passed at dover proves that my departure from england was no secret  my necessary absence from your country affords the opportunity of knowing whether the prosecution was intended against thomas pain or against the rights of the people of england to investigate systems and principles of government for as i cannot now be the object of the prosecution the going on with the prosecution will show that something else was the object and that something else can be no other than the people of england for it is against their rights and not against me that a verdict or sentence can operate if it can operate at all be then so candid as to tell the jury if you choose to continue the process whom it is you are prosecuting and on whom it is that the verdict is to fall  gentlemen i certainly will comply with this request i am prosecuting both him and his work and if i succeed in this prosecution he shall never return to this country otherwise than in vinculis for i will outlaw him  but i have other reasons than those i have mentioned for writing you this letter and however you may choose to interpret them they procceed from a good heart the time sir is becoming too serious to play with court prosecutions and sport with national rights the terrible examples that have taken place here upon men who less than a year ago thought themselves as secure as any prosecuting judge jury or attorney general can now do in england ought to have some weight with men in your situation now gentlemen i do not think that mr pain judges very well of mankind  i do not think that it is a fair conclusion of mr pain that men such as you and myself who are quietly living in obedience to the laws of the land which they inhabit exercising their several functions peaceably and i hope with a moderate share of reputation i do not conceive that men called upon to think and in the habit of reflection are the most likely men to be immediately thrown off the hinges by meances and threats and i doubt whether men exercising public functions as you and i do in the face of our country could have the courage to run away all i can tell mr pain is this  if any of his assassins are here in london and there is some ground to suppose they may be or the assassins of those with whom he is connected if they are here i tell them that i do in my conscience think that for a man to die of doing his duty is just as good a thing as dying of a raging fever or under the tortures of the stone let him not think that not to be an incendiary is to be a coward  he says  that the government of england is as great if not the greatest perfection of fraud and corruption that ever took place since governments began is what you cannot be a stranger to unless the constant habit of seeing it has blinded your sense upon my word gentlemen i am stone blind i am not sorry for it  but though you may not choose to see it the people are seeing it very fast and the progress is beyond what you may choose to believe or that reason can make any other man believe that the capacity of such a man as mr guelph or any of his profligate sons is necessary to the government of a nation  now gentlemen with respect to this passage i have this to say it is contemptuous scandalous false cruel  why gentlemen is mr pain in addition to the political doctrines that he is teaching us in this country is he to teach us the morality and religion of implacability is he to teach human creatures whose moments of existence depend upon the permission of a being merciful long suffering and of great goodness that those youthful errors from which even royalty is not exempted are to be treasured up in a vindictive memory and are to receive sentence of irremissible sin at his hands are they all to be confounded in these slanderous terms shocking for british ears to hear and i am sure distressing to their hearts he is a barbarian who could use such profligate expressions uncalled for by any thing which could be the object of his letter addressed to me if giving me pain was his object he has that hellish gratification would this man destroy that great auxiliary of all human laws and constitutions  to judge of others as we would be judged ourselves  this is the bill of wrongs and insults of the christian religion i presume it is considered as that bill of wrongs and insults in the heart of that man who can have the barbarity to use those expressions and address them to me in a way by which i could not but receive them  gentlemen there is not perhaps in the world a more beneficial analogy nor a finer rule to judge by in public matters than by assimilating them to what passes in domestic life  a family is a small kingdom a kingdom is a large family suppose this to have happened in private life judge of the good heart of this man who thrusts into my hands the grateful servant of a kind and beneficent master and that too through the unavoidable trick of the common post slander upon that master and slander upon his whole offspring lay your hands upon your hearts and tell me what is your verdict with respect to his heart  i see it gentlemen he has the audacity to say i speak to you as one man ought to speak to another does he speak to me of those august personages as one man ought to speak to another had he spoken those words to me personally i will not answer for it whether i should not have forgot the duties of my office and the dignity of my station by being hurried into a violation of that peace the breach of which i am compelled to punish in others he says and i know also that i speak what other people are beginning to think that you cannot obtain a verdict and if you do it will signify nothing without packing a jury and we both know that such tricks are practiced is what i have very good reason to believe  mentiris impudentissime  gentlemen i know of no such practice i know indeed that no such practice exists nor can exist i know the very contrary of this to be true and i know too that this letter containing this dangerous falsehood was destined for future publication that i have no doubt of and therefore i dwell thus long upon it  i have gone into coffeehouses and places where i was unknown on purpose to learn the currency of opinion whether the sense of this nation is to be had in some pothouses and coffeehouses in this town of his own choosing is a matter i leave to your judgment and i never yet saw any company of twelve men that condemned the book but i have often found a greater number than twelve approving it and this i think is a fair way of collecting the natural currency of opinion do not then sir be the instrument of drawing twelve men into a situation that may be injurious to them afterward injurious to them afterward those words speak for themselves he proceeds thus  i do not speak this from policy what then but from gentlemen i will give you a hundred guesses benevolence but if you choose to go on with the process i make it my request that you would read this letter in court after which the judge and the jury may do as they please as i do not consider myself the object of the prosecution neither can i be affected by the issue one way or the other i shall though a foreigner in your country subscribe as much money as any other man toward supporting the right of the nation against the prosecution and it is for this purpose only that i shall do it  thomas pain  so it is a subscription defense you hear  p s i intended had i staid in england to have published the information with my remarks upon it  that would have been a decent thing  before the trial came on but as i am otherwise engaged i reserve myself till the trial is over when i shall reply fully to every thing you shall advance i hope in god he will not omit any one single word that i have uttered to day or shall utter in my future address to you this conceited menace i despise as i do those of a nature more cutthroat  gentlemen i do not think that i need to trouble you any further for the present according as you shall be of opinion that the necessarily mischievous tendency and intent of this book is that which i have taken the liberty at more length than i am warranted perhaps to state to you according as you shall or shall not be of that opinion so necessarily will be your verdict i have done my duty in bringing before a jury an offender of this magnitude be the event what it may i have done my duty i am satisfied with having placed this great and flourishing community under the powerful shield of your protection   evidence for the crown thomas haynes sworn examined by mr bearcroft q where did you get that book   a at mr jordans in fleet street   q when   a in the month of february        it was put into court thomas chapman sworn examined by mr solicitor general q what business are you   a a printer   q do you know the defendant thomas pain   a i do   q upon what occasion did you become acquainted with him   a on the recommendation of mr thomas christie   q for what purpose was he introduced to you or you to him   a i was introduced to mr pain by mr christie to print some book that he had   q when was that   a i cannot directly say it was in the year        q what book was that   a the first part of the rights of man   q are you a publisher as well as a printer   a i am not merely a printer   q did you print the first part of the rights of man   a i did   q who was the selling bookseller of that book   a mr jordan of fleet street   q had you any intercourse with mr jordan and mr pain concerning that book   a i had   q what was that intercourse relative to   a to the manner of publishing the book   q did jordan in fact publish that book   a he did   q had you any intercourse with mr pain relative to the printing this book which i have in my hand the witness looks at it   a the first edition of this book i had i dont think i printed this edition of it i printed the first edition of it   q is that the first or second part   a the second part i printed a part of the second part   mr erskine can you swear to that very book   a i cannot   mr solicitor general you say you printed part of the second part of the rights of man   a yes   q what part did you print   a i printed as far as page     signature h   q by signature h you mean the letter h that is at the bottom of the page   a yes   q upon whose employment did you print so much of the second part   a mr paines   q did you print the rest of the work from letter h to the conclusion of it   a i have the copy in my possession as far as     i think the manuscript copy   q did you print as far as     or stop at     signature h   a i stopped at     but my people had composed to page     which was not printed by me   q had you any conversation with mr pain relative to the printing the remainder of the work and if you had what was that conversation   a when i had finished page     or sheet h the proof sheet i came into my hand upon examining sheet i there was a part which in my weak judgment appeared of a dangerous tendency i therefore immediately concluded in my mind not to proceed any farther in the work accordingly i wrote a short note to mr pain this was about two oclock in the afternoon determining to send a letter with the remainder of the copy i felt a degree of reluctance from the circumstance of mr paines civilities that i had experienced as a gentleman and an employer and i was fearful i should not have courage in the morning to deliver up the copy but a circumstance occurred in the course of the day which enabled me to do it with satisfaction to myself i will relate the circumstance if you will give me leave   q was mr pain present when that circumstance happened   a he was and as it may in the eyes of the court exculpate me from a charge that mr pain has thought proper to bring against me i shall esteem it a favor of the court if they will suffer me to mention every circumstance of that kind  that very day at six oclock mr pain called upon me   q do you recollect the day   a i have a copy of that letter which is dated the   th of january so that he must have called upon me on the   th mr pain called upon me and as was rather unusual at least to my knowledge he was rather intoxicated by liquor he had i believe that day dined with mr johnson in saint pauls church yard being intoxicated he introduced a subject we have unfortunately differed on several times the subject of religion a favorite subject with him when intoxicated i am sorry to mention these circumstances but as it will justify me in the eyes of the public as part of the appendix has done me material injury in my profession the subject of debate ran very high he opposed every thing with great virulence till at length he came to personal abuse very much so both to myself and mrs chapman an observation was made by mrs chapman late in the evening i believe near ten oclock at which mr pain was particularly offended rising up in a great passion he said he had not been so personally affronted in the whole course of his life before   mr erskine the information charges no offense like this   court this is no offense it appears only at present to be impertinent   mr erskine i admit the publication but i cannot admit that letter   mr solicitor general go on   chapman mr pain accordingly rose in a great passion declaring that as i was a dissenter he had a very bad opinion of dissenters in general he believed them all to be a pack of hypocrites and therefore he must deal very cautiously with them and begged therefore that in the morning before i proceeded any further in his work we should have a settlement i felt a degree of pleasure in it as it enabled me with courage next morning to deliver up his copy which i had before determined i sent a letter next morning enclosing the whole of his copy he called upon me and made many apologies for what he had said he said that it was the effect of liquor and hoped that i would pass it over and proceed with the work but being determined on the matter i would not upon any account   q and did you state to him the reason why you would not go on with the work   a i did the letter will show the reason   mr solicitor general you have told us that mr pain was your employer so far as you did print did you ever make any offers to any body to buy the copy of the second part of the rights of man   a i did   q to whom   a to mr pain   q when you made these offers did he accept them or refuse them or how did he treat the offers   a i made him three separate offers in the different stages of the work the first i believe was a hundred guineas the second five hundred and the last was a thousand   q to these offers what did mr pain answer   a to the best of my recollection he answered that as it was his intention to publish a small edition of his work he wished to reserve it in his own hands   q have you seen this mr pain write   a i have   q do you think you know his hand writing   a i think i do   q look at that letter dated feb         is that his hand writing   a i think it is   q look at that dated feb         enclosed in the above   a i think that is his hand writing   q look particularly at this short note dated april         is that his hand writing   a i believe it is   q here is an order directed to yourself dated feb        look at that is that his hand writing   a it is   q look at that letter dated june         is that mr paines hand writing   a i believe it is   q look at that letter the letter to the attorney general dated paris the   th of nov is that mr paines hand writing   a i cannot speak with any certainty   q do you believe that to be his hand writing   a i am inclined to think it is   thomas chapman crossexamined by mr erskine q in the first place flow often have you seen mr pain write   a i presume a dozen times   q did you ever look at him when he was writing so as particularly to observe how he formed his characters   a decency would not suffer me to look particularly   q i take for granted that you did not at that time suppose you should be called upon to prove his hand writing and did not of course take any notice of it  did you upon your oath look at it with a view of saying i will see how this man writes in order that i may know his writing again   a i did not   q did you ever see any other writing than that you have described   a no   q then you are only inclined to believe that last letter is his hand writing   a yes   mr solicitor general do you believe that that last letter is his hand writing   a i think it is   mr erskine do you mean to say that you have a firmer belief of it now than you had a moment ago   a yes   q what has produced this change in your opinion   a by the manner of his signature   q had not you looked at his signature before   a it struck me that there was something particular in the manner of his writing his signature   q then you have a firmer belief now than you had a few minutes ago    a yes   the letters read mr chapman please to deliver to mr jordan the remaining sheets of the rights of man  thomas pain feb  th     feb         for your satisfaction and my own i send you the enclosed though i do not apprehend there will be any occasion to use it if in case there should you will immediately send a line for me under cover to mr johnson st pauls churchyard who will forward it to me upon which i shall come and answer personally for the work  send also to mr horn took  t p  mr jordan no     fleet street  feb         sir should any person under the sanction of any kind of authority enquire of you respecting the author and publisher of the rights of man you will please to mention me as the author and publisher of that work and show to such person this letter i will as soon as as i am made acquainted with it appear and answer for the work personally  your humble servant thomas pain  mr jordan no     fleet street  april         mr jordan please to settle the account of the sale of the pamphlets with mr johnson as i am at present engaged in getting forward another small work for publication  yours etc thomas pain  mr jordan no     fleet street  london june         sir i have drawn on you two drafts for one hundred and fifty pounds each one at seven days sight the other at fourteen payable to mr johnson or order for moneys which he has advanced on my account and bills which are due which drafts please to pay and place the same to my account  yours etc thomas pain  mr jordan no     fleet street  paris   th november  st year of the republic sir as there can be no personal resentment between two strangers i write this letter to you as to a man against whom i have no animosity  you have as attorney general commenced a prosecution against me as the author of rights of man had not my duty in consequence of my being elected a member of the national convention of france called me from england i should have staid to have contested the injustice of that prosecution not upon my own account for i cared not about the prosecution but to have defended the principles i had advanced in the work  the duty i am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to trouble myself about your prosecution when i have leisure i shall have no objection to meet you on that ground but as i now stand whether you go on with the prosecution or whether you do not or whether you obtain a verdict or not is a matter of the most perfect indifference to me as an individual if you obtain one which you are welcome to if you can get it it cannot affect me either in person property or reputation otherwise than to increase the latter and with respect to yourself it is as consistent that you obtain a verdict against the man in the moon as against me neither do i see how you can continue the prosecution against me as you would have done against one of your own people who had absented himself because he was prosecuted what passed at dover proves that my departure from england was no secret  my necessary absence from your country now in consequence of my duty here affords the opportunity of knowing whether the prosecution was intended against thomas pain or against the rights of the people of england to investigate systems and principles of government for as i cannot now be the object of the prosecution the going on with the prosecution will show that something else was the object and that something else can be no other than the people of england for it is against their rights and not against me that a verdict or sentence can operate if it can operate at all be then so candid as to tell the jury if you choose to continue the process whom it is you are prosecuting and on whom it is that the verdict is to fall  but i have other reasons than those i have mentioned for writing you this letter and however you may choose to interpret them they proceed from a good heart the time sir is becoming too serious to play with court prosecutions and sport with national rights the terrible examples that have taken place here upon men who less than a year ago thought themselves as secure as any prosecuting judge jury or attorney general can now do in england ought to have some weight with men in your situation that the government of england is as great if not the greatest perfection of fraud and corruption that ever took place since governments began is what you cannot be a stranger to unless the constant habit of seeing it has blinded your senses but though you may not choose to see it the people are seeing it very fast and the progress is beyond what you may choose to believe is it possible that you or i can believe or that reason can make any other man believe that the capacity of such a man as mr guelph or any of his profligate sons is necessary to the government of a nation i speak to you as one man ought to speak to another and i know also that i speak what other people are beginning to think  that you cannot obtain a verdict and if you do it will signify nothing without packing a jury and we both know that such tricks are practiced is what i have very good reason to believe i have gone into coffeehouses and places where i was unknown on purpose to learn the currency of opinion and i never yet saw any company of twelve men that condemned the book but i have often found a greater number than twelve approving it and this i think is a fair way of collecting the natural currency of opinion do not then sir be the instrument of drawing twelve men into a situation that may be injurious to them afterward i do not speak this from policy but from benevolence but if you choose to go on with the process i make it my request to you that you will read this letter in court after which the judge and the jury may do as they please as i do not consider myself the object of the prosecution neither can i be affected by the issue one way or the other i shall though a foreigner in your country subscribe as much money as any other man toward supporting the right of the nation against the prosecution and it is for this purpose only that i shall do it  thomas pain  to archd macdonald attorney general as i have not time to copy letters you will excuse the corrections  p s i intended had i staid in england to have published the information with my remarks upon it before the trial came on but as i am otherwise engaged i reserve myself till the trial is over when i shall reply fully to every thing you shall advance  t p     andrew milne sworn examined by mr bearcroft q i believe you lived with mr jordan   a yes   q when   a about this time twelvemonth   q did you at any time see mr pain at mr jordans   a yes   q what was the business he came upon   a it was respecting money principally   q did you ever go to the printers of that book while it was in hand   a the second part i did   q did you go by the directions of anybody and by whose directions   a by mr paines directions   q had you occasion to see him more than once   a yes   q did you at any time get an order from him to mr crowder the printer   a yes once in particular   q was that before or after it was gone out of the hands of chapman   a after   q did you ever see him at jordans shop after it had been published more than once   a yes   q tell us the circumstances   a respecting that note in which he mentions mr horn took i was in the shop at the time mr pain came with mr horn took to mr jordans in the evening the conversation was in the parlour i did not hear the conversation but i knew of it afterward   q i dont ask you what you learned from any body else did you learn it from pain   a no   q did you see any money paid by jordan to mr pain on account of this book   a yes   john purdue sworn examined by mr wood q are you acquainted with mr pain   a i was formerly   q how long ago   a i have not seen him since he went to america   q he was in the excise   a he was in the excise   q are you acquainted with his handwriting   a formerly i was   q look at these letters and say whether you believe them to be his handwriting   a i believe they all are   the extracts from the libel read as follows page    all hereditary government is in its nature tyranny an heritable crown or an heritable throne or by what other fanciful name such things may be called have no other significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property to inherit a government is to inherit the people as if they were flocks and herds page    this convention met at philadelphia in may      of which general washington was elected president he was not at that time connected with any of the stategovernments or with congress he delivered up his commission when the war ended and since then had lived a private citizen  the convention went deeply into all the subjects and having after a variety of debate and investigation agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution the next question was the manner of giving it authority and practice  for this purpose they did not like a cabal of courtiers send for a dutch stadtholder or a german elector but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country  page    the history of the edwards and henrys and up to the commencement of the stuarts exhibits as many instances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had restricted it the stuarts endeavored to pass those limits and their fate is well known in all those instances we see nothing of a constitution but only of restrictions on assumed power  after this another william descended from the same stock and claiming from the same origin gained possession and of the two evils james and william the nation preferred what it thought the least since from circumstances it must take one the act called the bill of rights comes here into view what is it but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers profits and privileges you shall have so much and i will have the rest and with respect to the nation it said for your share you shall have the right of petitioning this being the case the bill of rights is more properly a bill of wrongs and of insult as to what is called the convention parliament it was a thing that made itself and then made the authority by which it acted a few persons got together and called themselves by that name several of them had never been elected and none of them for the purpose  from the time of william a species of government arose issuing out of this coalition bill of rights and more so since the corruption introduced at the hanover succession by the agency of walpole that can be described by no other name than a despotic legislation though the parts may embarrass each other the whole has no bounds and the only right it acknowleges out of itself is the right of petitioning where then is the constitution either that gives or that restrains power  it is not because a part of the government is elective that makes it less a despotism if the persons so elected possess afterward as a parliament unlimited powers election in this case becomes separated from representation and the candidates are candidates for despotism  page    the attention of the government of england for i rather choose to call it by this name than the english government appears since its political connection with germany to have been so completely engrossed and absorbed by foreign affairs and the means of raising taxes that it seems to exist for no other purposes domestic concerns are neglected and with respect to regular law there is scarcely such a thing  page    note with respect to the two houses of which the english parliament is composed they appear to be effectually influenced into one and as a legislature to have no temper of its own the minister whoever he at any time may be touches it as with an opium wand and it sleeps obedience  but if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses the difference will appear so great as to show the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it wretched as the state of representation is in england it is manhood compared with what is called the house of lords and so little is this nicknamed house regarded that the people scarcely enquire at any time what it is doing it appears also to be most under influence and the furthest removed from the general interest of the nation  pages  0  0  having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two houses of parliament i proceed to what is called the crown upon which i shall be very concise  it signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year the business of which consists in receiving the money whether the person be wise or foolish sane or insane a native or a foreigner matters not every ministry acts upon the same idea that mr burke writes namely that the people must be hoodwinked and held in superstitious ignorance by some bugbear or other and what is called the crown answers this purpose and therefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from it this is more than can be said of the other two branches the hazard to which this office is exposed in all countries is not from any thing that can happen to the man but from what may happen to the nation  the danger of its coming to its senses  page     note i happened to be in england at the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of      the characters of william and mary have always appeared to me detestable the one seeking to destroy his uncle and the other her father to get possession of power themselves yet as the nation was disposed to think something of that event i felt hurt at seeing it ascribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken it as a job and who besides what he otherwise got charged  00000 l for the expense of the little fleet that brought him from holland george the first acted the same closefisted part as william had done and bought the duchy of bremin with the money he got from england   0000 l over and above his pay as king and having thus purchased it at the expense of england added it to his hanoverian dominions for his own private profit in fact every nation that does not govern itself is governed as a job england has been the prey of jobs over since the revolution  page     the fraud hypocrisy and imposition of governments are now beginning to be too well understood to promise them any long career the farce of monarchy and aristocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry and mr burke is dressing for the funeral let it then pass quietly to the tomb of all other follies and the mourners be comforted  the time is not very distant when england will laugh at itself for sending to holland hanover zell or brunswick for men at the expense of a million a year who understood neither her laws her language nor her interest and whose capacities would scarcely have fitted them for the office of parish constable if government could be trusted to such hands it must be some easy and simple thing indeed and materials fit for all the purposes may be found in every town and village in england  the end of the evidence for the crown the honorable thomas erskine gentlemen of the jury  the attorney general in that part of his address which arose from a letter supposed to have been written to him from france exhibited signs of strong sensibility and emotion i do not i am sure charge him with acting a part to seduce you on the contrary i am persuaded from my own feelings and from my acquaintance with my friend from our childhood upwards that he expressed himself as he felt but gentlemen if he felt those painful embarrassments think what mine must be he can only feel for the august character whom he represents in this place as a subject for his sovereign too far removed by custom and by law from the intercourses which generate affections to produce any other sentiments than those that flow from a relation common to us all but it will be remembered that i stand in the same relation mr erskine is attorney general to the prince of wales toward another great person more deeply implicated by this supposed letter who not restrained from the cultivation of personal attachment by those qualifications which must always secure them has exalted my duty of a subject to a prince into a warm and honest affection between  and man thus circumstanced i certainly should have been glad to have had an earlier opportunity of knowing correctly the content of this letter and whether which i positively deny it proceeded from the defendant coming thus suddenly upon us i see but too plainly the impression it has made upon you who are to try the cause and i feel its weight upon myself who am to conduct it but this shall neither detach me from my duty nor added to all the other difficulties th thicken around me enervate me if i can hel  in the discharge of it  gentlemen if the attorney gen  founded in the commentaries he has made to you upon this book which he prosecutes if he is warranted by the law of england in repressing its circulation through these realms from the illegal and dangerous matters contained in it if that suppression be as he avows it and as in common sense it must be the sole object of the prosecution the public has great reason to lament that this letter should have been at all brought into the service of the cause it is no part of the charge upon the record it had no existence for months after the work was composed and published it was not even written if written at all till after he had been at dover in a manner insultingly expelled from the country by the influence of government and had become the subject of another country it cannot therefore by any fair inference even decypher the mind of the author when he composed his work still less can it affect the construction of the language in which the work itself is written the introduction of this letter at all is therefore not only a departure from the charge but a sort of dereliction of the object of the prosecution which is to condemn the book for if the condemnation of the author is to be obtained not by the work itself but by collateral matter not even existing when it was written nor known to its various publishers throughout the kingdom how can a verdict upon such grounds condemn the work or criminate other publishers strangers to the collateral matter on which the conviction may be obtained i maintain therefore that upon every principle of sound policy as it affects the interests of the crown and upon every rule of justice as it affects the author of the rights of man the letter should be wholly dismissed from your consideration  gentlemen the attorney general has thought it necessary to inform you that a rumor had been spread and had reached his ears that he only carried on the prosecution as a public prosecutor but without the concurrence of his own private judgment and therefore to add the just weight of his own character to his public duty and to repel what he thinks a calumny he tells you that he should have deserved to have been driven from society if he had not arraigned the work and the author before you  here too we stand in situations very different i have no doubt of the existence of such a rumor and of its having reached his ears because he says so but for the narrow circle in which any rumor personally implicating my learned friends character has extended i might appeal to the multitudes who surround us and ask which of all them except the few connected in office with the crown ever heard of its existence but with regard to myself every man who hears me at this moment nay the whole people of england have been witnesses to the calumnious clamor that by every art has been raised and kept up against me in every place where business or pleasure collect the public together day after day my name and character have been the topics of injurious reflection and for what  only for not having shrunk from the discharge of a duty which no personal advantage recommended and which a thousand difficulties repelled but gentlemen i have no complaint to make either against the printers of these libels nor even against their authors the greater part of them hurried perhaps away by honest prejudices may have believed they were serving their country by rendering me the object of its suspicion and contempt and if there have been amongst them others who have mixed in it from personal malice and unkindness i thank god i can forgive them also  little indeed did they know me who thought that such proceedings would influence my conduct i will for ever at all hazards assert the dignity independence and integrity of the english bar without which impartial justice the most valuable part of the english constitution can have no existence for from the moment that any advocate can be permitted to say that he will or will not stand between the crown and a subject arraigned in the court where he daily sits to practice from that moment the liberties of england are at an end if the advocate refuses to defend from what he may think of the charge or of the defense he assumes the character of the judge nay he assumes it before the hour of judgment and in proportion to his rank and reputation puts the heavy influence of perhaps a mistaken opinion into the scale against the accused in whose favor the benevolent principle of english law makes all presumptions and which commands the very judge to be his counsel  gentlemen it is now my duty to address myself regularly and without digression to the defense and the first thing which presents itself in the discussion of a judicial subject and indeed of every other is to state distinctly and with precision what the question is and where prejudice and misrepresentation have been exerted to distinguish it accurately from what it is not the question then is not whether the constitution of our fathers under which we live  under which i present myself before you and under which alone you have any jurisdiction to hear me  be or be not preferable to the constitution of america or france or any other human constitution for upon what principle can a court constituted by the authority of any government and administering a positive system of law under it pronounce a decision against the constitution which creates its authority or the rule of action which its jurisdiction is to enforce the common sense of the most uninformed person must revolt at such an absurd supposition  i have no difficulty therefore in admitting that if by accident some or all of you were alienated in opinion and affection from the forms and principles of the english government and were impressed with the value of that unmixed representative constitution which this work recommends and inculcates you could not on that account acquit the defendant nay to speak out plainly i freely admit that even if you were avowed enemies to monarchy and devoted to republicanism you would be nevertheless bound by your oaths as a jury sworn to administer english justice to convict the author of the rights of man if it were brought home to your consciences that he had exceeded those widely extended bounds which the ancient wisdom and liberal policy of the english constitution have allotted to the range of a free press i freely concede this because you have no jurisdiction to judge either the author or the work by any rule but by the english law which is the source of your authority but having made this large concession it follows by a consequence so inevitable as to be invulnerable to all argument or artifice that if on the other hand you should be impressed which i know you to be not only with a dutiful regard but with an enthusiasm for the whole form and substance of your own government and though you should think that this work in its circulation amongst classes of men unequal to political researches may tend to alienate opinion still you cannot upon these grounds without a similar breach of duty convict the defendant of a libel unless he has clearly stepped beyond that extended range of communication which the same ancient wisdom and liberal policy of the british constitution has allotted for the liberty of the press  gentlemen i admit with the attorney general that in every case where a court has to estimate the quality of a writing the mind and intention of the writer must be taken into the account the bona or mala fides as lawyers express it must be examined for a writing may undoubtedly proceed from a motive and be directed to a purpose not to be decyphered by the mere construction of the thing written but wherever a writing is arraigned as seditious or slanderous not upon its ordinary construction in language nor from the necessary consequences of its publication under any circumstances and at all times but that the criminality springs from some extrinsic matter not visible upon the page itself nor universally operative but capable only of being connected with it by evidence so as to demonstrate the effect of the publication and the design of the publisher such a writing not libellous per se cannot be arraigned as the authors work is arraigned upon the record before the court i maintain without the hazard of contradiction that the law of england positively requires for the security of the subject that every charge of a libel complicated with extrinsic facts and circumstances dehors the writing must appear literally upon the record that the defendant may know what crime he is called upon to answer and how to stand upon his defense what crime is it that the defendant comes to answer for to day what is the notice that i who am his counsel have from this parchment of the crime alleged against him i come to defend his having written this book the record states nothing else the charge of sedition in the introduction is notoriously paper and packthread and the innuendos cannot enlarge the sense or natural construction of the text the record does not state any one extrinsic fact or circumstance to render the work criminal at one time more than another it states no peculiarity of time or season or intention not proveable from the writing itself which is the naked charge upon record there is nothing therefore which upon any principle of english law gives you any jurisdiction beyond the construction of the work itself and you cannot be justified in finding it criminal because published at this time unless it would have been a criminal publication under any circumstances or at any other time  the law of england then both in its forms and substance being the only rule by which the author or the work can be justified or condemned and the charge upon the record being the naked charge of a libel the cause resolves itself into a question of the deepest importance to us all the nature and extent of the liberty of the english press  but before i enter upon it i wish to fulfill a duty to the defendant which if i do not deceive myself is at this moment peculiarly necessary to his impartial trial  if an advocate entertains sentiments injurious to the defense he is engaged in he is not only justified but bound in duty to conceal them so on the other hand if his own genuine sentiments or any thing connected with his character or situation can add strength to his professional assistance he is bound to throw them into the scale in addressing myself therefore to gentlemen not only zealous for the honor of english government but visibly indignant at any attack upon its principles and who would perhaps be impatient of arguments from a suspected quarter i give my client the benefit of declaring that i am and ever have been attached to the genuine principles of the british government and that however the court or you may reject the application i defend him upon principles not only consistent with its permanence and security but without the establishment of which it never could have had an existence  the proposition which i mean to maintain as the basis of the liberty of the press and without which it is an empty sound is this  that every man not intending to mislead and to confound but seeking to enlighten others with what his own reason and concience however erroneously dictate t him as truth may address himself to the universal reason of a whole nation either upon the subject of governments in general or upon that of our own particular country that he may analyze the principles of its constitution point out its errors and defects examine and publish its corruptions warn his fellowcitizens against their ruinous consequences and exert his whole faculties in pointing out the most advantageous changes in establishments which he considers to be radically defective or sliding from their object by abuse  all this every subject of this country has a right to do if he contemplates only what he thinks its happiness and but seeks to change the public mind by the conviction which flows from reasonings dictated by conscience  if indeed he writes what he does not think if contemplating the misery of others he wickedly condemns what his own understanding approves or even admitting his real disgust against the government or its corruptions if he calumniates living magistrates or holds out to individuals that they have a right to run before the public mind in their conduct that they may oppose by contumacy or force what private reason only disapproves that they may disobey the law because their judgment condemns it or resist the public will because they honestly wish to change it he is then a criminal upon every principle of rational policy as well as upon the immemorial precedents of english justice because such a person seeks to disunite individuals from their duty to the whole and excites to overt acts of misconduct in a part of the community instead of endeavoring to change by the impulse of reason that universal assent which in this and in every country constitutes the law for all  i have therefore no difficulty in admitting that if upon an attentive perusal of this work it shall be found that the defendant has promulgated any doctrines which tend to withdraw individuals from their subjection to the law by which the whole nation consents to be governed nay if the direct contrary shall not be found to be studiously inculcated  if his book shall be found to have warranted or excited that unfortunate criminal who appeared here yesterday to endeavor to relieve himself from imprisonment by the destruction of a prison while the law of imprisonment remained or dictated to him the language of defiance which ran through his whole defense  if throughout the whole work there shall be found any syllable or letter which strikes at the security of property or which hints that any thing less than the whole nation can constitute the law or that the law be it what it may is not the inexorable rule of action for every individual i willingly yield him up to the justice of the court  gentlemen i say in the name of thomas pain and in his words as author of the rights of man as written in the very volume that is charged with seeking the destruction of property  the end of all political associations is the preservation of the rights of man which rights are liberty property and security that the nation is the source of all sovereignty derived from it the right of property being secured and inviolable no one ought to be deprived of it except in cases of evident public necessity legally ascertained and on condition of a previous just indemnity  these are undoubtedly the rights of man  the rights for which all governments are established  and the only rights mr pain contends for but which he thinks no matter whether right or wrong are better to be secured by a republican constitution than by the forms of the english government he instructs me to admit that when government is once constituted no individuals without rebellion can withdraw their obedience from it  that all attempts to excite them to it are highly criminal for the most obvious reasons of policy and justice  that nothing short of the will of a whole people can change or affect the rule by which a nation is to be governed  and that no private opinion however honestly inimical to the forms or substance of the law can justify resistance to its authority while it remains in force the author of the rights of man not only admits the truth of all this doctrine but he consents to be convicted and i also consent for him unless his work shall be found studiously and painfully to inculcate these great principles of government which it is charged to have been written to destroy let me not therefore be suspected to be contending that it is lawful to write a book pointing out defects in the english government and exciting individuals to destroy its sanctions and to refuse obedience but on the other hand i do contend that it is lawful to address the english nation on these momentous subjects for had it not been for this unalienable right thanks be to god and our fathers for establishing it how should we have had this constitution which we so loudly boast of if in the march of the human mind no man could have gone before the establishments of the time he lived in how could our establishment by reiterated changes have become what it is if no man could have awakened the public mind to errors and abuses in our government how could it have passed on from stage to stage through reformation and revolution so as to have arrived from barbarism to such a pitch of happiness and perfection that the attorney general considers it as profanation to touch it any further or to look for any future amendment  in this manner power has reasoned in every age  government in its own estimation has been at all times a system of perfection but a free press has examined and detected its errors and the people have happily reformed them this freedom has alone made our government what it is and alone can preserve it and therefore under the banners of that freedom today i stand up to defend thomas pain but how alas shall this task be accomplished how may i expect from you what human nature has not made man for the performance of how am i to address your reasons or ask them to pause amidst the torrent of prejudice which has hurried away the public mind on the subject you are to judge  was any englishman ever so brought as a criminal before an english court of justice  if i were to ask you gentlemen of the jury what is the choicest fruit that grows upon the tree of english liberty you would answer security under the law if i were to ask the whole people of england the return they looked for at the hands of government for the burdens under which they bend to support it i should still be answered security under the law or in other words an impartial administration of justice so sacred therefore has the freedom or trial been ever held in england so anxiously does justice guard against every possible bias in her path that if the public mind has been locally agitated upon any subject in judgment the forum is either changed or the trial postponed the circulation of any paper that brings or which can be supposed to bring prejudice or even well founded knowledge within the reach of a british tribunal on the spur of an occasion is not only highly criminal but defeats itself by leading to put off the trial which its object was to pervert on this principle his lordship will permit me to remind him that on the trial of the dean of st asaph for a libel or rather when he was brought to trial the circulation of books by a society favorable to his defense was held by the noble lord as chief justice of chester to be a reason for not trying the cause although they contained no matter relative to the dean nor to the object of his trial being only extracts from ancient authors of high reputation on the general rights of juries to consider the innocence as well as the guilt of the accused yet still as the recollection of these rights was pressed forward with a view to affect the proceedings to guard the principle the proceedings were postponed  is the defendant then to be the only exception to these admirable provisions  is the english law to judge him stripped of he armor with which its universal justice encircles all others  shall we in the very act of judging him for detracting from the english government furnish him with ample matter for just reprobation instead of detraction has not his cause been prejudged through a thousand channels has not the work before you been daily publicly reviled and his person held up to derision and reproach has not the public mind been excited by crying down the very phrase and idea of the rights of man nay have not associations of gentlemen i speak it with regret because i am persuaded from what i know of some of them that they amongst them at least thought they were serving the public yet have they not in utter contempt and ignorance of that constitution of which they declare themselves to be the guardians published the grossest attacks upon the defendant have they not even while the cause has been standing here in the paper for immediate trial published a direct protest against the very work now before you advertising in the same paper though under the general description of seditious papers a reward on the conviction of any person who should dare to sell the book itself to which their own publication was an answer  the attorney general has spoken of a forced circulation of this work but how have these prejudging papers been circulated we all know how they have been thrown into our carriages in every street they have met us at every turnpike and they lie in the areas of all our houses to complete the triumph of prejudice that high tribunal of which i have the honor to be a member my learned friends know what i say to be true has been drawn into this vortex of slander and some of its members for i do not speak of the house itself have thrown the weight of their stations into the same scale  by all means i maintain that this cause has been prejudged  it may be said that i have made no motion to put off the trial for these causes and that courts of themselves take no cognizance of what passes elsewhere without facts laid before them gentlemen i know that i should have had equal justice from that quarter if i had brought myself within the rule but when should i have been better in the present aspect of things and therefore i only remind you of all these hardships that you may recollect that your judgment is to proceed upon that alone which meets you here upon the evidence in the cause and not upon suggestions destructive of every principle of justice  having disposed of these foreign prejudices i hope you will as little regard some arguments that have been offered to you in court the letter which has been so repeatedly pressed upon you ought to dismiss even from your recollection i have already put it out of the question as having been written long subsequent to the book and as being a libel on the king which no part of the information charges and which may hereafter be prosecuted as a distinct offense i consider that letter besides and indeed have always heard it treated as a forgery contrived to injure the merits of the cause and to embarrass me personally in its defense i have a right so to consider it because it is unsupported by any thing similar at an earlier period the defendants whole deportment previous to the publication has been wholly unexceptionable he properly desired to be given up as the author of the book if any enquiry should take place concerning it and he is not affected in evidence directly or indirectly with any illegal or suspicious conduct not even with having uttered an indiscreet or taunting expression nor with any one matter or thing inconsistent with the duty of the best subject in england his opinions indeed were adverse to our system but i maintain that opinion is free and that conduct alone is amenable to the law  yu are next desied to judge of the authors mind and intention by the modes and extent of the circulation of his work the first part of the righs of man mr attorney general tells you he did not prosecute although it was in circulation through the country for a year and a half together because it seems it circulated only amongst what he styles the judicious part of the public who possessed in their capacities and experience an antidote to the poison but that with regard to the second part now before you its circulation had been forced into every corner of society had been printed and reprinted for cheapness even upon whited brown paper and had crept into the very nurseries of children as a wrapper for their sweetmeats  in answer to this statement which after all stands only upon mr attorney generals own assertion unsupported by any kind of proof no witness having proved the authors personal interference with the sale i still maintain that if he had the most anxiously promoted it the question would remain exactly the same the question would still be whether at the time when pain composed his work and promoted the most extensive purchase of it he believed or disbelieved what he had written and whether he contemplated he happiness or the misery of the english nation to which it is addressed and whichever of these intentions may be evidenced to your judgments upon reading the book itself i confess i am utterly at a loss to comprehend how a writer can be supposed to mean something different from what he has written by an anxiety common i believe to all authors that his work should be generally read  remember i am not asking your opinions of the doctrines themselves you have given them already pretty visibly since i began to address you but i shall appeal not only to you but to those who without our leave will hereafter judge without appeal of all that we are doing to day whether upon the matter which i hasten to lay before you you can refuse in justice to pronounce that from his education  from the accidents and habits of his life  from the time and occasion of the publication  from the circumstances attending it  and from every line and letter of the work itself and all his other writings before and even since his conscience and understanding no matter whether erroneously or not were deeply and solemnly impressed with the matters contained in his book  that he addressed it to the reason of the nation at large and not to the passions of individuals and that in the issue of its influence he contemplated only what appeared to him though it may not to us to be the interest and happiness of england and of the whole human race in drawing the one or the other of these conclusions the book stands first in order and it shall now speak for itself  gentlemen the whole of it is in evidence before you the particular parts arraigned having only been read by my consent upon the presumption that on retiring from the court you would carefully compare them with the context and all the parts with the whole viewed together you cannot indeed do justice without it the most common letter even in the ordinary course of business cannot be read in a cause to prove an obligation for twenty shillings without the whole being read that the writers meaning may be seen without deception but in a criminal charge of only four pages and a half out of a work containing nearly two hundred you cannot with even the appearance of common justice pronounce a judgment without the most deliberate and cautious comparison i observe that the noble and learned judge confirms me in this observation but if any given part of a work be legally explanatory of every other part of it the preface a fortiori is the most material because the preface is the authors own key to his writing it is there that he takes the reader by the hand and introduces him to his subject it is there that the spirit and intention of the whole is laid before him by way of prologue a preface is meant by the author as a clue to ignorant or careless readers the author says by it to every man who chooses to begin where he ought look at my plan  attend to my distinctions  mark the purpose and limitations of the matter i lay before you  let then the calumniators of thomas pain now attend to his preface where to leave no excuse for ignorance or misrepresentation he expresses himself thus  i have differed from some professional gentlemen on the subject of prosecutions and i since find they are falling into my opinion which i will here state as fully but as concisely as i can  i will first put a case with respect to any law and then compare it with a government or with what in england is or has been called a constitution  it would be an act of despotism or what in england is called arbitrary power to make a law to prohibit investigating the principles good or bad on which such a law or any other is founded  if a law be bad it is one thing to oppose the practice of it but it is quite a different thing to expose its errors to reason on its defects and to show cause why it should be repealed or why another ought to be substituted in its place i have always held it an opinion making it also my practice that it is better to obey a bad law making use at the same time of every argument to show its errors and procure its repeal than forcibly to violate it because the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force and lead to a discretionary violation of those which are good  the case is the same with principles and forms of government or to what are called constitutions and the parts of which they are composed  it is for the good of nations and not for the emolument or aggrandisement of particular individuals that government ought to be established and that mankind are at the expense of supporting it the defects of every government and constitution both as to principle and form must on a parity of reasoning be as open to discussion as the defects of a law and it is a duty which every man owes to society to point them out when those defects and the means of remedying them are generally seen by a nation that nation will reform its government or its constitution in the one case as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other  gentlemen you must undoubtedly wish to deal with every man who comes before you in judgment as you would be dealt by yourselves and surely you will not lay it down to day as a law to be binding hereafter even upon yourselves that if you should publish any opinion concerning the existing abuses in your countrys government and point out to the whole public the means of amendment you are to be acquitted or convicted as any twelve men may happen to agree with you in your opinions yet this is precisely what you are asked to do to another it is precisely the case before you mr pain expressly says i obey a law until it is repealed obedience is not only my principle but my practice since my disobedience of a law from thinking it bad might apply to justify another man in the disobedience of a good one and thus individuals would give the rule for themselves and not society for all  gentlemen you will presently see that the same principle pervades the rest of the work and i am the more anxious to call your attention to it however repetition may tire you because it unfolds the whole principle of my argument for if you find a sentence in the whole book that invests any individual or any number of individuals or any community short of the whole nation with a power of changing any part of the law or constitution i abandon the cause  yes i freely abandon it because i will not affront the majesty of a court of justice by maintaining propositions which even upon the surface of them are false mr pain page          goes on thus  when a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking it is no longer to be governed as before but it would not only be wrong but bad policy to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason rebellion consists in forcibly opposing the general will of a nation whether by a party or by a government there ought therefore to be in every nation a method of occasionall ascertaining the state of public opinion with respect to government  there is therefore no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any matter respecting a general reform and by the same right that two persons can confer on such a subject a thousand may the object in all such preliminary proceedings is to find out what the general sense of a nation is and to be governed by it if it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform or choose to pay ten times more taxes than there is occasion for it has a right so to do and so long as the majority do not impose conditions on the minority different to what they impose on themselves though there may be much error there is no injustice neither will the error continue long reason and discussion will soon bring things right however wrong they may begin by such a process no tumult is to be apprehended the poor in all countries are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their interest and happiness are included it is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous  gentlemen these are the sentiments of the author of the rights of man and whatever his opinions may be of the defects in our government it never can change our sentiments concerning it if our sentiments are just and a writing can never be seditious in the sense of the english law which states that the government leans on the universal will for its support  gentlemen this universal will is the best and securest title which his majesty and his family have to the throne of these kingdoms and in proportion to the wisdom of our institutions the title must in common sense become the stronger so little idea indeed have i of any other that in my place in parliament not a week ago i considered it as the best way of expressing my attachment to the constitution as established at the revolution to declare i believe in the presence of the heir apparent of the crown for whom i have the greatest personal zeal that his majesty reigned in england by choice and consent as the magistrate of the english people not indeed a consent and choice by personal election like a king of poland the worst of all possible constitutions but by the election of a family for great national objects in defiance of that hereditary right which only becomes tyranny in the sense of mr pain when it claims to inherit a nation instead of governing by their consent and continuing for its benefit  gentlemen this sentiment has the advantage of mr burkes high authority who says with great truth in a letter to his constituents too little dependence cannot be had at this time of day on names and prejudices the eyes of mankind are opened and communities must be held together by a visible and solid interest i believe gentlemen of the jury that the prince of wales will always render this title dear to the people the attorney general can only tell you what he believes of him i can tell you what i know and what i am bound to declare since this prince may be traduced and calumniated in every part of the kingdom without its coming often in question till brought in to load a defense with matter collateral to the charge i therefore assert what the attorney general can only hope that whenever that prince shall come to the throne of this country which i hope but by the course of nature will never happen he will make the constitution of great britain the foundation of all his conduct  having now gentlemen established the authors general intention by his own introduction which is the best and fairest exposition let us next look at the occasion which gave it birth  the attorney general throughout the whole course of his address to you i knew it would be so has avoided the most distant notice or hint of any circumstance having led to the appearance of the author in the political world after a silence of so many years he has not even pronounced or even glanced at the name of mr burke but has left you to take it for granted that the defendant volunteered this delicate and momentous subject and that without being led to it by the provocation of political controversy he had seized a favorable moment to stigmatize from mere malice and against his own confirmed opinions the constituion of this couty  gentlemen my learned friend knows too well my respect and value for him to suppose that i am charging him with a wilful suppression i know him to be incapable of it he knew it would come from me he will premit me however to lament that it should have been left for me at this late period of the cause to inform you that not only the work before you but the first part of which it is a natural continuation were written avowedly and upon the face of them in answer to mr burke they were written besides under circumstances which i shall hereafter explain and in the course of which explanation i may have occasion to cite a few passages from the works of that celebrated person and i shall speak of him with the highest respect for with whatever contempt he may delight to look down upon my humble talents however he may disparage the principles which direct my public conduct he shall never force me to forget the regard which this country owes to him for the writings which he has left upon record for the illumination of our most distant posterity after the gratitude which we owe to god for the divine gifts of reason and understanding our next thanks are due to those from the fountain of whose enlightened minds they are fed and fructified but pleading as i do the cause of freedom of opinions i shall not give offense by remarking that this great author has been thought to have changed some of his and if thomas pain had not thought so i should not now be addressing you because the book which is my subject would never have been written who is right and who is wrong in the contention of doctrines i have repeatedly disclaimed to be the question i can only say that mr pain may be right throughout but that mr burke cannot  mr pain has been uniform in his opinions but mr burke has not  mr burke can only be right in part but should mr pain be even mistaken in the whole still i am not removed from the principle of his defense my defense has nothing to do with either the concealment or rectitude of his doctrines i admit mr pain to be a republican you shall soon see what made him one  i do not seek to shade or qualify his attack upon our constitution i put my defense on no such matter  he undoubtedly means to declare it to be defective in its forms and contaminated with abuses which in his judgment will one day or other bring on the ruin of us all it is in vain to mince the matter this is the scope of his work but still if it contains no attack upon the kings majesty nor upon any other living magistrate if it excites to no resistance to magistracy but on the contrary if it even inculcates as it does obedience to government then whatever may be its defects the question continues as before and ever must remain an unmixed question of the liberty of the press i therefore considered it as no breach of professional duty nor injurious to the cause i am defending to express my own admiration of the real principles of our constitution  a constitution which i hope never to see give way to any other  a constitution which has been productive of various benefits and which will produce many more hereafter if we have wisdom eough to pluck up those weeds that grow in the richest soils and amongst the brightest flowers i agree with the merchants of london that the english government is equal to the reformation of its own abuses and as an inhabitant of the city i would have signed their declaration if i had known of my own knowledge the facts recited in its preamble but abuses the english constitution unquestionably has which call loudly for reformation the existence of which has been the theme of our greatest statesmen which have too plainly formed the principles of the defendant and created the very conjuncture which produced his book  gentlemen we all but too well remember the calamitous situation in which our country stood but a few years ago  a situation which no man can look back upon without horror nor feel himself safe from relapsing into again while the causes remain which produced it the event i allude to you must know to be the american war and the still existing causes of it the corruptions of this government in those days it was not thought virtue by the patriots of england to conceal their existence from the people but then as now authority condemned them as disaffected subjects and defeated the ends they sought by their promulgation  hear the opinion of sir george saville  not his speculative opinion concerning the structure of our government in the abstract but his opinion of the settled abuses which prevailed in his own time and which continue at this moment but first let me remind you who sir george saville was  i fear we shall hardly look upon his like again  how shall i describe him to you  in my own words i cannot i was lately commended by mr burke in the house of commons for strengthening my own language by an appeal to dr johnson were the honorable gentleman present at this moment he would no doubt doubly applaud my choice in resorting to his own works for the description of sir george saville  his fortune is among the largest a fortune which wholly unincumbred as it is without one single charge from luxury vanity or excess sinks under the benevolence of its dispenser this private benevolence expanding itself into patriotism renders his whole being the estate of the public in which he has not reserved a peculium for himself of profit diversion or relaxation during the session the first in and the last out of the house of commons he passes from the senate to the camp and seldom seeing the seat of his ancestors he is always in parliament to serve his country or in the field to defend it  it is impossible to ascribe to such a character any principle but patriotism when he expressed himself as follows  i return to you baffled and dispirited and i am sorry that truth obliges me to add with hardly a ray of hope of seeing any change in the miserable course of public calamities  on this melancholy day of account in rendering up to you my trust i deliver to you your share of a country maimed and weakened its treasure lavished and misspent its honors faded and its conduct the laughing stock of europe our nation in a manner without allies or friends except such as we have hired to destroy our fellow subjects and to ravage a country in which we once claimed an invaluable share i return to you some of your principal privileges impeached and mangled and lastly i leave you as i conceive at this hour and moment fully effectually and absolutely under the discretion and power of a military force which is to act without waiting for the authority of the civil magistrates  some have been accused of exaggerating the public misfortunes nay of having endeavored to help forward the mischief that they might afterward raise discontents i am willing to hope that neither my temper nor my situation in life will be thought naturally to urge me to promote misery discord or confusion or to exult in the subversion of order or in the ruin of property i have no reason to contemplate with pleasure the poverty of our country the increase of our debts and of our taxes or the decay of our commerce  trust not however to my report reflect compare and judge for yourselves  but under all these disheartening circumstances i could yet entertain a cheerful hope and undertake again the commission with alacrity as well as zeal if i could see any effectual steps taken to remove the original couse of the mischief  then would there be a hope  but till the purity of the constituent body and thereby that of the representative be restored there is none  i gladly embrace this most public opportunity of delivering my sentiments not only to all my constituents but to those likewise not my constituents whom yet in the large sense i represent and am faithfully to serve  i look upon restoring election and representation in some degree for i expect no miracles to their original purity to be that without which all other efforts will be vain and ridiculous  if something be not done you may indeed retain the outward form of your constitution but not the power thereof  such were the words of that great good man lost with those of many others of his time and his fame as far as power could hurt it put in the shade along with them the consequences we have all seen and felt america from an obedient affectionate colony became an independent nation and two millions of people nursed in the very lap of our monarchy became the willing subjects of a republican constitution  gentlemen in that great and calamitous conflict mr burke and mr pain fought in the same field of reason together but with very different successes mr burke spoke to a parliament in england such as sir george saville describes it that had no ears but for sounds that flattered its corruptions mr pain on the other hand spoke to a people reasoned with them that they were bound by no subjection to any sovereignty further than their own benefits connected them and by these powerful arguments prepared the minds of the american people for that glorious just and happy revolution  gentlemen i have a right to distinguish it by that appellation because i aver that at this moment there is as sacred a regard to property as inviolable a security to all the rights of individuals lower taxes fewer grievances less to deplore and more to admire in the constitution of america than that of any other country under heaven i wish indeed to except our own but i cannot even do that till it shall be purged of those abuses which though they obscure and deform the surface have not as yet thank god destroyed the vital parts  why then is mr pain to be calumniated and reviled because out of a people consisting of near three millions he alone did not remain attached in opinion to a monarchy remember that all the blood which was shed in america and to which he was for years a melancholy and indignant witness was shed by the authority of the crown of great britain under the influence of its parliament such as sir george saville has described it and such as mr burke himself will be called upon by and by in more glowing colors to paint it how then can it be wondered at that mr pain should return to this country in his heart a republican was he not equally republican when he wrote common sense yet that volume has been sold without restraint or prosecution in every shop in england ever since and which nevertheless i appeal to the book which i have in court and which is in every bodys hands contains every one principle of government and every abuse in the british constitution which is to be found in the rights of man yet mr burke himself saw no reason to be alarmed at its publication nor to cry down its contents even when america which was swayed by it was in arms against the crown of great britain you shall hear his opinion of it in his letter to the sheriffs of bristol pages    and     the court gazette accomplished what the abettors of independence had attempted in vain when that disingenuous compilation and strange medley of railing and flattery was adduced as a proof of the united sentiments of the people of great britain there was a great change throughout all america the tide of popular affection which had still set toward the parent country began immediately to turn and to flow with great rapidity in a contrary course far from concealing these wild declarations of enmity the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence insists largely on the multitude and the spirit of these addresses and draws an argument from them which if the fact were as he supposes must be irresistible for i never knew a writer on the theory of government so partial to authority as not to allow that the hostile mind of the rulers to their people did fully justify a change of government nor can any reason whatever be given why one people should voluntarily yield any degree of preeminence to another but on a supposition of great affection and benevolence toward them unfortunately your rulers trusting to other things took no notice of this great principle of connection  but there is a time it seems for all things  gentlemen the consequences of this mighty revolution are too notorious to require illustration no audience would sit to hear what every body has seen and felt the independence of america notoriously produced not by remote and circuitous effect but directly and palpably the revolutions which now agitate europe and which portend such new changes over the face of the earth let governors take warning the revolution in france was the consequence of her incurably corrupt and profligate government god forbid that i should be thought to lean by this declaration upon her unfortunate monarch bending perhaps at this moment under afflictions which my heart sinks within me to think of but when i speak with detestation of the former politics of the french court i fasten as little of them upon that fallen and unhappy prince as i impute to our gracious sovereign the corruptions of our own government i desire indeed in the distinctest manner to be understood that i mean to speak of his majesty not only with that obedience and duty which i owe to him as a subject but with that justice which i think is due to him from all men who examine his conduct either in public or private life  gentlemen mr pain happened to be in england when the french revolution took place and notwithstanding what he must be supposed and allowed from his history to have felt upon such a subject he remained wholly silent and inactive the people of this country too appeared to be indifferent spectators of the animating scene they saw without visible emotion despotism destroyed and the king of france by his own consent become the first magistrate of a free people certainly at least it produced none of those effects which are so deprecated by government at present nor most probably ever would if it had not occurred to the celebrated person whose name i must so often mention voluntarily to provoke the subject a subject which if dangerous to be discussed he should not have led to the discussion for surely it is not to be endured that any private man is to publish a creed for a whole nation to tell us that we are not to think for ourselves  to impose his own fetters upon the human mind  to dogmatise at discretion  and that no man shall sit down to answer him without being guilty of a libel i assert that if it be a libel to mistake our constitution  to support it by means that tend to destroy it  and to choose the most dangerous sason for the interference mr burke is that libeller but not therefore the object of a criminal prosecution for whilst i am defending the motives of one man i have neither right nor disposition to criminate the motives of another all i contend for is a fact that cannot be controverted viz that this officious interference was the origin of mr paines book i put my cause upon its being the origin of it  the avowed origin  as will abundantly appear from the introduction and preface to both parts and throughout the whole body of the work nay from the very work of mr burke himself to which both of them are answers  gentlemen for the history of that celebrated work i appeal to itself  when the french revolution had arrived at some of its early stages a few and but a few persons not to be named when compared with the nation took a visible interest in these mighty events an interest well worthy of englishmen they saw a pernicious system of government which had led to cruel desolating wars and had been for ages the scourge of great britain giving way to a system which seemed to promise harmony and peace amongst the nations they saw this with virtuous and peaceable satisfaction and a reverend divine dr price  eminent for his eloquence recollecting that the issues of life are in the hands of god saw no profaneness in mixing the subject with public thanksgiving reminding the people of this country of their own glorious deliverance in former ages it happened also that a society of gentlemen france being then a neutral nation and her own monarch swearing almost daily upon her altars to maintain the new constitution thought they infringed no law by sending a general congratulation their numbers indeed were very inconsiderable so much so that mr burke with more truth than wisdom begins his volume with a sarcasm upon their insignificance  until very lately he had never heard of such a club it certainly never occupied a moment of his thoughts nor he believed those of any person out of their own set  why then make their proceedings the subject of alarm throughout england  there had been no prosecution against them nor any charge founded upon suspicion of disaffection against any of their body but mr burke thought it was reserved for his eloquence to whip these curs of faction to their kennels how he has succeeded i appeal to all that has happened since the introduction of his schism in the british empire by giving to the king whose title was questioned by no man a title which it is his majestys most solemn interest to disclaim  after having in his first work lashed dr price in a strain of eloquent irony for considering the monarchy to be elective which he could not but know dr price in the literal sense of election neither did or could possibly consider it mr burke published a second treatise in which after reprinting many passages from mr paines former work he ridicules and denies the supposed right of the people to change their governments in the following words  the french revolution say they speaking of the english societies was the act of the majority of the people and if the majority of any other people the people of england for instance wish to make the same change they have the same right just the same undoubtedly that is none at all  and then after speaking of the subserviency of will to duty in which i agree with him he in a substantive sentence maintains the same doctrine thus  the constitution of a country being once settled upon some compact tacit or expressed there is no power existing of force to alter it without the breach of the covenant or the consent of all the parties such is the nature of a contract  so that if reason or even revelation itself were now to demonstrate to us that our constitution was mischievous in its effects that to use mr attorney generals expression we had been insane for the many centuries we have supported it yet that still if the king had not forfeited his title to the crown nor the lords their privileges the universal voice of the whole people of england could not build up a new government upon a legitimate basis  gentlemen not to argue for the present against such a proposition and supposing it could beyond all controversy be maintained for heavens sake let wisdom never utter it let policy and prudence for ever conceal it if you seek the stability of the english government rather put the book of mr pain which calls it bad into every hand in the kingdom than doctrines which bid human nature rebel even against that which is the best  say to the people of england look at your constitution there it lies before you  the work of your pious fathers handed down as a sacred deposit from generation to generation the result of wisdom and virtue and its parts cemented together with kindred blood there are indeed a few spots upon its surface but the same principle which reared the structure will brush them all away you may keep it or you may destroy it  to such an address what would be the answer a chorus of the nation  yes we will preserve it but say to the same nation even of the very same constitution it is yours such as it is for better or for worse it is strapped upon your backs to carry it as beasts of burden and you have no jurisdiction to cast it off let this be your position and you instantly raise up i appeal to every mans consciousness of his own nature a spirit of uneasiness and discontent yet it is the controversy alone which this useless and mischievous proposition stirred up that has pointed most of the passages arraigned before you which it will be presently my duty to explain  but let the prudence of the argument be what it may the argument itself is untenable  his majesty undoubtedly was not elected to the throne no man can be supposed in the teeth of fact to have contended it but did not the people of england elect king william and break the hereditary succession and does not his majestys title grow out of that election it is one of the charges against the defendant his having denied the parliament which called the prince of orange to the throne to have been a legal convention of the whole people and is not the very foundation of that charge that it was such a legal convention and that it was intended to be so and if it was so did not the people then confer the crown upon king william without any regard to hereditary right did they not cut off the prince of wales who stood directly in the line of succession and who had incurred no personal forfeiture did they not give their deliverer an estate in the crown totally new and unprecedented in the law or history of the country and lastly might they not by the same authority have given the royal inheritance to the family of a stranger mr justice blackstone in his commentaries in terms asserts that they might and ascribes their choice of king william and the subsequent limitations of the crown not to want of jurisdiction but to their true origin to prudence and discretion in not disturbing a valuable institution further than public safety and necessity dictated  the english government stands then on this public consent the true root of all governments and i agree with mr burke that while it is well administered it is not in the power of factions or libels to disturb it though when ministers are in fault they are sure to set down all disturbances to these causes this is most justly and eloquently exemplified in the thoughts on the cause of the present discontents page   and    ministers contend that no adequate provocation has been given for so spreading a discontent our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable temper and consummate wisdom the wicked industry of some libellers joined to the intrigues of a few disappointed politicans have in their opinion been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation  nothing indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of this country if the above account be a true one i confess i shall assent to it with great reluctance and only on the compulsion of the clearest and firmest proofs because their account resolves itself into this short but discouraging proposition that we have a very good ministry but that we are a very bad people that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feeds us and with a malignant insanity oppose the measures and ungratefully vilify the persons of those whose sole object is our own peace and prosperity if a few puny libellers acting under a knot of factious politicians without virtue parts or character for such they are constantly represented by these gentlemen are sufficient to excite this disturbance very perverse must be the disposition of that people amongst whom such a disturbance can be excited by such means  he says true never were serious disturbances excited by such means  but to return to the argument  let us now see how the rights of the people stand upon authority and whether this great source of government is not maintained by persons on whom my friend will find it hard to fasten the character of libellers  i shall begin with the most modern author on the subject of government  a gentleman whose work lies spread out before me as it often does for my delight and instruction in my leisure hours i have also by the favor of a friend who sits near me in court the honor of his personal acquaintance he is a man perhaps more than any other devoted to the real constitution of the country as will be found throughout his valuable work and he is a person besides of great learning which enabled him to infuse much useful knowledge into my learned friend who introduced me to him mr law kings counsel i speak of mr paley archdeacon of carlisle and of his work entitled the principles of political and moral philosophy in which he investigates the first principles of all governments  a discussion not thought dangerous till lately and i hope we shall soon get rid of this ridiculous panic  mr paley professes to think of governments what the christian religion was thought of by its first teachers  if it be of god it will stand and he puts the duties of obedience to them upon free will and moral duty after dissenting from mr lock as to the origin of governments in compact he says  wherefore rejecting the intervention of a compact as unfounded in its principle and dangerous in the application we assign for the only ground of the subjects obligation the will of god as collected from expediency  the steps by which the argument proceeds are few and direct  it is the will of god that the happiness of human life be promoted  this is the first step and the foundation not only of this but of every moral conclusion civil society conduces to that end  this is the second proposition civil societies cannot be upheld unless in each the interest of the whole society be binding upon every part and member of it  this is the third step and conducts us to the conclusion namely  that so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconveniency it is the will of god which will universally determines our duty that the established government be obeyed  and no longer  but who shall judge of this we answer every man for himself in contentions between the sovereign and the subject the parties acknowledge no common arbitrator and it would be absurd to commit the decision to those whose conduct has provoked the question and whose own interest authority and fate are immediately concerned in it the danger of error and abuse is no objection to the rule of expediency because every other rule is liable to the same or greater and every rule that can be propounded upon the subject like all rules which appeal to or bind the conscience must in the application depend upon private judgment it may be observed however that it ought equally to be accounted the exercise of a mans private judgment whether he determines by reasonings and conclusions of his own or submits to be directed by the advice of others provided he be free to choose his guide  he then proceeds in a manner rather inconsistent with the principles entertained by my learned friend in his opening to you   no usage law or authority whatever is so binding that it need or ought to be continued when it may be changed with advantage to the community the family of the prince  the order of succession  the prerogative of the crown  the form and parts of the legislature  together with the respective powers office duration and mutual dependency of the several parts are all only so many laws mutable like other laws whenever expediency requires either by the ordinary act of the legislature or if the occasion deserve it by the interposition of the people  no man can say that mr paley intended to diffuse discontent by this declaration he must therefore be taken to think with me that freedom and affection and the sense of advantages are the best and the only supports of government on the same principle he then goes on to say  these points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe they are represented to the mind as principles of the constitution settled by our ancestors and being settled to be no more committed to innovation or debate as foundations never to be stirred as the terms and conditions of the social compact to which every citizen of the state has engaged his fidelity by virtue of a promise which he cannot now recall such reasons have no place in our system  such are the sentiments of this excellent author and there is no part of mr paines work from the one end of it to the other that advances any other proposition  but the attorney general will say these are the grave speculative opinions of a friend to the english government whereas mr pain is its professed enemy what then the principle is that every man whle he obeys the laws is to think for himself and to conduct himself as he thinks the very ends of society exact this license and the policy of the law in its provisions for its security has tacitly sanctioned it the real fact is that writings against a free and wellproportioned government need not be guarded against by laws they cannot often exist and never with effect the just and aweful principles of society are rarely brought forward but when they are insulted and denied or abused in practice mr lockes essay on government we owe to sir robert filmer as we owe mr paines to mr burke and indeed between the arguments of filmer and burke i see no essential difference since it is not worth disputing whether a king exists by diine right or indissoluble human compact if he exists whether we will or no if his existence be without our consent and to continue without benefit it matters not a farthing whether his title be from god or from man  that his title is from man and from every generation of man without regard to the determination of former ones hear from mr lock all mn say they i e filmer and his adherents are born under government and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one every one is born a subject to his father or his prince and is therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance it is plain mankind never owned nor considered any such natural subjection that they were born in to one or to the other that tied them without their own consents to a subjection to them and their heirs  it is true that whatever engagements or promises any one has made for himself he is under the obligation of them but cannot by any compact whatsoever bind his children or posterity for his son when a man being altogether as free as the father any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son than it can of any body else  so much for mr lockes opinion of the rights of mankind let us now examine his ideas of the supposed danger of trusting them with them  perhaps it will be said that the people being ignorant and always discontented to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humor of the people is to expose it to certain ruin and no government will be able long to subsist if the people may set up a new legislature whenever they take offense at the old one to this i answer quite the contrary people are not so easily got out of their old forms as some are apt to suggest they are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the frame they have been accustomed to and if there be any original defects or adventitious ones introduced by time or corruption it is not an easy thing to be changed even when all the world sees there is an opportunity for it this slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old constitutions has in the many revolutions which have been seen in this kingdom in this and former ages still kept us to or after some interval of fruitless attempts still brought us back again to our old legislative of king lords and commons and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from some of our princes heads they never carried the people so far as to place it in another line  gentlemen i wish i had strength to go on with all that is material but i have read enough not only to maintain the true principles of government but to put to shame the narrow system of distrusting the people  it may be said that mr lock went great lengths in his positions to beat down the contrary doctrine of divine right which was then endangering the new establishment but that cannot be objected to david hume who maintains the same doctrine speaking of the magna charta in his history vol ii page    he says it must be confessed that the former articles of the great charter contain such mitigations and explanations of the feodal law as are reasonable and equitable and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal government and provide for the equal distribution of justice and free enjoyment of property the great object for which political society was founded by men which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall and which no time nor precedent nor statute nor positive institution ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermost in their thoughts and attention  these authorities are sufficient to rest on yet i cannot omit mr burke himself who is if possible still more distinct on the subject speaking not of the ancient people of england but of colonies planted almost within our memories he says if there be one fact in the world perfectly clear it is this that the disposition of the people of america is wholly averse to any other than a free government and this is indication enough to any honest statesman how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their case if any ask me what a free government is i answer that it is what the people think so and that they and not i are the natural lawful and competent judges of this matter if they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is consistent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom i ought to thank them for so great a trust and not to endeavor to prove from thence that they have reasoned amiss and that having gone so far by analogy they must hereafter have no enjoyment but by my pleasure  gentlemen i am sorry to feel my time considerably consumed before i am arrived at what i conceive to be the material subject of your consideration for all that i have been stating now is only to show that there is not that novelty in the opinions of the defendant that should lead you to think that he does not bona fde entertain them much less when connected with the history of his life which i therefore brought in review before you  but still the great question remains unargued had he a right to promulgate these opinions gentlemen if he entertained them i shall argue that he had  and although my arguments upon the liberty of the press may not today be honored with your or the courts approbation i shall retire not at all disheartened consoling myself with the reflection that a season may arrive for their reception  the most essential freedoms of mankind have been but slowly and gradually received and so very late indeed do some of them come to maturity that notwithstanding the attorney general tells you that the very question i am now agitating is most peculiarly for your consideration as a jury under our ancient constitution yet i must remind both you and him that your jurisdiction to consider and deal with it at all in judgment is but a year old  when before that late period i ventured to maintain this very right of a jury over the question of libel under the same ancient constitution i do not mean before my lord for the matter was gone to rest in the courts at least long before he came to sit where he does but when before a noble and reverend magistrate of the most exalted understanding and of the most uncorrupted integrity to give effect to it earl mansfield  i had occasion to maintain it he treated me not with disregard indeed for of that his nature was incapable but he put me aside with indulgence as you do a child while it is lisping its prattle out of season and if this cause had been tried then instead of now the defendant must have been instantly convicted on the proof of the publication whatever you might have thought of his case  yet i have lived to see it resolved by an almost unanimous vote of the whole parliament of england that i had all along een in the right if this be not an awful lesson of cauton concerning opinions where are such lessons to be read  gentlemen i have insisted at great length upon the origin of government being in the consent of the people and detailed the authorities which you have heard upon the subject because i consider it to be not only a support but indeed the only foundation of the liberty of the press if mr burke be right in his principles of government i admit that the press in my sense of its freedom ought not to be free nor free in any sense at all and that all addresses to the people upon the subject of government and all speculations of amendment of what kind or nature soever are illegal and criminal  for if the people have without possible recall delegated all their authorities they have no jurisdiction to act and therefore none to think upon such subjects and it is a libel to arraign government or any of its acts before those that have no jurisdiction to correct them but on the other hand as it is a settled rule in the law of england that the subject may always address a competent jurisdiction on every matter within it no legal argument can shake the freedom of the press in my sense of it if i am supported in my doctrines concerning the great unalienable rights of the people to change or to reform their governments  gentlemen it is because the liberty of the press resolves itself into this great issue that it has been in every time and country the last liberty which subjects have been able to wrest from power  other liberties are held under governments but the liberty of opinion keeps governments themselves in due subjection to their duties this has produced the martyrdom of truth in every age and the world has only purged itself from ignorance with the innocent blood of those who have enlightened it  gentlemen my strength and time are wasted and i can only make this melancholy history pass like a shadow before you  i shall begin with the grand type and example  the universal god of nature  the savior of mankind  the fountain of all light who came to pluck the world from eternal darkness expired upon a cross the scoff of infidel scorn and his blessed apostles followed him in the train of martyrs when he came in the flesh he might have come like the mohammedan prophet as a powerful sovereign and propagated that religion with an unconquerable sword which even now after the lapse of ages is but slowly moving under the influence of reason over the face of the earth but such a process would have been inconsistent with his mission which was to confound the pride and to establish the universal rights of men he came therefore in that lowly state which is represented in the gospel and preached his consolations to the poor  when the foundation of this religion was discovered to be invulnerable and immortal we find political power taking the church into partnership thus began the corruptions both of religion and civil power and hand in hand together what havoc have they not made in the world ruing by ignorance and the persecution of truth but this very persecution only hastened the revival of letters and liberty which was t destroy the one and to raise up the other nay you will find that in the exact proportion that knowledge and learning have been beat down and fettered they have destroyed the governments that bound them the court of star chamber the first restriction on the press of england was erected in      from that moment no man could legally write without an imprimatur from the state but truth and freedom found their way with greater force through secret channels and the unhappy charles unwarned by a free press was brought in eleven years afterward to an ignominious death  when men can freely communicate their thoughts and their sufferings real or imaginary their passions spend themselves in air like gunpowder scattered upon the surface but pent up by terrors they work unseen like subteraneous fire burst forth in earthquake and destroy every thing in their course let reason be opposed to reason and argument to argument and every good government will be safe  the usurper cromwell pursued the same system of restraint in support of his government and the end of it speedily followed  at the restoration of charles the second the star chamber ordinance of      was worked up into an act of parliament and was ollowed up during that reign and the short one that followed it by the most sanguinary prosecutions but what fact in history is more notorious than that this blind and contemptible policy prepared and hastened on the revolution at that great era these cobwebs ere all brushed away the freedom of the press was regenerated and the country rued by its affections has since enjoyed a century of tranquillity and glory  thus i have maintained by english history that in proportion as the press has been free english government has been secure  gentlemen i will now support the same important truth by very great authorities upon a subject of this kind resort cannot be had to law cases the ancient law of england knew nothing of such libels they began and should have ended with the star chamber what writings are slanderous of individuals must be looked for where these prosecutions are recorded but upon general subjects we must go to general writers if indeed i were to refer to obscure authors i might be answered that my very authorities were libels instead of justifications or examples but this cannot be said with effect of great men whose works are classics in our language taught in our schools and printed under the eye of government  gentlemen i shall begin with the poet milton a great authority in all learning  it may be said indeed he was a republican but that would only prove that republicanism is not incompatible with virtue it may be said too that the work which i cite was written against previous licensing which is not contended for today but in my opinion if every work is to be adjudged a libel which is adverse to the wishes of government or to the opinions of those who may try it the revival of a licencer would be a security to the public for if i present my book to a magistrate appointed by law if he rejects it i have only to forbear from the publication and in the forbearance i am safe and he too is answerable to law for the abuse of his authority but upon the argument of today a man must print at his peril without any guide to the principles of judgment upon which his work may be afterward posecuted and condemned miltons argument therefore applies and was meant to apply to every interruption to writing which while they oppress the individual endanger the state  we have them not says milton that can be heard of from any ancient state or polity or church nor by any statute left us by our ancestors elder or later nor from the modern custom of any reformed city or church abroad but from the most antichristian council and the most tyrannous inquisition that ever existed till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth the issue of the brain was no more stied than the issue of the womb  to the pure all things are pure not only meats and drinks but all kind of knowledge whether good or evil the knowledge cannot defile nor consequently the books if the will and conscience be not defiled  bad books serve in many respects to discover to confute to forewarn and to illustrate whereof what better witness can we expect i should produce than one of your own now sitting in parliament the chief of learned men reputed in this land mr seldom whose volume of natural and national laws proves not only by great authorities brought together but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematicaly demonstrative that all opinions yea errors known read and collated are of main service and assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is truest  opinions and understanding are not such wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and statutes and standards we must not think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the land to mark and license it like our broad cloth and our woolpacks  nor is it to the common people less than a reproach for if we be so jealous over them that we cannot trust them with an english pamphlet what do we but censure them for a giddy vicious and ungrounded people in such a sick and weak estate of faith and discretion as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a licenser that this is care or love of them we cannot pretend  those corruptions which it seeks to prevent break in faster at doors which cannot be shut  to prevent men thinking and acting for themselves by restraints on the press is like to the exploits of that gallant man who thought to pound up the crows by shutting his park gate  this obstructing violence meets for the most part with an event utterly opposite to the end which it drives at instead of suppressing books it raises them and invests them with a reputation the punishment of wits enhances their authority says the viscount st albans and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain spark of truth that flies up in the face of them who seek to tread it out  he then adverts to his visit to the famous galileo whom he found and visited in the inquisition for not thinking in astronomy with the franciscan and dominican monks and what event ought more deeply to interest and affect us the very laws of nature were to bend under the rod of a licenser this illustrious astronomer ended his life within the bars of a prison because in seeing the phases of venus through his newlyinvented telescope he pronounced that she shone with borrowed light and from the sun as the center of the universe this was the mighty crime the placing the sun in the center that sun which now inhabits it upon the foundation of mathematical truth which enables us to traverse the pathless ocean and to carry our line and rule amongst other worlds which but for galileo we had never known perhaps even to the recesses of an infinite and immortal god  milton then in his most eloquent address to the parliament puts the liberty of the press on its true and most honorable foundation believe it lords and commons they who counsel ye to such a suppressing of books do as good as bid you suppress yourselves and i will soon show how  if it be desired to know the immediate cause of all this free writing and free speaking there cannot be assigned a truer than your own mild and free and humane government it is the liberty lords and commons which your own valorous and happy counsels have purchased us liberty which is the nurse of all great wits this is that which has rarefied and enlightened our spirits like the influence of heaven this is that which has enfranchised enlarged and lifted up our apprehensions degrees above themselves ye cannot make us now less capable less knowing less eagerly pursuing the truth unless ye first make yourselves that made us so less the lovers less the founders of our true liberty we can grow ignorant again brutish formal and slavish as ye found us but you then must first become that which ye cannot be oppressive arbitrary and tyrannous as they were from whom ye have freed us that our hearts are now more capacious our thoughts now more erected to the search and expectation of greatest and exactest things is the issue of your own virtue propagated in us give me the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties  gentlemen i will now refer you to another author whose opinion you may think more in point as having lived in our own times and as holding the highest monarchical principles of government i speak of mr hume who nevertheless considers that this liberty of the press extends not only to abstract speculation but to keep the public on their guard against all the acts of their government  after showing the advantages of a monarchy to public freedom provided it is duly controlled and watched by the popular part of the constitution he says these principles account for the great liberty of the press in these kingdoms beyond what is indulged in any other government it is apprehended that arbitrary power would steal in upon us were we not careful to prevent its progress and were there not an easy method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other the spirit of the people mst frequently be roused in order to curb the ambition of the court and the dread of rousing this spirit must be employed to prevent that ambition nothing is so effectual to this purpose as the liberty of the press by which all the learning wit and genius of the nation may be employed on the side of freedom and every one be animated to its defense as long therefore as the republican part of our government can maintain itself against the monarchical it will naturally be careful to keep the press open as of importance to its own preservation  there is another authority cotemporary with the last a splendid speaker in the upper house of parliament and who held during most of his time high offices under the king i speak of the earl of chesterfield who thus expressed himself in the house of lords  one of the greatest blessings my lords we enjoy is liberty but every good in this life has its alloy of evil  licentiousness is the alloy of liberty it is    lord kenyon doctor johnson claims to pluck that feather from lord chesterfields wing he speaks i believe of the eye of the political body   mr erskine gentlemen i have heard it said that lord chesterfield borrowed that which i was just about to state and which his lordship has anticipated   lord kenyon that very speech which did lord chesterfield so much honor is supposed to have been written by doctor johnson   mr erskine gentlemen i believe it was so and i am much obliged to his lordship for giving me a far higher authority for my doctrine for though lord chesterfield was a man of great ingenuity and wit he was undoubtedly far inferior in learning and in monarchical opinion to the celebrated writer to whom my lord has now delivered the work by his authority doctor johnson then says one of the greatest blessings we enjoy one of the greatest blessings a people my lords can enjoy is liberty but every good in this life has its alloy of evil licentiousness is the alloy of liberty it is an ebullition an excrescence it is a speck upon the eye of the political body which i can never touch but with a gentle with a trembling hand lest i destroy the body lest i injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear  there is such a connection between licentiousness and liberty that it is not easy to correct the one without dangerously wounding the other it is extremely hard to distinguish the true limit between them like a changeable silk we can easily see there are two different colors but we cannot easily discover where the one ends or where the other begins  i confess i cannot help agreeing with this learned author the danger of touching the press is the difficulty of marking its limits my learned friend who has just gone out of court has drawn no line and unfolded no principle he has not told us if this book is condemned what book may be written if i may not write against the existence of a monarchy and recommend a republic may i write against any part of tie government may i say that we should be better without a house of lords or a house of commons or a court of chancery or any other given part of our establishment or if as has been hinted a work may become libellous for stating even legal matter with sarcastic phrase the difficulty becomes the greater and the liberty of the press more impossible to define  the same author pursuing the subject and speaking of the fall of roman liberty says but this fort of liberty came soon after to be called licentiousness for we are told that augustus after having established his empire restored order in rome by restraining licentiousness god forbid we should in this country have order restored or licentiousness restrained at so dear a rate as the people of rome paid for it to augustus  let us consider my lords that arbitrary power has seldom or never been introduced into any country at once it must be introduced by slow degrees and as it were step by step lest the people should see its approach the barriers and fences of the peoples liberty must be plucked up one by one and some plausible pretenses must be sound for removing or hoodwinking one after another those sentries who are posted by the constitution of a free country for warning the people of their danger when these preparatory steps are once made the people may then indeed with regret see slavery and arbitrary power making long strides over their land but it will be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin  the stage my lords and the press are two of our outsentries if we remove them if we hoodwink them if we throw them in fetters the enemy may surprise us  gentlemen this subject was still more lately put in the justest and most forcible light by a noble person high in the magistracy and whose mind is not at all tuned to the introduction of disorder by improper popular excesses i mean lord loughborough chief justice of the court of common pleas i believe i can answer for the correctness of my note which i shall follow up with the opinion of another member of the lords house of parliament the present earl stanhope or rather i shall take lord stanhope first as his lordship introduces the subject by adverting to this argument of lord loughboroughs if says his lordship our boasted liberty of the press were to consist only in the liberty to write in praise of the constitution this is a liberty enjoyed under many arbitrary governments i suppose it would not be deemed quite an unpardonable offense even by the empress of russia if any man were to take into his head to write a panegyric upon the russian form of government such a liberty as that might therefore properly be termed the russian liberty of the press but the english liberty of the press is of a very different description for by the law of england it is not prohibited to publish speculative works upon the constitution whether they contain praise or censure  lord stanhopes defense of the libel bill  you see therefore as far as the general principle goes i am supported by the opinion of lord stanhope for otherwise the noble lord has written a libel himself by exciting other people to write whatever they may think be it good or evil of the constitution of the country as to the other high authority lord loughborough i will read what applies to this subject  every man said lord loughborough may publish at his discretion his opinions concerning forms and systems of government  if they be wise and enlightening the world will gain by them if they be weak and absurd they will be laughed at and forgotten and if they be bona fide they cannot be criminal however erroneous on the other hand the purpose and the direction may give a different turn to writings whose common construction is harmless or even meritorious suppose men assembled in disturbance of the peace to pull down mills or turnpikes or to do any other mischief and that a mischievous person should disperse among them an excitation to the planned mischief known to both writer and reader to your tents o israel that publication would be criminal but how criminal not as a libel not as an abstract writing but as an act and the act being the crime it must be stated as a fact extrinsic on the record for otherwise a court of error could have no jurisdiction but over the natural construction of the writing nor would the defendant have any notice of such matter at the trial without a charge on the record to give the jury cognizance of any matter beyond the construction of the writing the averrment should be in the case as i have instanced that certain persons were as i have described assembled and that the publisher intending to execute these persons so assembled wrote so and so here the crime is complete and consists in an overt act of wickedness evidenced by a writing  in answer to all these authorities the attorney general may say that if mr pain had written his observations with the views of those high persons and under other circumstances he would be protected and acquitted to which i can only answer that no facts or circumstances attending his work are either charged or proved that you have no jurisdiction whatever but over the natural construction of the work before you and that i am therefore brought without a flaw in the deduction to the passages which are the particular subject of complaint  gentlemen i am not unmindful how long i have already trespassed upon your patience and recollecting the nature of the human mind and how much for a thousand reasons i have to struggle against at this moment i shall not be disconcerted if any of you should appear anxious to retire from the pain of hearing me farther it has been said that my vanity has forwarded my zeal in this cause but i might appeal even to the authors of those paragraphs whether a situation ever existed which vanity would have been fonder to fly from  the task of speaking against every known prepossession with every countenance as it were planted and lifted up against me but i stand at this bar to give to a criminal arraigned before it the defense which the law of the country entitles him to if any of my arguments be indecent or unfit for the court to hear the noble judge presides to interrupt them if all or any of them are capable of an answer they will be answered or if they be so unfounded in your own minds who are to judge of them as not to call for refutation your verdict in a moment will overthrow all that has been said  we shall then have all discharged our duties  it is yours to judge but mne only to address your judgments  when my lord and i were counsel for lord george gordon in      it was not considered by that jury nor imputed to us by any body that we were contending for the privileges of overawing the house of commons or recommending the conflagration of this city i am doing the same duty now which my lord and i then did in concert together and whatever may become of the cause i expect to be heard conscious that no just obloquy can be or will in the end be cast upon me for having done my duty in the manner i have endeavored to perform it  gentlemen i come now to observe on the passages selected by the information and with regard to the first i shall dispose of it in a moment  all hereditary government is in its nature tyranny an hereditable crown or an hereditable throne or by what other fanciful name such things may be called have no other significant explanation than that mankind are hereditable property to inherit a government is to inherit the people as if they were flocks and herds  and is it to be endured says the attorney general that the people of this country are to be told that they are driven like oxen or sheep certainly not i am of opinion that a more dangerous doctrine cannot be instilled into the people of england but who instills such a doctrine i deny it is instilled by pain for when he maintains that hereditary monarchy inherits a people like flocks and herds it is clear from the context which is ket out of view that he is combating the proposition in mr burkes book which asserts that the hereditary monarchy of england is fastened upon the people of england by indissoluble compact mr pain on the contrary asserts the king of england to be the magistrate of the people existing by their consent which is utterly incompatible with their being driven like herds his argument therefore is this and it retorts on his adversary he says such a king as you represent the king of england to be inheriting the people by virtue of conquest or of some compact which having once existed cannot be dissolved while the original terms of it are kept is an inheritance like flocks and herds but i deny that to be the king of englands title he is the magistrate of the people and that title i respect it is to your own imaginary king of england therefore and not to his majesty that your unfounded innuendos apply it is the monarchs of russia and prussia and all governments fastened upon unwilling subjects by hereditary indefeasible titles that are stigmatized by pain as inheriting the people like flocks the sentence therefore must either be taken in the pure abstract and then it is not only merely speculative but the application of it to our own government fails altogether or it must be taken connected with the matter which constitutes the application and then it is mr burkes king of england and not his majesty whose title is denied  i pass therefore to the next passage which appears to be an extraordinary selection it is taken at a leap from page    to page    and breaks in at the words this convention the sentence selected stands thus this convention met at philadelphia in may      of which general washington was elected president he was not at that time connected with any of the state governments or with congress he delivered up his commission when the war ended and since then had lived a private citizen  the convention went deeply into all the subjects and having after a variety of debate and investigation agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution the next question was the manner of giving it authority and practice  for this purpose they did not like a cabal of courtiers send for a dutch stadtholder or a german elector but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country  this sentence standing thus by itself may appear to be a mere sarcasm on king william upon those who effected the revolution and upon the revolution itself without any reasoning or deduction but when the context and sequel are looked at and compared it will appear to be a serious historical comparison between the revolution effected in england in      and the late one in america when she established her independence and no man can doubt that his judgment on that comparison was sincere but where is the libel on the constitution for whether king william was brought over here by the sincerest and justest motives of the whole people of england each man acting for himself or through the motives and agencies imputed by the defendant it signifies not one farthing at this time of day to the establishment itself blackstone warns us not to fix our obedience or affection to the government on the motives of our ancestors or the rectitude of their reasonings but to be satisfied that it is established this is safe reasoning and for my own part i should not be differently affected to the constitution of my country which my own understanding approved whether angels or demons had given it birth  do any of you love the reformation the less because henry the eighth was the author of it or because lust and poverty and not religion were his motives he had squandered the treasures of his father and he preferred anne bullen to his queen these were the causes which produced it  what then does that affect the purity of our reformed religion undermine its establishment or shake the kings title as prince of the country to the exclusion of those who held by the religion it had abolished will the attorney general affirm that i could be convicted of a libel for a whole volume of asperity against henry the eighth merely because he effected the reformation and if not why against king william who effected the revolution where is the line to be drawn is one two or three centuries to be the statute of limitation but do not our own historians detail this very cabal of courtiers from the records of our own country if you will turn to humes history volume the eighth page     etc etc you will find that he states at great length the whole detail of intrigues which paved the way for the revolution and the interested coalition of parties which gave it effect  but what of all this concerning the motives of parties which is recorded by hume the question is what is the thing brought about  not how it was brought about if it stands as blackstone argues it upon the consent of our ancestors followed up by our own no individual can withdraw his obedience if he dislikes the establishment let him seek elsewhere for another i am not contending for uncontrouled conduct but for freedom of opinion  with regard to what has been stated of the edwards and henrys and the other princes under which the author can only discover restrictions on power but nothing of a constitution surely my friend is not in earnest when he selects that as a libel  pain insists that there was no constitution under these princes and that english liberty was obtained from usurped power by the struggles of the people so say i and i think it for the honor and advantage of the country that it should be known  was there any freedom after the original establishment of the normans by conquest was not the magna charta wrested from john by open force of arms at runnymead was it not again reenacted whilst menacing arms were in the hands of the people were not it is stipulations broken through and two and forty times reenacted by parliament upon the firm demand of the people in the following reigns i protest it fills me with astonishment to hear these truths brought in question  i was formerly called upon under the discipline of a college to maintain them and was rewarded for being thought to have successfully maintained that our present constitution was by no means a remnant of saxon liberty nor any other institution of liberty but the pure consequence of the oppression of the norman tenures which spreading the spirit of freedom from one end of the kingdom to another enabled our brave fathers inch by inch not to reconquer but for the first time to obtain those privileges which are the unalienable inheritance of all mankind  but why do we speak of the edwards and henrys when hume himself expressly says notwithstanding all we have heard today of the antiquity of our constitution that our monarchy was nearly absolute till the middle of last century i have his book in court and will read it to you it is his essay on the liberty of the press vol i page     all absolute governments and such in a great measure was england till the middle of the last century notwithstanding the numerous panegyries on ancient english liberty must very much depend on the administration  this is humes opinion the conclusion of a grave historian from all that he finds recorded as the materials for history and shall it be said that mr pain is to be punished for writing today what was before written by another who is now a distinguished classic in the language all the verdicts in the world will not make that palateable to an impartial public or to posterity  the next passage arraigned is this p    the attention of the government of england for i rather choose to call it by this name than the english government appears since it is political connection with germany to have been so completely engrossed and absorbed by foreign affairs and the means of raising taxes that it seems to exist for no other purposes domestic concerns are neglected and with respect to regular law there is scarcely such a thing  that the government of this country is in consequence of it is connection with the continent and the continental wars which it has occasioned been continually loaded with grievous taxes no man can dispute and i appeal to your justice whether this subject has not been for years together the constant topic of unreproved declamation and grumbling  as to what he says with regard to there hardly being such a thing as regular law he speaks in the abstract of the complexity of our system but does not arraign the administration of justice in it is practice but with regard to criticisms and strictures on the general system it has been echoed over and over again by various authors and even from the pulpits of our country that the law of the land is mainly defective devoid of regularity and precision and overloaded with a variety of expensive and unnecessary forms i have a sermon in court written during the american war by a person of great eloquence and piety part of which i will read to you on this subject in which he looks forward to an exemption from the intolerable grievances of our old legal system in the infant establishment of the new world  it may be in the purposes of providence on yon western sores to raise the bulwark of a purer reformation than ever britain patronized to sound a less burdensome more auspicious stable and incorruptible government than ever britain has enjoyed and to establish there a system of law more just and simple in it is principles less intricate dubious and dilatory in it is proceedings more mild and equitable in it is sanctions more easy and more certain in it is execution wherein no man can err through ignorance of what concerns him or want justice through poverty or weakness or escape it by legal artifice or civil privileges or interposing power wherein the rule of conduct shall not be hidden or disguised in the language of principles and customs that died with the barbarism which gave them birth wherein hasty formulas shall not dissipate the reverence that is due to the tribunals and transactions of justice wherein obsolete prescripts shall not pervert nor entangle nor impede the administration of it nor in any instance expose it to derision or to disregard wherein misrepresentation shall have no share in deciding upon right and truth and under which no man shall grow great by the wages of chicanery or thrive by the quarrels that are ruinous to his employers  this is ten times stronger than mr pain but who ever thought of prosecuting mr cappe  in various other instances you will find defects in our jurisprudence pointed out and lamented and not seldom by persons called upon by their situations to deliver the law in the seat of magistracy therefore the authors general observation does not appear to be that species of attack upon the magistracy of the country as to fall within the description of a libel  with respect to the two houses of parliament i believe i shall be able to show you that the very person who introduced this controversy and who certainly is considered by those who now administer the government as a man usefully devoted to maintain the constitution of the country in the present crisis has himself made remarks upon these assemblies that upon comparison you will think more severe than those which are the subject of the attorney generals animadversion the passage in mr pain runs thus  with respect to the two houses of which the english parliament is composed they appear to be effectually influenced into one and as a legislature to have no temper of it is own the minister whoever he at any time may be touches it as with an opium wand and it sleeps obedience  but if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses the difference will appear so great as to show the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it wretched as the state of representation is in england it is manhood compared with what is called the house of lords and so little is this nicknamed house regarded that the people scarcely inquire at any time what it is doing it appears also to be most under influence and the furthest removed from the general interest of the nation  the conclusion of the sentence and which was meant by pain as evidence of the previous affection the attorney general has omitted in the information and in his speech it is this in the debate on engaging in the russian and turkish war the majority in the house of peers in favor of it was upwards of ninety when in the other house which is more than double it is numbers the majority was sixtythree  the terms however in which mr burke speaks of the house of lords are still more expressive it is something more than a century ago since we voted the house of lords useless they have now voted themselves so and the whole hope of reformation  speaking of the house of commons is cast upon us this sentiment mr burke not only expressed in his place in parliament where no man can call him to an account but it has been since repeatedly printed amongst his other valuable works and his opinion of both the houses of parliament which i am about to read to you was originally published as a pamphlet and applied to the settled habitual abuses of these high assemblies remember i do not use them as argumenta ad hominem or ad invidiam against the author for if i did it could be no defense of mr pain but i use them as high authority the work mr burkes thoughts on the cause of the present discontents published in      having been the just foundation of substantial and lasting reputation would to god that any part of it were capable of being denied or doubted  against the being of parliament i am satisfied no designs have ever been entertained since the revolution every one must perceive that it is strongly the interest of the court to have some second cause interposed between the ministers and the people the gentlemen of the house of commons have an interest equally strong in sustaining the part of that intermediate cause however they may hire out the usfct of their voices they never will part with the sea and inheritance accordingly those who have been of the most known devotion to the will and pleasure of a court have at the same time been most forward in asserting an high authority in the house of commons when they knew who were to use that authority and how it was to be employed they thought it never could be carried too far it must be always the wish of an unconstitutional statesman that an house of commons who are entirely dependent upon him should have every right of the people dependent upon their pleasure for it was discovered that the forms of a free and the ends of an arbitrary government were things not altogether incompatible  the power of the crown almost dead and rotten as prerogative has grown up anew with much more strength and far less odium under the name of influence an influence which operates without noise and violence which converts the very antagonist into the instrument of power which contains in itself a perpetual principle of growth and renovation and which the distress and the prosperity of the country equally tend to augment was an admirable substitute for a prerogative that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices had molded in its original stamina irresiible principles of decay and dissolution the ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary system but the interest of active men in the state is a foundation perpetual and infallible  mr burke therefore in page    speaking of the same court party says  parliament was indeed the great object of all these polities the end at which they aimed as well as the instrument by which they were to operate  and pursuing the subject in page  0 proceeds as follows  they who will not conform their conduct to the public good and cannot support it by the prerogative of the crown have adopted a new plan they have totally abandoned the shattered and oldfashioned fortress of prerogative and made a lodgement in the strong hold of parliament itself if they have any evil design to which there is no ordinary legal power commensurate they bring it into parliament there the whole is executed from the beginning to the end and the power of obtaining their object absolute and the safety in the proceeding perfect no rules to confine nor after reckonings to terrify for parliament cannot with any great propriety punish others for things in which they themselves have been accomplices thus its control upon the executory power is lost because it is made to partake in every considerable act of government and impeachment that great guardian of the purity of the constitution is in danger of being lost even to the idea of it  until this time the opinion of the people through the power of an assembly still in some sort popular led to the greatest honors and emoluments in the gift of the crown now the principle is reversed and the favor of the court is the only sure way of obtaining and holding those honors which ought to be in the disposal of the people  mr burke in page  00 observes with great truth that the mischiefs he complained of did not at all arise from the monarchy but from the parliament and that it was the duty of the people to look to it he says the distempers of monarchy were the great subjects of apprehension and redress in the last century in this the distempers of parliament  not the distempers of parliament in this year or the last but in this century i e its settled habitual distemper it is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary disorders can be completed and hardly indeed can it begin there until a confidence in government is reestablished the people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed attention to the conduct of their representatives standards for judging more systematically upon their conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties and corporations and frequent and correct lists of the voters in all important questions ought to be procured  by such means something may be done since it may appear who those are that by an indiscriminate support of all administrations have totally baied all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings have confounded the best men with the worst and weakened and dissolved instead of strengthening and compacting the general frame of government  i wish it was possible to read the whole of this most important volume  but the consequences of these truths contained in it were all eloquently summed up by the author in his speech upon the reform of the household  but what i confess was uppermost with me what i bent the whole course of my mind to was the reduction of that corrupt influence which is itself the perennial spring of all prodigality and disorder which loads us more than millions of debt which takes away vigor from our arms wisdom from our councils and every shadow of authority and credit from the most venerable parts of our constitution  the same important truths were held out to the whole public upon a still later occasion by the person now at the head of his majestys councils and so high as it appears in the confidence of the nation he not in the abstract like the author before you but upon the spur of the occasion and in the teeth of what had been just declared in the house of commons came to and acted upon resolutions which are contained in this book mr erskine took up a book resolutions pointed to the purification of a parliament dangerously corrupted into the very state described by mr pain remember here too that i impute no censure to mr pit it was the most brilliant passage in his life and i should have thought his life a better one if he had continued uniform in the support of opinions which it is said he has not changed and which certainly have had nothing to change them but at all events i have a right to make use of the authority of his splendid talents and situation not merely to protect the defendant but the public and to resist the precedent that what one man may do in england with approbation and glory shall conduct another man to a pillory or a prison  it was the abuses pointed out by the man before you that led that right hon gentleman to associate with many others of high rank under the banners of the duke of richmond whose name stands at the head of the list and to pass various public resolutions concerning the absolute necessity of purifying the house of commons and we collect the plan from a preamble entered in the book whereas the life liberty and property of every man is or may be affected by the law of the land in which he lives and every man is bound to pay obedience to the same  and whereas by the constitution of this kingdom the right of making laws is vested in three estates of king lords and commons in parliament assembled and the consent of all the three said estates comprehending the whole community is necessary to make laws to bind the whole community and whereas the house of commons represents all the commons of the realm and the consent of the house of commons binds the consent of all the commons of the realm and in all cases on which the legislature is competent to decide  and whereas no man is or can be actually represented who has not a vote in the election of his representative  and whereas it is the right of every commoner of this realm infants persons of insane mind and criminals incapacitated by law only excepted to have a vote in the election of the representative who is to give his consent to the making of laws by which he is to be bound  and whereas the number of persons who are suffered to vote for electing the members of the house of commons do not at this time amount to onesixth part of the whole commons of this realm whereby far the greater part of the said commons are deprived of their right to elect their representatives and the consent of the majority of the whole community to the passing of laws is given by persons whom they have not delegated for such purposes and the majority of the said community and to which the said majority have not in fact consented by themselves or by their representatives  and whereas the state of election of members of the house of commons has in process of time so grossly deviated from its simple and natural principle of representation and equality that in several places the members are returned by the property of one man that the smallest boroughs send as many members as the largest counties and that a majority of the representatives of the whole nation are chosen by a number of votes not exceeding twelve thousand  these with many others were published not as abstract speculative writings but within a few days after the house of commons had declared that no such rights existed and that no alteration was necessary in the representation it was then that they met at the thatched house and published their opinions and resolutions to the country at large  were any of them prosecuted for these proceedings certainly not for they were legal proceedings but i desire you as men of honor and truth to compare all this with mr paines expression of the ministers touching parliament with his opiate wand and let equal justice be done  that is all i ask  let all be punished or none  do not let mr pain be held out to the contempt of the public upon the score of his observations on parliament while others are enjoying all the sweets which attend a supposed attachment to their country who have said the same things and reduced their opinions to practice  but now every man is to be cried down for such opinions i observed that my learned friend significantly raised his voice in naming mr horn took as if to connect him with pain or pain with him this is exactly the same course of justice for after all he said nothing of mr took what could he have said but that he was a subscriber with the great names i have read in these proceedings which they have thought fit to desert  gentlemen let others hold their opinions and change them at their pleasure i shall ever maintain it to be the dearest privilege of the people of great britain to watch over every thing that affects their good government either in the system or in the practice and that for this purpose the press must be free it has always been so and much evil has been corrected by it  if government finds itself annoyed by it let it examine it is own conduct and it will find the cause  let it amend it and it will find the remedy  gentlemen i am no friend to sarcasms in the discussion of grave subjects but you must take writers according to the view of the mind at the moment mr burke as often as any body indulges in it  hear his reason in his speech on reform for not taking away the salaries from lords who attend upon the british court you would said he have the court deserted by all the nobility of the kingdom  sir the most serious mischiefs would follow from such a desertion kings are naturally lovers of low company they are so elevated above all the rest of mankind that they must look upon all their subjects as on a level they are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility on account of the occasional resistance to their will which will be made by their virtue their petulance or their pride it must indeed be admitted that many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers talebearers parasites pimps and bussoons as any of the lowest and vilest of mankind can possibly be but they are not properly qualified for this object of their ambition the want of a regular education and early habits with some lurking remains of their dignity will never permit them to become a match for an italian eunuch a mountebank a sidler a player or any regular practitioner of that tribe the roman emperors almost from the beginning threw themselves into such hands and the mischief increased every day till it is decline and it is final ruin it is therefore of very great importance provided the thing is not overdone to contrive such an establishment as must almost whether a prince will or not bring into daily and hourly offices about his person a great number of his first nobility and it is rather an useful prejudice that gives them a pride in such a servitude though they are not much the better for a court a court will be much the better for them i have therefore not attempted to reform any of the offices of honor about the kings person  what is this but saying that a king is an animal so incurably addicted to low company as generally to bring on by it the ruin of nations but nevertheless he is to be kept as a necessary evil and his propensities bridled by surrounding him with a parcel of miscreants still worse if possible but better than those he would chose for himself  this therefore if taken by itself would be a most abominable and libellous sarcasm on kings and nobility but look at the whole speech and you observe a great system of regulation and no man i believe ever doubted mr burkes attachment to monarchy to judge therefore of any part of a writing the whole must be read  with the same view i mean to read to you the beginning of harringtons oceana but it is impossible to name this well known author without exposing to just contempt and ridicule the ignorant or profligate misrepresentations which are vomited forth upon the public to bear down every man as desperately wicked who in any age or country has countenanced a republic for the mean purpose of prejudging this trial  mr erskine took up a book but laid it down again without reading from it saying something to the gentleman who sat near him in a low voice which i did not hear is this the way to support the english constitution are these the means by which englishmen are to be taught to cherish it i say if the man upon trial were stained with blood instead of ink  if he were covered over with crimes which human nature would start at the naming of the means employed against him would not be the less disgraceful  for this notable purpose then harrington not above a week ago was handed out to us as a low obscure wretch involved in the murder of the monarch and the destruction of the monarchy and as addressing his despicable works at the shrine of an usurper yet this very harrington this low blackguard was descended you may see his pedigree at the heralds office for sixpence from eight dukes three marquisses seventy earls twentyseven viscounts and thirtysix barons sixteen of whom were knights of the garter a descent which i think would save a man from disgrace in any of the circles of germany but what was he besides  a bloodstained ruffian oh brutal ignorance of the history of the country he was the most affectionate servant of charles the first from whom he never concealed his opinions for it is observed by wood that the king greatly affected his company but when they happened to talk of a commonwealth he would scarcely endure it  i know not says toland which most to commend the king for trusting an honest man though a republican or harrington for owning his principles while he served a king  but did his opinions affect his conduct  let history again answer  he preserved his fidelity to his unhappy prince to the very last after all his fawning courtiers had left him to his enraged subjects he staid with him while a prisoner in the isle of wight came up by stealth to follow the fortunes of his monarch and master even hid himself in the boot of the coach when he was conveyed to windsor and ending a he began fell into his arms and fainted on the scaffold  after charless death the oceana was written and as if it were written from justice and affection to his memory for it breathes the same noble and spirited regard and asserts that it was not charles that brought on the destruction of the monarchy but the feeble and ill constituted nature of monarchy itself  but the book was a flattery to cromwell  once more and finally let history decide  it was seized by the usurper as a libel and the way it was recovered is remarkable i mention it to show that cromwell was a wise man in himself and knew on what governments must stand for their support  harrington waited on his daughter to beg for his book and on entering her apartment snatched up her child and ran away  on her following him with surprise and terror he turned to her and said i know what you feel as a mother feel then for me your father has got my child meaning the oceana the oceana was afterward restored on her petition cromwell answering with the sagacity of a sound politician let him have his book if my government is made to stand it has nothing to fear from paper shot  he said true  no good government will ever be battered by paper shot montesquieu says that in a free nation it matters not whether individuals reason well or ill it is sufficient that they do reason truth arises from the collision and from hence springs liberty which is a security from the effect of reasoning the attorney general read extracts from mr adamss answer to this book let others do like mr adams i am not insisting upon the infallibility of mr paines doctrines if they are erroneous let them be answered and truth will spring from the collision  a disposition in a nation to this species of controversy is no proof of sedition or degeneracy but quite the reverse as is mentioned by milton i omitted to cite the passage with the others who in speaking of this subject rises into that inexpressibly sublime style of writing wholly peculiar to himself he was indeed no plagiary from any thing human he looked up for light and expression as he himself wonderfully describes it by devout prayer to that great being who is the source of all utterance and knowledge and who sends out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altars to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases when the cheerfulness of the people says this mighty poet is so sprightly up as that it has not only wherewith to guard well it is own freedom and safety but to spare and to bestow upon the solidest and sublimest points of controversy and new invention it betokens us not degenerated nor drooping to a fatal decay but casting off the old and wrinkled skin of corruption to outlive these pangs and wax young again entering the glorious ways of truth and prosperous virtue destined to become great and honorable in these latter ages methinks i see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks methinks i see her as an eagle muing her mighty youth and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam purging and unscaling her long abused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance while the whole noise of timorous and flocking birds with those also that love the twilight flutter about amazed at what she means and in their envious gabble would prognosticate a year of sects and schisms  gentlemen what milton only saw in his mighty imagination i see in fact what he expected but which never came to pass i see now fulfilling methinks i see this noble and puissant nation not degenerated and drooping to a fatal decay but casting off the wrinkled skin of corruption to put on again the vigor of her youth  and it is because others as well as myself see this that we have all this uproar  france and its constitution are the mere pretenses it is because britons begin to recollect the inheritance of their own constitution left them by their ancestors it is because they are awakened to the corruptions which have fallen upon its most valuable parts that forsooth the nation is in danger of being destroyed by a single pamphlet  gentlemen i have marked the course of this alarm it began with the renovation of those exertions for the public which the authors of the alarm had themselves originated and deserted and they became louder and louder when they saw these principles avowed and supported by my admirable and excellent friend mr fox the most eminently honest and enlightened statesman that history brings us acquainted with a man whom to name is to honor but whom in attempting adequately to describe i must fly to mr burke my constant refuge when eloquence is necessary a man who to relieve the sufferings of the most distant nation put to the hazard his ease his security his interest his power even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he had never seen how much more then for the inhabitants of his native country yet this is the man who has been censured and disavowed in the manner we have lately seen  gentlemen i have but a few more words to trouble you with i take my leave of you with declaring that all this freedom which i have been endeavoring to assert is no more than the freedom which belongs to our own inbred constitution i have not asked you to acquit mr pain upon any new lights or upon any principle but the law which you are sworn to administer my great object has been to inculcate that wisdom and policy which are the parents of the law of great britain forbid this jealous eye over her subjects and that on the contrary they cry aloud in the language of the poet employed by lord chatham on the memorable subject of america unfortunately without effect be to their faults a little blind be to their virtues very kind let all their thoughts be unconfined and clap your padlock on the mind   engage them by their affections convince their reason and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty sincere vigorous or rational a conviction that it is their truest interest and that their form of government is for their common good constraint is the natural parent of resistance and a pregnant proof that reason is not on the side of those who use it you must all remember gentlemen lucians pleasant story jupiter and a countryman were walking together conversing with great freedom and familiarity upon the subject of heaven and earth the countryman listened with attention and acquiescence while jupiter strove only to convince him but happening to hint a doubt jupiter turned hastily round and threatened him with his thunder  ah ha says the countryman now jupiter i know that you are wrong youre always wrong when you appeal to your thunder  this is the case with me  i can reason with the people of england but i cannot fight against the thunder of authority  gentlemen this is my defense for free opinions with regard to myself i am and ever have been obedient and affectionate to the law to that rule of action as long as i exist i shall ever give my voice and my conduct but i shall ever do as i have done today maintain the dignity of my high profession and perform as i understand them all its important duties   mr attorney general arose immediately to reply to mr erskine when mr campbell the foreman of the jury said  my lord i am authorized by the jury here to inform the attorney general that a reply is not necessary for them unless the attorney general wishes to make it or your lordship  mr attorney general sat down and the jury gave in their verdict guilty  erratum page    line  0 should read thus  is it possible that you or i can believe or that reason can make any other man believe  the passage is printed correct where it occurs again the bottom of page
