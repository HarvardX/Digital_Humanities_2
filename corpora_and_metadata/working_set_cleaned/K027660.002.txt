a sentimental journey etc etc  a sentimental journey through france and italy  by mr yorick  vol ii  london printed for t becket and p a de hondt in the strand mdcclxviii  the fille de chamber paris what the old french officer had delivered upon traveling bringing poloniuss advice to his son upon the same subject into my head  and that bringing in hamlet and hamlet the rest of shakespeares works i stopped at the quai de conti in my return home to purchase the whole set  the bookseller said he had not a set in the world  comment said i taking one up out of a set which lay upon the counter betwixt us  he said they were sent him only to be got bound and were to be sent back to versailles in the morning to the count de b   and does the count de b said i read shakespeare cest un esprit fort replied the bookseller  he loves english books and what is more to his honor monsieur he love the english too you speak this so civilly said i that it is enough to oblige an englishman to lay out a louis dor or two at your shop  the bookseller made a bow and was going to say something when a young decent girl of about twenty who by her air and dress seemed to be fille de chamber to some devout woman of fashion came into the shop and asked for les egarments du coeur and de lesprit the bookseller gave her the book directly she pulled out a little green satin purse run round with a ribband of the same color and putting her finger and thumb into it she took out the money and paid for it as i had nothing more to stay me in the shop we both walked out at the door together   and what have you to do my dear said i with the wanderings of the heart who scarce know yet you have one nor till love has first told you it or some faithless shepherd has made it ache can thou ever be sure it is so  le dieu men guard said the girl  with reason said i  for if is a good one it is pity it should be stolen it is a little treasure to thee and gives a better air to your face than if it was dressed out with pearls  the young girl listened with a submissive attention holding her satin purse by its ribband in her hand all the time  it is a very small one said i taking hold of the bottom of it  she held it toward me  and there is very little in it my dear said i but be but as good as thou art handsome and heaven will fill it i had a parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for shakespeare and as she had let go the purse entirely i put a single one in and tying up the ribband in a bowknot returned it to her  the young girl made me more a humble courtesy than a low one  twas one one of those quiet thankful sinkings where the spirit bows itself down  the body does no more than tell it i never gave a girl a crown in my life which gave me half the pleasure  my advice my dear would not have been worth a pin to you said i if i had not given this along with it but now when you see the crown you will remember it  so dont my dear lay it out in ribbands  upon my word sir said the girl earnestly i am incapable  in saying which as is usual in little bargains of honor she gave me her hand  en verite monsieur je mettrai cet argent apart said she  when a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman it sanctifies their most private walks so notwithstanding it was dusky yet as both our roads lay the same way we made no scruple of walking along the quai de conti together  she made me a second courtesy in setting off and before we got twenty yards from the door as if she had not done enough before she made a sort of a little stop to tell me again  she thanked me  it was a small tribute i told her which i could not avoid paying to virtue and would not be mistaken in the person i had been rendering it to for the world  but i see innocence my dear in your face  and foul befall the man who ever lays a snare in its way  the girl seemed affected some way or other with what i said  she gave a low sigh  i found i was not empowered to enquire at all after it  so said nothing more till i got to the corner of the rue de nevers where we were to part   but is this the way my dear said i to the hotel de modene she told me it was  or that i might go by the rue de guineygaude which was the next turn  then i will go my dear by the rue de guineygaude said i for two reasons first i shall please myself and next i shall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as i can the girl was sensible i was civil  and said she wished the hotel de modene was in the rue de st pierre  you live there said i  she told me she was fille de chamber to madame r  good god said i it is the very lady for whom i have brought a letter from amiens  the girl told me that madame r she believed expected a stranger with a letter and was impatient to see him  so i desired the girl to present my compliments to madame r and say i would certainly wait upon her in the morning  we stood still at the corner of the rue de nevers whilst this passed  we then stopped a moment whilst she disposed of her egarments de coeur etc more commodiously than carrying them in her hand  they were two volumes so i held the second for her whilst she put the first into her pocket and then she held her pocket and i put in the other after it  it is sweet to feel by what finespun threads our affections are drawn together  we set off afresh and as she took her third step the girl put her hand within my arm  i was just bidding her  but she did it of herself with that undeliberating simplicity which showed it was out of her head that she had never seen me before for my own part i felt the conviction of consanguinity so strongly that i could not help turning half round to look in her face and see if i could trace out any thing in it of a family likeness  tut said i are we not all relations  when we arrived at the turning up of the rue de guineygaude i stopped to bid her adieu for good an all the girl would thank me again for my company and kindness  she bid me adieu twice  i repeated it as often and so cordial was the parting between us that had it happened any where else i am not sure but i should have signed it with a kiss of charity as warm and holy as an apostle  but in paris as none kiss each other but the men  i did what amounted to the same thing    i bid god bless her  the passport paris when i got home to my hotel la fleur told me i had been enquired after by the lieutenant de police  the duce take it said i  i know the reason it is time the reader should know it for in the order of things in which it happened it was omitted not that it was out of my head but that had i told it then it might have been forgot now  and now is the time i want it  i had left london with so much precipitation that it never entered my mind that we were at war with france and had reached dover and looked through my glass at the hills beyond boulogne before the idea presented itself and with this in its train that there was no getting there without a passport go but to the end of a street i have a mortal aversion for returning back no wiser than i sat out and as this was one of the greatest efforts i had ever made for knowledge i could less bear the thoughts of it so hearing the count de  had hired the packet i begged he would take me in his suite the count had some little knowledge of me so made little or no difficulty  only said his inclination to serve me could reach no further than calais as he was to return by way of brussels to paris however when i had once passed there i might get to paris without interruption but that in paris i must make friends and shift for myself  let me get to paris monsieur le count said i  and i shall do very well so i embarked and never thought more of the matter  when le fleur told me the lieutenant de police had been enquiring after me  the thing instantly recurred  and by the time le fleur had well told me the master of the hotel came into my room to tell me the same thing with this addition to it that my passport had been particularly asked after the master of the hotel concluded with saying he hoped i had one  not i faith said i  the master of the hotel retired three steps from me as from an infected person as i declared this  and poor le fleur advanced three steps toward me and with that sort of movement which a good soul makes to succor a distressed one  the fellow won my heart by it and from that single trait i knew his character as perfectly and could rely upon it as firmly as if he had served me with fidelity for seven years  mon seignior cried the master of the hotel  but recollecting himself as he made the exclamation he instantly changed the tone of it  if monsieur said he has not a passport apparament in all likelihood he has friends in paris who can procure him one  not that i know of quoth i with an air of indifference  then certes replied he you will be sent to the bastile or the chatelet au moins poo said i the king of france is a good natured soul  he will hurt no body  cela nempeche pas said he  you will certainly be sent to the bastile tomorrow morning  but i have taken your lodgings for a month answered i and i will not quit them a day before the time for all the kings of france in the world la fleur whispered in my ear that no body could oppose the king of france  pardi said my host ces messieurs anglois sont des gens tres extraordinaires  and having both said and sworn it  he went out  the passport the hotel at paris i could not find in my heart to torture la fleurs with a serious look upon the subject of my embarrassment which was the reason i had treated it so cavalierly and to show him how light it lay upon my mind i dropped the subject entirely and whilst he waited upon me at supper talked to him with more than usual gaiety about paris and of the opera comique  la fleur had been there himself and had followed me through the streets as far as the booksellers shop but seeing me come out with the young fille de chamber and that we walked down the quai de conti together la fleur deemed it unnecessary to follow me a step further  so making his own reflections upon it he took a shorter cut  and got to the hotel in time to be informed of the affair of the police against my arrival  as soon as the honest creature had taken away and gone down to sup himself i then began to think a little seriously about my situation    and here i know eugenius thou will smile at the remembrance of a short dialogue which passed betwixt us the moment i was going to set out  i must tell it here  eugenius knowing that i was as little subject to be overburthend with money as thought had drawn me aside to interrogate me how much i had taken care for upon telling him the exact sum eugenius shook his head and said it would not do so pulled out his purse in order to empty it into mine  i have enough in conscience eugenius said i  indeed yorick you have not replied eugenius  i know france and italy better than you  but you dont consider eugenius said i refusing his offer that before i have been three days in paris i shall take care to say or do something or other for which i shall get clapped up into the bastile and that i shall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of frances expense  i beg pardon said eugenius drily really i had forgot that resource  now the event i treated gaily came seriously to my door  is it folly or nonchalance or philosophy or pertinacity  or what is it in me that after all when la fleur had gone down stairs and i was quite alone that i could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwise than i had then spoken of it to eugenius   and as for the bastile the terror is in the word  make the most of it you can said i to myself the bastile is but another word for a tower  and a tower is but another word for a house you cannot get out of  mercy on the gouty for they are in it twice a year  but with nine livres a day and pen and ink and paper and patience albeit a man cannot get out he may do very well within  at least for a month or six weeks at the end of which if he is a harmless fellow his innocence appears and he comes out a better and wiser man than he went in  i had some occasion i forget what to step into the courtyard as i settled this account and remember i walked down stairs in no small triumph with the conceit of my reasoning  beshrew the sombre pencil said i vauntingly  for i envy not its powers which paints the evils of life with so hard and deadly a coloring the mind sits terrified at the objects she has magnified herself and blackened reduce them to their proper size and hue she overlooks them  it is true said i correcting the proposition  the bastile is not an evil to be despised  but strip it of its towers  fill up the fosse  unbarricade the doors  call it simply a confinement and suppose it is some tyrant of a distemper  and not of a man which holds you in it  the evil vanishes and you bear the other half without complaint  i was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy with a voice which i took to be of a child which complained it could not get out  i looked up and down the passage and seeing neither man woman or child i went out without further attention  in my return back through the passage i heard the same words repeated twice over and looking up i saw it was a starling hung in a little cage  i cannot get out  i cannot get out said the starling  i stood looking at the bird and to every person who came through the passage it ran fluttering to the side toward which they approached it with the same lamentation of its captivity  i cannot get out said the starling  god help thee said i but i will let thee out cost what it will so i turned about the cage to get to the door it was twisted and double twisted so fast with wire there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to pieces  i took both hands to it  the bird flew to the place where i was attempting his deliverance and thrusting his head through the trellis pressed his breast against it as if impatient  i fear poor creature said i i cannot set thee at liberty  no said the starling  i cannot get out  i cannot get out said the starling  i vow i never had my affections more tenderly awakened or do i remember an incident in my life where the dissipated spirits to which my reason had been a bubble were so suddenly called home mechanical as the notes were yet so true in tune to nature were they chanted that in one moment they overthrew all my systematic reasonings upon the bastile and i heavily walked up stairs unsaying every word i had said in going down them  disguise thyself as thou will still slavery said i  still thou art a bitter draught and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of thee thou art no less bitter on that account  it is thou thrice sweet and gracious goddess addressing myself to liberty whom all in public or in private worship whose taste is grateful and ever wilt be so till nature herself shall change  no tint of words can spot thy snowy mantle or chymic power turn thy scepter into iron  with thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust the swain is happier than his monarch from whose court thou art exiled  gracious heaven cried i kneeling down upon the last step but one in my ascent  grant me but health thou great bestower of it and give me but this fair goddess as my companion  and shower down thy mitres if it seems good unto thy divine providence upon those heads which are aching for them  the captive paris the bird in his cage pursued me into my room i sat down close to my table and leaning my head upon my hand i begun to figure to myself the miseries of confinement i was in a right frame for it and so i gave full scope to my imagination  i was going to begin with the millions of my fellow creatures born to no inheritance but slavery but finding however affecting the picture was that i could not bring it near me and that the multitude of of sad groups in it did but distract me    i took a single captive and having first shut him up in his dungeon i then looked through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture  i beheld his body half wasted away with long expectation and confinement and felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope deferred upon looking nearer i saw him pale and feverish in thirty years the western breeze had not once fanned his blood  he had seen no sun no moon in all that time  nor had the voice of friend or kinsman breathed through his lattice  his children    but here my heart began to bleed  and i was forced to go on with another part of the portrait  he was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw in the furthest corner of his dungeon which was alternately his chair and bed a little calender of small sticks were laid at the head notchd all over with the dismal days and nights he had passed there  he had one of these little sticks in his hand and with a rusty nail he was etching another day of misery to add to the heap as i darkened the little light he had he lifted up a hopeless eye toward the door then cast it down  shook his head and went on with his work of affliction i heard his chains upon his legs as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle  he gave a deep sigh  i saw the iron enter into his soul  i burst into tears  i could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn  i startled up from my chair and calling la fleur i bid him bespeak me a remise and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine in the morning   i will go directly said i myself to monsieur le duke de choiseul  la fleur would have put me to bed but not willing he should see any thing upon my cheek which would cost the honest fellow a heart ache  i told him i would go to bed by himself  and bid him go do the same  the starling road to versailles i got into my remise the hour i proposed la fleur got up behind and i bid the coachman make the best of his way to versailles  as there was nothing in this road or rather nothing which i look for in traveling i cannot fill up the blank better than with a short history of this selfsame bird which became the subject of the last chapter  whilst the honorable mr  was waiting for a wind at dover it had been caught upon the cliffs before it could well fly by an english lad who was his groom who not caring to destroy it had taken it in his breast into the packet  and by course of feeding it and taking it once under his protection in a day or two grew fond of it and got it safe along with him to paris  at paris the lad had laid out a a livre in a little cage for the starling and as he had little to do better the five months his master stayed there he taught it in his mothers tongue the four simple words  and no more  to which i owned myself so much it is debtor  upon his masters going on for italy  the lad had given it to the master of the hotel  but his little song for liberty being in an unknown language at paris  the bird had little or no store set by him  so la fleur bought both him and his cage for me for a bottle of burgundy  in my return from italy i brought him with me to the country in whose language he had learned his notes  and telling the story of him to lord a  lord a begged the bird of me  in a week lord a gave him to lord b  lord b made a present of him to lord c  and lords cs gentleman sold him to lord ds for a shilling  lord d gave him to lord e  and so on  half round the alphabet  from that rank he passed into the lower house and passed the hands of as many commoners  but as all these wanted to get in  and my bird wanted to get out  he had almost as little store set by him in london as in paris  it is impossible but many of my readers must have heard of him and if any by mere chance have ever seen him  i beg leave to inform them that that bird was my bird  or some vile copy set up to represent him  i have nothing further to add upon him but that from that time to this i have borne this poor starling as the crest to my arms  thus  blazon or coat of arms   and let the heralds officers twist his neck about if they dare  the address versailles i should not like to have my enemy take a view of my mind when i am going to ask protection of any man for which reason i generally endeavor to protect myself but this going to monsieur le duc de c was an act of compulsion  had it been an act of choice i should have done it i suppose like other people  how many mean plans of dirty address as i went along did my servile heart form i deserved the bastile for every one of them  then nothing would serve me when i got within sight of versailles but putting words and sentences together and conceiving attitudes and tones to wreath myself into monsieur le duc de cs good graces  this will do  said i  just as well retorted i again as a coat carried up to him by an adventurous tailor without taking his measure  fool continued i  see monsieur le ducs face first  observe what character is written in it take notice in what posture he stands to hear you  mark the turns and expressions of his body and limbs  and for the tone  the first sound which comes from his lips will give it you and from all these together you will compound an address at once upon the spot which cannot disgust the duke  the ingredients are his own and most likely to go down  well said i i wish it well over  coward again as if man to man was not equal throughout the whole surface of the globe and if in the field  why not face to face in the cabinet too and trust me yorick whenever it is not so man is false to himself and betrays his own succors ten times where nature does it once go to the duc de c with the bastile in thy looks  my life for it thou will be sent back to paris in half an hour with an escort  i believe so said i  then i will go to the duke by heaven with all the gaity and debonairness in the world    and there you are wrong again replied i  a heart at ease yorick flies into no extremes  it is ever on its center  well well cried i as the coachman turned in at the gates  i find i shall do very well and by the time he had wheeled round the court and brought me up to the door i found myself so much the better for my own lecture that i neither ascended the steps like a victim to justice who was to part with life upon the topmost  nor did i mount them with a skip and a couple of strides as i do when i fly up eliza to thee to meet it  as i entered the door of the saloon i was met by a person who possibly might be the maitre dhotel but had more the air of one of the under secretaries who told me the duc de c was busy  i am utterly ignorant said i of the forms of obtaining an audience being an absolute stranger and what is worse in the present conjuncture of affairs being an englishman too  he replied that did not increase the difficulty  i made him a slight bow and told him i had something of importance to say to monsieur le duc the secretary looked toward the stairs as if he was about to leave me to carry up this account to some one  but i must not mislead you said i  for what i have to say is of no manner of importance to monsieur le duc de c  but of great importance to myself  cest une autre affair replied he  not at all said i to a man of gallantry  but pray good sir continued i when can a stranger hope to have access in not less than two hours said he looking at his watch the number of equipages in the courtyard seemed to justify the calculation that i could have no nearer a prospect  and as walking backwards and forwards in the saloon without a soul to commune with was for the time as bad as being in the bastile itself i instantly went back to my remise and bid the coachman drive me to the cordon bleu which was the nearest hotel  i think there is a fatality in it  i seldom go to the place i set out for  le patisser versailles before i had got halfway down the street i changed my mind as i am at versailles thought i i might as well take a view of the town so i pulled the cord and ordered the coachman to drive round some of the principal streets  i suppose the town is not very large said i  the coachmen begged pardon for setting me right and told me it was very superb and that numbers of the first dukes and marquises and counts had hotels  the count de b of whom the bookseller at the quai de conti had spoke so handsomely the night before came instantly into my mind  and why should i not go thought i to the count de b who has so high an idea of english books and englishmen  and tell him my story so i changed my mind a second time  in truth it was the third for i had intended that day for madame de r in the rue st pierre and had devoutly sent her word by her fille de chamber that i would assuredly wait upon her  but i am governed by circumstances  i cannot govern them so seeing a man standing with a basket on the other side of the street as if he had something to sell i bid la fleur go up to him and enquire for the counts hotel  la fleur returned a little pale and told me it was a chevalier de st louis selling pates  it is impossible la fleur said i  la fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myself but persisted in his story he had seen the croix set in gold with its red ribband he said tied to his buttonhole  and had looked into the basket and seen the pates which the chevalier was selling so could not be mistaken in that  such a reverse in mans life awakens a better principle than curiosity i could not help looking for some time at him as i sat in the remise  the more i looked at him  his croix and his basket the stronger they wove themselves into my brain  i got out of the remise and went toward him  he was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees and with a sort of a bib went half way up his breast upon the top of this but a little below the hem hung his croix his basket of little pates was covered over with a white damask napkin another of the same kind was spread at the bottom and there was a look of proprete and neatness throughout that one might have bought his pates of him as much from appetite as sentiment  he made an offer of them to neither but stood still with them at the corner of a hotel for those to buy who chose it without solicitation  he was about fortyeight  of a sedate look something approaching to gravity i did not wonder  i went up rather to the basket than him and having lifted up the napkin and taken one of his pates into my hand  i begged he would explain the appearance which affected me  he told me in a few words that the best part of his life had passed in the service in which after spending a small patrimony he had obtained a company and the croix with it but that at the conclusion of the last peace his regiment being reformed and the whole corpse with those of some other regiments left without any provision  he found himself in a wide world without friends without a livre  and indeed said he without any thing but this  pointing as he said it to his croix  the poor chevalier won my pity and he finished the scene with winning my esteem too  the king he said was the most generous of princes but his generosity could neither relieve or reward every one and it was only his misfortune to be amongst the number he had a little wife he said whom he loved who did the patisserie and added he felt no dishonor in defending her and himself from want in this way  unless providence had offered him a better  it would be wicked to withold a pleasure from the good in passing over what happened to this poor chevalier of st louis about nine months after  it seems he usually took his stand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace and as his croix had caught the eye of numbers numbers had made the same enquiry which i had done  he had told them the same story and always with so much modesty and good sense that it had reached at last the kings ears  who hearing the chevalier had been a gallant officer and respected by the whole regiment as a man of honor and integrity  he broke up his little trade by a pension of fifteen hundred livres a year  as i have told this to please the reader i beg he will allow me to relate another out of its order to please myself  the two stories reflect light upon each other  and it is a pity they should be parted  the sword rennes when states and empires have their periods of declension and feel in their turns what distress and poverty is  i stop not to tell the causes which gradually brought the house do you in britany into decay the marquis do you had fought up against his condition with great firmness wishing to preserve and still show to the world some little fragments of what his ancestors had been  their indiscretions had put it out of his power there was enough left for the little exigencies of obscurity  but he had two boys who looked up to him for light  he thought they deserved it he had tried his sword  it could not open the way  the mounting was too expensive  and simple economy was not a match for it  there was no resource but commerce  in any other province in france save britany this was smiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wished to see reblossom  but in britany there being a provision for this he availed himself of it and taking an occasion when the states were assembled at rennes the marquis attended with his two boys entered the court and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy which though seldom claimed he said was no less in force he took his sword from his side  here  said he  take it and be trusty guardians of it till better times put me in condition to reclaim it  the president accepted the marquiss sword  he stayed a few minutes to see it deposited in the archives of his house  and departed  the marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for martinico and in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to business with some unlooked for bequests from distant branches of his house  returned home to reclaim his nobility and to support it  it was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller but a sentimental one that i should be at rennes at the very time of this solemn requisition i call it solemn  it was so to me  the marquis entered the court with his whole family he supported his lady  his eldest son supported his sister and his youngest was at the other extreme of the line next his mother  he put his handkerchief to his face twice    there was a dead silence when the marquis had approached within six paces of the tribunal he gave the marchioness to his youngest son and advancing three steps before his family  he reclaimed his sword his sword was given him and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it almost out of the scabbard  twas the shining face of a friend he had once given up  he looked attentively along it beginning at the hilt as if to see whether it was the same  when observing a little rust which it had contracted near the point he brought it near his eye and bending his head down over it  i think i saw a tear fall upon the place i could not be deceived by what followed  i shall find said he some other way to get it off  when the marquis had said this he returned his sword into its scabbard made a bow to the guardians of it  and with his wife and daughter and his two sons following him walked out  o how i envied him his feelings  the passport versailles i found no difficulty in getting admittance to monsieur le count de b the set of shakespears was laid upon the table and he was tumbling them over i walked up close to the table and giving first such a look at the books as to make him conceive i knew what they were  i told him i had come without any one to present me knowing i should meet with a friend in his apartment who i trusted would do it for me  it is my countryman the great shakespeare said i pointing to his works  et ayez la bonte mon cher ami apostrophizing his spirit added i de me fair cet honneur la   the count smiled at the singularity of the introduction and seeing i looked a little pale and sickly insisted upon my taking an armchair so i sat down and to save him conjectures upon a visit so out of all rule i told him simply of the incident in the booksellers shop and how that had impelled me rather to go to him with the story of a little embarrassment i was under than to any other man in france  and what is your embarrassment let me hear it said the count so i told him the story just as i have told it the reader    and the master of my hotel said i as i concluded it will needs have it monsieur le count that i shall be sent to the bastile  but i have no apprehensions continued i  for in falling into the hands of the most polished people in the world and being conscious i was a true man and not come to spy the nakedness of the land i scarce thought i laid at their mercy  it does not suit the gallantry of the french monsieur le count said i to show it against invalids  an animated blush came into the count de bs cheeks as i spoke this  ne craignez rien  dont fear said he  indeed i dont replied i again  besides continued i a little sportingly  i have come laughing all the way from london to paris and i do not think monsieur le duc de choiseul is such an enemy to mirth as to send me back crying for my pains   my application to you monsieur le compte de b making him a low bow is to desire he will not  the count heard me with great good nature or i had not said half as much  and once or twice said  cest bien dit so i rested my cause there  and determined to say no more about it  the count led the discourse we talked of indifferent things  of books and politics and men  and then of women  god bless them all said i after much discourse about them  there is not a man upon earth who loves them so much as i do after all the foibles i have seen and all the satires i have read against them still i love them being firmly persuaded that a man who has not a sort of an affection for the whole sex is incapable of ever loving a single one as he ought  heh bien monsieur langlois said the count gaily  you are not come to spy the nakedness of the land  i believe you  ni encore i dare say that of our women  but permit me to conjecture  if par hazard they fell in your way  that the prospect would not affect you  i have something within me which cannot bear the shock of the least indecent insinuation in the sportability of chitchat i have often endeavored to conquer it and with infinite pain have hazarded a thousand things to a dozen of the sex together  the least of which i could not venture to a single one to gain heaven  excuse me monsieur le count said i  as for the nakedness of your land if i saw it i should cast my eyes over it with tears in them  and for that of your women blushing at the idea he had excited in me i am so evangelical in this and have such a fellowfeeling for what ever is weak about them that i would cover it with a garment if i knew how to throw it on  but i could wish continued i to spy the nakedness of their hearts and through the different disguises of customs climates and religion find out what is good in them to fashion my own by  and therefore am i come  it is for this reason monsieur le compte continued i that i have not seen the palais royal  nor the luxembourg  nor the facade of the louvre  nor have attempted to swell the catalogues we have of pictures statues and churches  i conceive every fair being as a temple and would rather enter in and see the original drawings and loose sketches hung up in it than the transfiguration of raphael itself  the thirst of this continued i as impatient as that which inflames the breast of the connoisseur has led me from my own home into france  and from france will lead me through italy  it is a quiet journey of the heart in pursuit of nature and those affections which rise out of her which make us love each other  and the world better than we do  the count said a great many civil things to me upon the occasion and added very politely how much he stood obliged to shakespeare for making me known to him  but apropos said he  shakespeare is full of great things  he forgot a small punctillio of announcing your name  it puts you under a necessity of doing it yourself  the passport versailles there is not a more perplexing affair in life to me than to set about telling any one who i am  for there is scarce any body i cannot give a better account of than of myself and i have often wished i could do it in a single word  and have an end of it it was the only time and occasion in my life i could accomplish this to any purpose  for shakespeare lying upon the table and recollecting i was in his books i took up hamlet and turning immediately to the gravediggers scene in the fifth act i laid my finger upon yorick and advancing the book to the count with my finger all the way over the name  me voici said i  now whether the idea of poor yoricks skull was put out of the counts mind by the reality of my own or by what magic he could drop a period of seven or eight hundred years makes nothing in this account  it is certain the french conceive better than they combine  i wonder at nothing in this world and the less at this inasmuch as one of the first of our own church for whose candor and paternal sentiments i have the highest veneration fell into the same mistake in the very same case  he could not bear he said to look into sermons wrote by the king of denmarks jester  good my lord said i  but there are two yoricks the yorick your lordship thinks of has been dead and buried eight hundred years ago he flourished in horwendilluss court  the other yorick is myself who have flourished my lord in no court  he shook his head  good god said i you might as well confound alexander the great with alexander the coppersmith my lord  twas all one he replied    if alexander king of macedon could have translated your lordship said i  i am sure your lordship would not have said so  the poor count de b fell but into the same error    et monsieur est il yorick cried the count  je le suis said i  vous  moi  moi qui ai lhonneur de vous parler monsieur le compte  mon dieu said he embracing me  vous etes yorick  the count instantly put the shakespeare into his pocket  and left me alone in his room  the passport versailles i could not conceive why the count de b had gone so abruptly out of the room any more than i could conceive why he had put the shakespeare into his pocket  mysteries which must explain themselves are not worth the loss of time which a conjecture about them takes up twas better to read shakespeare so taking up  much ado about nothing i transported myself instantly from the chair i sat in to messina in sicily and got so busy with don pedro and benedick and beatrice that i thought not of versailles the count or the passport  sweet pliability of mans spirit that can at once surrender itself to illusions which cheat expectation and sorrow of their weary moments   long  long since had ye numbered out my days had i not trod so great a part of them upon this enchanted ground when my way is too rough for my feet or too steep for my strength i get off it to some smooth velvet path which fancy has scattered over with rosebuds of delights and having taken a few turns in it come back strengthened and refreshed  when evils press sore upon me and there is no retreat from them in this world then i take a new course  i leave it  and as i have a clearer idea of the elysian fields than i have of heaven i force myself like eneas into them  i see him meet the pensive shade of his forsaken dido  and wish to recognize it  i see the injured spirit wave her head and turn off silent from the author of her miseries and dishonours  i lose the feelings for myself in hers  and in those affections which were wont to make me mourn for her when i was at school  surely this is not walking in a vain shadow  nor does man disquiet himself in vain by it  he oftener does so in trusting the issue of his commotions to reason only  i can safely say for myself i was never able to conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively as by beating up as fast as i could for some kindly and gentle sensation to fight it upon its own ground  when i had got to the end of the third act the count de b entered with my passport in his hand mons le duc de c said the count is as good a prophet i dare say as he is a statesman  un homme qui rit said the duke ne sera jamais dangereuz  had it been for any one but the kings jester added the count i could not have got it these two hours  pardonncz moi mons le compte said i  i am not the kings jester  but you are yorick  yes  et vous plaisantez  i answered indeed i did jest  but was not paid for it  twas entirely at my own expense  we have no jester at court mons le compte said i the last we had was in the licentious reign of charles the iid  since which time our manners have been so gradually refining that our court at present is so full of patriots who wish for nothing but the honors and wealth of their country  and our ladies are all so chaste so spotless so good so devout  there is nothing for a jester to make a jest of   voila un persiflage cried the count  the passport versailles as the passport was directed to all lieutenant governors governors and commandants of cities generals of armies justiciaries and all officers of justice to let mr yorick the kings jester and his baggage travel quietly along  i own the triumph of obtaining the passport was not a little tarnishd by the figure i cut in it  but there is nothing unmixt in this world and some of the gravest of our divines have carried it so far as to affirm that enjoyment itself was attended even with a sigh  and that the greatest they knew of terminated in a general way in little better than a convulsion  i remember the grave and learned bevoriskius in his commentary upon the generations from adam very naturally breaks off in the middle of a note to give an account to the world of a couple of sparrows upon the outedge of his window which had incommoded him all the time he wrote and at last had entirely taken him off from his genealogy   it is strange writes bevoriskius but the facts are certain for i have had the curiosity to mark them down one by one with my pen  but the cocksparrow during the little time that i could have finished the other half this note has actually interrupted me with the reiteration of his caresses three and twenty times and a half  how merciful adds bevoriskius is heaven to his creatures  ill fated yorick that the gravest of thy brethren should be able to write that to the world which stains thy face with crimson to copy in even thy study  but this is nothing to my travels  so i twice  twice beg pardon for it  character versailles and how do you find the french said the count de b after he had given me the passport  the reader may suppose that after so obliging a proof of courtesy i could not be at a loss to say something handsome to the enquiry   mais pass pour cela  speak frankly said he do you find all the urbanity in the french which the world give us the honor of  i had found every thing i said which confirmed it  vraiment said the count  les francois sont poli s  to an excess replied i  the count took notice of the word excess and would have it i meant more than i said i defended myself a long time as well as i could against it  he insisted i had a reserve and that i would speak my opinion frankly  i believe mons le compte said i that man has a certain compass as well as an instrument and that the social and other calls have occasion by turns for every key in him sothat if you begin a note too high or too low there must be a want either in the upper or under part to fill up the system of harmony  the count de b did not understand music so desired me to explain it some other way a polished nation my dear count said i makes every one its debtor and besides urbanity itself like the fair sex has so many charms it goes against the the heart to say it can do ill and yet i believe there is but a certain line of perfection that man take him altogether is empowered to arrive at  if he gets beyond he rather exchanges qualities than gets them i must not presume to say how far this has affected the french in the subject we are speaking of  but should it ever be the case of the english in the progress of their resentments to arrive at the same polish which distinguishes the french if we did not lose the politesse de coeur which inclines men more to human actions than courteous ones  we should at least lose that distinct variety and originality of character which distinguishes them not only from each other but from all the world besides  i had a few king williams shillings as smooth as glass in my pocket and foreseeing they would be of use in the illustration of my hypothesis i had got them into my hand when i had proceeded so far   see mons le compte said i rising up and laying them before him upon the table  by jingling and ribbing one against another for seventy years together in one bodys pocket or anothers they are become so much alike you can scarce distinguish one shilling from another  the english like ancient medais kept more apart and passing but few peoples hands preserve the first sharpnesses which the fine hand of nature has given them  they are not so pleasant to feel  but in return the legend is so visible that at the first look you see whose image and superscription they bear  but the french mons le compte added i wishing to soften what i had said have so many excellencies they can the better spare this  they are a loyal a gallant a generous an ingenious and good tempered people as is under heaven  if they have a fault  they are too serious  mon dieu cried the count rising out of his chair  mais vous plaisantez said he correcting his exclamation  i laid my hand upon my breast and with earnest gravity assured him it was my most settled opinion  the count said he was mortified he could not stay to hear my reasons being engaged to go that moment to dine with the duc de c  but if it is not too far to come to versailles to eat your soup with me i beg before you leave france i may have the pleasure of knowing you retract your opinion  or in what manner you support it  but if you do support it mons anglois said he you must do it with all your powers because you have the whole world against you  i promised the count i would do myself the honor of dining with him before i set out for italy  so took my leave  the temptation paris whey i alighted at the hotel the porter told me a young woman with a bandbox had been that moment enquiring for me  i do not know said the porter whether she is gone away or no i took the key of my chamber of him and went up stairs and when i had got within ten steps of the top of the landing before my door i met her coming easily down  it was the fair fille de chamber i had walked along the quai de conti with madame de r had sent her upon some commissions to a merchande de modes within a step or two of the hotel de modene and as i had failed in waiting upon her had bid her enquire if i had left paris and if so whether i had not left a letter addressed to her  as the fair fille de chamber was so near my door she turned back and went into the room with me for a moment or two whilst i wrote a card  it was a fine still evening in the latter end of the month of may  the crimson window curtains which were of the same color of those of the bed were drawn close  the sun was setting and reflected through them so warm a tint into the fair fille de chambres face  i thought she blushed  the idea of it made me blush myself  we were quite alone and that superinduced a second blush before the first could get off  there is a sort of a pleasing half guilty blush where the blood is more in fault than the man  it is sent impetuous from the heart and virtue flies after it  not to call it back but to make the sensation of it more delicious to the nerves  it is associated   but i will not describe it  i felt something at first within me which was not in strict unison with the lesson of virtue i had given her the night before  i sought five minutes for a card  i knew i had not one  i took up a pen  i laid it down again  my hand trembled  the devil was in me  i know as well as any one he is an adversary whom if we resist he will fly from us  but i seldom resist him at all from a terror that though i may conquer i may still get a hurt in the combat  so i give up the triumph for security and instead of thinking to make him fly i generally fly myself  the fair fille de chamber came close up to the bureau where i was looking for a card  took up first the pen i cast down then offered to hold me the ink she offered it so sweetly i was going to accept it  but i durst not  i have nothing my dear said i to write upon  write it said she simply upon any thing   i was just going to cry out then i will write it fair girl upon thy lips   if i do said i i shall perish  so i took her by the hand and led her to the door and begged she would not forget the lesson i had given her  she said indeed she would not  and as she uttered it with some earnestness she turned about and gave me both her hands closed together into mine  it was impossible not to compress them in that situation  i wished to let them go and all the time i held them i kept arguing within myself against it  and still i held them on  in two minutes i found i had all the battle to fight over again  and i felt my legs and every limb about me tremble at the idea  the foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we were standingg  i had still hold of her hands  and how it happened i can give no account but i neither asked her  nor drew her  nor did i think of the bed  but so it did happen we both sat down  i will just show you said the fair fille de chamber the little purse i have been making today to hold your crown so she put her hand into her right pocket which was next me and felt for it for sometime  then into into the left  she had lost it  i never bore expectation more quietly  it was in her right pocket at last  she pulled it out it was of green taffeta lined with a little bit of white quilted satin and just big enough to hold the crown  she put it into my hand  it was pretty and i held it ten minutes with the back of my hand resting upon her lap  looking sometimes at the purse sometimes on one side of it  a stitch or two had broke out in the gathers of my stock  the fair fille de chamber without saying a word took out her little hussive threaded a small needle and sewed it up  i foresaw it would hazard the glory of the day and as she passed her hand in silence across and across my neck in the maneuver i felt the laurels shake which fancy had wreathed about my head  a strap had given way in her walk and the buckle of her shoe was just falling off  see said the fille de chamber holding up her foot  i could not for my soul but fasten the buckle in return and putting in the strap  and lifting up the other foot with it when i had done to see both were right  in doing it too suddenly  it unavoidably threw the fair fille de chamber off her center  and then   the conquest yes  and then  ye whose claycold heads and lukewarm hearts can argue down or mask your passions  tell me what trespass is it that man should have them or how his spirit stands answerable to the father of spirits but for his conduct under them  if nature has so wove her web of kindness that some threads of love and desire are entangled with the piece  must the whole web be rent in drawing them out  whip me such stoics great governor of nature said i to myself  wherever thy providence shall place me for the trials of my virtue  whatever is my danger  whatever is my situation  let me feel the movements which rise out of it and which belong to me as a man  and if i govern them as a good one  i will trust the issues to thy justice for thou have made us  and not we ourselves  as i finished my address i raised the fair fille de chamber up by the hand and led her out of the room  she stood by me till i locked the door and put the key in my pocket  and then  the victory being quite decisive  and not till then i pressed my lips to her cheek and taking her by the hand again led her safe to the gate of the hotel  the mystery paris if a man knows the heart he will know it was impossible to go back instantly to my chamber  it was touching a cold key with a flat third to it upon the close of a piece of music which had called forth my affections  therefore when i let go the hand of the fille de chamber i remained at the gate of the hotel for some time looking at every one who passed by and forming conjectures upon them till my attention got fixed upon a single object which confounded all kind of reasoning upon him  it was a tall figure of a philosophic serious adust look which passed and repassed sedately along the street making a turn of about sixty paces on each side of the gate of the hotel  the man was about fiftytwo  had a small cane under his arm  was dressed in a dark drabcolourd coat waistcoat and breeches which seemed to have seen some years service  they were still clean and there was a little air of frugal proprete throughout him by his pulling off his hat and his attitude of accosting a good many in his way i saw he was asking charity so i got a sous or two out of my pocket ready to give him as he took me in his turn  he passed by me without asking any thing  and yet did not go five steps further before he asked charity of a little woman  i was much more likely to have given of the two  he had scarce done with the woman when he pulled off his hat to another who was coming the same way  an ancient gentleman came slowly  and after him a young smart one  he let them both pass and asked nothing i stood observing him half an hour in which time he had made a dozen turns backwards and forwards and found that he invariably pursued the same plan  there were two things very singular in this which set my brain to work and to no purpose  the first was why the man should only tell his story to the sex  and secondly  what kind of story it was and what species of eloquence it could be which softened the hearts of the women which he knew twas to no purpose to practice upon the men  there were two other circumstances which entangled this mystery  the one was he told every woman what he had to say in her ear and in a way which had much more the air of a secret than a petition  the other was it was always successful  he never stopped a woman but she pulled out her purse and immediately gave him something  i could form no system to explain the phenomenon  i had got a riddle to amuse me for the rest of the evening so i walked up stairs to my chamber  the case of conscience paris i was immediately followed up by the master of the hotel who came into my room to tell me i must provide lodgings else where  how so friend said i  he answered i had had a young woman locked up with me two hours that evening in my bedchamber and twas against the rules of his house  very well said i well all part friends then  for the girl is no worse  and i am no worse  and you will be just as i found you  it was enough he said to overthrow the credit of his hotel  voyez vous monsieur said he pointing to the foot of the bed we had been sitting upon  i own it had something of the appearance of an evidence but my pride not suffering me to enter into any detail of the case i exhorted him to let his soul sleep in peace as i resolved to let mine do that night and that i would discharge what i owed him at breakfast  i should not have minded monsieur said he if you had had twenty girls  it is a score more replied i interrupting him than i ever reckoned upon  provided added he it hadbeen but in a morning  and does the difference of the time of the day at paris make a difference in the sin  it made a difference he said in the scandal  i like a good distinction in my heart and cannot say i was intolerably out of temper with the man  i own it is necessary reassumed the master of the hotel that a stranger at paris should have the opportunities presented to him of buying lace and silk stockings and ruffles et tout cela  and it is nothing if a woman comes with a band box  of my conscience said i she had one but i never looked into it  then monsieur said he has bought nothing  not one earthly thing replied i  because said he i could recommend one to you who would use you en conscience  but i must see her this night said i  he made me a low bow and walked down  now shall i triumph over this maitre dhotel cried i  and what then  then i shall let him see i know he is a dirty fellow  and what then  what then  i was too near myself to say it was for the sake of others  i had no good answer left  there was more of spleen than principle in my project and i was sick of it before the execution  in a few minutes the grisset came in with her box of lace  i will buy nothing however said i within myself  the grisset would show me every thing  i was hard to please she would not seem to see it she opened her little magazine laid all her laces one after another before me  unfolded and folded them up again one by one with the most patient sweetness  i might buy  or not  she would let me have every thing at my own price  the poor creature seemed anxious to get a penny and laid herself out to win me and not so much in a manner which seemed artful as in one i felt simple and caressing  if there is not a fund of honest cullibility in man so much the worse  my heart relented and i gave up my second resolution as quietly as the first  why should i chastise one for the trespass of another if thou art tributary to this tyrant of an host thought i looking up in her face so much harder is thy bread  if i had not had more than four louis dors in my purse there was no such thing as rising up and showing her the door till i had first laid three of them out in a pair of ruffles   the master of the hotel will share the profit with her  no matter  then i have only paid as many a poor soul has paid before me for an act he could not do or think of  the riddle paris when la fleur came up to wait upon me at supper he told me how sorry the master of the hotel was for his affront to me in bidding me change my lodgings  a man who values a good nights rest will not lay down with enmity in his heart if he can help it  so i bid la fleur tell the master of the hotel that i was sorry on my side for the occasion i had given him  and you may tell him if you will la fleur added i that if the young woman should call again i shall not see her  this was a sacrifice not to him but myself having resolved after so narrow an escape to run no more risks but to leave paris if it was possible with all the virtue i entered in  cest deroger a noblesse monsieur said la fleur making me a bow down to the ground as he said it  et encore monsieur said he may change his sentiments  and if par hazard he should like to amuse himself  i find no amusement in it said i interrupting him   mon dieu said la fleur  and took away  in an hours time he came to put me to bed and was more than commonly officious  something hung upon his lips to say to me or ask me which he could not get off i could not conceive what it was and indeed gave myself little trouble to find it out as i had another riddle so much more interesting upon my mind which was that of the mans asking charity before the door of the hotel  i would have given any thing to have got to the bottom of it and that not out of curiosity  it is so low a principle of enquiry in general i would not purchase the gratification of it with a twosous piece  but a secret i thought which so soon and so certainly softened the heart of every woman you came near was a secret at least equal to the philosophers stone had i had both the indies i would have given up one to have been master of it  i tossed and turned it almost all night long in my brains to no manner of purpose and when i awoke in the morning i found my spirit as much troubled with my dreams as ever the king of babylon had been with his and i will not hesitate to affirm it would have puzzled all the wise men of paris as much as those of chaldea to have given its interpretation  le dimanche paris it was sunday and when la fleur came in in the morning with my coffee and role and butter he had got himself so gallantly arrayed i scarce knew him  i had convenanted at montreal to give him a new hat with a silver button and loop and four louis dors pour sadoniser when we got to paris and the poor fellow to do him justice had done wonders with it  he had bought a bright clean good scarlet coat and a pair of breeches of the same  they were not a crown worse he said for the wearing  i wished him hanged for telling me  they looked so fresh that though i knew the thing could not be done yet i would rather have imposed upon my fancy with thinking i had bought them new for the fellow than that they had come out of the rue de friperie  this is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at paris  he had purchased moreover a handsome blue satin waistcoat fancifully enough embroidered  this was indeed something the worse for the services it had done but twas clean scoured  the gold had been touched up and upon the whole was rather showy than otherwise  and as the blue was not violent it suited with the coat and breeches very well he had squeezed out of the money moreover a new bag and a solitaire and had insisted with the fripier upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches knees  he had purchased muslin ruffles bien brodees with four livres of his own money  and a pair of white silk stockings for five more  and to top all nature had given him a handsome figure without costing him a sous  he entered the room thus set off with his hair dressed in the first style and with a handsome bouquet in his breast  in a word there was that look of festivity in every thing about him which at once put me in mind it was sunday  and by combining both together it instantly struck me that the favor he wished to ask of me the night before was to spend the day as every body in paris spent it besides i had scarce made the conjecture when la fleur with infinite humility but with a look of trust as if i should not refuse him begged i would grant him the day pour fair le galant vis a vis de sa maitresse now it was the very thing i intended to do myself vis a vis madame de r  i had retained the remise on purpose for it and it would not have mortified my vanity to have had a servant so well dressed as la fleur was to have got up behind it i never could have worse spared him  but we must feel not argue in these embarrassments  the sons and daughters of service part with liberty but not with nature in their contracts they are flesh and blood and have their little vanities and wishes in the midst of the house of bondage as well as their taskmasters  no doubt they have set their selfdenials at a price  and their expectations are so unreasonable that i would often disappoint them but that their condition puts it so much in my power to do it  behold  behold i am thy servant  disarms me at once of the powers of a master    thou shall go la fleur said i   and what mistress la fleur said i can thou have picked up in so little a time at paris la fleur laid his hand upon his breast and said twas a petite demoiselle at monsieur le compte de bs  la fleur had a heart made for society and to speak the truth of him let as few occasions slip him as his master  so that some how or other but how  heaven knows  he had connected himself with the demoiselle upon the landing of the staircase during the time i was taken up with my passport and as there was time enough for me to win the count to my inteterest la fleur had contrived to make it do to win the maid to his  the family it seems was to be at paris that day and he had made a party with her and two or three more of the counts household upon the boulevards  happy people that once a week at least are sure to lay down all your cares together and dance and sing and sport away the weights of grievance which bow down the spirit of other nations to the earth  the fragment paris la fleur had left me something to amuse myself with for the day more than i had bargained for or could have entered either into his head or mine  he had brought the little print of butter upon a current leaf and as the morning was warm and he had a good step to bring it he had begged a sheet of waste paper to put betwixt the current leaf and his hand  as that was plate sufficient i bad him lay it upon the table as it was and as i resolved to stay within all day i ordered him to call upon the traileur to bespeak my dinner and leave me to breakfast by myself  when i had finished the butter i threw the current leaf out of the window and was going to do the same by the waste paper  but stopping to read a line first and that drawing me on to a second and third  i thought it better worth so i shut the window and drawing a chair up to it i sat down to read it  it was in the old french of rabelaiss time and for ought i know might have been wrote by him  it was moreover in a gothic letter and that so faded and gone off by damps and length of time it cost me infinite trouble to make any thing of it  i threw it down and then wrote a letter to eugenius  then i took it up again and embroiled my patience with it afresh  and then to cure that i wrote a letter to eliza  still it kept hold of me and the difficulty of understanding it increased but the desire  i got my dinner and after i had enlightened my mind with a bottle of burgundy i at it again  and after two or three hours poring upon it with almost as deep attention as ever gruter or jacob spon did upon a nonsensical inscription i thought i made sense of it but to make sure of it the best way i imagined was to turn it into english and see how it would look then  so i went on leisurely as a trifling man does sometimes writing a sentence  then taking a turn or two  and then looking how the world went out of the window so that it was nine oclock at night before i had done it  i then begun and read it as follows  the fragment paris  now as the notarys wife disputed the point with the notary with too much heat  i wish said the notary throwing down the parchment that there was another notary here only to set down and attest all this    and what would you do then monsieur said she rising hastily up  the notarys wife was a little fume of a woman and the notary thought it well to avoid a hurricane by a mild reply  i would go answered he to bed  you may go to the devil answered the notarys wife  now there happening to be but one bed in the house the other two rooms being unfurnished as is the custom at paris and the notary not caring to lie in the same bed with a woman who had but that moment sent him pellmell to the devil went forth with his hat and cane and short cloak the night being very windy and walked out ill at ease toward the pont neuf  of all the bridges which ever were built the whole world who have passed over the pont neuf must own that it is the noblest  the finest  the grandest  the lightest  the longest  the broadest that ever conjoined land and land together upon the face of the terraqueous globe   by this it seems as if the author of the fragment had not been a frenchman  the worst fault which divines and the doctors of the sorbonne can allege against it is that if there is but a capfull of wind in or about paris it is more blasphemously sacre dieud there than in any other aperture of the whole city  and with reason good and cogent messieurs for it comes against you without crying guard deau and with such unpremeditable puffs that of the few who cross it with their hats on not one in fifty but hazards two livres and a half which is its full worth  the poor notary just as he was passing by the sentry instinctively clapped his cane to the side of it but in raising it up the point of his cane catching hold of the loop of the sentinels hat hoisted it over the spikes of the ballustrade clear into the seine    it is an ill wind said a boatsman who caught it which blows no body any good  the sentry being a gascon incontinently twirld up his whiskers and levelled his harquebuss  harquebusses in those days went off with matches and an old womans paper lanthorn at the end of the bridge happening to be blown out she had borrowed the sentrys match to light it  it gave a moments time for the gascons blood to run cool and turn the accident better to his advantage  it is an ill wind said he catching off the notarys castor and legitimating the capture with the boatmans adage  the poor notary crossed the bridge and passing along the rue de dauphine into the fauxbourgs of st germain lamented himself as he walked along in this manner  luckless man that i am said the notary to be the sport of hurricanes all my days  to be born to have the storm of ill language levelled against me and my profession wherever i go  to be forced into marriage by the thunder of the church to a tempest of a woman  to be driven forth out of my house by domestic winds and despoiled of my castor by pontific ones  to be here bareheaded in a windy night at the mercy of the ebbs and flows of accidents  where i am to lay my head  miserable man what wind in the twoandthirty points of the whole compass can blow unto thee as it does to the rest of thy fellow creatures good  as the notary was passing on by a dark passage complaining in this sort a voice called out to a girl to bid her run for the next notary  now the notary being the next and availing himself of his situation walked up the passage to the door and passing through an old sort of a saloon was ushered into a large chamber dismantled of every thing but a long military pike  a breast plate  a rusty old sword and bandoleer hung up equidistant in four different places against the wall  an old personage who had heretosore been a gentleman and unless decay of fortune taints the blood along with it was a gentleman at that time lay supporting his head upon his hand in his bed a little table with a taper burning was set close beside it and close by the table was placed a chair  the notary sat him down in it and pulling out his inkhorn and a sheet or two of paper which he had in his pocket he placed them before him and dipping his pen in his ink and leaning his breast over the table he disposed every thing to make the gentlemans last will and testament  alas monsieur le notaire said the gentleman raising himself up a little i have nothing to bequeath which will pay the expense of bequeathing except the history of myself which i could not die in peace unless i left it as a legacy to the world the profits arising out of it i bequeath to you for the pains of taking it from me  it is a story so uncommon it must me read by all mankind  it will make the fortunes of your house  the notary dipped his pen into his inkhorn  almighty director of every event in my life said the old gentleman looking up earnestly and raising his hands toward heaven  thou whose hand has led me on through such a labyrinth of strange passages down into this scene of desolation assist the decaying memory of an old infirm and brokenhearted man  direct my tongue by the spirit of thy eternal truth that this stranger may set down naught but what is written in that book from whose records said he clasping his hands together i am to be condemned or acquitted  the notary held up the point of his pen betwixt the taper and his eye    it is a story monsieur le notaire said the gentleman which will rouse up every affection in nature  it will kill the humane and touch the heart of cruelty herself with pity    the notary was inflamed with a desire to begin and put his pen a third time into his inkhorn  and the old gentleman turning a little more toward the notary began to dictate his story in these words    and where is the rest of it la fleur said i as he just then entered the room  the fragment and the nosegay bouquet paris when la fleur came up close to the table and was made to comprehend what i wanted he told me there were only two other sheets of it which he had wrapped round the stalks of a bouquet to keep it together which he had presented to the demoiselle upon the boulevards  then prithee la fleur said i step back to her to the count de bs hotel and see if you can get  there is no doubt of it said la fleur  and away he flew  in a very little time the poor fellow came back quite out of breath with deeper marks of disappointment in his looks than could arise from the simple irreparability of the fragment  just ciel in less than two minutes that the poor fellow had taken his last tender farewell of her  his faithless mistress had given his gage damour to one of the counts footmen  the footman to a young sempstress  and the sempstress to a fiddler with my fragment at the end of it  our misfortunes were involved together  i gave a sigh  and la fleur echoed it back again to my ear    how perfidious cried la fleur  how unlucky said i    i should not have been mortified monsieur quoth la fleur if she had lost it  nor i la fleur said i had i found it  whether i did or no will be seen hereafter  the act of charity paris the man who either disdains or fears to walk up a dark entry may be an excellent good man and fit for a hundred things but he will not do to make a good sentimental traveller i count little of the many things i see pass at broad noon day in large and open streets  nature is shy and hates to act before spectators but in such an unobserved corner you sometimes see a single short scene of here is worth all the sentiments of a dozen french plays compounded together  and yet they are absolutely fine  and whenever i have a more brilliant affair upon my hands than common as they suit a preacher just as well as a hero i generally make my sermon out of em  and for the text  capadosia pontus and asia phrygia and pamphilia  is as good as any one in the bible  there is a long dark passage issuing out from the opera comique into a narrow street it is trod by a few who humbly wait for a fiacre hackneycoach  or wish to get off quietly ofoot when the opera is done at the end of it toward the theater it is lighted by a small candle the light of which is almost lost before you get halfway down but near the door  it is more for ornament than use you see it as a fixed star of the least magnitude it burns  but does little good to the world that we know of  in returning along this passage i discerned as i approached within five or six paces of the door two ladies standing arm in arm with their backs against the wall waiting as i imagined for a fiacre  as they were next the door i thought they had a prior right so edged myself up within a yard or little more of them and quietly took my stand  i was in black and scarce seen  the lady next me was a tall lean figure of a woman of about thirtysix the other of the same size and make of about forty there was no mark of wife or widow in any one part of either of them  they seemed to be two upright vestal sisters unsappd by caresses unbroke in upon by tender salutations i could have wished to have made them happy  their happiness was destined that night to come from another quarter  a low voice with a good turn of expression and sweet cadence at the end of it begged for a twelvesous piece betwixt them for the love of heaven i thought it singular that a beggar should fix the quota of an alms  and that the sum should be twelve times as much as what is usually given in the dark they both seemed astonished at it as much as myself  twelve sous said one  a twelvesous piece said the other  and made no reply  the poor man said he knew not how to ask less of ladies of their rank and bowed down his head to the ground  poo said they  we have no money  the beggar remained silent for a moment or two and renewed his supplication  do not my fair young ladies said he stop your good ears against me  upon my word honest man said the younger we have no change  then god bless you said the poor man and multiply those joys which you can give to others without change  i observed the elder sister put her hand into her pocket  i will see said she if i have a sous  a sous give twelve said the supplicant nature has been bountiful to you be bountiful to a poor man  i would friend with all my heart said the younger if i had it  my fair charitable said he addressing himself to the elder  what is it but your goodness and humanity which makes your bright eyes so sweet that they outshine the the morning even in this dark passage and what was it which made the marquis de santerre and his brother say so much of you both as they just passed by  the two ladies seemed much affected and impulsively at the same time they both put their hands into their pocket and each took out a twelvesous piece  the contest betwixt them and the poor supplicant was no more  it was continued betwixt themselves which of the two should give the twelvesous piece in charity  and to end the dispute they both gave it together and the man went away  the riddle explained paris i stepped hastily after him it was the very man whose success in asking charity of the women before the door of the hotel had so puzzled me  and i found at once his secret or at least the basis of it  twas flattery  delicious essence how refreshing art thou to nature how strongly are all its powers and all its weaknesses on thy side how sweetly do thou mix with the blood and help it through the most difficult and tortuous passages to the heart  the poor man as he was not straightend for time had given it here in a larger dose it is certain he had a way of bringing it into less form for the many sudden cases he had to do with in the streets but how he contrived to correct sweeten concentre and qualify it  i vex not my spirit with the inquiry  it is enough the beggar gained two twelvesous pieces  and they can best tell the rest who have gained much greater matters by it  paris we get forwards in the world not so much by doing services as receiving them you take a withering twig and put it in the ground and then you water it because you have planted it  mons le compte de b merely because he had done me one kindness in the affair of my passport would go on and do me another the few days he was at paris in making me known to a few people of rank and they were to present me to others and so on  i had got master of my secret just in time to turn these honors to some little account otherwise as is commonly the case i should have dined or supped a single time or two round and then by translating french looks and attitudes into plain english i should presently have seen that i had got hold of the couvert plate napkin knife fork and spoon of some more entertaining guest and in course should have resigned all my places one after another merely upon the principle that i could not keep them  as it was things did not go much amiss  i had the honor of being introduced to the old marquis de b in days of yore he had signalized himself by some small feats of chivalry in the cour damour and had dressed himself out to the idea of tilts and tournaments ever since  the marquis de b wished to have it thought the affair was somewhere else than in his brain he could like to take a trip to england and asked much of the english ladies stay where you are i beseech you mons le marquise said i  les messrs angloise can scarce get a kind look from them as it is  the marquis invited me to supper  mons p the farmergeneral was just as inquisitive about our taxes  they were very considerable he heard  if we knew but how to collect them said i making him a low bow  i could never have been invited to mons ps concerts upon any other terms  i had been misrepresented to madame de q as an esprit  madam de q was an esprit herself she burnt with impatience to see me and hear me talk i had not taken my seat before i saw she did not care a sous whether i had any wit or no  i was let in to be convinced she had  i call heaven to witness i never once opened the door of my lips  madame de q vowed to every creature she met she had never had a more improving conversation with a man in her life  there are three epochas in the empire of a frenchwoman  she is coquette  then deist  then devote the empire during these is never lost  she only changes her subjects when thirtyfive years and more have unpeopled her dominions of the slaves of love she repeoples it with slaves of infidelity  and then with the slaves of the church  madame de v was vibrating betwixt the first of these epochas the color of the rose was shading fast away  she ought to have been a deist five years before the time i had the honor to pay my first visit  she placed me upon the same sopha with her for the sake of disputing the point of religion more closely  in short madame de v told me she believed nothing  i told madame de v it might be her principle but i was sure it could not be her interest to level the outworks without which i could not conceive how such a citadel as hers could be defended  that there was not a more dangerous thing in the world than for a beauty to be a deist  that it was a debt i owed my creed not to conceal it from her  that i had not been five minutes sat upon the sopha besides her but i had begun to form designs  and what is it but the sentiments of religion and the persuasion they had existed in her breast which could have checked them as they rose up  we are not adamant said i taking hold of her hand  and there is need of all restraints till age in her own time steals in and lays them on us  but my dear lady said i kissing her hand  it is too  too soon   i declare i had the credit all over paris of unperverting madame de v  she affirmed to mons d and the abbe m that in one half hour i had said more for revealed religion than all their encyclopedia had said against it  i was listed directly into madame de vs coterie  and she put off the epoch of deism for two years  i remember it was in this coterie in the middle of a discourse in which i was showing the necessity of a first cause that the young count de faineant took me by the hand to the furthest corner of the room to tell me my solitaire was pinned too strait about my neck  it should be plus badinant said the count looking down upon his own  but a word mons yorick to the wise    and from the wise mons le compte replied i making him a bow  is enough  the count de faineant embraced me with more ardour than ever i was embraced by mortal man  for three weeks together i was of every mans opinion i met  pardi ce mons yorick a autant desprit que nous autres  il raisonne bien said another  cest un bon enfant said a third  and at this price i could have eaten and drank and been merry all the days of my life at paris but twas a dishonest reckoning  i grew ashamed of it  it was the gain of a slave  every sentiment of honor revolted against it  the higher i got the more was i forced upon my beggarly system  the better the coterie  the more children of art  i languishd for those of nature and one night after a most vile prostitution of myself to half a dozen different people i grew sick  went to bed  ordered la fleur to get me horses in the morning to set out for italy  maria moulines i never felt what the distress of plenty was in any one shape till now  to travel it through the bourbonnois the sweetest part of france  in the heyday of the vintage when nature is pouring her abundance into every ones lap and every eye is lifted up  a journey through each step of which music beats time to labor and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their clusters  to pass through this with my affections flying out and kindling at every group before me  and every one of em was pregnant with adventures  just heaven  it would fill up twenty volumes  and alas i have but a few small pages left of this to crowd it into  and half of these must be taken up with the poor maria my friend mr shandy met with near moulines  the story he had told of that disordered maid affectd me not a little in the reading but when i got within the neighbouthood where she lived it returned so strong into my mind that i could not resist an impulse which prompted me to go half a league out of the road to the village where her parents dwelt to enquire after her  it is going i own like the knight of the woeful countenance in quest of melancholy adventures  but i know not how it is but i am never so perfectly conscious of the existence of a soul within me as when i am entangled in them  the old mother came to the door her looks told me the story before she opened her mouth  she had lost her husband he had died she said of anguish for the loss of marias senses about a month before  she had feared at first she added that it would have plundered her poor girl of what little understanding was left  but on the contrary it had brought her more to herself  still she could not rest  her poor daughter she said crying was wandering somewhere about the road    why does my pulse beat languid as i write this and what made la fleur whose heart seemed only to be tuned to joy to pass the back of his hand twice across his eyes as the woman stood and told it i beckoned to the postilion to turn back into the road  when we had got within half a league of moulines at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket i discovered poor maria sitting under a poplar  she was sitting with her elbow in her lap and her head leaning on one side within her hand  a small brook ran at the foot of the tree  i bid the postilion go on with the chaise to moulines  and la fleur to bespeak my supper  and that i would walk after him  she was dressed in white and much as my friend described her except that her hair hung loose which before was twisted within a silk net  she had superadded likewise to her jacket a pale green ribband which fell across her shoulder to the waist at the end of which hung her pipe  her goat had been as faithless as her lover and she had got a little dog in lieu of him which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle as i looked at her dog she drew him toward her with the string  thou shall not leave me sylvio said she i looked in marias eyes and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat for as she uttered them the tears trickled down her cheeks  i sat down close by her and maria let me wipe them away as they fell with my handkerchief  i then sleepd it in my own  and then in hers  and then in mine  and then i wiped hers again  and as i did it i felt such undescribable emotions within me as i am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion  i am positive i have a soul nor can all the books with which materialists have pestered the world ever convince me of the contrary  maria when maria had come a little to herself i asked her if she remembered a pale thin person of a man who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before she said she was unsettled much at that time but remembered it upon two accounts  that ill as she was she saw the person pitied her and next that her goat had stolen his handkerchief and she had beat him for the theft  she had washed it she said in the brook and kept it ever since in her pocket to restore it to him in case she should ever see him again which she added he had half promised her as she told me this she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves tied round with a tendril  on opening it i saw an s marked in one of the corners  she had since that she told me strayed as far as rome and walked round st peters once  and returned back  that she found her way alone across the apennines  had traveled over all lombardy without money  and through the flinty roads of savoy without shoes  how she had borne it and how she had got supported she could not tell  but god tempers the wind said maria to the shorn lamb  shorn indeed and to the quick said i and wast thou in my own land where i have a cottage i would take thee to it and shelter thee thou should eat of my own bread and drink of my own cup  i would be kind to thy sylvio  in all thy weaknesses and wanderings i would seek after thee and bring thee back  when the sun went down i would say my prayers and when i had done thou should play thy evening song upon thy pipe nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart  nature melted within me as i uttered this and maria observing as i took out my handkerchief that it was steeped to much already to be of use would needs go wash it in the stream  and where will you dry it maria said i  i will dry it in my bosom said she  twill do me good  and is your heart still so warm maria said i  i touched upon the string on which hung all her sorrows  she looked with wistful disorder for some time in my face and then without saying any thing took her pipe and played her service to the virgin  the string i had touched ceased to vibrate  in a moment or two maria returned to herself  let her pipe fall  and rose up  and where art you going maria said i  she said to moulines  let us go said i together  maria put her arm within mine and lengthening the string to let the dog follow  in that order we entered moulines  maria moulines though i hate salutations and greetings in the marketplace yet when we got into the middle of this i stopped to take my last look and last farewell of maria  maria though not tall was nevertheless of the first order of fine forms  affliction had touched her looks with something that was scarce earthly  still she was feminine  and so much was there about her of all that the heart wishes or the eye looks for in woman that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain and those of elizas out of mine she should not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup but maria should lay in my bosom and be unto me as a daughter  adieu poor luckless maiden  imbibe the oil and wine which the compassion of a stranger as he journieth on his way now pours into thy wounds  the being who has twice bruised thee can only bind them up for ever  the bourbonnois there was nothing from which i had painted out for myself so joyous a riot of the affections as in this journey in the vintage through this part of france but pressing through this gate of sorrow to it my sufferings has totally unfitted me in every scene of festivity i saw maria in the background of the piece sitting pensive under her poplar and i had got almost to lions before i was able to cast a shade across her    dear sensibility source inexhausted of all that is precious in our joys or costly in our sorrows thou chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of straw  and it is thou who lifts him up to heaven  eternal fountain of our feelings  it is here i trace thee  and this is thy divinity which stirs within me  not that in some sad and sickening moments  my soul shrinks back upon herself and startles at destruction  mere pomp of words  but that i feel some generous joys and generous cares beyond myself  all comes from thee great  great sensorium of the world which vibrates if a hair of our heads but falls upon the ground in the remotest desert of thy creation  touched with thee eugenius draws my curtain when i languish  hears my tale of symptoms and blames the weather for the disorder of his nerves thou givst a portion of it sometimes to the roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest mountains  he finds the lacerated lamb of anothers flock  this moment i beheld him leaning with his head against his crook with piteous inclination looking down upon it  oh had i come one moment sooner  it bleeds to death  his gentle heart bleeds with it   peace to thee generous swain  i see thou walk off with anguish  but thy joys shall balance it  for happy is thy cottage  and happy is the sharer of it  and happy are the lambs which sport about you  the supper a shoe coming loose from the forefoot of the thillhorse at the beginning of the ascent of mount taurira the postilion dismounted twisted the shoe off and put it in his pocket as the ascent was of five or six miles and that horse our main dependence i made a point of having the shoe fastened on again as well as we could but the postilion had thrown away the nails and the hammer in the chaisebox being of no great use without them i submitted to go on  he had not mounted half a mile higher when coming to a flinty piece of road the poor devil lost a second shoe and from off his other forefoot i then got out of the chaise in good earnest and seeing a house about a quarter of a mile to the left hand with a great deal to do i prevailed upon the postilion to turn up to it the look of the house and of every thing about it as we drew nearer soon reconciled me to the disaster  it was a little farmhouse surrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard about as much corn  and close to the house on one side was a potagerie of an acre and a half full of every thing which could make plenty in a french peasants house  and on the other side was a little wood which furnished wherewithal to dress it it was about eight in the evening when i got to the house  so i left the postilion to manage his point as he could  and for mine i walked directly into the house  the family consisted of an old greyheaded man and his wife with five or six sons and sonsinlaw and their several wives and a joyous genealogy out of em  they were all sitting down together to their lentilsoup a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table and a flaggon of wine at each end of it promised joy through the stages of the repast  twas a feast of love  the old man rose up to meet me and with a respectful cordiality would have me sit down at the table my heart was sat down the moment i entered the room so i sat down at once like a son of the family and to invest myself in the character as speedily as i could i instantly borrowed the old mans knife and taking up the loaf cut myself a hearty luncheon and as i did it i saw a testimony in every eye not only of an honest welcome but of a welcome mixed with thanks that i had not seemed to doubt it  was it this or tell me nature what else it was which made this morsel so sweet  and to what magic i owe it that the draught i took of their flaggon was so delicious with it that they remain upon my palate to this hour  if the supper was to my taste  the grace which followed it was much more so  the grace when supper was over the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife  to bid them prepare for the dance the moment the signal was given the women and girls ran all together into a back apartment to tie up their hair  and the young men to the door to wash their faces and change their sabots and in three minutes every soul was ready upon a little esplanade before the house to begin  the old man and his wife came out last and placing me betwixt them sat down upon a sopha of turf by the door  the old man had some fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle  and at the age he was then of touched it well enough for the purpose his wife sung nowandthen a little to the tune  then intermitted  and joined her old man again as their children and grandchildren danced before them  it was not till the middle of the second dance when from some pauses in the movement wherein they all seemed to look up i fancied i could distinguish an elevation of spirit different from that which is the cause or the effect of simple jollity  in a word i thought i beheld religion mixing in the dance  but as i had never seen her so engaged i should have looked upon it now as one of the illusions of an imagination which is eternally misleading me had not the old man as soon as the dance ended said that this was their constant way and that all his life long he had made it a rule after supper was over to call out his family to dance and rejoice believing he said that a cheerful and contented mind was the best sort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate peasant could pay    or a learned prelate either said i  the case of delicacy when you have gained the top of mount taurira you run presently down to lions  adieu then to all rapid movements it is a journey of caution and it fares better with sentiments not to be in a hurry with them so i contracted with a voiturin to take his time with a couple of mules and convey me in my own chaise safe to turin through savoy  poor patient quiet honest people fear not your poverty the treasury of your simple virtues will not be envied you by the world nor will your valleys be invaded by it  nature in the midst of thy disorders thou art still friendly to the scantiness thou have created  with all thy great works about thee little have thou left to give either to the scithe or to the sickle  but to that little thou grantest safety and protection and sweet are the dwellings which stand so sheltered  let the wayworn traveller vent his complaints upon the sudden turns and dangers of your roads  your rocks  your precipices  the difficulties of getting up  the horrors of getting down  mountains impracticable  and cataracts which roll down great stones from their summits and block his up road  the peasants had been all day at work in removing a fragment of this kind between st michael and madane and by the time my voiturin got to the place it wanted full two hours of completing before a passage could any how be gained there was nothing but to wait with patience  twas a wet and tempestuous night so that by the delay and that together the voiturin found himself obliged to take up five miles short of his stage at a little decent kind of an inn by the road side  i forthwith took possession of my bedchamber  got a good fire  ordered supper and was thanking heaven it was no worse  when a voiture arrived with a lady in it and her servantmaid  as there was no other bedchamber in the house the hostess without much nicety led them into mine telling them as she ushered them in that there was no body in it but an english gentleman  that there were two good beds in it and a closet within the room which held another  the accent in which she spoke of this third bed did not say much for it  however she said there were three beds and but three people  and she durst say the gentleman would do any thing to accommodate matters  i left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about it  so instantly made a declaration i would do any thing in my power  as this did not amount to an absolute surrender of my bedchamber i still felt myself so much the proprietor as to have a right to do the honors of it  so i desired the lady to sit down  pressed her into the warmest seat  called for more wood  desired the hostess to enlarge the plan of the supper and to favor us with the very best wine  the lady had scarce warmed herself five minutes at the fire before she began to turn her head back and give alook at the beds and the oftener she cast her eyes that way the more they returned perplexed  i felt for her  and for myself for in a few minutes what by her looks and the case itself i found myself as much embarrassed as it was possible the lady could be herself  that the beds we were to lay in were in one and the same room was enough simply by itself to have excited all this  but the position of them for they stood parallel and so very close to each other as only to allow space for a small wicker chair betwixt them rendered the affair still more oppressive to us  they were fixed up moreover near the fire and the projection of the chimney on one side and a large beam which crossed the room on the other formed a kind of recess for them that was no way favorable to the nicety of our sensations  if any thing could have added to it it was that the two beds were both of em so very small as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and the maid lying together which in either of them could it have been feasible my lying besides them though a thing not to be wished yet there was nothing in it so terrible which the imagination might not have passed over without torment  as for the little room within it offered little or no consolation to us twas a damp cold closet with a half dismantled window shutter and with a window which had neither glass or oil paper in it to keep out the tempest of the night i did not endeavor to stifle my cough when the lady gave a peep into it so it reduced the case in course to this alternative  that the lady should sacrifice her health to her feelings and take up with the closet herself and abandon the bed next mine to her maid  or that the girl should take the closet etc etc  the lady was a piedmontese of about thirty with a glow of health in her cheeks  the maid was a lyonoise of twenty and as brisk and lively a french girl as ever moved  there were difficulties every way  and the obstacle of the stone in the road which brought us into the distress great as it appeared whilst the peasants were removing it was but a pebble to what lay in our ways now  i have only to add that it did not lessen the weight which hung upon our spirits that we were both too delicate to communicate what we felt to each other upon the occasion  we sat down to supper and had we not had more generous wine to it than a little inn in savoy could have furnished our tongues had been tied up till necessity herself had set them at liberty  but the lady having a few bottles of burgundy in her voiture sent down her fille de chamber for a couple of them so that by the time supper was over and we were left alone we felt ourselves inspired with a strength of mind sufficient to talk at least without reserve upon our situation we turned it every way and debated and considered it in all kind of lights in the course of a two hours negotiation at the end of which the articles were settled finally betwixt us and stipulated for in form and manner of a treaty of peace  and i believe with as much religion and good faith on both sides as in any treaty which as yet had the honor of being handed down to posterity  they were as follows  first as the right of the bedchamber is in monsieur  and he thinking the bed next to the fire to be the warmest he insists upon the concession on the ladys side of taking up with it  granted on the part of madame with a proviso that as the curtains of that bed are of a flimsy transparent cotton and appear likewise too scanty to draw close that the fille de chamber shall fasten up the opening either by corking pins or needle and thread in such manner as shall be deemed a sufficient barrier on the side of monsieur   dly it is required on the part of madame that monsieur shall lay the whole night through in his robe de chamber  rejected inasmuch monsieur is not worth a robe de chamber he having nothing in his portmanteau but six shirts and a black silk pair of breeches  the mentioning the silk pair of breeches made an entire change of the article  for the breeches were accepted as an equivalent for the robe de chamber and so it was stipulated and agreed upon that i should lay in my black silk breeches all night   dly it was insisted upon and stipulated for by the lady that after monsieur was got to bed and the candle and fire extinguished that monsieur should not speak one single word the whole night  granted provided monsieurs saying his prayers might not be deemed an infraction of the treaty  there was but one point forgot in this treaty and that was the manner in which the lady and myself should be obliged to undress and get to bed  there was but one way of doing it and that i leave to the reader to devise protesting as i do it that if it is not the most delicate in nature it is the fault of his own imagination  against which this is not my first complaint  now when we were got to bed whether it was the novelty of the situation or what it was i know not but so it was i could not shut my eyes i tried this side and that and turned and turned again till a full hour after midnight when nature and patience both wearing out  o my god said i    you have broke the treaty monsieur said the lady who had no more slept than myself  i begged a thousand pardons  but insisted it was no more than en ejaculation  she maintained twas an entire infraction of the treaty  i maintained it was provided for in the clause of the third article  the lady would by no means give up her point though she weakened her barrier by it for in the warmth of the dispute i could hear two or three corking pins fall out of the curtain to the ground  upon my word and honor madame said i  stretching my arm out of bed by way asseveration    i was going to have added that i would not have trespassed against the remotest idea of decorum for the world    but the fille de chamber hearing there were words between us and fearing that hostilities would ensue in course had crept silently out of her closet and it being totally dark had stolen so close to our beds that she had got herself into the narrow passage which separated them and had advanced so far up as to be in a line betwixt her mistress and me   so that when i stretched out my hand i caught hold of the fille de chambres  end of vol ii
