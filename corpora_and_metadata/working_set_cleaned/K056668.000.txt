a further search into the conduct of the allies and the late ministry as to peace and war  containing also a reply to the several letters and memorials of the states general  with a vindication of the british parliament in their late resolves and address relating to the deficiencies of the dutch  london printed for john morphew near stationers hall       a further search into the conduct of the allies etc the reception a former work of this kind has met with in the world and the little which has been said against it as to matters of fact must be acknowledged to be all owing to the truth coming with an irresistible force upon the minds of men and which always carries its own evidence along with it when we have met with the enemy descanting upon it we have heard them even in the midst of a thousand curses and hard names which they cast upon the author yet at every pause cry out damn the circumstance i doubt there is too much truth in it though i hate the design of making it public this makes it clear which has often and upon many other occasions been said that our late people had a kind of popery in their politics  viz that much of their success consisted in keeping the people blind and ignorant in the main and most essential points of their affairs and which it was most necessary for them to know that they were so far from knowing what usage they had received abroad from their allies that when they came to be a little rightly informed they could not frame ideas of so much knavery in their heads or think it possible that any people who called themselves allies could at the same time carry themselves in such a manner to those for whom they had made the least professions of any respect or for whose common safety they had the least concern  as the truth of what has been thus spoken is hereby acknowledged and confessed by the enemy which is the best kind of evidence so the seasonableness of making that truth public in the manner it has been by the former tract and as it shall or may be in this is justified and cleared beyond all possibility of objection by the late public resolutions of the honorable house of commons where it comes into the world with the sanction and authority of the great representative of the nation it is true the particulars in the votes amount to a most excessive height and though it was known and believed by many to be very great yet i must confess few imagined them to be so surprising the account so large and the particulars so many as they appear to be also one thing is obtained by this report of the house of commons which the credit of a single author was by no means sufficient for  viz that the dutch had any share in the deficiency and in the injuries which this nation has suffered under the weight of this confederacy many would be brought by the power of reasoning and the force of demonstrations which are things all people are not equally furnished to resist they would i say be brought to confess that there might have been defects in general and that those defects appeared in the affairs of the empire the portuguese and such like any thing but the dutch but such an ascendant had the influence of the politics and the confederacy of the late administration with the parties concerned obtained over the people that though any thing would go down with them against other people yet if the dear dutch came into the dispute nothing could be born with but all the rest was the pure effect of jacobitism and the french  how fatal this has been to us i may hereafter have leisure to examine and every day is like to discover more and more of it to us indeed things were mounted to such a violent prepossession upon us in favor of the dutch that we began to think even our own constitution stood in need of further security from them and politickly brought the dutch into our national concerns thus making ourselves beholden to them for a guarantee or safety to the succession of hannover that this might be a handle to our doing other things for them so exorbitant in their own nature as that no nation but such as depended upon them for something very weighty and significant would ever consent to or could upon any other pretense be persuaded into yet this was not all for when we had brought our people to stoop to so mean a thought as that our succession ratified by both kingdoms and incorporated by both the parliaments of england and scotland in the late solemn treaty of union could receive any addition of strength from abroad more than that of the interest and alliance of so powerful a prince as his electoral highness of hannover and his allies that we stood in need of that incoherent article of a dutch guarantee when i say we had stooped so low as to level our constitution to the common notion of leagues and treaties between other and differing nations and that it should receive a farther sanction thereby it was not hard then to fill the heads of the poor people with a belief that whoever made the least objection against any thing hereafter which either the dutch might do by us or which we might do by them acted therein against the protestant succession this was a point so well gained by the dutch that on the faith of a man if they gained it for nothing it was the best bargain they made during the whole war and if our late managers granted it so also they must either have given up their senses to the dutch or had most despicable thoughts of the strength of great britain and of our being able to support our own settlement or which i speak most unwillingly there must have been some private bargain driven of which i shall venture to say no more but that i hope no englishman could be found that would be guilty of it  to wave therefore a reflection so unwelcome let us go back to the observation before viz this threefold end we have seen it answer to the dutch what end it will ever answer to us remains a mystery and will in all probability remain so for many years to come if not for ever the ends which i say it answered for the dutch were three    the barrier treaty which with the separate article was joined as the advance money of a loan by way of what our people call promptpayment and which the dutch had the confidence to paum upon us as a small matter and a thing due to them for the great kindness done for us by them in taking upon them to secure our succession i am not ignorant of that weak and foolish use which the enemies of peace made of that objection spoken of in the other forementioned tract p    viz that it may not be right in point of policy or good sense that a foreign power should be called in to confirm our succession by way of guarantee but only to acknoledge it otherwise we put it out of the power of our own legislature to change our succession without the consent of that prince or state who is guarantee however our posterity may hereafter by the tyranny and oppression of any succeeding princes be reduced to the fatal necessity of breaking in upon the excellent and happy settlement now in force  this by all means they will have as an aim taken for the pretender as if because we ought not to put it out of the power of our legislature to limit the succession whatever necessity may happen even when this race may be all in their graves that therefore we have an immediate alteration of the succession in our view these people who contend thus forget the mighty noise we have had from them about parliamentary limitations a word the whigs have made so sacred that it has been like the magna charta of their liberties and with which they run down the hereditary right of their princes as if there had been nothing at all in it but tyranny and arbitrary government till at length it was happily discovered that they were very well consistent together and that they who best understood hereditary right had proved it to be agreeable to parliamentary limitation and then all was well again but after all this bustle was it to be imagined that the same people could so easily give up the parliaments right of limiting the succession to a foreign nation and by making a league of guarantee for the succession legitimate the impertinence of strangers who may hereafter intermeddle with our constitution and may tell a british parliament they have no power to alter or meddle with the settlement of the crown for that it is already settled and they are guarantees of it what has been may be and what may be may be supposed to be if then any of the family of hannover should tyrannize or abdicate or the same or like circumstances should happen as have happened before the parliament would be disabled from declaring the throne vacant and filling up the same with such other of the family as they find convenient which according to all the whig principles which we have so often heard of is inseparable from the constitution and much more sacred than any thing which has been hereditary in the world i do not incline to concern these papers with the popular disputes which have troubled the world so much and so long about the difference between hereditary and parliamentary right how far they are the same or which is best furnished with authorities and originals whether of divine or civil right it is enough to take hold here of the whigs own argument and allowing all they have said on this head to be orthodox whether it really be so or no it must necessarily follow that this parliamentary right cannot or ought not to be given out of our hinds and put by a treaty into the hands of foreigners so that it shall be in their power to put their negative into our next limitation of the crown if this be not to give away our liberties i would be glad to know what it is to keep them if there be any choice of tyrants and if it weighs any thing when our privileges are given up who is it they should be given up to i confess myself more willing to be a slave at home than abroad and to be tyrannized on by a prince of our own than by a foreign nation and if there were no other reason for that than this it would be sufficient to justify the choice  viz that there are more ways to avoid the mischief of it that an oppressing prince has some times changed his measures or he may be restrained or may die and thereby a nation may be delivered but such a convention as this made with a foreign nation engages that whole nation upon all occasions to embark itself and its whole strength in defense of the capitulation agreed on and thus by this method the power of parliament in future limitations of the crown seems to be effectually given up how the whigs would have liked this doctrine if it had come from any one but themselves may be best guessed at by the warmth they showed about the league said to be made by the late king james and the king of france which put this whole nation into a flame and reason good so far as that league appeared for what was it or what could we imagine it to be but a treaty of guarantee with the french for the securing the succession of popery in england whereas the settling the religion and liberties of this nation was the undoubted right of the people in parliament and so by the same rule must the succession of our princes be the sum of all this is that by the whigs own arguments and by their own principles which they have always professed and adhered to and by the same rule from which they acted in the revolution the accepting a guarantee for the securing the succession of the crown of this kingdom to any family or branch of a family race or line whatsoever is no less than giving up the privileges of the people and divesting the parliament of the power of limiting the succession to the crown  it may be remembered that in the late treaty of union with scotland some secret overtures were made to have engaged the dutch to be guarantees of that treaty and though that proposal seemed to come from such hands as gave reason to believe it was rather a design to destroy than secure the said treaty the dutch having at that time discovered willingness enough to have prevented the conclusion of that treaty yet those that knew any thing of the resentment expressed at that time here against that proposal as dishonorable to england and destructive of the constitution of both kingdoms would wonder that ever the same ministry should so far change their notions as to admit the same guarantee in so nice an affair as the succession to their own crown which they rejected with contempt in a treaty with the neighboring nation  secondly another end answered by this treaty of guarantee was giving an opportunity to the dutch to play their own game with us with respect to other treaties quotas proportions of payments ships troops and the like of this so much has been said already and is yet like to be said farther in public that i shall need say the less to it here my design being rather to justify the resentment all honest men entertain at the mean politics and submissions of our people here and to show the necessity of taking wiser for the future than to animate people against any of our confederates i am as forward as any to agree that the advantages of a strict union among the confederates are very great and that as her majesty expressed it the interest of the states of holland be looked upon as our own but this by no means hinders us from desiring that the dutch should use us well should show a reciprocal kindness and should act with a mutual concern for the general confederated interest and that we should not be willing to see them impose upon us in any of those particulars or be easy and submit quietly to it when they do and this is so much justice that none can object against and what is the best if not the only way to cultivate and maintain that friendship and good understanding on both sides which is so much the interest of the confederacy in general and of the dutch themselves in particular they who contend that the enquiring into these things seems to show a disregard to the confederacy in general or to the several parties concerned in particular seem to make severer satyrs upon the dutch than they are aware of the deficiencies of the performance they cannot deny the want of a due regard then to the confederacy must certainly lie rather in those that have been the cause of those deficiencies than those that have not for who are most justly to be charged with slighting and disregarding the mutual interest of the consederacy they that have failed in the performance of the condititions or they that complain of it in order to have them performed britain has all along shown by a zeal fatal to herself her willingness to push on the war with all imaginable vigor in order to which when her deficient allies having less concern for the general good have run the venture of miscarriage to shorten their expense britain as if the whole charge of the war had been her due to pay has zealously supplied both their quotas and her own while she was willing to do thus her confederates daily increased their deficiencies and her expense as they might very well do finding her so easy and while she was willing to sit still and see herself thus used it was very remarkable how augmentations and increase of forces was every year proposed by the confederates as well in flanders as in spain and none so forward as the emperor himself to increase the quotas of the troops and the charges of the war upon the rest of his confederates quietly waiting for their supplying additional troops and taking care to have very few of his own  while we submitted to all these things the war went quietly on but whether so successfully or no as it might have done if the allies had answered what we had reason to expect from them is left for them to answer at last the british court entering into a more narrow inspection of things have not thought fit so calmly to suffer the weight of the war to lie heavier upon one shoulder than another and though equally willing to bear their share of the burden yet not forward to carry that load which ought to lie upon other shoulders they are now calling upon their confederates to consider a little the justice of their several treaties and to look back and see what they are obliged to do if they expect the war should be carried on any farther if they are diffident of the success of these remonstrances from their experience how fruitless the like have been before and have therefore at the same time embraced the occasion that has offered toward putting an end to the war by an honorable peace they will be justified in it before all the world both now and for ever when it shall be at the same time understood in what manner and for how many years this war has been carried on nor can the artifices of an adverse party among us delude many in their suggesting to the world that the government here is in the interest of france since they can have no other reason to back that suggestion than that they were not willing to carry on a war upon unequal terms and in a confederacy with allies who would not perform their own conditions and in which those who expected the greatest advantages from it paid the least part of the expense toward it  thirdly the third end which this general complaint against a peace has been calculated to answer and which the party has taken care to make as popular as they can is a general notion that those who are for a peace do it with a design by the assistance of france to introduce the pretender however weak and inconsistent such a consequence may be nothing is more certain than that many innocent and wellmeaning people have been prevailed upon to believe it and though the improbilities of the thing in its own nature and the steady zeal of the persons who they charge with it and who have all along in a course of many years testified their abhorrence of that interest and taken such steps against it as have been most effectual to the cutting off all hope both from him and his party might suffice to any reasonable people yet this seems to be one of those difficulties which can be solved only by a little patience and time to those who will be convinced by argument it seems sufficient that our putting a stop to a war which we carried on at so much disadvantage and which had in view rather an utter empoverishing the nation than a timely reducing our enemies to reason however was not only necessary on many other accounts but greatly our advantage on this account in especial manner that thereby we might be left in a condition to defend our constitution and to preserve power to maintain our succession as our parliament had thought fit to limit it without the help of the dutch and without being put to so weak so scandalous and so dishonorable a shift as to accept of the guarantee of foreign states to preseve our own acts of parliament  when i look farther into this scandalous thing called a guarantee for our succession methinks it represents to me our people on their knees to the dutch for the mighty favor of taking us into their high and mighty protection and indeed when this is compared with the manner with which the states of holland carried on the geentruydenbergh treay wherein the making a peace for us was also left wholly to or engrossed by the states of holland the thing seems very much of a piece the barrier treaty also has much of the same manner in it which being handled at large by itself i say no more to here i have observed that at the time when we began to talk here of peace and when the french articles began to appear we were mightily amused with the dutch making offers that they would take away the excuse from us of want of money or credit and the dutch would advance to us four millions sterling to encourage us to carry on the war that the dutch made such an offer publicly in form is known to be a mistake but that the dutch might be willing to lend or to give as much as that amounts to to have the sole direction of making the peace that so their particular interest which they never forget might be principally provided for this there can be no great question of and the dutch are not without cunning enough to make it so well worth their while as that such a sum of money should not be ill laid out but those people should do well to consider two or three things which lie hid in this notion of the dutch lending us so much money and which by way of corollary may be of great use to us in the understanding of other parts of management on that side   that if the states of holland for the carrying on the war could spare us so much money to encourage us that we might not make a peace without them though that has not yet been thought of them however all they thought fit to say in former times of their being impoverished and exhausted and not in a condition to pay their quotas must be a manifest fraud and cheat and must be with design to put upon us the necessity of carrying it on upon unequal conditions and this they could not have entertained a thought of without first being sensible that they had us at so much advantage as that they knew whenever they thought fit to ease their own charge they mightput the hardship upon us   since it was obtained by the arts of their other conduct that the dutch had the sole direction of the peace it followed then that we were under an obligation to carry on the war at their bidding from whence it was most natural to believe they were not darksighted enough not to make their other advantages   these things make it no longer a mystery why the dutch would advance any sum of money for the encouraging us to carry on the war because it followed that we should carry it on under the same inequalities and disadvantages which we did before but now these things are detected and if we should come to a necessity of carrying on the war which god forbid yet that it should be more than probable we may not only demand that they begin upon a new foot and make up all their quotas for the time to come but also may call upon them for what is past also it is more than probable that they may then plead poverty with us as they did before and talk no more of the great sums they would lend us   there is yet another remark to be made upon this head viz of the dutch advancing such great sums of money to us we have never found but these sums were to be all lent upon good parliamentary security and on the interest current in england and we might not be thought ungrateful to the lenders if we asked them where was the advantage of all that was it to us or to themselves they must not know the dutch so well as we have reason to know them who expect to find them ever forgetful of their own interest in any proposal they may make it is true we have complained of our being impoverislsed and exhausted and not in a condition to carry on the war especially at the rate which it has been carried on at without great inconveniences and involving mortgaging and anticipating for us and our posterity at a rate which neither are like to see the end of but what is our defect we do not want lenders but funds to borrow upon we have usurers enough among us to devour us we want no help from the dutch we are not without a sort of men among us who having little or no interest in the freehold have amassed infinite sums of money in cash with which they trade upon the rest and live upon the blood and vitals of the government these like the eagles where the carcass falls gather together and if the parliament can but find funds though they boast of having the power of credit in themselves and often think of making themselves formidable by threatening the government that they will lend no money and that they can ruin the public credit by refusing to advance their money yet they can no more forbear than a vulture can forbear his prey the funds are the carcass they feed on they are as hungry for them as a lion that has been hunting and found no food and in spite of their faith often pledged to their party and friends to run down credit and lend no money let but the ministry find a fund and the parliament establish a lottery or subscription or loan and they are ready to trample one another to death to get in their money so that after all that has been said of the dutch lending us money we see nothing to be said to it but what was said in answer to some bantering lines in the time of king charles ii made upon the king which his majesty by repartee answered himself thus  charles at this time having no need  thanks you as much as if he did   it is apparent in our case we want no lenders we have been devoured with harpies already who think as no doubt the dutch would also think and perhaps say too that the borrower is servant to the lender but we must acknowledge we want funds to borrow and where to find them such excepted as will plunge us yet farther and farther into a gulf whence no less than a hundred years can redeem us is past the skill of the best advocates for a war to find out indeed i cannot but wonder that in all the noise the faction have made at these things they have not descended to one argument against the difficulty of raising funds they have indeed told us great things a la gasconade that there are funds enough that england is vastly rich that there is money enough that we can with ease carry on the war this seven years and such rhodomontade that they have surfeited the people with it for some time but we do not see one of them that offers any scheme how and upon what destructive ruinous fund this money may be raised that the people may judge whether what is alleged be true yea or no and whether those funds they shall so propose shall not be as fatal to the general good as those that have gone before with such fallacious ways have the people been managed till they have led them on to the brink of inevitable ruin and now as if it were not enough that the nation has for so many years been oppressed by the war through the negligence or knavery of our consederates we are modestly desired to proceed in the war upon the same foot i confess this among our own people is a sign of some national stupidity and blindness which one would hardly think possible but for our neighbors whether the states general or others to desire in seems to smell of something we want a word for in our tongue and may be better expressed in french by marveillieux surprenant and the like i must needs say i have not yet met with any man so weak but what begins to feel the force of this argument enter into his soul if the allies have not performed according to their agreement they should be reminded of it and if we cannot prevail with them to make up former defects we ought at least to be careful that they comply punctually for the time to come can any people be so besotted to a party as to expect or desire that a nation already impoverished by the unfair impositions of her allies and not able to carry on the war on the terms she has done for some time should not insist upon more justice for the future that she may be able to hold it out  neither is this an unnecessary argument at this time for if we can carry on this war at the expense of three millions and half yearly instead of seven then we are better able to go on two years upon the square with our allies than one year upon the unequal foundation we have gone upon all along so that to bring our allies to do us justice and to exert themselves to the uttermost in carrying on the war is the truest and best step toward the main point  viz of carrying it on if we are assured we shall no more be imposed upon if we see the full quotas of troops in the field the full numbers of ships in the mediterranean and all things in readiness in time and fit for action if any thing will revive the drooping spirits of the nation it must be this it must be that they have some hopes of not being cheated again and that the powerful assistance of the allies will be a means of putting a happy and speedy end to the war that a safe peace may follow and it is easy to find that nothing but this will do it nothing else can persuade an exhausted nation to bleed anew but some assurance that they shall not be suffered by their allies to bleed to death that there shall be some end of their sorrows and miseries and that every hand is fairly engaged in bringing things to a happy end  but these things seem to call for no further remark from us they are so natural and plain in themselves that every child in these affairs may understand them for if we must carry on the war it must be needful that we suffer ourselves to be no more abused by our allies if we are not to expect justice from our allies then we must be unaccountably besotted if we carry on the war nay though a worse peace were to follow than her majesty has good reason to expect from the negotiations now on foot  but it may not be amiss to enquire here what prospect there appears of these things and what hopes our allies do put us in of expecting for the future better treatment and that in the pursuit of the war they will go on upon a different foot from that which they have hitherto gone upon for if there was but some appearance of an amendment for the future it might be some encouragement to us to think of prosecuting the ensuing campaigns with more comfort but instead of this all we yet see amounts to little that way for at home all the fruit of the discovery shows only a kind of regret that it is made public an inward fretting that the fact is too obvious so that they cannot contradict it and an envious warmth at the justice done their own country in it because it touches upon the states general as if to touch them were fatal to us all and perhaps it may indeed be fatal to some projects the party had ser on foot here destructive enough to the liberty of their country and of which a little time may give us a farther view this is clear in that all the reply we have here to the detecting the hard usage we have met with from our allies issues in exclamations at our exposing the dutch and falling upon the dutch spreading reports that we design to fall out with the dutch and that we are for a peace with france and a war with the dutch as if we must refrain a due inspection into our own affairs for fear of the effects it will or may have upon the hollanders it is no less the duty of every faithful representative to enquire how other nations may impose upon the people and waste and destroy us than it is how we are embezzelled at home for every breach of treaty is in this kind a depredation upon the people and it is most reasonable that when they have thus discovered the fraud and by who as well as by what means the nation is exhausted and worn out they should so far expose the matters of fact and the persons that the people may know by what means they are impoverished this has been the constant method and usage of parliaments and the members of parliament could not have discharged the trust they have committed to them by the people they represent it they had omitted it nor can this be called exposing the dutch they lay open the truth if that exposes the dutch or any other persons or states the misfortune is their own to be liable to such a charge but let such people answer what they would have had the house of commons have done when upon enquiry into the state of the war they found that we had not been fairly used by the confederates if they had held their peace had they not been criminally silent had they not betrayed their country had they not been accessory to all the frauds of the like kind which should have happened for the future and what would the language of posterity have been when they should have seen that the house of commons knew these things but took no notice of them or any care to have the nation informed of them must it not have been a just reproach upon them as it is now upon those who knew it before and yet took no notice of it or made any application to former parliaments to have it redressed but it is evident these people who make now such loud complaints of the reflections cast upon our allies appear more concerned that the matter is made public than that it is true and are so far from desiring any cure for the disease that they spend all their heat and resentment at the discoveries of it and it is to be observed from their conduct that they make ten reflections upon the house of commons and the present ministry for the industry and pains taken in finding out how and by whom the nation has been abused for one just remark upon the integrity and zeal in the war of those allies who have used us in such a manner whence such a spirit can proceed and what reason can be given for it is not so hard to find out as it is melancholy to reflect that so it should be  i might go forward in this observation to expose the foundation from whence all this proceeds and by which we should soon see for what uses and purposes some people are so desirous of pushing on the war and how to do it they care not upon what disadvantages and unequal conditions they did it being willing to bear any part of the burden nay all the burden so the beloved war were but to be pursued the enquiry into this will open many scenes of private treachery not yet brought to light and for that i purpose to do it in a tract by itself i shall leave it to a fit occasion  it falls next in view to interrogate the ministers at vtrecht how they proceed and see thereby what measures the dutch take to convince us that we shall have a better and more equal balance kept up among us in case the war is to be continued but here you shall find measures calculated rather to compel the queen of great britain to carry on the war than to invite her majesty to it by assurances of performing treaties better than in the times past this is a temper so different from what might be expected from a people who had so treated their allies to us who complain of being so treated that it is as before marvellieux or to put it plainer a kind of throwing off the mask as if we were obliged to submit to be cheated after we had first discovered that it was so and that what before was done covertly and under the appearance of a treaty was now to be done more effectually openly avowedly and in the teeth of the rest of the allies  this appeared upon the first conference after the french plenipotentiaries had delivered in their paper of explanation as they called it on the proposals of the peace which they had formerly given in it came then to the turn of the allies to consider in what manner to deliver in their answer to the french proposals this it was resolved should be by the confederate ministers delivering in their demands or the several pretensions of their respective principles without taking any notice of the project contained in the paper given in by the ministers of france it should have been noted here in the first place that after all the dutch had said and after all that had been said to them in order to come to this treaty prepared to preserve a good understanding among the allies and to bring the treaty to the desired conclusion viz a good peace the dutch ministers appeared there without any character having neither powers as plenipotentiaries or as ambassadors or any thing more than mere commissioners empowered only to hear what was said make report to their masters the states and give back their answers which one of the queens common messengers may as well do on our side nor were the persons the equipages or the sallaries allowed to their said commissioners any more than what was suitable to common messengers whose business it was to carry a message and return with an answer so that in the conferences either general or particular there was no debating things with them only just giving in what any one had to say and all the answer these men could give was that they would report it to their highmightinesses the states general and would bring their answer the french plenipotentiaries presently objected against these powers as not sufficient to admit the dutch ministers into the conferences the british plenipotentiaries though they were sensible of the affront offered in it to their royal mistress after such assurances on her majestys part of her sincere intention to make the interest of all her allies to be as her own yet willing to wave every thing that might give an obstruction to the happy issue of the peace did not insist on this though they could not but complain that it greatly obstructed that happy concert of measures which they hoped might have been the constant fruit of the private conferences of the confederate ministers which the dutch having no powers that extended any farther than barely to hear and report and bring back a resolution was for want of those powers quite disappointed so that the dutch ministers might as justly be deemed and termed porters as plenipotentiaries well notwithstanding all this the british plenipotentiaries willing to promote the great end for which they assembled which as the lord bishop of bristol expressed it was in the name of god to bring the wars to a happy conclusion in an equitable and honorable peace all these obstructions were past over on their side and they labored to have the powers of the dutch ministers accepted as at last they were with some difficulty and thus they proceed to the affair of the demands as above which were to be delivered in as the  th of march the dutch ministers concealing the resolution taken at the hague to give in no demands but the very immediate copy of the preliminaries last treated on insisted that all the confederates demands should be formed into one instrument and be given in jointly by all the plenipotentiaries as the general demands of the whole alliance this though something surprising in itself yet was the less so when it was more known that this was in order to execute the measures above noted  viz of bringing in the preliminaries of geertruydenbergh as the summary demands of the allies but the british plenipotentiaries taking notice of it insisted that this seemed to be destructive of the treaty itself that france had twice ventured to carry on the war rather than agree to those preliminaries that they had been declared impracticable and could not be treated on here and to insist on the very literal form of those preliminiaries now and prescribe the plenipotentiaries to treat on them was to declare against a treaty at all that this meeting was understood by all parties to be not a treaty of preliminaries in order to a treaty of peace but a general treaty of peace itself wherein the specific demands of every ally were to be heard debated and finally discussed adjusted and answered to their satisfaction which could by no means be done by preliminary articles which had in them several references to a farther treaty and some suggested demands left to be farther discussed at another time whereas they were now met to make a final and general conclusion of all demands and pretensions whatsoever that there might be no more blood shed in the christian world that an end might be put to the miseries of europe it was also alleged that the said preliminaries had not been concerted with a due regard to the interest of all the allies in especial manner it was asked what article there was to be found in them which regarded the interest of her britannick majejesty farther than what merely respected her title to the crown and the banishment of the pretender whereas there seemed a great deal of reason for admitting farther demands for the security and enlarging the commerce and possessions of her majesty and her subjects for this reason as well as in behalf of the rest of the confederates the said british plenipotentiaries insisted upon giving in the instrument of their demands in particular every ally by themselves  it must be something astonishing to such true lovers of their country who can look back on these things with unprejudiced judgments to reflect on the temper reigning in this part of europe at the time of the treaty aforesaid when in all the numerous articles adjusted at the hague and afterward debated again at geertruydenberg by the dutch and french the former left out nothing which concerned their own interest security or advantage nay engaged the british court to concern and engage themselves for their particular security and advantages but not one word clause article or debate was ever thought of for the english either as to the security of their commerce as it then stood or the increase of it for the future on the other hand all the stress on the british side and for which we were to think ourselves infinitely obliged to the dutch was to engage their assistance to keep out the pretender and secure the succession of the crown of great britain to his electoral highness of hannover a thing which is so the universal resolution of all the people and parties in britain and to which they think all the opposition that can be made from either french or any else is so trifling and insignificant that they cannot be sensible of the exceeding obligation on that behalf to their confederates or of the great danger which they were in of the pretender although no foreign assistance had been engaged on that behalf esteeming the favorers of the pretender in britain not withstanding their great clamours of a party among us to be so sew and so inconsiderable as that there is nothing to be seared from them but supposing there had been more danger of this clause  viz the succession then we are willing to hope there is ground to apprehend it cannot but be reminded that it is as much the interest of the states general to secure that succession in the illustrious house of hannover as it is even of greatbritain itself and much more than it can be supposed to be to britain to secure to them the barrier of flanders for should the dominions of her britannick majesty ever fall into the hands of a popish or french interest or into the hands of a prince who is or may be in the interest of france the territories of the states general being stripped of the powerful assistance of the british troops by land and fleets by sea must inevitably be exposed to the powerful invasion of french and british fleets united and their trade in particular eaten up and destroyed as was verified by woeful experience to the said states in the year      when if the english court had not broken off from the said french alliance the states general had inevitably sunk under the power of france and their government been dissolved and destroyed so that upon the whole it is manifest there was no need on our part to engage the dutch to appear for the security of our succession to the house of hannover for that the sovereign law of their own preservation will always put them under a necessity of doing it the contrary being most sure to be a great step in their injury if not their evident destruction it may be argued that in rules of government we are not to depend upon this or that state being obliged by their own interest to assist us but we are to regard what necessity either for security of trade common safety of government or other political inteterest we are in or may be in of the assistance of the powers we are treating with and if that necessity appears it is a sufficient reason for us to secure that assistance and this we have frequent examples of as of the dutch themselves treating with us in      when notwithstanding it was the undoubted interest of england not to let holland upon any terms whatever fall into the hands of france and if ever the french do again make that attempt we ought to assist the dutch with all our troops and power and that not so much from any care and kindness to them as a nation but for our own interest and preservation yet the dutch knowing the eyes of a nation are not always open to their own interest thought fit to tie us to assist them in that case and even articled with us for the proportion viz the number of ten thousand men this is brought for a reason why not withstanding its being so much the interest of the states of holland to preserve the succession of the house of hannover to the crown of great britain we ought also to bind them to it by treaty but though we were to grant all this it will not follow that this treaty should have such a price put upon it that the dutch should demand of us all they want for this little equivalent and the reasons above though they should not be allowed to subsist against the treaty of guarantee itself will certainly take off much of that high price which the dutch have put upon it as if we were under such infinite obligations to them to secure it for us as that we were quite out of condition to defend it ourselves or as if they had no concern or were to receive no security benefit or advantage at all by it to themselves again it might pass for some argument in this case that if any power in europe ought to have sought this guarantee from the states general it should have been the elector himself who on his part might probably have some more occasion to secure his passage over to england and the march of any troops which his highness might find necessary to bring with him to assist his faithful people of britain to place him on the throne in case a french or popish interest should make opposition here indeed the states general might be very useful allies and his electoral highness would have thought very well of such a guarantee of the states but it cannot be conceived that britain can be under like necessity of such a security the succession which is their own act and deed being universally approved by the whole nation a few people excepted who are contemptible either for their number or interest so that on all these accounts it seems however a treaty of guarantee may be useful enough for our succession and no harm in it yet it cannot be a thing of that weight as to have so great a value set upon it and that britain should suffer herself so much to be imposed upon for it as it is apparent to all the world she has been on that account  we return now to the manner of the carrying on of the treaty of peace at vtrecht the british plenipotentiaries having as i said above insisted upon the giving in the demands of the allies in a separate manner have by this means an occasion of securing for the subjects of her majesty some other advantages than by the former treaty was thought of and the people of britain may now see not only on what disadvantage for us the former treaty was negotiated when we were to have our markets made for us by our dutch neighbors but they may see that all the noise that has been made of the present ministry and of the present managers being in the interest of france amounts only to this that whereas the other gave up all our interest to the dutch and the emperor these men are careful that britain may reap some advantages by the treaty as well as the rest of the confederates  indeed it has been something wonderful in the common discourse of the people on these subjects to find the generality poisoned by these selfdenying notions viz that all which can be obtained from france must be given to the emperor and the dutch and the king of portugal but nothing to the queen of great britain as if our strength were no acquisition or our power any safety to the alliance nay rather as if it were dangerous to the confederacy to entrust any part of that we have fought so long for and bought so dear to the queen of great britain one would think the dutch themselves went on that notion when as was apparent they appeared uneasy and jealous at the preparations made by her majesty to send a fleet and forces to canada while not knowing the design they apprehended it to be for the taking possession of some place or other in the spanish america although by the th article of the grand alliance it was agreed that her majesty might lawfully have done so if she had thought fit these things however of no other consequence yet serve to let us see how different as respecting us the manner of the allies has been in all the transactions of this war and how different their views have been in all their steps toward a peace from our constant behavior in the same heads as they respected them and that in all these occasions it has been the constant maxim of our confederates that we were to have no share in any thing but that the dutch under a notion of a barrier and security to their frontiers should make large acquisitions both to their territory and their commerce both which have been consented to from hence whether it be to the honor or to the infamy of those who have given in to these measures is left to the impartial part of mankind to determine it is evident that at length the just representations of the british ministers took place and the dutch after much difficulty have yielded that the demands of the allies be given in to the french although in one and the same instrument yet in separate heads and the british plenipotentiaries agree and propose to add at the end of every head this general and satisfaction of all the rest of the allies a clause sufficient to remove the scandal and reproach early cast upon the present management  viz that they designed to make a separate peace and had actually concluded the conditions there of with france before the congress was to begin i must crave pardon if i make these several instances of the usage of her majesty has met with from her allies rank in with their other conduct relating to forces and quotas which have already been made public and all together to come under the title of deficiencies for if there had been a more disinterested conjunction of counsel and assistance of measures in the proceedings of the allies to and with her britannick majesty and her ministers no question this treaty had been with more ease brought on with more mutual assistance to and confidence in one another entered into and perhaps the success might have been more promising also  there seems to be no occasion here of entering into the clauses which the dutch have obtained in any of their treaties and agreements with us by which they have gained advantages in commerce particularly to our prejudice because even the dutch themselves acknowledge them in their late letter to her majesty only declaring that they do not design to take the advantage of those articles i am very willing to believe the states general especially while a good understanding among the allies and particularly between them and us is so necessary to them would not make use of the advantages which were given them by that treaty but this does by no means deny nay it not tacitly only but even explicitly as it seems to indifferent judgments grants that such advantages are given to the dutch by that treaty see the declaration of the dutch on this head more particularly as follows  for having learnt that the principal exceptions taken to the said treaty were that it might prove prejudicial to the commerce of her majestys subjects in the spanish netherlands and that some had entertained an illgrounded and erroneous opinion that the states might design to take advantage by it to make themselves masters of the said spanish netherlands their high mightinesses did declare postively and by this letter do voluntarily repeat it that it never was their intention nor ever will be to make use of the said treaty or of their garrisons in the fortified places of the country to prejudice in any manner the commerce of her majestys subjects but that their opinion is that whatever relates to navigation and commerce there ought to be settled on an entire equality that so her majestys subjects may not be charged with higher duties of importation or exportation than theirs to the end commerce may be carried on there by both nations on an equal foot  here the states general acknowledge that whatever relates to navigation and commerce in the spanish netherlands ought to be settled on an entire equality this is owning what her majesty has since claimed to be just and yet that it has not been so is apparent also and in the same letter they acknowledge it again by adding that if there be some articles of the said treaty which without affecting the essentials of it may be thought to want explanation her majesty shall find them willing and ready to treat thereupon with all the facility and condescension that can reasonable be required of them  now however satisfactory such an offer is from the dutch who indeed cannot be supposed to be ignorant of the justice of her majestys demands in this case as not to come to a farther explanation on these heads yet all this adds to and confirms the complaint against the conduct at least of those employed from hence who in behalf of their own country could pass such a treaty and sign such a convention by which it appears were not the dutch willing to explain themselves upon it there was effectually given up to them both the sovereignty and the commerce of the spanish netherlands the last being exclusive of the english there is no doubt to me that this was evident at that time and therefore it is that i cannot place it to the account of ignorance or inadvertency for the duke of marlborough saw into it and therefore how willing soever in other cases to oblige the dutch he had not so little concern for his own safety as not to know a british parliament would certainly one time or other call a treaty so dishonorable and prejudicial to britain in question and therefore no doubt whatever other reasons his grace might have also he thought fit not to be drawn in to set his hand to it but refused to be a party to it though at that time a plenipotentiary from hence but another hand and other management effected it and now the dutch are willing to explain these things to our satisfaction which would admit of many remarks as to the former part of it which i omit because satisfaction will be now obtaind only this cannot in justice to the present ministry and parliament be omitted viz that if this enquiry into these things had not been begun those explanations had never been obtained and the dutch had been left in a capacity when they thought fit to exclude the subjects of britain from all trade and commerce in the spanish netherlands and had been enabled whenever their occasions made it for their purpose to have seized upon the spanish netherlands and have made themselves entire masters thereof so that the preventing these things seems wholly owing to the vigilance of the present ministry and to the vigorous resolutions of the present parliament  there seems indeed one clause in the said letter which some people are very forward here to take hold of insinuating that the dutch complain of being tricked in england into a consent to a negotiation of peace by being put in hopes that after they should do so the other affair of the barrier should be adjusted to their satisfaction the words are these that however having not long since been informed that in england some were of opinion that the said treaty in some articles might be prejudicial to her majestys subjects the commissioned m buys their envoy extraordinary then going to england to inquire what those points were that might be thought grievances and authorized to treat about them with her majestys ministers and to remove it possible the difficulties by all the explanations that should appear necessary which they were put in hopes would not be very hard to do when once they should have consented to concur with her majesty as they did to procure a congress for the negotiation of a general peace but that the misfortune was that the said m buys during his residence in england was not able to finish that affair to reciprocal satisfaction and that it having been remitted to the hague no way has hitherto been found to terminate it there neither though their high mightinesses think they have shown all the readiness to comply with any just expedient that could reasonably be expected from them  this seems to be very ill turned by a party among ourselves and implies as they pretend as if the british court had made light of the matter and promised to adjust it if the dutch would do so and so but that after the dutch had complied and concurred with her majesty to procure a congress for the negotiation of a general peace they could never obtain the promised condition although they had shown all the readiness to comply with any just expedient that could reasonably be expected from them  this is a black charge and had not the dutch with much more integrity than these people anticipated this calumny and given the true reason for their said concurring with her majesty to be their disposition and persuasion of the absolute necessity there was in the present conjuncture for the cultivating and maintaining a good friendship perfect confidence and union between their said states and her majesty which for the better authority i give you also from their own letter that during the whole course of her majestys glorious reign they have had nothing more at heart than to cultivate and maintain with her a good friendship perfect confidence and union and to corroborate them the most they possibly could having always judged them absolutely necessary and especially in the present conjuncture that they likewise judged they could not give a better proof of this their disposition and persuasion than that which they lately gave in agreeing to the proposition which her majesty had caused to be made to them to begin the negotiation of a general peace with the enemy and in concurring with her majesty to facilitate the bringing together of the ministers of all the high allies to the congress at vtrecht  this effectually contradicts what as before is suggested viz that they were induced  to concur with her majesty as they did to procure a congress for the negotiation of a general peace upon their being put in hopes that it would not be very hard to do after they had consented so to concur with her majesty i say this is so contradicted by what is said before that i was tempted to doubt both the said paragraphs could not be in one and the same letter and indeed it seems shocking to any reader that their high mightinesses should say in one part of their letter that they concurred with her majesty to give the best proof of their disposition to cultivate a good friendship perfect confidence and union with her majesty and in another part of the same letter to say that they concurred  with her majesty as they did to procure a congress for the negotiation of a general peace  these considerations being too hard for my understanding are left to the logical discussion of the party here whole talent so eminently lies in equivocation and insignificant railery who when they have chewed it and mumbled it like an ass upon thistles will bring it out the same thorny crabbed inconsistency that they found it  but while we are leaving them to this difficult work it may be needful to look farther for we have yet much more work cut out from holland than in the foregoing piece the states general having received a new brush from the british parliament are very solicitous to wash their negro skin as clean as they can from the imputations which have lain so plainly against them but now they find it more difficult than they did before for till now they had only pamphlets and general clamours to answer such as the suspicions of the people and the information of a few had made loud and which began to make them uneasy these were treated with some contempt by the states and more by their friends here  but the parliament finding more truth in these things than perhaps they expected and much more than the faction pretended thought it required an extraordinary sanction to make them less disputed and thought it just to make them public with an undisputed authority that the people ought to be undeceived and that the quarrels about the truth of fact ought to cease among the people for this reason having caused all the particulars to be exactly and faithfully laid before them by the report of the commissioners of the admiralty and other proper officers and those particulars to be critically examined they deduced from thence the matters of fact as they really were and making all the cases plain in which the government had been imposed upon by their allies and the dutch deficient among others they came to several resolves about the same and drawing those resolves up into general heads referring to the particulars for their demonstration they humbly represented all in an address to her majesty and caused both the said resolves and the address to be printed for the conviction of all her majestys good subjects and to confute and silence a party who as abovesaid had made it their business to ridicule all that had been said of these matters as false and empty notions infused into peoples heads to raise ill blood and create prejudices against the dutch if these things coming forth with such an undisputed authority did a little surprise the world and consequently open the eyes of the people much more would they surprise the states general whose interest it had so long been to have the people of britain kept as ignorant as possible of these matters and finding it absolutely necessary that something should be said to puzzle the cause a little and to furnish their friends with arguments for their defense they issue a paper entitled as follows a memorial serving to prove that the states general of the united netherlands are unjustly charged by the resolutions or votes of the house of commons of the parliament of great britain and by the subsequent address of the said house of commons thereupon presented to her majesty the queen of great britain with having been deficient in diverse respects during the present war in furnishing what according to their quota or contingent they stood engaged for toward carrying on the said war  this is the paper which i come now to examine and in which if i should discover that the states general have really been so far from clearing themselves of the charge so positively laid upon them in parliament that in every part they either directly or tacitly acknowledge it then there will remain little force in the rest of their paper  in considering this new and great affair of the dutch memorial it seems very proper to make as few circumlocutions as possible and come directly to the point our introduction therefore shall consist rather of laying down a list of the particulars which we shall leave out than of what we shall put into the following tract what shall be dropped as foreign to the case in hand and not worth either the authors while to note or the readers to be concerned about as first it shall take up little of our time to animadvert on the insolence unparalleled of a scandalous mercenary who in defiance of a british parliament and while that parliament was actually sitting should have the face to publish the answer or defense of a foreign nation against his own country  if a man have received an affront from another and meets one of his servants and says to him you jack or you thomas pray tell your master i say he is a villain and a rascal will not the servant if he have any manners or sense of his duty say to him sir let him be what he will he is my master and it is not fit for me to tell him so pray employ somebody else on the other hand if the ignorant fellow should have so little wit or manners as to carry this message to his master would not the master say to him let the man be what he will you are an unmannerly rascal for bringing me such a message since you were my servant and not his and would he not very justly cane him and turn him out of his service for his impudence  this case as it is unprecedented unless in the same person who did the like once before so it will be doubly unprecedented in the public justice if he is uncorrected for it nay by how much more the party glory in and boast of having insulted the parliament and the government in this publication by so much the more necessity they bring upon the said parliament to vindicate themselves and punish the persons with their utmost rigor but this is humbly left and submitted to the parliament who no doubt will do themselves and their defender justice in this case  next it shall take up no part of this discourse to enquire whether the dutch have ordered these sheets to be thus published in england or no we are not ignorant how many ways of late the foreign powers concerned in this war have privately endeavored to make themselves and their actings with her majesty popular here appealing at it were from her majesty to her subjects but we shall not suppose however that they are yet arrived to such a contempt of their alliances with her britannick majesty as to appear in an action which derogates so much from the usual civilities due from one ally to another as that they should openly and avowedly make an attempt of this nature  this leads us to consider how prudently the parliament of britain has acted in this case in which perhaps the dutch as subtle a nation as they are and how good soever their politics have been in other cases will be put to it how to behave themselves between the two extremes of owning or disowning this publication of their memorial  the parliament have first stigmatized the paper itself as a false and scandalous libel but in this censure they do not call it the memorial of the states general but a pretended memorial now as the lie is here given by the whole british nation and that most justly also it remains for the dutch to show us how they please to take it if they own the paper and the publication of it here they take the lie aforesaid to themselves and are obliged to fall under the charge hush it up and thereby own in just or resent it which we suppose they will consider of before they go about it on the other side if they take upon them to mention answer or vindicate this paper they own not the paper only but the mean step of causing it to be published in england in especial insult to her majesty and to the parliament of britain then sitting and what evil consequences may follow such a thing must lie at their doors it is true that as the parliament has not thought fit to take it but as a spurious and pretended paper we might very well do so also but as we see it published in all parts of europe as allowed in those prints in holland who are said to write cum privilegio and as it is in these countries styled the answer of the states etc we cannot but treat it as such or at least as an answer for the states if not the answer of the states and that this may be justified by good evidence the reader may observe that our prints after the resentment of the parliament of britain had made it too dangerous for our newsmen to go on with the printing it gave this account april  th hague april    all our public prints published by authority have been and continue full of the states reply to the resolutions of the commons of britain in vindication of their conduct  this we cannot but think gives sufficient authority to a writer whether the states general are concerned in the publication at london or no to suppose them to be the real authors of the paper itself and that it is really the states reply as above and as such we shall therefore consider it  the first thing meet for observation in it is what we ought not by any means to pass over viz that the states general confess the charge acknowledging the fact directly viz that the quotas for sea service were not supplied or as the resolution of the house of commons express it viz that the states general have been desicient in their quotas for sea service in proportion to the numbers of ships provided by her majesty etc  to this the states in their memorial after a very long introduction answer two things first that the quota the british court proposed to fit out particularly in the years   0  and   0  were too many or more than was needful for the service viz more than was needed to make the confederates superior to the french in the mediterranean and that therefore they the states did not think themselves obliged to furnish so many that whereas we should have seventyfour ships the year   0  and seventynine the year   0  they thought the rate of twentyfour ships of their state a proportion against sixty of her majestys and that they concerted it so with admiral mitchel so that it is plain here from this very memorial that the states do no manner of way deny the deficiency itself but evade the force of the charge by disputing the proportions and explaining what they understood by the two fifths to three fifths so insisted on by the parliament and how they ought to be understood by others again they would patch up the deficiency aforesaid by bringing in the number of their men of war employed in the north seas to make up their quota and they express this very subtly as a thing which they think ought to be set against the number of ships employed by the british in the narrow seas this may be considered immediately in their own terms but first it is fit to note that both these arguments confess the charge in fact only offer these explanations or extenuations so that the truth of what the parliament has published in their representation and address stand fast is acknowledged and confessed by the states and needs no farther defense but it comes next of course to see what force this allegation of the dutch as to their ships in the north seas ought to have in this argument and if it appears that these are not and ought not to be reckoned in the proportion above and that they were not reckoned in the first proportion stated and agreed with the states general then all the consequences drawn from those proportions will stand the states in no stead as to any defense to be made by them against the charge in the examination of this we meet with this clause in the state of proportions laid before the house by the lords of the admiralty which stands diametrically opposite to what the states allege in their memorial in these words viz that by the treaties between the queen of great britain and the states general their proportion of the ships of the line of battle to act in conjunction with those of this kingdom in the channel and in and about the mediterranean ought to be three to our five the first observation meet to be made here is that the treaties between the queen of great britain and the states have expressly settled their respective proportions which indeed the memorial seems to evade by alleging that in the grand alliance the respective parties were to assist with all their forces then complimenting britain i do not say flattering with being more powerful than the states they thence deduce the reasonableness of the forces of one being more than the other but the states general would think themselves but ill answered if this way of argument was made use of with them for what is all this to the equality of proportions have not the dutch always as the memorial acknowledges treated every year with the queen upon the just proportions of every years service and has not the queen sent admiral mitchel always to settle that point now the present question is not whether nation is most powerful or whether we are to send more troops than the states general or more ships but whether the proportions being settled annually by agreement the states general have supplied the numbers agreed on by those treaties and sent as many as they agreed to send or no if they have done this then it is true the first settled proportions are of no weight on the other hand if they have not the general treaty of empolying all their forces or any other are equally of no force  now it is apparent that the states general have not supplied their quota of ships for the services for which they agreed to supply them and therefore we on our side justly complain and the account as it was laid before the house by the lords commissioners of the admiralty and by her majesty command is very plain in the case admitting of no dispute wherefore we have for a further and more effectual convincing the advocates for the states general in this case caused it to be annexed at large and is as follows by the lords commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of great britain ireland etc of all her majestys plantatious  her majestys pleasure having been signified to us by mr secretary st john that we should in pursuance of an address from the house of commons prepare an account of the quotas of her majestys ships and those of her allies during this present war and what agreements and conventions have been made for the said quotas and how the same have been observd we do in obedience to her majesty command humbly report  that by the treaties between the queen of great britain and the states general their proportion of the line of battle to act in conjunction with those of this kingdom in the channel and in and about the mediterranean ought to be three to our five  that since the commencement of this war not only sir david mitchel but sir james wishart have been appointed by her majestys command to go to holland and adjust with the states general or their deputies the quotas of their ships of war to act in conjunction with those of her majestys as aforesaid and what was done in pursuance of those treaties was sent to her majestys principal secretary of state to which we humbly refer  and as to the number of ships in the line of battle which the states general each year during the war have joind to her majestys on the forementioned services the same will appear by the following account which has been computed with as much exactness as the nature of the things will bear viz in the year   0  her majesty had forty four ships employed in the channel and soundings of the line of battle and thirty in and about the mediterranean making in the whole seventyfour and they were joined with no more than thirtythree of the states general whereas they should have been fortyfour    0  seventynine of her majestys ships were employed in the aforesaid services and but twentytwo of the states general which should have been fortyseven    0  there was seventyfour of the queens ships and eighteen dutch which should have been fortyfour    0  seventynine of her majestys ships and twentyeight dutch which should have been fortyseven    0  there were but fifteen ships of the dutch acted in conjunction with seventyeight of the queens ships whereas they should have been fortysix    0  to seventytwo of her majestys they were no more than twentyseven of the states general instead of fortythree    0  the states general joined twentyfive ships of the line to sixtynine of her majestys instead of fortytwo    0  no more than eleven ships of the states were joined to sixtyseven of the queens instead of fortythree     0 her majesty had sixtytwo employed in the aforesaid service and the states general appointed no more than thirteen to act in conjunction with them instead of thirtyseven       there was no more than twelve dutch ships instead of thirtyfive appointed to act with fiftynine of the queens ships which as well as those in the preceding year were employed in the mediterranean and not so much as one allotted by the states general to act in concert with those of her majesty against the enemies ships at dunkirk and in the channel  here seems a most convincing proof of the matter of fact now let us see what dutch cunning will bring them off of this for it is a home charge and they will not easily parry the thrust the memorial in truth does not attempt it and therefore the matter of fact as i said before stands granted but they plead then that we have not treated them fairly for say they secondly it must be observed that in the aforesaid account notice is taken only of the ships of this state which in conjunction with those of her majesty were employed in the mediterr anean and the channel and that the north sea which this state during the war has generally had the care of is wholly omitted which mention of those ships only of this state which have acted in conjunction with those of her majesty and the omission of the north sea make so great a difference between the number of ships reckoned by the foresaid account to have been furnished by great britain and that said in the same account to be furnished by this state that probably this difference gave occasion to the forming the foresaid prejudicial resolution or vote of the lower house which possibly would not have been formed might this state have first been heard upon it  this plea needs no farther examination than to look back to the second paragraph of the admiraltys report above where it is affirmed that by the treaties between the queen of great britain and the states general their proportion of ships of the line of battle to act in conjunction with those of this kingdom in the channel and in about the mediterranean ought to be three to our five  it must be surprising to all that read the memorial of the states to hear them insist with so many introductory paragraphs and lay so much stress upon their employing ships in the north seas when it is thus proved that the north seas are quite left out of the question and the treaties they had made were only for ships to be employed in the channel in and about the mediterranean now if they have furnished their quota as agreed upon with us for the channel and the mediterranean though they had sent no ships to the north seas we conceive the commons had made no representation nor had they any reason for there was no mention of it in the agreements of treaties aforesaid but if they have not furnished their quotas for the channel although they had sent an hundred sail to the north seas it had been nothing to the case any more than their sending ships to batavia for the same reason as above the north sea guard being not mentioned in the said treaties and annual agreements to what purpose then is all the long description of the necessity of the sending ships to the north seas and what can be more surprising than to find their high mightinesses arguing what is or was their sentiments against what is and was at that very time concerted and adjusted by them with the persons actually sent over by the queen of great britain for that purpose and which in the very same paragraph they acknowledge was so concerted and adjusted for the more ready assisting the reader to make a full and free judgment hereof the long pretended defense on that head is here copied out of the said memorial and is as follows viz it must be observed that by the seventh article of the treaty of the ninth of june   0  by which that agreement was renewed it is provided that the number of ships of war to be furnished by each for their whole quota according to the said agreement should be regulated every year and that the rendezvous as well as the places where the ships should be employed should likewise be agreed upon every year accordingly this has been concerted yearly her majesty having to that purpose for several years sent over one of her admirals at which times two things principally were taken into deliberation namely the number of shipping and the places where they should be employed upon which the projects on the part of her majesty proposed commonly the employing a greater number than was proposed by this state and also more regard was had to the channel than to the north sea of which north sea not the least mention is made in the aforesaid account of the lords commissioners of the admiralty from which omission it partly comes that they reckon so low what this state has furnished to the seaservice the sentiment of this state upon this subject has always been that the number of ships to be sent yearly to sea ought to be regulated according to the force which it might reasonably be judged the enemy could yearly bring into the mediterranean the channel and the north sea so that men might be morally sure that the fleets and squadrons which on the part of great britain and this state should act in conjunction or seperately would be superior to those of the enemy the term in conjunction or separately was used because it was ever the opinion of this state that her majestys ships and those of this state sent to portugal and the mediterranean ought to act in conjunction and that the security of the channel ought to be left to the care of her majesty and that of the north sea to the care of this state because the channel is best situate for great britain with respect to its countries harbors and commerce and the north sea for this state with respect to its countries harbors and commerce yet so that if unexpectedly the enemy should bring any fleet or considerable squadrons into the channel or into the north sea then the squadrons on both sides in whole or in part according to the circumstances of affairs might join each other  it is observed here the states general first acknowledge in this paragraph of their memorial that both the number of ships to be furnished by each party and the places where those ships should be employed was concerted yearly her majesty having to that purpose for several years sent over one of her admirals nay they repeat it again viz at which times two things principally were taken into deliberation viz the number of shipping and the places where they should be employed we can have no occasion to make answer to this in any other manner than by appeal to the statesgeneral themselves and enquiring then whether in the quotas of ships at those times agreed on and the place where they should be employed any place but the channel and in and about the mediterranean was ever included or incerted if it were then we must give it against the representation of the house of commons and acquit the states general but if not what means all the preamble and circumlocution of this long memorial and to what purpose is it said this or that was the sentiments of the states general the representation and address of the commons and the report of the british admiralty can say nothing to what was or was not the sentiments of the states general but to what was their agreement and what was concerted yearly between the queen of great britain and the states that they may enquire about and that they do represent fairly and faithfully viz that the dutch have not furnished the quotas which they were obliged by treaty to do for the service of the consederates in the channel and in or about the mediterranean what they did in the north seas as being no part of the said agreement the said representation has no ground to meddle with it nor does it take the least notice of it as is supposed for that reason  it may not be foreign to this case to enquire a little here into the reason and equity also of this argument about the north s as service in doing whereof if it shall be found that this service ought not to be thought of in establishing the said quotas of ships as being wholly and solely a work of interest protecting their own commerce fishing etc in which the allies have no concern and that the english had at the same time several squadrons in those seas which were never esteemed part of the said quota on the british side and therefore that the like ought not to be insisted on on the part of the states general then all the argument drawn from these things will fall to the ground and the impressions which those resolutions of the house of commons have made on the people must necessarily remain  it is not questioned at all nor does it seem material to this case but that in the several alliances made between england and the states general they were mutually obliged to assist each other with all their forces but this is so far from taking off the edge of the complaint that it rather fixes and confirms the same for that we allege that the dutch have not assisted with all their forces and to determine the signification of the said term and how the same is to be understood we are to observe that lest it should create hereafter any misunderstanding among the allies the several quotas or proportions of the allies were settled between every the particular nations annually now the parliaments complaint is clear in this nor does the memorial of the states offer one word of answer to it they do not complain in general that the states have not supplied their whole forces but that they have not supplied those several proportions by which their whole forces were by virtue of their subsequent agreement to be understood and this appears from the very memorial itself where their high mightinesses acknowledge it and better proof cannot be desired see their own words  by the seventh article of the treaty of the ninth of june   0  by which that agreement was renewed it is provided that the number of ships of war to be furnished by each for their whole quota according to the said agreement should be regulated every year and that the rendezvous as well as the places where the ships should be employed should likewise be agreed upon every year accordingly this has been concerted yearly her majesty having to that purpose for several years sent over one of her admirals at which times two things principally were taken into deliberation namely the number of shipping and the places where they should be employed  here it is acknowledged by the states that the quotas were adjusted between us and them both as to number of ships and where to be employed there are but two objections which the memorial pretends to make after this the first is whether the ships which the states furnished for the guard of the north seas should not be esteemed part of their quota and secondly whether the number of ships mentioned to be employed by her majesty in the channel and in the mediterranean were necessary these are also their own words to which may be briefly answered first that after they had acknowledged as above is said that the number of ships and places where the same should be employed were every year concerted it can no more be asked whether they were necessary the question rather lies fairly whether the numbers concerted were respectively supplied if there had appeared any subsequent alteration in the face of the war so that if it had seemed to the states less necessary to send so large a number of ships as was agreed it must have been reasonable that a new concert between the allies should have been made and some mutual agreement offered for lessening the said number on both sides but to agree first that such a number on both sides should be supplied and then shortning that number on their side without signifying to the british court that they thought fewer ships enough so that the british should be left to send their full quota as agreed and the states only make an abatement this can be no fair treatment of the british nor is it esteemed fair dealing in our country whatever it may be in holland therefore the complaint of the commons in this case seems very just and is not at all answered by this memorial for that the states general did not supply the number of ships which by their annual agreement was concerted between them and her majesty secondly but say the states we did supply a great squadron in the north seas which ought to be esteemed a part of our proportion and all the reasons given for this way of acting are that such were the sentiments of the statesgeneral yet in another part of the said memorial it is owned and in the report of the commissioners of the admiralty it is expressly said those quotas were settled only for such ships as were to act conjunctly or separately in the channel and the mediterranean but because this argument is of too much value to have it depend upon the dubious construction of terms it may be observed first that there is no parity or equality in this argument for that the concert of proportions of ships to be supplied by us and the states respected only the particular seas in which the power of the french was particularly formidable and where their main fleets were to be expected as in the streights and the channel or on the coasts of portugal and spain and that the british nation have kept great squadrons and fleets out in sundry other parts of the world as the dutch have done in the north sea without reckoning any such ships into the quota or proportions of the fleets to be furnished as before for the carrying on the war such have been the fleets and ships constantly sent to the west indies to st helena to the canaries etc by which it appears that whatever the sentiments of the states of holland have been as above the sentiments of the british court have always been that each ally ought to have supplied their full quota of such ships as were concerted for the service of the war in the channel and in the mediterranean without esteeming such ships as part thereof which they respectively were obliged to furnish for the protection of their commerce in any other part of the world and that this was the real sentiments of the states general as well as of her majesty appears for that in all the ships sent by either of the powers into other parts of the world as into the north seas the baltic the west indies st helena and the like they very seldom acted in conjunction but sent their respective squadrons separately as the necessity of their affairs required nor did those ships act in conjunction on any occasion save only as they found it necessary to take the ships of each other nation under convoy or in their protection and made use of the harbors of each confederate as there might be occasion this is manifest in that notwithstanding the great fleets which the states general have upon all occasions sent to the north seas as is alleged the british court have been obliged also to send annual squadrons to those seas for the safety of their trade as well to russia as to the eastcountry the elbe and the weser as also for the defense of the coast of scotland and ireland which ships though equal if not superior to the numbers sent into those seas by the states general have not been accounted by her majesty as any part of the proportion of ships concerted as abovesaid with the states  this therefore can never be the reason of the report of the commissioners of the admiralty and it is surprising to all those who know the state of those things to hear the memorial say the states general had the care of the north seas as they do when they sum up that part of their case as follows viz it must be observed that in the aforesaid account notice is taken only of the ships of this state which in conjunction with those of her majesty were employed in the mediterranean and the channel and that the north sea which this state during the war has generally had the care of is wholly omitted which two things namely the mention of those ships only of this state which have acted in conjunction with those of her majesty and the omission of the north sea make so great a difference between the number of ships reckoned by the foresaid account to have been furnished by this state that probably this difference gave occasion to the forming the foresaid prejudicial resolution or vote of the lower house which possibly would not have been formed might this state have first been heard upon it  it should seem needful here to enter into an enquiry what number of ships her majesty has from time to time sent into the north seas and how the states general may be said to have had the care of the north seas when it is well known the british trade nay and even often the dutch to archangel have been convoyed out and home by her majestys ships and the coast of scotland the mouth of the baltic and the elbe have been constantly guarded by the british ships  thus by the plainest reasoning in the world the memorial is fallacious for that the desiciencies complained of remain consest by the states themselves the reasons pretended to justify themselves are directly contrary to the concerted proportions and treaties made between the said states general and the queens majesty and this is exactly agreeable to the report of the commissioners of the admiralty and the resolutions of the house of commons  the like fallacious way of arguing appears in the case of the landforces or troops in which still their high mightinesses do not deny the matter of fact alleged in the said address but excuse and extenuate the same by their efforts otherways as particularly they allege an article of their raising troops before us and this they say deserves some compensation that is that they having raised fifty thousand men before us they should be therefore allowed to maintain fewer than they agreed for afterward or to speak plainly that because they were obliged to a quicker armament than the british therefore they were to have leave to break in upon future concert and fail in the numbers they were to bring in afterward this seems no unfair construction of the first clause of the memorial relating to the troops which is as follows  in the first place it must not be omitted to observe on the said estimate that in the general charge for the year   0  the fortyfour thousand nine hundred ninetytwo men which the vnitednetherlands kept up after the peace of ryswick are mixed with the thirtyfour thousand eight hundred sixtysix men which were taken into service immediately after the death of charles the second king of spain and that for the year   0  not only the troops which this state took into service that year but those hired the beginning of the foregoing year are reckoned all together which if put down more distinctly would have shown that this state had reinforced their i roops with above fifty thousand men a considerable time before great britain came to make any particular augmentation which earlier arming to the excessive expense of this state well deserved to be allowed for by some kind of compensation  what can the words deserve some compensation be supposed to signify but that the states general concluded from thence that their future deficiency was to be allowed because of their more arming than the english which any one that remembers the occasion may find other reasons to give for and which the states general themselves seem to acknowledge or at least to hint at which was in short that the parliament and people of england did not come into the measures for the last war or perhaps believe it so necessary at first as the states did and therefore did not vote such large sums for their proportion as the states general required and this they now allege should be made up afterward this is gathered from the following words in the memorial  this state were obliged to be content with greatbritains furnishing in the beginning of the war no more than forty thousand men in the netherlands in so great a disproportion with respect to this state not because there was any convention or agreement made about it or that it was at all reasonable but because no more was consented to by the parliament the reasons of which are probable fresh still in the remembrance of many and at that time the only course this state could take was to burden itself with so great a disproportion and to wait till in the continuance of the war it should be made good to them  this may imply that the states general desired to have this disproportion made good to them afterward by the english but does not prove that it ought to have been made good or that the queen of greatbritian had agreed to make it good much less did it signify that they were thereby entitled to make it good to themselves by a deficiency in such quotas and proportions as they should agree afterward to bring into the field  upon the whole then it seems the sum of the case is this that the dutch have really been deficient in the said quotas but that according to their own sentiments they might lawfully be so notwithstanding express treaties and conventions to the contrary and that these sentiments arise from their thinking fit to make reprizal or stoppage upon england for the dutch coming into the war a year before us and because we did not think fit to come into the alliance sooner they are making us pay for our standing out  more or less than this cannot be made of their long memorial and as to the justice and equity of this the world is left to judge of that affair  the author of this had resolved to add here some remarks about the pretense of carrying on the war with all their forces and the states saying that britain is more powerful and therefore must bring in more forces making themselves judges of who is or is not most powerful but her majestys answer to the states since published has made this so clear and pressed it so close upon the dutch that it seems needless to say any more to that point  finis
