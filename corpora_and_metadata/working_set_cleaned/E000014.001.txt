congress in the year      by childs  peterson in the clerks office of the district court of the united states for the eastern district of pennsylvania iii preface by the american editor the present edition of the commentaries of sir william blackstone has been prepared with especial reference to the use of american lawstudents the main object of the notes selected and original has been to correct any statement in itself erroneous and to explain what might be calculated to mislead in some cases where the text appeared to pass over important topics they have been introduced in order to render the book complete as an institute of legal education besides the editions of archbold christian and chitty which have been republished in this country the editor has drawn largely upon the valuable notes of mr justice coleridge the late english editions by james stewart and robert malcolm kerr—in which all the recent alterations by statutes have been referred to and incorporated—have been freely used and an occasional note will be found from the late abridgment of blackstone by samuel warren and the attention of the student is especially called to the notes added to the last chapter of the work on the rise progress and gradual improvement of the laws of england for valuable sketches by coleridge john william smith stewart warren and kerr of the latest enactments to which the american editor has ventured to add some remarks upon american jurisprudence barron fields analysis—a most important aid to the student in the work of selfexamination—has been added at the end on the whole it is hoped that this edition—the fruit of much care and toil as much in rejecting which does not appear as in adopting which does—may meet the approbation of the profession and the public g s ppiladelphia june      iv preface the following sheets contain the substance of a course of lectures on the laws of england which were read by the author in the university of oxford his original plan took its rise in the year      and notwithstanding the novelty of such an attempt in this age and country and the prejudices usually conceived against any innovations in the established mode of education he had the satisfaction to find—and he acknowledges it with a mixture of pride and gratitude—that his endeavours were encouraged and patronized by those both in the university and out of it whose good opinion and esteem he was principally desirous to obtain the death of mr viner in      and his ample benefactions to the university for promoting the study of the law produced about two years afterwards a regular and public establishment of what the author had privately undertaken the knowledge of our laws and constitution was adopted as a liberal science by general academical authority competent endowments were decreed for the support of a lecturer and the perpetual encouragement of students and the compiler of the ensuing commentaries had the honour to be elected the first vinerian professor in this situation he was led both by duty and inclination to investigate the elements of the law and the grounds of our civil polity with greater assiduity and attention than many have thought it necessary to do and yet all who of late years have attended the public administration of justice must be sensible that a masterly acquaintance with the general spirit of laws and principles of universal jurisprudence combined with an accurate knowledge of our own municipal constitutions their original reason and history hath given a beauty and energy to many modern judicial decisions with which our ancestors were wholly unacquainted if in the pursuit of these inquiries the author hath been able to rectify any errors which either himself or others may have heretofore imbibed his pains will be sufficiently answered and if in some points he is still mistaken the candid and judicious reader will make due allowances for the difficulties of a search so new so extensive and so laborious nov        postscript notwithstanding the diffidence expressed in the foregoing preface no sooner was the work completed but many of its positions were vehemently attacked by zealots of all even opposite denominations religious as well as civil by some with a greater by others with a less degree of acrimony to such of these animadverters as have fallen within the authors notice for he doubts not but some have escaped it he owes at least this obligation that they have occasioned him from time to time to revise his work in respect to the particulars objected to to retract or expunge from it what appeared to be really erroneous to amend or supply it when inaccurate or defective to illustrate and explain it when obscure but where he thought the objections ill founded he hath left and shall leave the book to defend itself being fully of opinion that if his principles be false and his doctrines unwarrantable no apology from himself can make them right if founded in truth and rectitude no censure from others can make them wrong v a memoir of sir william blackstone by the american editor the ambition of posthumous fame is very general if not universal among mankind it is one of the strong arguments for our immortality that we stretch out our desires beyond the brief span of our present existence and live in the future a sad and dreary thought would it be to a man—that of dying unwept by any one unhonoured by any survivor and entirely forgotten as soon as removed from sight if not an actor upon the more prominent theatre of the worlds history within some narrower circle of society—his neighbourhood his friends his family or at least his descendants—every one looks anxiously forward in the hope that his memory will be respectfully cherished his faults and foibles overlooked and excused his virtues adorned in their fairest and loveliest colours whether in that spiritland where our immortal natures still live after their earthly tabernacles have crumbled to their original clay they have any knowledge of or interest in the affairs of the world which they have left behind we do not know it has not been revealed to us from that bourne no traveller has returned the faculties and powers of the soul—especially memory—the strong affections of the heart all belonging to and constituting an inseparable part of its spiritual nature as well as its unwearying activity even while the body reposes in soundest slumber render it to say the least a reasonable conjecture that though engaged in moral and intellectual employments and enjoyments much nobler and purer than earths they are still spectators—interested curious spectators—in the works of gods providence which relate to his moral creation the common superstitions of the people in all ages and countries which may be regarded either as the tradition of an original revelation or the result of a stronglyimpressed innate sentiment are not without weight on such a question such superstitions have intertwined themselves with the earliest poetry they form a part of the legends of childhood in spite of ourselves we are all more or less believers in the communion of spirits the man who has entirely cast off this prejudice or superstition if we please to term it so has lost one restraint which has been known to exert its salutary influence when even the sense of higher accountability has been disregarded we may well fancy then vi a power in departed spirits of watching and tracing the influences of their own lives writings or actions upon those who have come after them if these influences have been for human virtue and happiness the wider and more extended the purer must be the pleasure afforded if they are otherwise they must be the source of bitter unavailing and neverending regrets such considerations may well excite us to the practice of virtuous actions to the cultivation of noble and generous sympathies and emotions a part of their appropriate reward may be the observation hereafter of their widening circles as they spread with their influences for good the name we have borne down to the remotest generation the fame of a lawyer however much he may live in the public eye and however large may seem the space he occupies in the public consideration is in general a very narrow and circumscribed one he is prominently useful in his own day and generation and among his contemporaries he supports and defends the accused and oppressed he maintains the cause of the poor and friendless he succours those that are ready to perish he counsels the ignorant he guides and saves those who are wandering and out of the way and when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings his bones have a tomb of orphans tears wept on them how much untold good is done by an honest wise and generous man in the full practice of this profession which even those to whom he has consecrated his time and thoughts without the hope of adequate compensation never appreciate how often contrary to his own interest does he succeed in calming the surges of passion and leading the bitter partisan to measures of peace and compromise how often does his beneficence possess that best and purest characteristic of the heavenly grace that his right hand knoweth not what his left hand doeth yet—beyond the circle of his own profession the student of which may occasionally meet with a few brief evidences of his learning and industry in print on the pages of some dusty reportbook and pause to spell his name and wonder who he was—posterity will scarcely ever hear of him and his severest efforts and brightest intellectual achievements will sink forever in the night of oblivion the important case of taylor on the demise of atkyns vs horde was argued before lord mansfield and the court of kings bench about one hundred years ago the title to a large estate was at issue knotty and difficult points of old lawlearning were required to be discussed and they were discussed with exhausting research and ability it is not to be doubted that the counsel engaged were the most eminent at the english bar we have a further assurance from the character of some of them mr pratt—afterwards lord camden a name forever associated with english liberty as the dauntless opponent of general warrants and the champion of american colonial rights upon the floor of parliament—mr yorke son of lordchancellor hardwicke the hon charles yorke afterwards lordchancellor are named as of counsel for plaintiff with them were mr caldecot the compiler of the settlement cases opposed to these men there were for the defendant the names of mr knowles mr perrot and mr sergeant prime pratt and yorke having occupied high political vii and judicial positions their lives have been written their characters have been portrayed and will be preserved who were these others deemed worthy to enter the lists and measure lances with them in this important intellectual contest where is their memorial even among the members of that profession of which while they lived they were the pride and ornament besides official and political position which must frequently give character and fame to the lawyer there are some other exceptions—of those who hand down their names within the bounds of their profession by contributing valuable works to its legal literature the legal writings of lord coke have contributed more than his office and influence to this result hale foster gilbert and others may be placed in the same category but that they have largely paid that debt which according to lord bacon every man owes to his profession how soon would the names of fearne hargrave butler preston powell stephen and williams have to be classed with those of knowles perrot and prime there is one english legal writer whose fortune in this respect is peculiar he produced an elementary work—written with so much system and accuracy and in style and language so pure and elegant that it not only at once assumed and has ever since maintained the place of first institute of legal education to all who make the common law of england their special study but became a book of instruction and interest to scholars and gentlemen of all pursuits—which has been for that reason translated into many other tongues that lawyer was sir william blackstone an american author has in like manner illustrated his name by a work which both here and abroad will forever stand alongside and share the enviable fame of that of the illustrious english commentator it is unnecessary to name james kent the father of sir william blackstone was charles blackstone a citizen and silkman of london whose family was from the west of england he was born on the  0th july      his father had died before and he lost his mother at the early age of eleven by the early loss of both parents william and his two brothers charles and henry were thrown upon the care of their maternal uncles charles and henry were educated at winchester under the care of dr bigg who was warden of that school both of them took orders in the church the care and education of william fell to the lot of another uncle—mr thomas bigg an eminent surgeon of london in    0 william then about seven years old was put to school at the charterhouse and in      was by the nomination of sir robert walpole through the influence of another member of his mothers family admitted as a scholar upon its foundation he is said to have been a studious and exemplary boy and to have gained the favour of his masters at the age of fifteen he was at the head of the school and was thought sufficiently advanced to be removed to the university and he was accordingly entered a commoner at pembroke college in oxford on the  0th of november      he was allowed to remain at school until after the   th of december the anniversary commemoration viii of the foundation of the charterhouse in order that he might deliver the customary oration in honour of richard sutton—by which he gained much applause after having been three years prosecuting his studies at this illustrious seat of learning on the  0th november      being then eighteen he entered himself a member of the middle temple and commenced the study of the law he was called to the bar as soon as the probationary period of five years had expired—viz on the   th november      in the early periods of english jurisprudence the inns of court were resorted to by large numbers of young gentlemen not merely to acquire a profession but to complete a liberal education by the study of the laws of their country in the time of fortescue who wrote in the reign of henry vi there are said to have been about eighteen hundred or two thousand students in the inns of court and chancery the number was still very considerable in the time of ben jonson who has left on record his estimate of their influence and character in the dedication of his comedy of every man out of his humour which he inscribed to the noblest nurseries of humanity and liberty in the kingdom the inns of court to characterize a lawschool as the nursery of sound learning and civil liberty is indeed a highlywrought eulogium of the legal profession—a praise however which its history shows to have been well deserved in the inns of chancery the younger students of the law were usually placed learning and studying says fortescue the originals and as it were the elements of the law who profiting therein as they grew to ripeness so were they admitted into the greater inns of the same study called the inns of court the word inns was anciently used to denote townhouses in which the nobility and gentry resided when they were in attendance at court and it is frequently employed by the old poets to denote a spacious and elegant mansion the inns of court were in old french termed hostells in the courtrecords in latin they are called hospitia while diversoria is the name applied to public lodginghouses which are now commonly known as inns the buildings originally purchased for the purposes of these legal societies having been at the time private residences still retained in their new use the ancient names by which they were designated the middle and inner temples were formerly dwellings of the knights templars lincolns and grays inn anciently belonged to the earls of lincoln and gray so the names of the several inns of chancery are taken from the names of their original proprietors—except new inn staple inn which belonged to the merchants of the staple and lion inn which was a common tavern with the sign of the lion there can be no doubt that there was originally provided in these schools some system of instruction for the students competent persons termed readers were appointed to deliver public lectures such men as more coke and holt were chosen as readers they fell into disuse however and before the time of blackstone the student at the inns was left to his own discretion and was even called to the bar after a set time without any examination as to ix his qualification for the exercise of his profession according to the regulations at that time and with some modification still existing every man was entitled to be called to the bar who had paid the fees accustomed and due to the inn at which he had entered and had kept twelve terms a term was kept in a very easy and pleasant way indeed by being present at a certain number of dinners in common—generally five in each term—in presence of the benchers he must have gone nine times through a certain ceremony which is called performing an exercise exercises were performed thus the student was furnished by the steward of the society with a piece of paper on which was supposed to be written an argument on some point of law but owing to the negligence of successive copyists the writing came at last to consist of a piece of legal jargon wholly unintelligible when afterdinner grace had been said the student advanced to the barristers table and commenced reading from this paper upon which one of the barristers present made him a slight bow took the paper from him and told him that it was quite sufficient throwing aside this piece of antiquated and ridiculous mummery we may say then that practically all that was required as a qualification for the english bar was that the applicant had eaten sixty dinners at certain intervals we have not been informed under whose advice or by whose direction blackstone prosecuted his course of legal studies in the middle temple he has himself depicted in a very lively manner the dangers and difficulties of such a course—we may appeal to the experience of every sensible lawyer whether any thing can be more hazardous or discouraging than the usual entrance on the study of the law a raw and inexperienced youth in the most dangerous season of life is transplanted on a sudden into the midst of allurements to pleasure without any restraint or check but what his own prudence can suggest with no public direction in what course to pursue his inquiries no private assistance to remove the distresses and difficulties which will always embarrass a beginner in this situation he is expected to sequester himself from the world and by a tedious lonely process to extract the theory of law from a mass of undigested learning or else by an assiduous attendance on the courts to pick up theory and practice together sufficient to qualify him for the ordinary run of business we may conjecture that blackstone began with finch and then proceeded to set upon the rough mines of legal treasure to be found in coke upon littleton as well as to look into bracton glanville fleta and the reports it was somewhat better than when not quite two centuries before in      sir henry spelman so graphically described it as linguam peregrinam aïalectum barbarum methodum inconcinnum molem non ingentem solum sed perpetuis humeris sustinendam the young student whose career we are to sketch little thought that in the design of providence he was the engineer selected to make a new road through this wild and almost impassable country and that he would do so with so much skill and judgment and at the same time adorn its sides and environs with so green and rich a landscape as to convert the journey from a wearisome toil x to an attractive pleasure for almost a century the commentaries have been the first book of the student of law and whatever criticisms have been or may be made upon their learning or accuracy the fact is that no lawyer fails to make them a part of his course of study sooner or later at oxford he had been a diligent student before he was twenty he had compiled a treatise on the elements of architecture with plans and drawings from his own pen he devoted a large portion of his time to elegant literature and had cultivated to a considerable extent the art of poetry even at school he had shown poetic ability by some verses on milton for which he was rewarded with a gold medal upon betaking himself to the study of the law he appears to have considered it necessary to abandon this employment he wrote the lawyers farewell to his muse which was afterwards printed in dodsleys miscellanies—a poem exhibiting a cultivated taste and a chastened fancy as well as great command of language afterwards in      he wrote an elegy on the death of frederick prince of wales which was published in the oxford collection judging from these pieces it is perhaps not a subject of regret that he relinquished poetry nor are we tempted to exclaim as pope did of lord mansfield—   how sweet an ovid murray was our boast   how many martials were in pulteney lost it has however been well remarked that to his early predilection for poetry we may reasonably attribute the formation of that exquisite style and method with which he afterwards embellished and illustrated the law for nothing so well can teach us that propriety of expression that felicity of illustration and that symmetry of method by which the most abstruse subject may be rendered clear and delightful as the study of the works of those who may be styled the masters of language it is not uncommon to hear the expression the law is a jealous mistress it is true that this profession like all others demands of those who would succeed in it an earnest and entire devotion it must be the main business of the student he must love it but it is not inconsistent with all this that he should still pursue his classical reading—that he should maintain a constant acquaintance and familiarity with those authors in every tongue who by the unanimous award of time are the standards of taste and eloquence a man may become a first rate practitioner or scrivener by devoting himself exclusively to professional reading and if money be his whole object with great success but if his aim be—as it ought to be—higher then liberal studies will be found as necessary to make the truly great and accomplished lawyer as any other it is not the mere gathering of flowers in devious bypaths but of rich and nourishing fruit which gives tone and vigour to the moral and intellectual man the old partition of time which even lord coke has sanctioned by his authority for the good spending of the day assigned six hours of the twentyfour to the sacred muses—   sex horas somno totidem des legibus æquis   quatuor orabis des epulisque duas   quod superest ultra sacris largire camænis xi previously to blackstones call to the bar he had removed from pembroke to allsouls and in june      had become a fellow of the latter college allsouls was celebrated for lawyers and lord northington and chiefjustice willes were fellows of this college in      he graduated bachelor of civil law after his admission to the bar he was condemned like the great majority of all who adopt this profession to undergo a long and trying novitiate from      to    0 he only reports himself to have been engaged in two cases and those so unimportant that they are not mentioned in any other reportbook happy are those who adopt as their motto ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito—who seize this as the favourable time for close observation of men and things as well as for an extended and thorough course of professional reading—remembering that the mower loses no time while he is whetting his scythe—but being careful not to sink into the mere recluse and bookworm our author appears to have attempted this happy middle way but at the same time hope so long deferred made his heart sick and it has been noticed that though from his call to the bar until michaelmas term    0 he regularly attended the court of kings bench and took notes of cases his diligence relaxed and latterly the only cases noted are those concerning the universities in whose affairs he always took an especial interest he made the acquaintance however and secured the friendship during this time of some of the most eminent men in the profession who appear to have discovered in him that merit which he only wanted the opportunity to display to all one of these was william murray afterwards earl of mansfield upon a vacancy in the professorship of civil law in the university of oxford mr murray introduced mr blackstone to the duke of newcastle then chancellor of the university and warmly recommended him as entirely able to fill the vacant chair for his grace however this was not enough unless he could rely on his support in favour of the administration to ascertain the political principles of blackstone he said to him sir i can rely upon the judgment of your friend mr murray as to your giving lawlectures in a style most beneficial to the students and i dare say i may safely rely on you whenever any thing in the political nemisphere is agitated in the university that you will exert yourself in our behalf the answer was your grace may be assured that i will discharge my duty in giving lawlectures to the best of my poor ability ay ay replied his grace and your duty in the other branch too mr blackstone coolly bowed and a few days after dr jenner was appointed professor mr blackstone passed much of his time in oxford and took an active interest in the affairs of the university he was elected bursar or treasurer of his college finding the muniments in a confused state with considerable research and labour he made a new arrangement of them he drew up a dissertation upon the method of keeping the accounts with a view to render them more simple and intelligible—a copy of which is still preserved for the benefit of his successors in the bursarship he took a lively interest in the codrington library exerted himself actively to secure the completion of the building xii and formed a new arrangement and classification of the books in may      as a small reward for his services and to afford him further opportunities of advancing the interests of the college he was appointed steward of their manors in the same year on the resignation of his uncle seymour richmond esq he was elected recorder of the borough of wallingford in berkshire and received the kings approbation on the  0th of may on the   th of april    0 he commenced doctor of civil law and thereby became a member of the convocation about this time he published an essay on collateral consanguinity the design of the work was to attack the claims of those who on the ground of kindred with archbishop chichele the founder of allsouls asserted a right of being elected in preference to all others into that society he undertook to prove that as the archbishop who by the canons could not lawfully marry never had any legitimate lineal descendants the great lapse of time since his death by the rules both of the civil and canon law had put an end to all collateral relationship—or in other words that all mankind might be presumed equally akin to the founder the college acted on this doctrine but archbishop secker in      as visitor reversed their decision seckers successor archbishop cornwallis chose blackstone one of his assessors and with his assistance and that of dr hay an eminent civilian formed a regulation which without entirely setting aside all claims founded on the express words of the collegestatutes limited the number of the founders kin who could be admitted—a regulation which in a great measure removed the inconvenience and gave satisfaction on all sides it was about the year    0 that blackstone first began to plan his lectures on the laws of england he despaired of success at the bar and determined to confine himself to his fellowship and an academical life continuing the practice of his profession as provincial counsel in michaelmas term      he delivered his first course at oxford whether from the novelty of the subject or the reputation of the lecturer his first course was numerously attended nor did the interest flag such was the elegance of style and popular character of the course that attendance soon became the fashion in      he found it worth while from the number attending to publish his analysis of the laws of england for the use of his hearers it is founded on a similar work by sir matthew hale with some alterations not generally regarded as improvements in july      he was appointed one of the delegates of the clarendon press he entered upon this office with that determination to do his whole duty which characterized him in every other situation in which he was placed he found that abuses had crept into that trust and in order to obtain a clearer insight into the matter and to be better qualified to enter upon the task of correcting them he made himself master of the mechanical art of printing he proposed a valuable reform which he had the pleasure of seeing successfully put in execution much to the advantage of the university he wrote a small tract on the management of the university press which he left for the use of his successors in that office in      he was elected by the surviving visitors of michels new foundation in queens college into that body there had been xiii a long dispute between the members of the old and the new foundation here again he exerted himself successfully and principally through his instrumentality this donation became a valuable acquisition to the college as well as an ornament to the university by the completion of that handsome pile of buildings towards the high street which for many years had been little better than a confused heap of ruins dr blackstone drew up a body of statutes for the regulation of the endowment which was confirmed by act of parliament in the year      mr viner having bequeathed to the university of oxford a considerable sum of money and the copyright of his abridgment of law for the purpose of instituting a professorship of common law with fellowships and scholarships dr blackstone was on the  0th of october      unanimously elected first vinerian professor he lost no time in entering upon his duties and on the   th of the same month delivered his introductory lecture on the study of the law—certainly if no sketch had previously existed a most remarkable composition to be prepared in so short a period of time at the request of the vicechancellor and heads of houses he published this introductory and afterwards prefixed it to his commentaries his lectures soon became celebrated throughout the kingdom he was requested to read them to the prince of wales afterwards george iii but being at that time engaged with a numerous class of pupils at oxford whom he did not think it right to leave he declined the honour however he transmitted copies for the princes perusal who in return sent him a handsome present in      he had resumed his attendance at westminster coming up to town every winter and showing himself in court each michaelmas and hilary term—for the purpose doubtless of making himself known he does not record however that he was engaged in any cause in june      he resigned his offices of assessor in the vicechancellors court and steward of allsouls manors and purchased chambers in the temple where he came to reside he did not appear in court until trinity term    0 nor indeed does it seem that he ever acquired much celebrity as an advocate his principal practice was as a chamber counsel that he was commanding notice and regard in the profession appears from the fact that lord chiefjustice willes and mr justice bathurst invited him to take the coif which he declined—probably from economical reasons the expense accompanying that honour was considerable and in that which blackstone felt to be more his professional line the advantages and privileges of the order—principally then the monopoly of the practice at the bar of the common pleas—were not sufficient to counterbalance its expense and inconvenience in the same year      he published two small pieces relative to the university the one entitled reflections on the opinions of messrs pratt morton and wilbraham relating to lord litchfields disqualification who was then a candidate for the chancellorship the other a case for the opinion of counsel on the right of the university to make new statutes in november      he published a new edition of the great charter and charter of the forest and also a tract on the law of descents in feesimple xiv as to the former while the mechanical execution reflected great honour on the author as the principal reformer of the clarendon press from which no volume had ever before issued equal in beauty to this the work itself added materially to his former reputation as a lawyer and antiquary it led him however into an unpleasant controversy with dr lyttelton dean of exeter afterwards bishop of carlisle in regard to the authenticity of an ancient roll containing the great charter and the charter of the forest belonging to lord lyttelton which however blackstone did not consider an original the first cause of any interest which he argued was that of robinson vs bland in trinity term    0 the question was whether a gamingdebt contracted in france could be recovered in england it is to be found reported   w blacks           burr  0   his argument is certainly elaborate and ingenious the next cause in which he appears to have been engaged was in a legal point of view decidedly the most interesting that ever came before the courts—namely the commonlaw right of literary property it was the case of tonson vs collins   sir w blacks  0      blackstones admirable argument is to be found at p     after this it would be tedious and uninteresting to trace his connection with other important cases at the bar in      the appointment of chiefjustice of the common pleas for ireland was offered to him but declined in march of the same year he was returned to parliament for hindon in wiltshire and on may  th received a patent of precedence on the  th may      he married the daughter of james clitherow esq of boston house in the county of middlesex having by this marriage vacated his fellowship of allsouls he was on the   th of july      appointed principal of new inn hall by the earl of westmoreland then chancellor of oxford this appointment besides the rank it gave him in the university assured him an agreeable residence during the delivery of his lectures in      he collected and republished several of his pieces under the title of law tracts in two volumes octavo in      he was appointed solicitorgeneral to the queen and elected about the same time a bencher of the middle temple in      appeared the first volume of the commentaries—twelve years after the delivery of his original lectures and the other three volumes were published in the course of the four succeeding years in      he resigned the vinerian professorship and at the same time the principality of new inn hall he had hoped that the professorship might be permanently connected with some college or hall as mr viner had contemplated and thus a permanent settlement in oxford be rendered agreeable but this plan was rejected in convocation and thus his views of a lasting settlement disappointed in      he was returned to parliament for the borough of westbury in wiltshire and took part in the debates relative to the election of john wilkes when his adversaries observed and pointed out an inconsistency between his position and the doctrine laid down in his commentaries on the subject he xv published a pamphlet on the subject which drew upon him severe sarcasms from the author of junius in the same year dr priestley animadverted on his positions in the commentaries relative to offences against the doctrine of the established church and dr furneaux addressed him some letters on his exposition of the toleration act he published an answer to dr priestley and in subsequent editions modified the passages in which errors and inaccuracies had been pointed out he was offered the solicitorgeneralship by lord north in january    0 on the resignation of dunning he accepted however the position of a judge of the common pleas on the resignation of mr justice clive he was of course called to the degree of sergeant and gave rings with the motto secundis dubiisque rectus but mr justice yates being desirous to retire to use blackstones own words into the court of common pleas i consented to exchange with him and accordingly february   th i kissed his majestys hand on being appointed a judge of the kings bench and received the honour of knighthood sir joseph yates did not long survive his retirement for on the whitsunday following he was taken ill at church and died on thursday following to the great loss of the public and the court of common pleas in particular wherein he sat one term only on this event sir william blackstone likewise retired into the court of common pleas which says burrow he was always understood to have in view whenever opportunity offered sir william blackstone maintained the reputation he had previously acquired by his performance of his duties on the bench there are several very elaborate judgments of his in his own reports upon important and difficult questions which display his ability and research to great advantage the court of common pleas during the time of blackstone differed in opinion only upon two cases in both he dissented the first was scott vs shepherd   w bl     relative to the distinction between actions of trespass and on the case the other goodright dem rolfe vs harwood   w bl     in which the judgment of the common pleas was unanimously reversed by the kings bench and that reversal confirmed by the house of lords upon the opinions of the barons of the exchequer the opinion of sir william blackstone in the celebrated case of perrin vs blake   w bl     has been always highly esteemed as a most ingenious and able view of the knotty question which arose in that case and has attained a very just celebrity it may well be doubted whether mr roscoe is sustained by the facts in the opinion which he has so confidently expressed—that after the publication of the commentaries the legal acquirements of blackstone rather declined than advanced he had purchased shortly after his marriage a villa called priory place in wallingford he exerted himself with his accustomed activity in the promotion of every plan for the improvement of his neighbourhood not only substantially in the opening of roads and building of bridges but ornamentally in the rebuilding of that handsome fabric st peters church such were his employments at home in london besides the duties of his public post he was generally engaged in some scheme of public utility in the latter part xvi of his life he devoted much time to the consideration of the subject of prisondiscipline he exerted himself in conjunction with john howard to procure an act of parliament for the establishment of penitentiary houses near london the objects of which should be to seclude the criminals from their former associates to separate those of whom hopes might be entertained from those who were desperate to teach them useful trades to accustom them to habits of industry to give them religious instruction and to provide them with a recommendation to the world and the means of obtaining an honest livelihood after the expiration of the term of their imprisonment the statute    geo iii c    was accordingly passed and though it did not produce all the beneficial effects that were expected from it it led the way to more just and rational views of prisondiscipline in one of his charges to a grand jury he referred to the establishment of penitentiaries under this act in the following terms—in these houses the convicts are to be separately confined during the intervals of their labours debarred from all incentives to debauchery instructed in religion and morality and forced to work for the benefit of the public imagination cannot figure to itself a species of punishment in which terror benevolence and reformation are more happily blended together what can be more dreadful to the riotous the libertine the voluptuous the idle delinquent than solitude confinement sobriety and constant labour yet what can be more truly beneficial solitude will awaken reflection confinement will banish temptation sobriety will restore vigour and labour will beget a habit of honest industry while the aid of a religious instructor may implant new principles in his heart and when the date of his punishment is expired will conduce both to his temporal and eternal welfare such a prospect as this is surely well worth the trouble of an experiment he indulged also in literary labours to some extent the only fruits of these however are an account of the dispute between addison and pope communicated to dr kippis and by him published in the biographia britannica in the life of addison and some notes upon shakspeare which are published in malones edition of    0 marked by the final letter of his name he did not however long continue to enjoy this life of quiet usefulness honour and happiness sedentary employments such as those in which he delighted are never conducive to health as he advanced in age he became corpulent and was occasionally visited by gout dropsy and vertigo about christmas      he was seized with a violent shortness of breath which his physicians attributed to his dropsical habit and to water on the chest and their prescriptions gave him a temporary relief he was able to come to town to attend hilary term—when he was again attacked in a more formidable shape chiefly in his head which induced a drowsiness and stupor that baffled all the skill of his medical attendants after lying in a state of insensibility for several days he expired at his house in lincolns inn fields on the   th of february    0 being in the fiftyseventh year of his age he was buried at st peters church wallingford—his friend dr barrington bishop of llandaff officiating at his funeral xvii he had nine children of whom seven survived him henry blackstone the reporter was his nephew and died from the effects of overexertion in his profession of his sons james enjoyed nearly the same university preferments as his father he was fellow of allsouls principal of new inn hall vinerian professor deputy high steward and assessor in the vicechancellors courts he died in      the notes of decisions which he had collected while at the bar and on the bench and which he had himself prepared for the press were published after his death in two volumes folio agreeably to a direction in his will they seem to be only such as he had selected out of many from his rough notes either as being of a more interesting nature or as containing some essential point of law or practice or perhaps such only particularly for the first few years as he had taken the most accurate notes of they were published under the superintendence of his executor and brotherinlaw james clitherow esq prefaced by a sketch of his life from which the facts contained in this memoir have been principally taken having now given says mr clitherow a faithful and it is hoped not too prolix a detail of the life of this great man from his cradle to his grave it will be expected that it should be followed by the outlines at least of his character a hard task for the pen of a friend to do justice to the merits of such a character without incurring the imputation of flattery is as difficult as to touch on its imperfections and such the most perfect human characters have with truth and delicacy in his public line of life he approved himself an able upright impartial judge perfectly acquainted with the laws of his country and making them the invariable rule of his conduct as a senator he was averse to party violence and moderate in his sentiments not only in parliament but at all times and on all occasions he was a firm supporter of the true principles of our happy constitution in church and state—on the real merits of which few men were so well qualified to decide he was ever an active and judicious promoter of whatever he thought useful or advantageous to the public in general or to any particular society or neighbourhood he was connected with and having not only a sound judgment but the clearest ideas and the most analytical head that any man perhaps was ever blessed with these qualifications joined to an unremitting perseverance in pursuing whatever he thought right enabled him to carry many beneficial plans into execution which probably would have failed if they had been attempted by other men he was a believer in the great truths of christianity from a thorough investigation of its evidence attached to the church of england from conviction of its excellence his principles were those of its genuine members—enlarged and tolerant his religion was pure and unaffected and his attendance on its public duties regular and those duties always performed with seriousness and devotion his professional abilities need not be dwelt upon they will be universally acknowledged and admired as long as his works shall be read or in other xviii words as long as the municipal laws of this country shall remain an object of study and practice and though his works will only hold forth to future generations his knowledge of the law and his talents as a writer there was hardly any branch of literature he was unacquainted with he ever employed much time in reading and whatever he had read and once digested he never forgot he was an excellent manager of his time and though so much of it was spent in an application to books and the employment of his pen yet this was done without the parade or ostentation of being a hard student it was observed of him during his residence at college that his studies never appeared to break in upon the common business of life or the innocent amusements of society—for the latter of which few men were better calculated being possessed of the happy faculty of making his own company agreeable and instructive whilst he enjoyed without reserve the society of others melancthon himself could not have been more rigid in observing the hour and minute of an appointment during the years in which he read his lectures at oxford it could not be remembered that he had ever kept his audience waiting for him even for a few minutes as he valued his own time he was extremely careful not to be instrumental in squandering or trifling away that of others who he hoped might have as much regard for theirs as he had for his indeed punctuality was in his opinion so much a virtue that he could not bring himself to think perfectly well of any who were notoriously defective in it the virtues of his private character less conspicuous in their nature and consequently less generally known endeared him to those he was more intimately connected with and who saw him in the more retired scenes of life he was notwithstanding his contracted brow owing in a great measure to his being very nearsighted a cheerful agreeable and facetious companion he was a faithful friend an affectionate husband and parent and a charitable benefactor to the poor—possessed of generosity without affectation bounded by prudence and economy the constant accurate knowledge he had of his income and expenses the consequence of uncommon regularity in his accounts enabled him to avoid the opposite extremes of meanness and profusion being himself strict in the exercise of every public and private duty he expected the same attention to both in others and when disappointed in his expectation was apt to animadvert with some degree of severity on those who in his estimate of duty seemed to deserve it this rigid sense of obligation added to a certain irritability of temper derived from nature and increased in his latter years by a strong nervous affection together with his countenance and figure conveyed an idea of sternness which occasioned the heavy but unmerited imputation among those who did not know him of ill nature but he had a heart as benevolent and as feeling as man ever possessed a natural reserve and diffidence which accompanied him from his earliest youth and which he could never shake off appeared to a casual observer xix though it was only appearance like pride—especially after he became a judge when he thought it his duty to keep strictly up to forms which as he was wont to observe are now too much laid aside and not to lessen the respect due to the dignity and gravity of his office by any outward levity of behaviour in short it may be said of him as the noble historian lord clarendon said of mr selden if he had some infirmities with other men they were weighed down with wonderful and prodigious abilities and excellencies in the other scale  such is the testimony of a friend and kinsman to the character of sir william blackstone partial no doubt in some respects but on the whole it bears on its face the marks of an honest effort to tell the truth—not to conceal what appeared to be unlovely we may accept it with the more confidence as truthful and reliable there may have been concludes mr welsby lives of eminent english judges more shining characters of whom we read with deeper interest but there have been few men more useful in their sphere few whose example we can contemplate more profitably few who better realized the wish so happily expressed by himself—   untainted by the guilty bribe   uncursed amidst the harpy tribe   no orphans cry to wound my ear   my honour and my conscience clear   thus may i calmly meet my end—   thus to the grave in peace descend of the commentaries as an institute of legal education very different opinions have been expressed but with one or two exceptions there is a concurrent admiration of their style and method when the illustrious contemporary of blackstone—lord mansfield—was asked to point out the books proper for the perusal of a student of the law that great man bore this emphatic testimony to their value—till of late i could never with any satisfaction to myself answer that question but since the publication of mr blackstones commentaries i can never be at a loss there your son will find analytical reasoning diffused in a pleasing and perspicuous style there he may imbibe imperceptibly the first principles on which our excellent laws are founded and there he may become acquainted with an uncouth crabbed author coke upon littleton who has disappointed many a tyro but who cannot fail to please in a modern dress one of his most stern and unrelenting critics—jeremy bentham—himself a jurist and fundamentally opposed to blackstone in his general views and principles of government thus speaks of the style in which the commentaries were written—he it is who first of all institutional writers has taught jurisprudence to speak the language of the scholar and the gentleman put a polish upon that rugged science cleansed her from the dust and cobwebs of the office and if he has not enriched her with that precision which is drawn only from the sterling treasury of the sciences has decked her out to advantage from the toilet of classic erudition enlivened her with metaphors and allusions and sent her abroad in some xx measure to instruct and in still greater measure to entertain the most miscellaneous and even the most fastidious societies the merit to which as much perhaps as to any this work stands indebted is the enchanting harmony of its numbers it is easy says mr justice coleridge to point out their faults and their general merits of lucid order sound and clear exposition and a style almost faultless in its kind are also easily perceived and universally acknowledged but it requires perhaps the study necessarily imposed upon an editor to understand fully the whole extent of praise to which the author is entitled his materials should be seen in their crude and scattered state the controversies examined of which the result only is shortly given what he has rejected what he has forborne to say should be known before his learning judgment taste and above all his total want of selfdisplay can be justly appreciated lord avonmore has said he it was who first gave to the law the air of a science he found it a skeleton and clothed it with life colour and complexion he embraced the cold statue and by his touch it grew into youth health and beauty sir william jones one of the most accomplished scholars the legal profession can boast of having produced and an ornament not to that profession alone but to human nature gives his opinion in these words—his commentaries are the most correct and beautiful outline that ever was exhibited of any human science but they alone will no more form a lawyer than a general map of the world how accurately and elegantly soever it may be delineated will make a geographer if indeed all the titles which he professed only to sketch in elementary discourses were filled up with exactness and perspicuity englishmen might hope at length to possess a digest of their laws which would leave but little room for controversy except in cases depending upon their particular circumstances—a work which every lover of humanity and peace must anxiously wish to see accomplished to these many similar authorities might be added but we may be allowed to subjoin the testimony of the distinguished american commentator chancellor kent—he blackstone is justly placed at the head of all the modern writers who treat of the general elementary principles of law by the excellence of his arrangement the variety of his learning the justness of his taste and the purity and elegance of his style he communicated to those subjects which were harsh and forbidding in the pages of coke the attraction of a liberal science and the embellishments of polite literature the second and third volumes of the commentaries are to be thoroughly studied and accurately understood what is obsolete is necessary to illustrate that which remains in use and the greater part of the matter in these volumes is law at this day and on this side of the atlantic in opposition to this stand mr ritso and mr austin the former in his curious and useful introduction to the study of coke upon littleton and the latter in his outlines of lectures on the province of jurisprudence they deny to sir william blackstone all merit as an institutional writer and even condemn his style as unfitted to the subject and meretricious his manner says mr austin is not the manner of those classical roman jurists who are xxi always models of expression though their meaning be never so faulty it differs from their unaffected yet apt and nervous style as the tawdry and flimsy dress of a milliners doll from the graceful and imposing nakedness of a grecian statue mr ritso is an idolater of lord coke and unwilling that any book should share in the honours of the institutes much less displace it as a first book in the hands of the professional student mr austin is an enthusiastic benthamite his associations have been altogether with codes and systems what other arrangement he would have made of the common law of england than that followed by blackstone and hale can only be conjectured but the probability is that it would not have been adapted to the science as it practically existed and would have been inconvenient because artificial the common law is not a strait canal cut by the art of civil engineers but a mighty river its head lost in the sands of antiquity which has sought and made its own channel and that the most natural and the best though occasionally requiring to be improved by legislative dams and embankments it is not difficult to arrive at a just conclusion between these conflicting opinions blackstone is not an authority in the law in the same sense in which littleton or his commentator lord coke is he has fallen into some errors and inaccuracies—not however so many nor so important that the student ought to have his confidence in it as an institute at all impaired in fact these errors and inaccuracies have been for the most part pointed out and corrected in the modern editions there is certainly truth in the charge brought against blackstone of overweening admiration of the british constitution but that is not likely to mislead an american student we can sympathize with his panegyric of the free spirit and general justice of the common law we claim it as our birthright and boast of it as the substratum of our own jurisprudence as an elementary book however it may be enough to say that the whole body of american lawyers and advocates with very few exceptions since the revolution have drawn their first lessons in jurisprudence from the pages of blackstones commentaries and no more modern work has succeeded as yet in superseding it xxii xxiii xxx xxxi   introduction of the study nature and extent of the laws of england section i on the study of the law† mr vicechancellor and the gentlemen of the university the general expectation of so numerous and respectable an audience the novelty and i may add the importance of the duty required from this chair must unavoidably be productive of great diffidence and apprehensions in him who has the honour to be placed in it he must be sensible how much will depend upon his conduct in the infancy of a study which is now first adopted by public academical authority which has generally been reputed however unjustly of a dry and unfruitful nature and of which the theoretical elementary parts have hitherto received a very moderate share of cultivation he cannot but reflect that if either his plan of instruction be crude and injudicious or the execution of it lame and superficial it will cast a damp upon the farther progress of this most useful and most rational branch of learning and may defeat for a time the    publicspirited design of our wise and munificent benefactor and this he must more especially dread when he feels by experience how unequal his abilities are unassisted by preceding examples to complete in the manner he could wish so extensive and arduous a task since he freely confesses that his former more private attempts have fallen very short of his own ideas of perfection and yet the candour he has already experienced and this last transcendent mark of regard his present nomination by the free and unanimous suffrage of a great and learned university an honour to be ever remembered with the deepest and most affectionate gratitude these testimonies of your public judgment must entirely supersede his own and forbid him to believe himself totally insufficient for the labour at least of this employment one thing he will venture to hope for and it certainly shall be his constant aim by diligence and attention to atone for his other defects esteeming that the best return which he can possibly make for your favourable opinion of his capacity will be his unwearied endeavours in some little degree to deserve it the science thus committed to his charge to be cultivated methodized and explained in a course of academical lectures is that of the laws and constitution of our own country a species of knowledge in which the gentlemen of england have been more remarkably deficient than those of all europe besides in most of the nations of the continent where the civil or imperial law under different modifications is closely interwoven with the municipal laws of the land no gentleman or at least no scholar thinks his education is completed till he has attended a course or two of lectures both upon the institutes of justinian and   the local constitutions of his native soil under the very eminent professors that abound in their several universities and in the northern parts of our own island where also the municipal laws are frequently connected with the civil it is difficult to meet with a person of liberal education who is destitute of a competent knowledge in that science which is to be the guardian of his natural rights and the rule of his civil conduct    nor have the imperial laws been totally neglected even in the english nation a general acquaintance with their decisions has ever been deservedly considered as no small accomplishment of a gentleman and a fashion has prevailed especially of late to transport the growing hopes of this island to foreign universities in switzerland germany and holland which though infinitely inferior to our own in every other consideration have been looked upon as better nurseries of the civil or which is nearly the same of their own municipal law in the mean time it has been the peculiar lot of our admirable system of laws to be neglected and even unknown by all but one practical profession though built upon the soundest foundations and approved by the experience of ages far be it from me to derogate from the study of the civil law considered apart from any binding authority as a collection of written reason no man is more thoroughly persuaded of the general excellence of its rules and the usual equity of its decisions nor is better convinced of its use as well as ornament to the scholar the divine the statesman and even the common lawyer but we must not carry our veneration so far as to sacrifice our alfred and edward to the manes of theodosius and justinian we must not prefer the edict of the prætor or the rescript of the roman emperor to our own immemorial customs or the sanctions of an english parliament unless we can also prefer the despotic monarchy of rome and byzantium for whose meridians the former were calculated to the free constitution of britain which the latter are adapted to perpetuate without detracting therefore from the real merits which abound in the imperial law i hope i may have leave to assert that if an englishman must be ignorant of either the one or the other he had better be a stranger to the roman than the english institutions for i think it an undeniable position that a competent knowledge of the laws of that society    in which we live is the proper accomplishment of every gentleman and scholar an highly useful i had almost said essential part of liberal and polite education and in this i am warranted by the example of ancient rome where as cicero informs usa the very boys were obliged to learn the twelve tables by heart as a carmen necessarium or indispensable lesson to imprint on their tender minds an early knowledge of the laws and constitution of their country  but as the long and universal neglect of this study with us in england seems in some degree to call in question the truth of this evident position it shall therefore be the business of this introductory discourse in the first place to demonstrate the utility of some general acquaintance with the municipal law of the land by pointing out its particular uses in all considerable situations of life some conjectures will then be offered with regard to the causes of neglecting this useful study to which will be subjoined a few reflections on the peculiar propriety of reviving it in our own universities and first to demonstrate the utility of some acquaintance with the laws of the land let us only reflect a moment on the singular frame and polity of that land which is governed by this system of laws a land perhaps the only one in the universe in which political or civil liberty is the very end and scope of the constitutionb this liberty rightly understood consists in the power of doing   whatever the laws permitc  which is only to be effected by a general conformity of all orders and degrees to those equitable rules of action by which the meanest individual is protected from the insults and oppression of the greatest as therefore every subject is interested in the preservation of the laws it is incumbent upon every man to be acquainted with those at least with which he is immediately concerned lest he incur the censure as well as inconvenience of living in society without knowing the obligations which it lays him under and thus much may suffice for    persons of inferior condition who have neither time nor capacity to enlarge their views beyond that contracted sphere in which they are appointed to move but those on whom nature and fortune have bestowed more abilities and greater leisure cannot be so easily excused these advantages are given them not for the benefit of themselves only but also of the public and yet they cannot in any scene of life discharge properly their duty either to the public or themselves without some degree of knowledge in the laws to evince this the more clearly it may not be amiss to descend to a few particulars let us therefore begin with our gentlemen of independent estates and fortune the most useful as well as considerable body of men in the nation whom even to suppose ignorant in this branch of learning is treated by mr locked as a strange absurdity it is their landed property with its long and voluminous train of descents and conveyances settlements entails and incumbrances that forms the most intricate and most extensive object of legal knowledge the thorough comprehension of these in all their minute distinctions is perhaps too laborious a task for any but a lawyer by profession yet still the understanding of a few leading principles relating to estates and conveyancing may form some check and guard upon a gentlemans inferior agents and preserve him at least from very gross and notorious imposition again the policy of all laws has made some forms necessary in the wording of last wills and testaments and more with regard to their attestation an ignorance in these must always be of dangerous consequence to such as by choice or necessity compile their own testaments without any technical assistance those who have attended the courts of justice are the best witnesses of the confusion and distresses that are hereby occasioned in families and of the difficulties that arise in discerning the true meaning of the testator or sometimes in discovering any meaning at all so that in the end his estate    may often be vested quite contrary to these his enigmatical intentions because perhaps he has omitted one or two formal words which are necessary to ascertain the sense with indisputable legal precision or has executed his will in the presence of fewer witnesses than the law requires but to proceed from private concerns to those of a more public consideration all gentlemen of fortune are in consequence of their property liable to be called upon to establish the rights to estimate the injuries to weigh the accusations and sometimes to dispose of the lives of their fellowsubjects by serving upon juries in this situation they have frequently a right to decide and that upon their oaths   questions of nice importance in the solution of which some legal skill is requisite especially where the law and the fact as it often happens are intimately blended together and the general incapacity even of our best juries to do this with any tolerable propriety has greatly debased their authority and has unavoidably thrown more power into the hands of the judges to direct control and even reverse their verdicts than perhaps the constitution intended but it is not as a juror only that the english gentleman is called upon to determine questions of right and distribute justice to his fellowsubjects it is principally with this order of men that the commission of the peace is filled and here a very ample field is opened for a gentleman to exert his talents by maintaining good order in his neighbourhood by punishing the dissolute and idle by protecting the peaceable and industrious and above all by healing petty differences and preventing vexatious prosecutions but in order to attain these desirable ends it is necessary that the magistrate should understand his business and have not only the will but the power also under which must be included the knowledge of administering legal and effectual justice else when he has mistaken his authority through passion through ignorance or absurdity he will be the object of    contempt from his inferiors and of censure from those to whom he is accountable for his conduct yet farther most gentlemen of considerable property at some period or other in their lives are ambitious of representing their country in parliament and those who are ambitious of receiving so high a trust would also do well to remember its nature and importance they are not thus honourably distinguished from the rest of their fellowsubjects merely that they may privilege their persons their estates or their domestics that they may list under party banners may grant or withhold supplies may vote with or vote against a popular or unpopular administration but upon considerations far more interesting and important they are the guardians of the english constitution the makers repealers and interpreters of the english laws delegated to watch to check and to avert every dangerous innovation to propose to adopt and to cherish any solid and wellweighed improvement bound by every tie of nature of honour and of religion to transmit that constitution and those laws to posterity amended if possible at least without any derogation and how unbecoming must it appear in a member of the legislature to vote for a new law who is utterly ignorant of the old what kind of interpretation can he be enabled to give who is a stranger to the text upon which he comments indeed it is perfectly amazing that there should be no other state of life no other occupation art or science in which some method of instruction is not looked upon as requisite except only the science of legislation the noblest and most difficult of any apprenticeships are held necessary to almost every art commercial or mechanical a long course of reading and study must form the divine the physician and the practical professor of the laws but every man of superior fortune thinks himself born a legislator yet tully was of a different opinion it is   0 necessary says hee for a senator to be thoroughly acquainted with the constitution and this he declares is a knowledge of the most extensive nature a matter of science of diligence of reflection without which no senator can possibly be fit for his office the mischiefs that have arisen to the public from inconsiderate alterations in our laws are too obvious to be called in question and how far they have been owing to the defective education of our senators is a point well worthy the public attention the common law of england has fared like other venerable edifices of antiquity which rash and unexperienced workmen have ventured to newdress and refine with all the rage of modern improvement hence frequently its symmetry has been destroyed its proportions distorted and its majestic simplicity exchanged for specious embellishments and fantastic novelties for to say the truth almost all the perplexed questions almost all the niceties intricacies and delays which have sometimes disgraced the english as well as other  0 courts of justice owe their original not to the common law itself but to innovations that have been made in it by acts of parliament overladen as sir edward coke expresses itf with provisoes and additions and many times on a sudden penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law this great and wellexperienced judge declares that in all his time he never knew two questions made upon rights merely depending upon the common law and warmly laments the confusion introduced by illjudging and unlearned legislators but if he subjoins acts of parliament were after the old fashion penned by such only as perfectly knew what the common law was before the making of any act of parliament concerning that matter as also how far forth former statues had provided remedy for former mischiefs and defects discovered by experience then should very few questions in law arise     and the learned should not so often and so much perplex their heads to make atonement and peace by construction of law between insensible and disagreeing words sentences and provisoes as they now do and if this inconvenience was so heavily felt in the reign of queen elizabeth you may judge how the evil is increased in later times when the statute book is swelled to ten times a larger bulk unless it should be found that the penners of our modern statutes have proportionably better informed themselves in the knowledge of the common law what is said of our gentlemen in general and the propriety of their application to the study of the laws of their country will hold equally strong or still stronger with regard to the nobility of this realm except only in the article of serving upon juries but instead of this they have several peculiar provinces of far greater consequence and concern being not only by birth hereditary counsellors of the crown and judges upon their honour of the lives of their brotherpeers but also arbiters of the property of all their fellowsubjects and that in the last resort in this their judicial capacity they are bound to decide the nicest and most critical points of the law to examine and correct such errors as have escaped the most experienced sages of the profession the lord keeper and the judges of the courts at westminster their sentence is final decisive irrevocable no appeal no correction not even a review can be had and to their determination whatever it be the inferior courts of justice must conform otherwise the rule of property would no longer be uniform and steady should a judge in the most subordinate jurisdiction be deficient in the knowledge of the law it would reflect infinite contempt upon himself and disgrace upon those who employ him and yet the consequence of his ignorance is comparatively very trifling and small his judgment may be examined and his errors rectified by other courts but how much more serious and affecting is the case of a superior judge     if without any skill in the laws he will boldly venture to decide a question upon which the welfare and subsistence of whole families may depend where the chance of his judging right or wrong is barely equal and where if he chances to judge wrong he does an injury of the most alarming nature an injury without possibility of redress yet vast as this trust is it can nowhere be so properly reposed as in the noble hands where our excellent constitution has placed it and therefore placed it because from the independence of their fortune and the dignity of their station they are presumed to employ that leisure which is the consequence of both in attaining a more extensive knowledge of the laws than persons of inferior rank and because the founders of our polity relied upon that delicacy of sentiment so peculiar to noble birth which as on the one hand it will prevent either interest or affection from interfering in questions of right so on the other it will bind a peer in honour an obligation which the law esteems equal to anothers oath to be master of those points upon which it is his birthright to decide     the roman pandects will furnish us with a piece of history not unapplicable to our present purpose servius sulpicius a gentleman of the patrician order and a celebrated orator had occasion to take the opinion of quintus mutius scævola the then oracle of the roman law but for want of some knowledge in that science could not so much as understand even the technical terms which his friend was obliged to make use of upon which mutius scævola could not forbear to upbraid him with this memorable reproofg that it was a shame for a patrician a nobleman and an orator of causes to be ignorant of that law in which he was so peculiarly concerned this reproach made so deep an impression on sulpicius that he immediately applied himself to the study of the law wherein he arrived to that     proficiency that he left behind him about an hundred and fourscore volumes of his own compiling upon the subject and became in the opinion of ciceroh a much more complete lawyer than even mutius scævola himself i would not be thought to recommend to our english nobility and gentry to become as great lawyers as sulpicius though he together with this character sustained likewise that of an excellent orator a firm patriot and a wise indefatigable senator but the inference which arises from the story is this that ignorance of the laws of the land hath ever been esteemed dishonourable in those who are intrusted by their country to maintain to administer and to amend them but surely there is little occasion to enforce this argument any farther to persons of rank and distinction if we of this place may be allowed to form a general judgment from those who are under our inspection happy that while we lay down the rule we can also produce the example you will therefore permit your professor to indulge both a public and private satisfaction by bearing this open testimony that in the infancy of these studies among us they were favoured with the most diligent attendance and pursued with the most unwearied application by those of the noblest birth and most ample patrimony some of whom are still the ornaments of this seat of learning and others at a greater distance continue doing honour to its institutions by comparing our polity and laws with those of other kingdoms abroad or exerting their senatorial abilities in the councils of the nation at home nor will some degree of legal knowledge be found in the least superfluous to persons of inferior rank especially those of the learned professions the clergy in particular besides the common obligations they are under in proportion to their rank and fortune have also abundant reason considered     merely as clergymen to be acquainted with many branches of the law which are almost peculiar and appropriated to themselves alone such are the laws relating to advowsons institutions and inductions to simony and simoniacal contracts to uniformity residence and pluralities to tithes and other ecclesiastical dues to marriages more especially of late and to a variety of other subjects which are consigned to the care of their order by the provisions of particular statutes to    understand these aright to discern what is warranted or enjoined and what is forbidden by law demands a sort of legal apprehension which is no otherwise to be acquired than by use and a familiar acquaintance with legal writers for the gentlemen of the faculty of physic i must frankly own that i see no special reason why they in particular should apply themselves to the study of the law unless in common with other gentlemen and to complete the character of general and extensive knowledge a character which their profession beyond others has remarkably deserved they will give me leave however to suggest and that not ludicrously that it might frequently be of use to families upon sudden emergencies if the physician were acquainted with the doctrine of last wills and testaments at least so far as relates to the formal part of their execution  but those gentlemen who intend to profess the civil and ecclesiastical laws in the spiritual and maritime courts of this kingdom are of all men next to common lawyers the most indispensably obliged to apply themselves seriously to the study of our municipal laws for the civil and canon laws considered with respect to any intrinsic obligation have no force or authority in this kingdom they are no more binding in england than our laws are binding at rome but as far as these foreign laws on account of some peculiar propriety have in some particular cases and in some particular courts been introduced and allowed by our laws so far they oblige and no farther their authority being wholly founded upon that permission and adoption in which we are not singular in our     notions for even in holland where the imperial law is much cultivated and its decisions pretty generally followed we are informed by van leeuweni that it receives its force from custom and the consent of the people either tacitly or expressly given for otherwise he adds we should no more be bound by this law than by that of the almains the franks the saxons the goths the vandals and other of the ancient nations wherefore in all points in which the different systems depart from each other the law of the land takes place of the law of rome whether ancient or modern imperial or pontifical and in those of our english courts wherein a reception has been allowed to the civil and canon laws if either they exceed the bounds of that reception by extending themselves to other matters than are permitted to them or if such courts proceed according to the decisions of those laws in cases wherein it is controlled by the law of the land the common law in either instance both may and frequently does prohibit and annul their proceedingsk and it will not be a sufficient excuse for them to tell the kings courts at westminster that their practice is warranted by the laws of justinian or gregory or is conformable to the decrees of the rota or imperial chamber  for which reason it becomes highly necessary for every civilian and canonist that would act with    safety as a judge or with prudence and reputation as an advocate to know in what cases and how far the english laws have given sanction to the roman in what points the latter are rejected and where they are both so intermixed and blended together as to form certain supplemental parts of the common law of england distinguished by the titles of the kings maritime the kings military and the kings ecclesiastical law the propriety of which inquiry the university of oxford has for more than a century so thoroughly seen that in her statutesl she appoints that one of the three questions to be annually discussed at the act by the juristinceptors shall relate to the common law subjoining this reason quia juris civilis studiosos decet haud imperitos esse     juris municipalis et differentias exteri patriique juris notas habere and the statutesm of the university of cambridge speak expressly to the same effect from the general use and necessity of some acquaintance with the common law the inference were extremely easy with regard to the propriety of the present institution in a place to which gentlemen of all ranks and degrees resort as the fountain of all useful knowledge but how it has come to pass that a design of this sort has never before taken place in the university and the reason why the study of our laws has in general fallen into disuse i shall previously proceed to inquire sir john fortescue in his panegyric on the laws of england which was written in the reign of henry the sixth putsn a very obvious question in the mouth of the young prince whom he is exhorting to apply himself to that branch of learning why the laws of england being so good so fruitful and so commodious are not taught in the universities as the civil and canon laws are in answer to which he giveso what seems with due deference be it spoken a very jejune and unsatisfactory reason being in short that as the proceedings at common law were in his time carried on in three different tongues the english the latin and the french that science must be necessarily taught in those three several languages but that in the universities all sciences were taught in the latin tongue only and therefore he concludes that they could not be conveniently taught or studied in our universities but without attempting to examine seriously the validity of this reason the very shadow of which by the wisdom of your late constitutions is entirely taken away we perhaps may find out a better or at least a more plausible account why the study of the municipal laws has been banished from these seats of science than what the learned chancellor thought it prudent to give to his royal pupil     that ancient collection of unwritten maxims and customs which is called the common law however compounded or from whatever fountains derived had subsisted immemorially in this kingdom and though somewhat altered and impaired by the violence of the times had in great measure weathered the rude shock of the norman conquest this had endeared it to the people in general as well because its decisions were universally known as because it was found to be excellently adapted to the genius of the english nation in the knowledge of this law consisted great part of the learning of those dark ages it was then taught says mr seldenp in the monasteries in the universities and in the families of the principal nobility the clergy in particular as they then engrossed almost every other branch of learning so like their predecessors    the british draidsq they were peculiarly remarkable for their proficiency in the study of the law nullus clericus nisi causidicus is the character given of them soon after the conquest by william of malmsburyr the judges there fore were usually created out of the sacred orders as was likewise the case among the normanst and all the inferior offices were supplied by the lower clergy which has occasioned their successors to be denominated clerks to this day but the common law of england being not committed to writing but only handed down by tradition use and experience was not so heartily relished by the foreign clergy who came over hither in shoals during the reign of the conqueror and his two sons and were utter strangers to our constitution as well as our language and an accident which soon after happened had nearly completed its ruin a copy of justinians pandects being newlyu discovered at amalfi      soon brought the civil law into vogue all over the west of europe where before it was quite laid asidew and in a manner forgotten though some traces of its authority remained in italyx and the eastern provinces of the empirey this now became in a particular manner the favourite of the popish clergy who borrowed the method and many of the maxims of their canon law from this original the study of it was introduced into several universities abroad particularly that of bologna where exercises were performed lectures read and degrees conferred in this faculty as in other branches of science and many nations on the continent just then beginning to recover from the convulsions consequent upon the overthrow of the roman empire and settling by degrees into peaceable forms of government adopted the civil law being the best written system then extant as the basis of their several constitutions blending and interweaving it among their own feodal customs in some places with a more extensive in others a more confined authorityz nor was it long before the prevailing mode of the times reached england for theobald a norman abbot being elected to the see of canterburya and extremely addicted to this new study brought over with him in his retinue many learned proficients therein and among the rest roger surnamed vacarius whom he placed in the university of oxfordb to teach it to the people of this country but it did not meet with the same easy reception in england where a mild and rational system of laws had been long established as it did upon the continent and though the monkish clergy devoted to the will of a foreign primate received it with eagerness and zeal yet the laity who were more interested to preserve the old constitution and had already severely felt the effect of many    norman innovations continued wedded to the use of the common law king stephen immediately     published a proclamationc forbidding the study of the laws then newly imported from italy which was treated by the monksd as a piece of impiety and though it might prevent the introduction of the civil law process into our courts of justice yet did not hinder the clergy from reading and teaching it in their own schools and monasteries from this time the nation seems to have been divided into two parties the bishops and clergy many of them foreigners who applied themselves wholly to the study of the civil and canon laws which now came to be inseparably interwoven with each other and the nobility and laity who adhered with equal pertinacity to the old common laws both of them reciprocally jealous of what they were unacquainted with and neither of them perhaps allowing the opposite system that real merit which is abundantly to be found in each this appears on the one hand from the spleen with which the monastic writerse speak of our municipal laws upon all occasions and on the other from the firm temper which the nobility shewed at the famous parliament of merton when the prelates endeavoured to procure an act to declare all bastards legitimate in case the parents intermarried at any time afterwards alleging this only reason because holy church that is the canon law declared such children legitimate but all the earls and barons says the parliament rollf with one voice an swered that they would not change the laws of england which had hitherto been used and approved and we find the same jealousy prevailing above a century afterwardsg when the nobility declared with a kind of prophetic spirit that the realm of england hath never been unto this hour neither by the consent of our lord the king and the lords of parliament shall it ever be   0 ruled or governed by the civil lawh and of this temper between the clergy and laity many more instances might be given while things were in this situation the clergy finding it impossible to root out the municipal law began to withdraw themselves by degrees from the temporal courts  and to that end very early in the reign of king henry the third  0 episcopal constitutions were publishedi forbidding all ecclesiastics to appear as advocates in foro sæculari nor did they long continue to act as judges there not caring to take the oath of office which was then found necessary to be administered that they should in all things determine according to the law and custom of this realmk though they still kept possession of the high office of chancellor an office then of little juridical power and afterwards as its business increased by degrees they modelled the process of the court at their own discretion but wherever they retired and wherever their authority extended they carried with them the same zeal to introduce the rules of the civil in exclusion of the municipal law this appears in a particular manner from the spiritual courts of all denominations from the chancellors courts in both our universities and from the high court of chancery before mentioned in all of which the proceedings are to this day in a course much conformed to the civil law for which no tolerable reason can be assigned unless that these courts were all under the immediate direction of the popish ecclesiastics among whom it was a point of religion to exclude the municipal law pope innocent the fourth having forbiddenl the very reading of it by the clergy because its decisions were not founded on the imperial constitutions but merely on the customs of the laity and if it be considered that our universities began about that period to receive their present form of scholastic discipline that they were then and continued to     be till the time of the reformation entirely under the influence of the popish clergy sir john mason the first protestant being also the first lay chancellor of oxford this will lead us to perceive the reason why the study of the roman laws was in those days of bigotrym pursued with such alacrity in these seats of learning and why the common law was entirely despised and esteemed little better than heretical and since the reformation many causes have conspired to prevent its becoming a part of academical education as first long usage and established custom which as in every thing else so especially in the forms of scholastic exercise have justly great weight and authority secondly the real intrinsic merit of the civil law considered upon the footing of reason and not of obligation which was well known to the instructors of our youth and their total ignorance of the merit of the common law though its equal at least and perhaps an improvement on the other but the principal reason of all that has hindered the introduction of this branch of learning is that the study of the common law being banished from hence in the times of popery has fallen into a quite different channel and has hitherto been wholly cultivated in another place but as the long usage and established custom of ignorance of the laws of the land begin now to be thought unreasonable and as by these means the merit of those     laws will probably be more generally known we may hope that the method of studying them will soon revert to its antient course and the foundations at least of that science will be laid in the two universities without being exclusively confined to the channel which it fell into at the times i have just been describing for being then entirely abandoned by the clergy a few stragglers excepted the study and practice of it devolved of course into the hands of laymen who entertained upon their parts a most hearty aversion to the civil lawn and made no scruple to profess their contempt nay even their ignoranceo of it in    the most public manner but still as the balance of learning was greatly on the side of the clergy and as the common law was no longer taught as formerly in any part of the kingdom it must have been subjected to many inconveniences and perhaps would have been gradually lost and overrun by the civil a suspicion well justified from the frequent transcripts of justinian to be met with in bracton and fleta had it not been for a peculiar incident which happened at a very critical time and contributed greatly to its support the incident which i mean was the fixing of the court of common pleas the grand tribunal for disputes of property to be held in one certain spot that the seat of ordinary justice might be permanent and notorious to all the nation formerly that in conjunction with all the other superior     courts was held before the kings capital justiciary of england in the aula regis or such of his palaces wherein his royal person resided and removed with his household from one end of the kingdom to the other this was found to occasion great inconvenience to the suitors to remedy which it was made an article of the great charter of liberties both that of king john and king henry the thirdp that common pleas should no longer follow the kings court but be held in some certain place in consequence of which they have ever since been held a few necessary removals in times of the plague excepted in the palace of westminster only this brought together the professors of the municipal law who before were dispersed about the kingdom and formed them into an aggregate body whereby a society was established of persons who as spelmanq observes addicting themselves wholly to the study of the laws of the land and no longer considering it as a mere subordinate science for the amusement of leisure hours soon raised those laws to that pitch of perfection which they suddenly attained under the auspices of our english justinian king edward the first in consequence of this lucky assemblage they naturally fell into a kind of collegiate order and being excluded from oxford and cambridge found it necessary to establish a new university of their own this they did by purchasing at various times certain houses now called the inns of court and of chancery between the city of westminster the place of holding the kings courts and the city of london for advantage of ready access to the one and plenty of provisions in the otherr here exercises were performed lectures read and degrees were at length conferred in the common law as at other universities in the canon and civil the degrees were those of barristers first styled apprenticess from apprendre to     learn who answered to our bachelors as the state and degree of a serjeantt servientis ad legem did to that of doctor the crown seems to have soon taken under its protection this infant seminary of common law and the more effectually to foster and cherish it king henry the third in the nineteenth year of his reign issued out an order directed to the mayor and sheriffs of london commanding that no regent of any law schools within that city should for the future teach law thereinu the word law or leges being a general term may create some doubt at this distance of time    whether the teaching of the civil law or the common or both is hereby restrained but in either case it tends to the same end if the civil law only is prohibited which is mr seldensw opinion it is then a retaliation upon the clergy who had excluded the common law from their seats of learning if the municipal law be also included in the restriction as sir edward cokex understands it and which the words seem to import then the intention is evidently this by preventing private teachers within the walls of the city to collect all the common lawyers into the one public university which was newly instituted in the suburbs     in this juridical university for such it is insisted to have been by fortescuey and sir edward cokez there are two sorts of collegiate houses one called inns of chancery in which the younger students of the law were usually placed learning and studying says fortescuea the originals and as it were the elements of the law who profiting therein as they grew to ripeness so were they admitted into the greater inns of the same study called the inns of court and in these inns of both kinds he goes on to tell us the knights and barons with other grandees and noblemen of the realm did use to place their children though they did not desire to have them thoroughly learned in the law or to get their living by its practice and that in his time there were about two thousand students at these several inns all of whom he informs us were filii nobilium or gentlemen born     hence it is evident that though under the influence of the monks our universities neglected this study yet in the time of henry the sixth it was thought highly necessary and was the universal practice for the young nobility and gentry to be instructed in the originals and elements of the laws but by degrees this custom has fallen into disuse so that in the reign of queen elizabeth    sir edward cokeb does not reckon above a thousand students and the number at present is very considerably less which seems principally owing to these reasons first because the inns of chancery being now almost totally filled by the inferior branch of the profession are neither commodious nor proper for the resort of gentlemen of any rank or figure so that there are very rarely any young students entered at the inns of chancery secondly because in the inns of court all sorts of regimen and academical superintendence either with regard to morals or studies are found impracticable and therefore entirely neglected lastly because persons of birth and fortune after having finished their usual courses at the universities have     seldom leisure or resolution sufficient to enter upon a new scheme of study at a new place of instruction wherefore few gentlemen now resort to the inns of court but such for whom the knowledge of practice is absolutely necessary such i mean as are intended for the profession the rest of our gentry not to say our nobility also having usually retired to their estates or visited foreign kingdoms or entered upon public life without any instruction in the laws of the land and indeed with hardly any opportunity of gaining instruction unless it can be afforded them in these seats of learning and that these are the proper places for affording assistances of this kind to gentlemen of all stations and degrees cannot i think with any colour of reason be denied for not one of the objections which are made to the inns of court and chancery and which i have just now enumerated will hold with regard to the universities gentlemen may here associate with gentlemen of their own rank and degree nor are their conduct and studies left entirely to their own discretion but regulated by a discipline so wise and exact yet so liberal so sensible and manly that their conformity to its rules which does at present so much honour to our youth is not more the effect of constraint than of their own inclinations and choice neither need they apprehend too long an avocation hereby from their private concerns and amusements or what is a more noble object the service of their friends and their country this study will go hand in hand with their other pursuits it will obstruct none of them it will ornament and assist them all but if upon the whole there are any still wedded to monastic prejudice that can entertain a doubt how far this study is properly and regularly academical such persons i am afraid either have not considered the constitution and design of an university or else think very meanly of it it must be a deplorable narrowness of mind that would confine these seats of instruction to the limited views of one or two learned professions to the praise of this age be it spoken a more open     and generous way of thinking begins now universally to prevail the attainment of liberal and genteel accomplishments though not of the intellectual sort has been thought by our wisest and most affectionate patronsc and very lately by the whole universityd no small improvement of our ancient plan of education and therefore i may safely affirm that nothing how unusual soever is under due regulations improper to be taught in this place which is proper for a gentleman to learn but that a science which distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong which teaches to establish the one and prevent punish or redress the other which employs in its theory the noblest faculties of the soul and exerts in its practice the cardinal virtues of the heart a science which is universal in its use and extent accommodated to each individual yet comprehending the whole community that a science like this should ever have been deemed unnecessary to be studied in an university is matter of astonishment and concern  surely if it were not before an object    of academical knowledge it was high time to make it one and to those who can doubt the propriety of its reception among us if any such there be we may return an answer in their own way that ethics are confessedly a branch of academical learning and aristotle himself has said speaking of the laws of his own country that jurisprudence or the knowledge of those laws is the principal and most perfect branch of ethicse from a thorough conviction of this truth our munificent benefactor mr viner having employed above half a century in amassing materials for newmodelling and rendering more commodious the rude study of the laws of the land consigned     both the plan and execution of these his publicspirited designs to the wisdom of his parent university resolving to dedicate his learned labours to the benefit of posterity and the perpetual service of his countryf he was sensible he could not perform his resolution in a better and more effectual manner than by extending to the youth of this place those assistances of which he so well remembered and so heartily regretted the want and the sense which the university has entertained of this ample and most useful benefaction must appear beyond a doubt from their gratitude in receiving it with all possible marks of esteemg from their alacrity and unexampled dispatch in carrying it into executionh and above all from the laws and constitutions by which they have effectually guarded it from the neglect and abuse to which such institutions are liablei we have seen an universal emulation who best should understand or most faithfully pursue the designs of our generous patron and with pleasure we recollect that those who are most distinguished   0 by their quality their fortune their station their learning or their experience have appeared the most zealous to promote the success of mr viners establishment  0 the advantages that might result to the science of the law itself when a little more attended to in these seats of knowledge perhaps would be very considerable the leisure and abilities of the learned in these retirements might either suggest expedients or execute those dictated by wiser headsk for improving its method retrenching its superfluities and reconciling the little contrarieties which the practice of many centuries will necessarily create in any human system a task which those who are deeply employed in business and the more active scenes of the profession can hardly condescend to engage in and as to  0 the interest or which is the same the reputation of the universities themselves i may venture to pronounce that if ever this study should arrive to any tolerable perfection either here or at cambridge the nobility and gentry of this kingdom would not shorten their residence upon this account nor perhaps entertain a worse opinion of the benefits of academical education neither should it be considered as a matter of light importance that while we thus extend the pomæria of university learning and adopt a new tribe of citizens within these philosophical walls we interest a very     numerous and very powerful profession in the preservation of our rights and revenues 0 for i think it past dispute that those gentlemen who resort to the inns of court with a view to pursue the profession will find it expedient whenever it is practicable to lay the previous foundations of this as well as every other science in one of our learned universities we may appeal to the experience of every sensible lawyer whether any thing can be more hazardous or discouraging than the usual entrance on the study of the law a raw and unexperienced youth in the most dangerous season of life is transplanted on a sudden into the midst of allurements to pleasure without any restraint or check but what his own prudence can suggest with no public direction in what course to pursue his inquiries no private assistance to remove the distresses and difficulties which will always embarrass a beginner in this situation he is expected to sequester himself from the world and by a tedious lonely process to extract the theory of law from a mass of undigested learning or else by an assiduous attendance on the courts to pick up theory and practice together sufficient to qualify him for the ordinary run of business how little therefore is it to be wondered at that we hear of so frequent miscarriages that so many gentlemen of bright    imaginations grow weary of so unpromising a searchl and addict themselves wholly to amusements or other less innocent pursuits and that so many persons of moderate capacity confuse themselves at first setting out and continue ever dark and puzzled during the remainder of their lives the evident want of some assistance in the rudiments of legal knowledge has given birth to a practice which if ever it had grown to be general must have proved of extremely     pernicious consequence i mean the custom by some so very warmly recommended of dropping all liberal education as of no use to students in the law and placing them in its stead at the desk of some skilful attorney in order to initiate them early in all the depths of practice and render them more dexterous in the mechanical part of business a few instances of particular persons men of excellent learning and unblemished integrity who in spite of this method of education have shone in the foremost ranks of the bar afforded some kind of sanction to this illiberal path to the profession and biassed many parents of shortsighted judgment in its favour not considering that there are some geniuses formed to overcome all disadvantages and that from such particular instances no general rules can be formed nor observing that those very persons have frequently recommended by the most forcible of all examples the disposal of their own offspring a very different foundation of legal studies a regular academical education perhaps too in return i could now direct their eyes to our principal seats of justice and suggest a few lines in favour of university learningm   but in these all who hear me i know have already prevented me making therefore due allowance for one or two shining exceptions experience may teach us to foretell that a lawyer thus educated to the bar in subservience to attorneys and solicitorsn will find he has begun at the wrong end if practice be the whole he is taught practice must also be the whole he will ever know if he be not instructed in the elements and first principles upon which the rule of practice is founded the least variation from established precedents will totally distract and bewilder him ita lex scripta esto is the utmost his knowledge will arrive at he must never aspire to form and seldom expect to comprehend any arguments drawn a priori from the spirit of the laws and the natural foundations of justice     nor is this all for as few persons of birth or fortune or even of scholastic education will submit to the drudgery of servitude and the manual labour of copying the trash of an office should this infatuation prevail to any considerable degree we must rarely expect to see a gentleman of distinction or learning at the bar and what the consequence may be to have the interpretation and enforcement of the laws which include the entire disposal of our properties liberties and lives fall wholly into the hands of obscure or illiterate men is matter of very public concern the inconveniences here pointed out can never be effectually prevented but by making academical education a previous step to the profession of the common law and at the same time making the rudiments of the law a part of academical education for sciences are of a sociable disposition and flourish best in the neighbourhood of each other nor is there any branch of learning but may be helped and improved by assistances drawn from other arts if therefore the student in our laws hath formed both his sentiments and style by perusal and imitation of the purest classical writers among whom the historians and orators    will best deserve his regard if he can reason with precision and separate argument from fallacy by the clear simple rules of pure unsophisticated logic if he can fix his attention and steadily pursue truth through any the most intricate deduction by the use of mathematical demonstrations if he has enlarged his conceptions of nature and art by a view of the several branches of genuine experimental philosophy if he has impressed on his mind the sound maxims of the law of nature the best and most authentic foundation of human laws if lastly he has contemplated those maxims reduced to a practical system in the laws of imperial rome if he has done this or any part of it though all may be easily done under as able instructors as ever graced any seats of learning a student thus qualified may enter upon the study of the law with incredible advantage and reputation and if at the conclusion or during     the acquisition of these accomplishments he will afford himself here a year or twos further leisure to lay the foundation of his future labours in a solid scientifical method without thirsting too early to attend that practice which it is impossible he should rightly comprehend he will afterwards proceed with the greatest ease and will unfold the most intricate points with an intuitive rapidity and clearness i shall not insist upon such motives as might be drawn from principles of economy and are applicable to particulars only i reason upon more general topics and therefore to the qualities of the head which i have just enumerated i cannot but add those of the heart affectionate loyalty to the king a zeal for liberty and the constitution a sense of real honour and wellgrounded principles of religion as necessary to form a truly valuable english lawyer a hyde a hale or a talbot and whatever the ignorance of some or unkindness of others may have heretofore untruly suggested experience will warrant us to affirm that these endowments of loyalty and public spirit of honour and religion are nowhere to be found in more high perfection than in the two universities of this kingdom before i conclude it may perhaps be expected that i lay before you a short and general account of the method i propose to follow in endeavouring to execute the trust you have been pleased to repose in my hands and in these solemn lectures which are ordained to be read at the entrance of every term more perhaps to do public honour to this laudable institution than for the private instruction of individualsp i presume it will best answer the intent of our benefactor and the expectation of this learned body if i attempt to illustrate at times such detached titles of the law as are the most easy to be understood and most capable of historical or critical ornament but in reading the complete course which is annually consigned to my care a more regular method will be necessary and till a better is proposed i     shall take the liberty to follow the same that i have already submitted to the publicq to fill up and finish that outline with propriety and correctness and to render the whole intelligible to the uninformed minds of beginners whom we are too apt to suppose acquainted with terms and ideas which they never had opportunity to learn this must be my ardent endeavour though by no means my promise to accomplish you will permit me however very briefly to describe rather what i conceive an academical expounder of the laws should do than what i have ever known to be done he should consider his course as a general map of the law marking out the shape of the country its connections and boundaries its greater divisions and principal cities it is not his business to describe minutely the subordinate limits or to fix the longitude and latitude of every inconsiderable hamlet his attention should be engaged like that of the readers in fortescues inns of chancery in tracing out the originals and as it were the elements of the law for if as justinianr has observed the tender understanding of the student be loaded    at the first with a multitude and variety of matter it will either occasion him to desert his studies or will carry him heavily through them with much labour delay and despondence these originals should be traced to their fountains as well as our distance will permit to the customs of the britons and germans as recorded by cæsar and tacitus to the codes of the northern nations on the continent and more especially to those of our own saxon princes to the rules of the roman law either left here in the days of papinian or imported by vacarius and his     followers but above all to that inexhaustible reservoir of legal antiquities and learning the feodal law or as spelmans has entitled it the law of nations in our western orb these primary rules and fundamental principles should be weighed and compared with the precepts of the law of nature and the practice of other countries should be explained by reasons illustrated by examples and confirmed by undoubted authorities their history should be deduced their changes and revolutions observed and it should be shown how far they are connected with or have at any time been affected by the civil transactions of the kingdom a plan of this nature if executed with care and ability cannot fail of administering a most useful and rational entertainment to students of all ranks and professions and yet it must be confessed that the study of the laws is not merely a matter of amusement for as a very judicious writert has observed upon a similar occasion the learner will be considerably disappointed if he looks for entertainment without the expense of attention an attention however not greater than is usually bestowed in mastering the rudiments of other sciences or sometimes pursuing a favourite recreation or exercise and this attention is not equally necessary to be exerted by every student upon every occasion some branches of the law as the formal process of civil suits and the subtle distinctions incident to landed property which are the most difficult to be thoroughly understood are the least worth the pains of understanding except to such gentlemen as intend to pursue the profession to others i may venture to apply with a slight alteration the words of sir john fortescueu when first his royal pupil determines to engage in this study it will not be necessary for a gentleman as such to examine with a close application the critical niceties of the law it will fully be sufficient and he may well enough be denominated a lawyer if under the instruction of a master he traces up the principles and grounds of the     law even to their original elements therefore in a very short period and with very little labour he may be sufficiently informed in the laws of his country if he will but apply his mind in good earnest to receive and apprehend them for though such knowledge as is necessary for a judge is hardly to be acquired by the lucubrations of twenty years yet with a genius of tolerable perspicacity that knowledge which is fit for a person of birth or condition may be learned in a single year without neglecting his other improvements to the few therefore the very few i am persuaded that entertain such unworthy notions of an university as to suppose it intended for mere dissipation of thought to such as mean only to while away the awkward interval from childhood to twentyone between the restraints of the school and the licentiousness of politer life in a calm middle state of mental and of moral inactivity to these mr viner gives no invitation to an entertainment which they never can relish but to the long and illustrious train of noble and ingenuous youth who are not more distinguished among us by their birth and possessions than by the regularity of their conduct and their thirst after useful knowledge to these our benefactor has consecrated the fruits of a long and laborious life worn out in the duties of his calling and will joyfully reflect if such reflections can be now the employment of his thoughts that he could not more effectually have benefited posterity or contributed to the service of the public than by founding an institution which may instruct the rising generation in the wisdom of our civil polity    and inspire them with a desire to be still better acquainted with the laws and constitution of their country         section ii of the nature of laws in general law in its most general and comprehensive sense signifies a rule of action and is applied indiscriminately to all kinds of action whether animate or inanimate rational or irrational thus we say the laws of motion of gravitation of optics or mechanics as well as the laws of nature and of nations and it is that rule of action which is prescribed by some superior and which the inferior is bound to obey thus when the supreme being formed the universe and created matter out of nothing he impressed certain principles upon that matter from which it can never depart and without which it would cease to be when he put that matter into motion he established certain laws of motion to which all movable bodies must conform and to descend from the greatest operations to the smallest when a workman forms a clock or other piece of mechanism he establishes at his own pleasure certain arbitrary laws for its direction—as that the hand shall describe a given space in a given time to which law as long as the work conforms so long it continues in perfection and answers the end of its formation if we farther advance from mere inactive matter to vegetable and animal life we shall find them still governed by laws more numerous indeed but equally fixed and invariable the whole progress of plants from the seed to the root and from thence to the seed again the method of animal     nutrition digestion secretion and all other branches of vital economy are not left to chance or the will of the creature itself but are performed in a wondrous involuntary manner and guided by unerring rules laid down by the great creator    this then is the general signification of law a rule of action dictated by some superior being and in those creatures that have neither the power to think nor to will such laws must be invariably obeyed so long as the creature itself subsists for its existence depends on that obedience but laws in their more confined sense and in which it is our present business to consider them denote the rules not of action in general but of human action or conduct that is the precepts by which man the noblest of all sublunary beings a creature endowed with both reason and freewill is commanded to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his behaviour  man considered as a creature must necessarily be subject to the laws of his creator for he is entirely a dependent being a being independent of any other has no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself but a state of dependence will inevitably oblige the inferior to take the will of him on whom he depends as the rule of his conduct not indeed in every particular but in all those points wherein his dependence consists this principle therefore has    more or less extent and effect in proportion as the superiority of the one and the dependence of the other is greater or less absolute or limited and consequently as man depends absolutely upon his maker for every thing it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his makers will this will of his maker is called the law of nature for as god when he created matter and endued it with a principle of mobility established certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion so when he created man and endued him with freewill to conduct himself in all parts of   0 life he laid down certain immutable laws of human nature whereby that freewill is in some degree regulated and restrained and gave him also the faculty of reason to discover the purport of those laws  considering the creator only as a being of infinite power he was able unquestionably to have prescribed whatever laws he pleased to his creature man however unjust or severe but as he is also a being of infinite wisdom he has laid down only such laws as were founded in those relations of justice that existed in the nature of things antecedent to any positive precept these are the eternal immutable laws of good and evil to which the creator himself in all his dispensations conforms and which he has enabled human reason to discover so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions such among others are these principles that we should live honestly should hurt nobody and should render to every one his due to which three general precepts justiniana has reduced the whole doctrine of law   0 but if the discovery of these first principles of the law of nature depended only upon the due exertion of right reason and could not otherwise be obtained than by a chain of metaphysical disquisitions mankind would have wanted some inducement to have quickened their inquiries and the greater part of the world would have rested content in mental indolence and ignorance its inseparable companion as therefore the creator is a being not only of infinite power and wisdom but also of infinite goodness he has been pleased so to contrive the constitution and frame of humanity that we should want no other prompter to inquire after and pursue the rule of right but only our own selflove that universal principle of action for he has so intimately connected so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former and if the former be punctually obeyed it cannot but induce the latter in consequence of which mutual connection of justice and human felicity he     has not perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and precepts referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things as some have vainly surmised but has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept that man should pursue his own true and substantial happiness this is the foundation of what we call ethics or natural law for the several articles into which it is branched in our systems amount to no more than demonstrating that this or that action tends to mans real happiness and therefore very justly concluding that the performance of it is a part of the law of nature or on the other hand that this or that action is destructive of mans real happiness and therefore that the law of nature forbids it     this law of nature being coeval with mankind and dictated by god himself is of course superior in obligation to any other it is binding over all the globe in all countries and at all times no human laws are of any validity if contrary to this and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority mediately or immediately from this original  but in order to apply this to the particular exigencies of each individual it is still necessary to have recourse to reason whose office it is to discover as was before observed what the law of nature directs in every circumstance of life by considering what method will tend the most effectually to our own substantial happiness and if our reason were always as in our first ancestor before his transgression clear and perfect unruffled by passions unclouded by prejudice unimpaired by disease or intemperance the task would be pleasant and easy we should need no other guide but this but every man now finds the contrary in his own experience that his reason is corrupt and his understanding full of ignorance and error this has given manifold occasion for the benign interposition of divine providence which in compassion to the frailty the imperfection and the blindness of human reason     hath been pleased at sundry times and in divers manners to discover and enforce its laws by an immediate and direct revelation the doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law and they are to be found only in the holy scriptures these precepts when revealed are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature as they tend in all their consequences to mans felicity but we are not from thence to conclude that the knowledge of these truths was attainable by reason in its present corrupted state since we find that until they were revealed they were hid from the wisdom of ages as then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the same original with those of the law of nature so their intrinsic obligation is of equal strength and perpetuity yet undoubtedly the revealed law is of infinitely more authenticity than that moral system which is framed by ethical    writers and denominated the natural law because one is the law of nature expressly declared so to be by god himself the other is only what by the assistance of human reason we imagine to be that law if we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former both would have an equal authority but till then they can never be put in any competition together upon these two foundations the law of nature and the law of revelation depend all human laws that is to say no human laws should be suffered to contradict these there are it is true a great number of indifferent points in which both the divine law and the natural leave a man at his own liberty but which are found necessary for the benefit of society to be restrained within certain limits and herein it is that human laws have their greatest force and efficacy for with regard to such points as are not indifferent human laws are only declaratory of and act in subordination to the former to instance in the case of murder this is expressly forbidden by the divine and demonstrably by the natural law and from these prohibitions arises the true unlawfulness of this crime those human laws that annex a punishment to it do not at all increase its moral guilt or     superadd any fresh obligation in foro conscientiæ to abstain from its perpetration nay if any human law should allow or enjoin us to commit it we are bound to transgress that human law or else we must offend both the natural and the divine but with regard to matters that are in themselves indifferent and are not commanded or forbidden by those superior laws—such for instance as exporting of wool into foreign countries—here the inferior legislature has scope and opportunity to interpose and to make that action unlawful which before was not so if man were to live in a state of nature unconnected with other individuals there would be no occasion for any other laws than the law of nature and the law of god neither could any other law possibly exist for a law always supposes some superior who is to make it and in a state of nature we are all equal without any other superior but him who is the author of our being but man was formed for society and as is demonstrated by the writers on this subjectb is neither capable of living alone nor indeed has the courage to do it however as it is impossible for the whole race of mankind to be united in one great society they must necessarily divide into many and form separate states commonwealths and nations entirely independent of each other and yet liable to a mutual intercourse hence arises a third kind of law to regulate this mutual intercourse called the law of nations which as none of these states will acknowledge a superiority in the other cannot be dictated by any but depends entirely upon the rules of natural law or upon mutual compacts treaties leagues and agreements between these several communities in the construction also of which compacts we have no other rule to resort to but the law of nature being the only one to which all the communities are equally subject and therefore the civil lawc very justly observes that quod naturalis ratio inter omnes homines constituit vocatur jus gentium         thus much i thought it necessary to premise concerning the law of nature the revealed law and the law of nations before i proceeded to treat more fully of the principal subject of this section municipal or civil law that is the rule by which particular districts communities or nations are governed being thus defined by justiniand jus civile est quod quisque sibi populus constituit i call it municipal law in compliance with common speech for though strictly that expression denotes the particular customs of one single municipium or free town yet it may with sufficient propriety be applied to any one state or nation which is governed by the same laws and customs municipal law thus understood is properly defined to be a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong  let us endeavour to explain its several properties    as they arise out of this definition and first it is a rute not a transient sudden order from a superior to or concerning a particular person but something permanent uniform and universal therefore a particular act of the legislature to confiscate the goods of titius or to attaint him of high treason does not enter into the idea of a municipal law for the operation of this act is spent upon titius only and has no relation to the community in general it is rather a sentence than a law  but an act to declare that the crime of which titius is accused shall be deemed high treason this has permanency uniformity and universality and therefore is properly a rule it is also called a rule to distinguish it from advice or counsel which we are at liberty to follow or not as we see proper and to judge upon the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the thing advised whereas our obedience to the law depends not upon our approbation but upon the makers will counsel is only matter of persuasion law is matter of injunction counsel acts only upon the willing law upon the unwilling also     it is also called a rule to distinguish it from a compact or agreement for a compact is a promise proceeding from us law is a command directed to us the language of a compact is i will or will not do this that of a law is thou shalt or shalt not do it it is true there is an obligation which a compact carries with it equal in point of conscience to that of a law but then the original of the obligation is different in compacts we ourselves determine and promise what shall be done before we are obliged to do it in laws we are obliged to act without ourselves determining or promising any thing at all upon these accounts law is defined to be a rule municipal law is also a rule of civil conduct this distinguishes municipal law from the natural or revealed the former of which is the rule of moral conduct and the latter not only the rule of moral conduct but also the rule of faith these regard man as a creature and point out his duty to god to himself and to his neighbour considered in the light of an individual but municipal or civil law regards him also as a citizen and bound to other duties towards his neighbour than those of mere nature and religion duties which he has engaged in by enjoying the benefits of the common union and which amount to no more than that he do contribute on his part to the subsistence and peace of the society it is likewise a rule prescribed because a bare resolution confined in the breast of the legislator without manifesting itself by some external sign can never be properly a law it is requisite that this resolution be notified to the people who are to obey it but the manner in which this notification is to be made is matter of very great indifference it may be notified by universal tradition and long practice which supposes a previous publication and is the case of the common law of england it may be notified viva voce by officers appointed for that purpose as is done with regard to proclamations and such    acts of parliament as are appointed     to be publicly read in churches and other assemblies it may lastly be notified by writing printing or the like which is the general course taken with all our acts of parliament yet whatever way is made use of it is incumbent on the promulgators to do it in the most public and perspicuous manner not like caligula who according to dio cassius wrote his laws in a very small character and hung them upon high pillars the more effectually to ensnare the people there is still a more unreasonable method than this which is called making of laws ex post facto when after an action indifferent in itself is committed the legislator then for the first time declares it to have been a crime and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it here it is impossible that the party could foresee that an action innocent when it was done should be afterwards converted to guilt by a subsequent law he had therefore no cause to abstain from it and all punishment for not abstaining must of consequence be cruel and unjuste all laws should be therefore made to commence in futuro and be notified before their commencement which is implied in the term prescribed but when this rule is in the usual manner notified or prescribed it is then the subjects business to be thoroughly acquainted therewith for if ignorance of what he might know were admitted as a legitimate excuse the laws would be of no effect but might always be eluded with impunity 0    but farther municipal law is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state for legislature as was before observed is the greatest act of superiority that can be exercised by one being over another wherefore it is requisite to the very essence of a law that it be made by the supreme power sovereignty and legislature are indeed convertible terms one cannot subsist without the other     this will naturally lead us into a short inquiry concerning the nature of society and civil government and the natural inherent right that belongs to the sovereignty of a state wherever that sovereignty be lodged of making and enforcing laws the only true and natural foundations of society are the wants and the fears of individuals not that we can believe with some theoretical writers that there ever was a time when there was no such thing as society either natural or civil and that from the impulse of reason and through a sense of their wants and weaknesses individuals met together in a large plain entered into an original contract and chose the tallest man present to be their governor this notion of an actually existing unconnected state of nature is too wild to be seriously admitted and besides it is plainly contradictory to the revealed accounts of the primitive origin of mankind and their preservation two thousand years afterwards both which were effected by the means of single families these formed the first natural society among themselves which every day extending its limits laid the first though imperfect rudiments of civil or political society and when it grew too large to subsist with convenience in that pastoral state wherein the patriarchs appear to have lived it necessarily subdivided itself by various migrations into more afterwards as agriculture increased which employs and can maintain a much greater number of hands migrations became less frequent and various tribes which had formerly separated reunited again sometimes by compulsion and conquest sometimes by accident and sometimes perhaps by compact but though society had not its formal beginning from any convention of individuals actuated by their wants and their fears yet it is the sense of their weakness and imperfection that keeps mankind together that demonstrates the necessity of this union and that therefore is the solid and natural foundation as well as the cement of civil society and this is what we mean by the original contract of society which though perhaps in no instance it has ever been formally expressed at the first institution of a state yet in nature and reason must always be understood and implied     in the very act of associating together namely that the whole should protect all its parts and that every part should pay obedience to the will of the whole or in other words that the community should guard the rights of each individual member and that in return for this protection each individual should submit to the laws of the community without which submission of all it was impossible that protection should be certainly extended to any      for when civil society is once formed government at the same time results of course as necessary to preserve and to keep that society in order unless some superior be constituted whose commands and decisions all the members are bound to obey they would still remain as in a state of nature without any judge upon earth to define their several rights and redress their several wrongs but as all the members which compose this society were naturally equal it may be asked in whose hands are the reins of government to be intrusted to this the general answer is easy but the application of it to particular cases has occasioned one half of those mischiefs which are apt to proceed from misguided political zeal in general all mankind will agree that government should be reposed in such persons in whom those qualities are most likely to be found the perfection of which is among the attributes of him who is emphatically styled the supreme being the three grand requisites i mean of wisdom of goodness and of power wisdom to discern the real interest of the community goodness to endeavour always to pursue that real interest and strength or power to carry this knowledge and intention into action these are the natural foundations of sovereignty and these are the requisites that ought to be found in every well constituted frame of government    how the several forms of government we now see in the world at first actually began is matter of great uncertainty and has occasioned infinite disputes it is not my business or intention to enter into any of them however they began or by     what right soever they subsist there is and must be in all of them a supreme irresistible absolute uncontrolled authority in which the jura summi imperii or the rights of sovereignty reside and this authority is placed in those hands wherein according to the opinion of the founders of such respective states either expressly given or collected from their tacit appro bation the qualities requisite for supremacy wisdom goodness and power are the most likely to be found the political writers of antiquity will not allow more than three regular forms of government the first when the sovereign power is lodged in an aggregate assembly consisting of all the free members of a community which is called a democracy the second when it is lodged in a council composed of select members and then it is styled an aristocracy the last when it is intrusted in the hands of a single person and then it takes the name of a monarchy all other species of government they say are either corruptions of or reducible to these three by the sovereign power as was before observed is meant the making of laws for wherever that power resides all others must conform to and be directed by it whatever appearance the outward form and administration of the government may put on for it is at any time in the option of the legislature to alter that form and administration by a new edict or rule and to put the execution of the laws into whatever hands it pleases by constituting one or a few or many executive magistrates and all the other powers of the state must obey the    legislative power in the discharge of their several functions or else the constitution is at an end      in a democracy where the right of making laws resides in the people at large public virtue or goodness of intention is more likely to be found than either of the other qualities of government popular assemblies are frequently foolish in their contrivance and weak in their execution but generally mean to do the thing that is right and just and have always a degree of patriotism or public spirit in   0 aristocracies there is more wisdom to be found than in the other frames of government being composed or intended to be composed of the most experienced citizens but there is less honesty than in a republic and less strength than in a monarchy a monarchy is indeed the most powerful of any for by the entire conjunction of the legislative and executive powers all the sinews of government are knitted together and united in the hand of the prince but then there is imminent danger of his employing that strength to improvident or oppressive purposes thus these three species of government have all of them their several perfections and imperfections democracies are usually the best calculated to direct the end of a law aristocracies to invent the means by which that end shall be obtained and monarchies to carry these means into execution and the ancients as was observed had in general no idea of any other permanent form  0 of government but these three for though cicerof declares himself of opinion esse optime constitutam rempublicam quæ ex tribus generibus illis regali optimo et populari sit modice confusa yet tacitus treats this notion of a mixed government formed out of them all and partaking of the advantages of each as a visionary whim and one that if effected could never be lasting or secureg but happily for us of this island the british constitution has long remained and i trust will long continue a standing exception to the truth of this observation for as with us the executive power of the laws is lodged in a single person they have all the advantages of strength and despatch that are to be found in the most absolute monarchy and as the legislature of the kingdom is intrusted to three distinct powers entirely independent of each other first the king secondly the lords spiritual and temporal which is an aristocratical assemblage of persons selected for their piety     their birth their wisdom their valour or their property and thirdly the house of commons freely chosen by the people from among themselves which makes it a kind of democracy as this aggregate body actuated by different springs and attentive to different interests composes the british parliament and has the supreme disposal of every thing there can no inconvenience be attempted by either of the three branches but will be withstood by one of the other two each branch being armed with a negative power sufficient to repel any innovation which it shall think inexpedient or dangerous here then is lodged the sovereignty of the british constitution and lodged as beneficially as is possible for society for in no other shape could we be so certain of finding the three great qualities of government so well and so happily united if the supreme power were lodged in any one of the three branches separately we must be exposed to the inconveniences of either absolute monarchy aristocracy or democracy and so want two of the three principal ingredients of good polity either virtue wisdom or power if it were lodged in any two of the branches for instance in the king and house of lords our laws might be providently made and well executed but they might not always have the good of the people in view if lodged in the king and commons we should want that circumspection and mediatory caution which the wisdom of the peers is to afford if the supreme rights of legislature were lodged in the two houses only and the king had no negative upon their proceedings they might be tempted to encroach upon the royal prerogative or perhaps to abolish the kingly office and thereby weaken if not totally destroy the strength of the executive power but the constitutional government of this island is so admirably tempered and compounded that nothing can endanger or hurt it but destroying the equilibrium of power between one branch of the legislature and the rest for if ever it should happen that the independence of any one of the three should be lost or that it should become subservient to the views of either of the other two there would     soon be an end of our constitution   the legislature would be changed from that which upon the supposition of an original contract either actual or implied is presumed to have been originally set up by the general consent and fundamental act of the society and such a change however effected is according to mr lockeh who perhaps carries his theory too far at once an entire dissolution of the bands of government and the people are thereby reduced to    a state of anarchy with liberty to constitute to themselves a new legislative power having thus cursorily considered the three usual species of government and our own singular constitution selected and compounded from them all i proceed to observe that as the power of making laws constitutes the supreme authority so wherever the supreme authority in any state resides it is the right of that authority to make laws that is in the words of our definition to prescribe the rule of civil action and this may be discovered from the very end and institution of civil states for a state is a collective body composed of a multitude of individuals united for their safety and convenience and intending to act together as one man if it therefore is to act as one man it ought to act by one uniform will but inasmuch as political communities are made up of many natural persons each of whom has his particular will and inclination these several wills cannot by any natural union be joined together or tempered and disposed into a lasting harmony so as to constitute and produce that one uniform will of the whole it can therefore be no otherwise produced than by a political union by the consent of all persons to submit their own private wills to the will of one man or of one or more assemblies of men to whom the supreme authority is intrusted and this will of that one man or assemblage of men is in different states according to their different constitutions understood to be law thus far as to the right of the supreme power to make laws but farther it is its duty likewise for since the     respective members are bound to conform themselves to the will of the state it is expedient that they receive directions from the state declaratory of that its will but as it is impossible in so great a multitude to give injunctions to every particular man relative to each particular action it is therefore incumbent on the state to establish general rules for the perpetual information and direction of all persons in all points whether of positive or negative duty and this in order that every man may know what to look upon as his own what as anothers what absolute and what relative duties are required at his hands what is to be esteemed honest dishonest or indifferent what degree every man retains of his natural liberty what he has given up as the price of the benefits of society and after what manner each person is to moderate the use and exercise of those rights which the state assigns him in order to promote and secure the public tranquillity from what has been advanced the truth of the former branch of our definition is i trust sufficiently evident that municipal law is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state i proceed now to the latter branch of it that it is a rule so prescribed commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong now in order to do this completely it is first of all necessary that the boundaries of right and wrong be established and ascertained by law and when this is once done it will follow of course that it is likewise the business of the law considered as a rule of civil conduct to enforce these rights and to restrain or redress these wrongs it remains therefore only to consider in what manner the law is said to ascertain the boundaries of right and wrong and the methods which it takes to command the one and prohibit the other for this purpose every law may be said to consist of several parts one declaratory whereby the rights to be observed and the wrongs to be eschewed are clearly defined and     laid down another directory whereby the subject is instructed and enjoined to observe those rights and to abstain from the commission of those wrongs a third remedial whereby a method is pointed out to recover a mans private rights or redress his private wrongs to which may be added a fourth usually termed the sanction or vindicatory branch of the law whereby it is signified what evil or penalty shall be incurred by such as commit any public wrongs and transgress or neglect their duty with regard to the first of these the declaratory part of the municipal law this depends not so much upon the law of revelation or of nature as upon the wisdom and will of the legislator this doctrine which before was slightly touched deserves a more particular explication those rights then which god    and nature have established and are therefore called natural rights such as are life and liberty need not the aid of human laws to be more effectually invested in every man than they are neither do they receive any additional strength when declared by the municipal laws to be inviolable on the contrary no human legislature has power to abridge or destroy them unless the owner shall himself commit some act that amounts to a forfeiture neither do divine or natural duties such as for instance the worship of god the maintenance of children and the like receive any stronger sanction from being also declared to be duties by the law of the land the case is the same as to crimes and misdemesnors that are forbidden by the superior laws and therefore styled mala in se such as murder theft and perjury which contract no additional turpitude from being declared unlawful by the inferior legislature for that legislature in all these cases acts only as was before observed in subordination to the great lawgiver transcribing and publishing his precepts so that upon the whole the declaratory part of the municipal law has no force or operation at all with regard to actions that are naturally and intrinsically right or wrong     but with regard to things in themselves indifferent the case is entirely altered these become either right or wrong just or unjust duties or misdemesnors according as the municipal legislator sees proper for promoting the welfare of the society and more effectually carrying on the purposes of civil life thus our own common law has declared that the goods of the wife do instantly upon marriage become the property and right of the husband and our statute law has declared all monopolies a public offence yet that right and this offence have no foundation in nature but are merely created by the law for the purposes of civil society and sometimes where the thing itself has its rise from the law of nature the particular circumstances and mode of doing it become right or wrong as the law of the land shall direct thus for instance in civil duties obedience to superiors is the doctrine of revealed as well as natural religion but who those superiors shall be and in what circumstances or to what degrees they shall be obeyed it is the province of human laws to determine and so as to injuries or crimes it must be left to our own legislature to decide in what cases the seizing anothers cattle shall amount to a trespass or a theft and where it shall be a justifiable action as when a landlord takes them by way of distress for rent thus much for the declaratory part of the municipal law and the directory stands much upon the same footing for this virtually includes the former the declaration being usually collected from the direction the law that says thou shalt not steal implies a declaration that stealing is a crime and we have seeni that in things naturally indifferent the very essence of right and wrong depends upon the direction of the laws to do or to omit them the remedial part of a law is so necessary a consequence of the former two that laws must be very vague and imperfect     without it for in vain would rights be declared in vain directed to be observed if there were no method of recovering and asserting these rights when wrongfully withheld or invaded this is what we mean properly when we speak of the protection of the law when for instance the declaratory part of the law has said that the field or inheritance which belonged to titiuss father is vested by his death in titius and the directory part has forbidden any one to enter on anothers property without the leave of the owner if gaius after this will presume to take possession of the land the remedial part of the law will then interpose its office will make gaius restore the possession to titius and also pay him damages for the invasion with regard to the sanction of laws or the evil that may attend the breach of public duties it is observed that human legislators have for the most part chosen to make the sanction of their laws rather vindicatory than remuneratory or to consist rather in punishments than in actual particular rewards because in the first place the quiet enjoyment and protection of all our civil rights and liberties which are the sure and general consequence of obedience to the municipal    law are in themselves the best and most valuable of all rewards because also were the exercise of every virtue to be enforced by the proposal of particular rewards it were impossible for any state to furnish stock enough for so profuse a bounty and farther because the dread of evil is a much more forcible principle of human actions than the prospect of goodk for which reasons though a prudent bestowing of rewards is sometimes of exquisite use yet we find that those civil laws which enforce and enjoin our duty do seldom if ever propose any privilege or gift to such as obey the law but do constantly come armed with a penalty denounced against transgressors either expressly defining the nature and quantity of the punishment or else leaving it to the discretion of the judges and those who are intrusted with the care of putting the laws in execution     of all the parts of a law the most effectual is the vindicatory for it is but lost labour to say do this or avoid that unless we also declare this shall be the consequence of your noncompliance we must therefore observe that the main strength and force of a law consists in the penalty annexed to it herein is to be found the principal obligation of human laws legislators and their laws are said to compel and oblige not that by any natural violence they so constrain a man as to render it impossible for him to act otherwise than as they direct which is the strict sense of obligation but because by declaring and exhibiting a penalty against offenders they bring it to pass that no man can easily choose to transgress the law since by reason of the impending correction compliance is in a high degree preferable to disobedience and even where rewards are proposed as well as punishments threatened the obligation of the law seems chiefly to consist in the penalty for rewards in their nature can only persuade and allure nothing is compulsory but punishment it is true it hath been holden and very justly by the principal of our ethical writers that human laws are binding upon mens consciences but if that were the only or most forcible obligation the good only would regard the laws and the bad would set them at defiance and true as this principle is it must still be understood with some restriction it holds i apprehend as to rights and that when the law has determined the field to belong to titius it is matter of conscience no longer to withhold or to invade it so also in regard to natural duties and such offences as are mala in se here we are bound in conscience because we are bound by superior laws before those human laws were in being to perform the one and abstain from the other but in relation to those laws which enjoin only positive duties and forbid only such things as are not mala in se but mala prohibita merely without any intermixture of moral guilt     annexing a penalty to noncompliancel here i apprehend conscience is no farther concerned than by directing a submission to the penalty in case of our breach of those laws for otherwise the multitude of penal laws in a state would not only be looked upon as an impolitic but would also be a very wicked thing if every such law were a snare for the conscience of the subject but in these cases the alternative is offered to every man either abstain from this or submit to such a penalty and his conscience will be clear whichever side of the alternative he thinks proper to embrace thus by the statutes for preserving the game a penalty is denounced against every unqualified person that kills a hare and against every person who possesses a partridge in august and so too by other statutes pecuniary penalties are inflicted for exercising trades without serving an apprenticeship thereto   for not burying the dead in woollen for not performing the statutework on the public roads and for innumerable other positive misdemesnors now these prohibitory laws do not make the transgression a moral offence or sin the only obligation in conscience is to submit to the penalty if levied it must however be observed that we are here    speaking of laws that are simply and purely penal where the thing forbidden or enjoined is wholly a matter of indifference and where the penalty inflicted is an adequate compensation for the civil inconvenience supposed to arise from the offence   but where disobedience to the law involves in it also any degree of public mischief or private injury there it falls within our former distinction and is also an offence against consciencem i have now gone through the definition laid down of a municipal law and    have shown that it is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong in the explication of which i have endeavoured to interweave a few useful principles concerning the nature of civil government and the obligation of human laws before i conclude this section it may not be amiss to add a few observations concerning the interpretation of laws when any doubt arose upon the construction of the roman laws the usage was to state the case to the emperor in writing and take his opinion upon it this was certainly a bad method of interpretation to interrogate the legislature to decide particular disputes is not only endless but affords great room for partiality and oppression the answers of the emperor were called his rescripts and these had in succeeding cases the force of perpetual laws though they ought to be carefully distinguished by every rational civilian from those general constitutions which had only the nature of things for their guide the emperor macrinus as his historian capitolinus informs us had once resolved to     abolish these rescripts and retain only the general edicts he could not bear that the hasty and crude answers of such princes as commodus and caracalla should be reverenced as laws but justinian thought otherwisen and he has preserved them all in like manner the canon laws or decretal epistles of the popes are all of them rescripts in the strictest sense contrary to all true forms of reasoning they argue from particulars to generals the fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law was made by signs the most natural and probable and these signs are either the words the context the subject matter the effects and consequence or the spirit and reason of the law let us take a short view of them all   words are generally to be understood in their usual and most known signification not so much regarding the propriety of grammar as their general and popular use thus the law mentioned by puffendorfo which forbade a layman to lay hands on a priest was adjudged to extend to him who had hurt a priest with a weapon again terms of art or technical terms must be taken according    to the acceptation of the learned in each art trade and science so in the act of settlement where the crown of england is limited to the princess sophia and the heirs of her body being protestants it becomes necessary to call in the assistance of lawyers to ascertain the precise idea of the words heirs of her body which in a legal sense comprise only certain of her lineal descendants     0   if words happen to be still dubious we may establish their meaning from the context with which it may be of singular use to compare a word or a sentence whenever they are ambiguous equivocal or intricate thus the proeme or preamble is often called in to help the construction of an act of parliament   of the same nature and use is the comparison of a law with other laws that are made by the same legislator that have some affinity with the subject or that expressly relate to the same point   thus when the law  0 of england declares murder to be felony without benefit of clergy we must resort to the same law of england to learn what the benefit of clergy is and when the common law censures simoniacal contracts it affords great light to the subject to consider what the canon law has adjudged to be simony     as to the subject matter words are always to be understood as having a regard thereto for that is always supposed to be in the eye of the legislator and all his expressions directed to that end thus when a law of our edward iii forbids all ecclesiastical persons to purchase provisions at rome it might seem to prohibit the buying of grain and other victual but when we consider that the statute was made to repress the usurpations of the papal see and that the nominations to benefices by the pope were called provisions we shall see that the restraint is intended to be laid upon such provisions only   as to the effects and consequence the rule is that where words bear either none or a very absurd signification if literally understood we must a little deviate from the received sense of them therefore the bolognian law mentioned by puffendorfp which enacted that whoever drew blood in the streets should be punished with the utmost severity was held after long debate not to extend to the surgeon who opened the vein of a person that fell down in the street with a fit       but lastly the most universal and effectual way of discovering the true meaning of a law when the words are dubious is by considering the reason and spirit of it or the cause which moved the legislator to enact it 0 for when this reason ceases the law itself ought likewise to cease with it an instance of this is given in a case put by cicero or whoever was the author of the treatise inscribed to herenniusq there was a law that those who in a storm forsook the ship should forfeit all property therein and that the ship and lading should belong entirely to those who stayed in it in a dangerous tempest all the mariners forsook the ship except only one sick passenger who by reason    of his disease was unable to get out and escape by chance the ship came safe to port the sick man kept possession and claimed the benefit of the law now here all the learned agree that the sick man is not within the reason of the law for the reason of making it was to give encouragement to such as should venture their lives to save the vessel but this is a merit which he could never pretend to who neither stayed in the ship upon that account nor contributed any thing to its preservation   from this method of interpreting laws by the reason of them arises what we call equity which is thus defined by grotiusr the correction of that wherein the law by reason of its universality is deficient for since in laws all cases cannot be foreseen or expressed it is necessary that when the general decrees of the law come to be applied to particular cases there should be somewhere a power vested of defining those circumstances which had they been foreseen the legislator himself would have expressed and these are the cases which according to grotius lex non exacte definit sed arbitrio boni viri permittit   equity thus depending essentially upon the particular circumstances of each individual case there can be no established     rules and fixed precepts of equity laid down without destroying its very essence and reducing it to a positive law and on the other hand the liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light must not be indulged too far lest thereby we destroy all law and leave the decision of every question entirely in the breast of the judge and law without equity though hard and disagreeable is much more desirable for the public good than equity without law which would make every judge a legislator and introduce most infinite confusion as there would then be almost as many different rules of action laid down in our courts as there are differences of capacity and sentiment in the human mind    section iii of the laws of england the municipal law of england or the rule of civil conduct prescribed to the inhabitants of this kingdom may with sufficient propriety be divided into two kinds the lex non scripta the unwritten or common law and the lex scripta the written or statute law the lex non scripta or unwritten law includes not only general customs on the common law properly so called but also the particular customs of certain parts of the kingdom and likewise those particular laws that are by custom observed only in certain courts and jurisdictions when i call these parts of our law leges non scriptæ i would not be understood as if all those laws were at present merely oral or communicated from the former ages to the present solely by word of mouth it is true indeed that in the profound ignorance of letters which formerly overspread the whole western world all laws were entirely traditional for this plain reason because the nations among which they prevailed had but little idea of writing thus the british as well as the gallic druids committed all their laws as well as learning to memorya and it is said of the primitive saxons here as well as their brethren on the continent that leges sola memoria et usu retinebantb but with us at present the monuments and evidences of our legal customs are contained in the records of the several courts of justice in books of     reports and judicial decisions and in the treatises of learned sages of the profession preserved and handed down to us from the times of highest antiquity however i therefore style these parts of our law leges non scriptæ because their original institution and authority are not set down in writing as acts of parliament are but they receive their binding power and the force of laws by long and immemorial usage and by their universal reception throughout the kingdom in like manner as aulus gellius defines the jus non scriptum to be that which is tacito et illiterato hominum consensu et moribus expressum our ancient lawyers and particularly fortescuec insist with abundance of warmth that these customs are as old as the primitive britons and continued down through the several mutations of government and inhabitants to the present time unchanged and unadulterated this may be the case as to some but in general as mr selden in his notes observes this assertion must be understood with many grains of allowance and ought only to signify as the truth seems to be that there never was any formal exchange of one system of laws for another though doubtless by the intermixture of adventitious nations the romans the picts the saxons the danes and the normans they must have insensibly introduced and incorporated many of their own customs with those that were before established thereby in all probability improving the texture and wisdom of the whole by the accumulated wisdom of divers particular countries our laws saith lord bacond are mixed as our language and as our language is so much the richer the laws are the more complete and indeed our antiquaries and early historians do all positively assure us that our body of laws is of this compounded nature for they tell us that in the time of alfred the local customs of the several provinces of the kingdom were grown so various that he found it expedient to compile his domebook or liber judicialis for the general use of the whole kingdom     this book is said to have been extant so late as the reign of king edward the    fourth but is now unfortunately lost  it contained we may probably suppose the principal maxims of the common law the penalties for misdemesnors and the forms of judicial proceedings thus much may at least be collected from that injunction to observe it which we find in the laws of king edward the elder the son of alfrede omnibus qui reipublicæ præsunt etiam atque etiam mando ut omnibus æquos se præbeant judices perinde ac in judiciali libro saxonice  scriptum habetur nec quicquam formident quin jus commune saxonice  audacter libereque dicant but the irruption and establishment of the danes in england which followed soon after introduced new customs and caused this code of alfred in many provinces to fall into disuse or at least to be mixed and debased with other laws of a coarser alloy so that about the beginning of the eleventh century there were three principal systems of laws prevailing in different districts   the mercenlage or mercian laws which were observed in many of the midland counties and those bordering on the principality of wales the retreat of the ancient britons and therefore very probably intermixed with the british or druidical customs   the westsaxon lage or laws of the west saxons which obtained in the counties to the south and west of the island from kent to devonshire these were probably much the same with the laws of alfred above mentioned being the municipal law of the far most considerable part of his dominions and particularly including berkshire the seat of his peculiar residence   the danelage or danish law the very name of which speaks its original and composition this was principally maintained in the rest of the midland counties and also on the eastern coast the part most exposed to the visits of that piratical people as for the very northern provinces they were at that time under a distinct governmentf     out of these three laws roger hovedeng and ranulphus cestrensish inform us king edward the confessor extracted one uniform law or digest of laws to be observed throughout the whole kingdom though hoveden and the author of an old manuscript chroniclei assure us likewise that this work was projected and begun by his grandfather king edgar and indeed a general digest of the same nature has been constantly found expedient and therefore put in practice by other great nations which were formed from an assemblage of little provinces governed by peculiar customs as in portugal under king edward about the beginning of the fifteenth centuryk in spain under alonzo x who about the year    0 executed the plan of his father st ferdinand and collected all the provincial customs into one uniform law in the celebrated code entitled las partidasl and in sweden about the same æra when a universal body of common law was compiled out of the particular customs established    by the laghman of every province and entitled the lands lagh being analogous to the common law of englandm  both these undertakings of king edgar and edward the confessor seem to have been no more than a new edition or fresh promulgation of alfreds code or domebook with such additions and improvements as the experience of a century and a half had suggested for alfred is generally styled by the same historians the legum anglicanarum conditor as edward the confessor is the restitutor  these however are the laws which our histories so often mention under the name of the laws of edward the confessor which our ancestors struggled so hardly to maintain under the first princes of the norman line and which subsequent princes so frequently promised to keep and restore as the most popular act they could do when pressed by foreign emergencies or domestic discontents these are the laws that so vigorously withstood     the repeated attacks of the civil law which established in the twelfth century a new roman empire over most of the states of the continent states that have lost and perhaps upon that account their political liberties while the free constitution of england perhaps upon the same account has been rather improved than debased these in short are the laws which gave rise and original to that collection of maxims and customs which is now known by the name of the common law a name either given to it in contradistinction to other laws as the statute law the civil law the law merchant and the like or more probably as a law common to all the realm the jus commune or folcright mentioned by king edward the elder after the abolition of the several provincial customs and particular laws before mentioned  but though this is the most likely foundation of this collection of maxims and customs yet the maxims and customs so collected are of higher antiquity than memory or history can reach  nothing being more difficult than to ascertain the precise beginning and first spring of an ancient and long established custom whence it is that in our law the goodness of a custom depends upon its having been used time out of mind or in the solemnity of our legal phrase time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary this it is that gives it its weight and authority and of this nature are the maxims and customs which compose the common law or lex non scripta of this kingdom     this unwritten or common law is properly distinguishable into three kinds   general customs which are the universal rule of the whole kingdom and form the common law in its stricter and more usual signification   particular customs which for the most part affect only the inhabitants of particular districts   certain particular laws which by custom are adopted and used by some particular courts of pretty general and extensive jurisdiction     i as to general customs or the common law properly so called this is that law by which proceedings and determinations in the kings ordinary courts of justice are guided and directed this for the most part settles the course in which lands descend by inheritance the manner and form of acquiring and transferring property the solemnities and obligation of contracts the rules of expounding wills deeds and acts of parliament the respective remedies of civil injuries the several species of temporal offences with the manner and degree of punishment and an infinite number of minuter particulars which diffuse themselves as extensively as the ordinary distribution of common justice requires thus for example that there shall be four superior courts of record the chancery the kings bench the common pleas and the exchequer—that the eldest son alone is heir to his ancestor—that property may be acquired and transferred by writing—that a deed is of no validity unless sealed and delivered—that wills shall be construed more favourably and deeds more strictly—that money lent upon bond is recoverable by action of debt—that breaking the public peace is an offence and punishable by fine and imprisonment—all these are doctrines that are not set down in any written statute or ordinance but depend merely upon immemorial usage that is upon common law for their support some have divided the common law into two principal grounds or foundations   established customs such as that where there are three brothers the eldest brother shall be heir to the second in exclusion of the youngest and   established rules and maxims as that the king can do no wrong that no man shall be bound to accuse himself and the like but i take these to be one and the same thing for the authority of these maxims rests entirely upon general reception and usage and the only method of proving that this or that maxim is a rule of the common law is by showing that it hath been always the custom to observe it     but here a very natural and very material question arises how are these customs or maxims to be known and by whom is their validity    to be determined the answer is by the judges in the several courts of justice they are the depositaries of the laws the living oracles who must decide in all cases of doubt and who are bound by an oath to decide according to the law of the land the knowledge of that law is derived from experience and study from the viginti annorum lucubrationes which fortescuen mentions and from being long persoually accustomed to the judicial decisions of their predecessors and indeed these judicial decisions are the principal and most authoritative evidence that can be given of the existence of such a custom as shall form a part of the common law the judgment itself and all the proceedings previous thereto are carefully registered and preserved under the name of records in public repositories set apart for that particular purpose and to them frequent recourse is had when any critical question arises in the determination of which former precedents may give light or assistance and therefore even so early as the conquest we find the præteritorum memoria eventorum reckoned up as one of the chief qualifications of those who were held to be legibus patriæ optime institutio for it is an established rule to abide by former precedents where the same points come again in litigation as well to keep the scale of justice even and steady and not liable to waver with every new judges opinion as also because the law in that case being solemnly declared and determined what before was uncertain and perhaps indifferent is now become a permanent rule which it is not in the breast of any subsequent judge to alter or vary from according to his private sentiments he being sworn to determine not according to his own private judgement but according to the known laws and customs of the land not delegated to pronounce a new law but to maintain and expound the old one yet this rule admits of exception where the former determination is most evidently contrary to reason   0 much more if it be clearly contrary to the divine law but even in such cases the subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation for if it be found that the former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust  it is declared not that such a sentence was bad law but that it was not law that is that it is not the established custom of the realm as has been erroneously determined and hence it is that our lawyers are with justice so copious in their encomiums on the reason of the common law that they tell us that the law is the perfection of reason that it always intends to conform thereto and that what is not reason is not law not that the particular reason of every rule in the law can at this distance of time be always precisely assigned but it is sufficient that there be nothing in the rule flatly contradictory to reason and then the law will presume it to be well foundedp and it hath been an ancient observation in the laws of england that whenever a standing rule of law of which the reason perhaps could not be remembered or discerned hath been  0 wantonly broken in upon by statutes or new resolutions the wisdom of the rule hath in the end appeared from the inconveniences that have followed the innovation the doctrine of the law then is this that precedents and rules must be followed unless flatly absurd or unjust  for though their reason be not obvious at first view yet we owe such a deference to former times as not to suppose that they acted wholly without consideration to illustrate this doctrine by examples it has been determined time out of mind that a brother of the half blood shall never succeed as heir to the estate of his half brother but it shall  0 rather escheat to the king or other superior lord now this is a positive law fixed and established by custom which custom is evidenced by judicial decisions and therefore can never be departed from by any modern judge without a breach of his oath and     the law for herein there is nothing repugnant to natural justice  though the artificial reason of it drawn from the feodal law may not be quite obvious to everybody 0 and therefore though a modern judge on account of a supposed hardship upon the half brother might wish it had been otherwise settled yet it is not in his power to alter it but if any court were now to determine that an elder brother of the half blood might enter upon and seize any lands that were purchased by his younger brother no subsequent judges would scruple to declare that such prior determination was unjust was unreasonable and therefore was not law so that the law and the opinion of the judge are not always convertible terms or one and the same thing since it sometimes may happen that the judge may mistake the law upon the whole however we may take it as a general rule that the decisions of courts of justice are the evidence of what is common law in the same manner as in the civil law what the emperor had once determined was to serve for a guide for the futureq      the decisions therefore of courts are held in the highest regard and are not only preserved as authentic records in the treasuries of the several courts but are handed out to public view in the numerous volumes of reports which furnish the lawyers library these reports are histories of the several cases with a short summary of the proceedings which are preserved at large in the record the arguments on both sides and the reasons the court gave for its judgment taken down in short notes by persons present at the determination and these serve as indexes to and also to explain the records which always in matters of consequence and nicety the judges direct to be searched the reports are extant in a regular series from the reign of king edward the second inclusive and from this time to that of henry the     eighth were taken by the prothonotaries or chief scribes of the court at the expense of the crown and published annually whence they are known under the denomination of the year books and it is much to be wished that this beneficial custom had under proper regulations been continued to this day for though king james the first at the instance of lord bacon appointed two reportersr with a handsome stipend for this purpose yet that wise institution was soon neglected and from the reign of henry the eighth to the present time this task has been executed by many private and contemporary hands who sometimes through haste and inaccuracy sometimes through mistake and want of skill have published very crude and imperfect perhaps contradictory accounts of one and the same determination some of the most valuable of the ancient reports are those published by lord chiefjustice coke a man of infinite learning in his profession though not a little infected with the pedantry and quaintness of the times he lived in which appear strongly in all his works however his writings are so highly esteemed that they are generally cited without the authors names besides these reporters there are also other authors to whom great veneration and respect is paid by the students of the common law such are glanvil and bracton britton and fleta hengham and littleton statham brooke fitzherbert and staundforde   with some others of ancient date whose treatises are cited as authority and are evidence that cases have formerly happened in which such and such points were determined which are now become settled and first principles one of the last of these methodical writers in point of time whose works are of any intrinsic authority in the courts of justice and do not entirely depend on the strength of their quotations from older authors is the     same learned judge we have just mentioned sir edward coke who hath written four volumes of institutes as he is pleased to call them though they have little of the institutional method to warrant such a title    the first volume is a very extensive comment upon a little excellent treatise of tenures compiled by judge littleton in the reign of edward the fourth this comment is a rich mine of valuable common law learning collected and heaped together from the ancient reports and year books but greatly defective in methodt the second volume is a comment upon many old acts of parliament without any systematical order the third a more methodical treatise of the pleas of the crown and the fourth an account of the several species of courtsu and thus much for the first ground and chief cornerstone of the laws of england which is general immemorial custom or common law from time to time declared in the decisions of the courts of justice which decisions are preserved among our public records explained in our reports and digested for general use in the authoritative writings of the venerable sages of the law the roman law as practised in the times of its liberty paid also a great regard to custom but not so much as our law it only then adopting it when the written law was deficient though the reasons alleged in the digestv will fully justify our practice in making it of equal authority with when it is not contradicted by the written law for since says julianus the written law binds us for no other reason but because it is approved by the judgment of the people therefore those laws which the people have approved without writing ought also to bind everybody for where is the difference whether the people declare their     assent to a law by suffrage or by a uniform course of acting accordingly thus did they reason while rome had some remains of her freedom but when the imperial tyranny came to be fully established the civil laws speak a very different language quod principi placuit   legis habet vigorem cum populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat says ulpianw imperator solus et conditor et interpres legis existimatur says the codex and again sacrilegii instar est rescripto principis obviariy and indeed it is one of the characteristic marks of english liberty that our common law depends upon custom which carries this internal evidence of freedom along with it that it probably was introduced by the voluntary consent of the people      ii the second branch of the unwritten laws of england are particular customs or laws which affect only the inhabitants of particular districts these particular customs or some of them are without doubt the remains of that multitude of local customs before mentioned out of which the common law as it now stands was collected at first by king alfred and afterwards by king edgar and edward the confessor each district mutually sacrificing some of its own special usages in order that the whole kingdom might enjoy the benefit of one uniform and universal system of laws but for reasons that have been now long forgotten particular counties cities towns manors and lordships were very early indulged with the privilege of abiding by their own customs in contradistinction to the rest of the nation at large which privilege is confirmed to them by several acts of parliamentz such is the custom of gavelkind in kent and some other parts of the kingdom though perhaps it was also general till the norman conquest which ordains among other things     that not the eldest son only of the father shall succeed to his inheritance but all the sons alike and that though the ancestor be attainted and hanged yet the heir shall succeed to his estate without any escheat to the lord—such is the custom that prevails in divers ancient boroughs and therefore called boroughenglish that the youngest son shall inherit the estate in preference to all his elder brothers—such is the custom in other boroughs that a widow shall be entitled for her dower to all her husbands lands whereas at the common law she shall be endowed of onethird part only—such also are the special and particular customs of manors of which every one has more or less and which bind all the copyhold and customary tenants that hold of the said manors—such likewise is the custom of holding divers inferior courts with power of trying causes in cities and trading towns the right of holding which when no royal grant can be shown depends entirely upon immemorial and established usage—such lastly are many particular customs within the city of london with regard to trade apprentices widows orphans and a variety of other matters all these are contrary to the general law of the land and are good only by special usage though the customs of london are also confirmed by act of parliamenta to this head may most properly be referred a particular system of customs used only among one set of the kings subjects called the custom of merchants or lex mercatoria which however different from the general rules of the common law is yet ingrafted into it and made a part of itb being allowed for the benefit of trade to be of the utmost validity in all commercial transactions for it is a maxim of law that cuilibet in sua arte credendum est      the rules relating to particular customs regard either the proof of their exist ence their legality when proved or their usual method of allowance and first we will consider the rules of proof     as to gavelkind and boroughenglish the law takes particular notice of themc and there is no occasion to prove that such customs actually exist but only that the lands in question are subject thereto all other private customs must be particularly pleadedd and as well the existence of such customs must be shown as that the thing in dispute is within the custom alleged the trial in both cases both to show the existence of the custom as that in the manor of dale lands shall descend only to the heirs male and never to the heirs female and also to show that the lands in question are within that manor is by a jury of twelve men and not by the judges except the same particular custom has been before tried determined and recorded in the same courte the customs of london differ from all others in point of trial for if the existence of the custom be brought in question it shall not be tried by a jury but by certificate from the lord mayor and aldermen by the mouth of their recorderf    unless it be such a custom as the corporation is itself interested in as a right of taking toll c for then the law permits them not to certify on their own behalfg when a custom is actually proved to exist the next inquiry is into the legality of it for if it is not a good custom it ought to be no longer used malus usus abolendus est is an established maxim of the lawh to make a particular custom good the following are necessary requisites   that it have been used so long that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary   so that if any one can show the beginning of it it is no good custom for which reason no custom can prevail against an express act of     parliament   since the statute itself is a proof of a time when such a custom did not existi   it must have been continued any interruption would cause a temporary ceasing the revival gives it a new beginning which will be within time of memory and thereupon the custom will be void but this must be understood with regard to an interruption of the right for an interruption of the possession only for ten or twenty years will not destroy the customj as if the inhabitants of a parish have a customary right of watering their cattle at a certain pool the custom is not destroyed though they do not use it for ten years it only becomes more difficult to prove but if the right be any how discontinued for a day the custom is quite at an end   it must have been peaceable and acquiesced in not subject to contention and disputek for as customs owe their original to common consent their being immemorially disputed either at law or otherwise is a proof that such consent was wanting   customs must be reasonablel or rather taken negatively they must not be unreasonable which is not always as sir edward coke saysm to be understood of every unlearned mans reason but of artificial and legal reason warranted by authority of law upon which account a custom may be good though the particular reason of it cannot be assigned for it sufficeth if no good legal reason can be assigned against it thus a custom in a parish that no man shall put his beasts into the common till the third of october would be good and yet it would be hard to show the reason why that day in particular is fixed upon rather than the day before or after but a custom that no cattle shall be put in till the lord of the manor has first put in his is unreasonable and therefore bad for peradventure the lord will never put in his and then the tenants will lose all their profitsn       customs ought to be certain a custom that lands shall descend to the most worthy of the owners blood is void for how shall this worth be determined but a custom to descend to the next male of the blood exclusive of females is certain and therefore goodo a custom to pay twopence    an acre in lieu of tithes is good but to pay sometimes twopense and sometimes threepence as the occupier of the land pleases is bad for its uncertainty yet a custom to pay a years improved value for a fine on a copyhold estate is good though the value is a thing uncertain for the value may at any time be ascertained and the maxim of law is id certum est quod certum reddi potest     customs though established by consent must be when established comulsory and not left to the option of every man whether he will use them or no therefore a custom that all the inhabitants shall be rated toward the maintenance of a bridge will be good but a custom that every man is to contribute thereto at his own pleasure is idle and absurd and indeed no custom at all   lastly customs must be consistent with each other one custom cannot be set up in opposition to another for if both are really customs then both are of equal antiquity and both established by mutual consent which to say of contradictory customs is absurd therefore if one man prescribes that by custom he has a right to have windows looking into anothers garden the other cannot claim a right by custom to stop up or obstruct those windows for these two contradictory customs cannot both be good nor both stand together he ought rather to deny the existence of the former customp next as to the allowance of special customs customs in derogation of the common law must be construed strictly   thus by the custom of gavelkind an infant of fifteen years     may by one species of conveyance called a deed of feoffment convey away his lands in feesimple or forever yet this custom does not empower him to use any other conveyance or even to lease them for seven years for the custom must be strictly pursuedq 0 and moreover all special customs must submit to the kings prerogative therefore if the king purchases lands of the nature of gavelkind where all the sons inherit equally yet upon the kings demise his eldest son shall succeed to those lands aloner and thus much for the second part of the leges non scriptæ or those particular customs which affect particular persons or districts only      iii the third branch of them are those peculiar laws which by custom are adopted and used only in certain peculiar courts and jurisdictions and by these i understand the civil and canon lawss it may seem a little improper at first view to rank these laws under the head of leges non scriptæ or unwritten laws seeing they are set forth by authority in their pandects their codes and their institutions their councils decrees and decretals and enforced by an immense number of expositions decisions and treatises of the learned in both branches of the law but i do this after the example of sir matthew halet because it is most plain that it is not on account of their being written laws that either the canon law or the civil law have any obligation within this kingdom neither do their force and efficacy depend upon their own intrinsic authority which is the case of our written laws or acts of parliament they bind not the subjects of england because their materials were collected from popes or emperors were digested by justinian or declared to be authentic by gregory these considerations give them no authority here for the legislature of england doth not nor ever did recognise any foreign power as superior or equal to it in this kingdom or as having the right to give law to any the meanest of its subjects but all the   0 strength that either the papal or imperial laws have obtained in this realm or indeed in any other kingdom in europe is only because they have been admitted and received by immemorial usage and custom in some particular cases and some particular courts and then they form a branch of the leges non scriptæ or customary laws or else because they are in some other cases introduced by consent of parliament and then they owe their validity to the leges scriptæ or statute law this is expressly declared in those remarkable words of the statute    hen viii c    addressed to the kings royal majesty—this your graces realm recognising no superior under god but only your grace hath been and is free from subjection to any mans laws but only to such as have been devised made and ordained within this realm for the wealth of the same or to such other as by sufferance of your grace and your progenitors the people of this your realm have taken at their free liberty by their own consent to be used among them and have bound themselves by long use and custom to the observance of the same not as to the observance of the laws of any foreign prince potentate or prelate but as to the customed and ancient laws of this realm originally established as laws of the same by the said sufferance consents and custom and none otherwise by the civil law absolutely taken is generally understood the civil or municipal law of the roman empire as comprised in the institute the code and the digest of the emperor justinian and the novel constitutions of himself and some of his successors of which as there will frequently be occasion to cite them by way of illustrating our own laws it may not be amiss to give a short and general account the roman law founded first upon the regal constitutions of their ancient kings next upon the twelve tables of the decemviri then upon the laws or statutes enacted by the senate or people the edicts of the prætor and the responsa prudentum or opinions of learned lawyers and     lastly upon the imperial decrees or constitutions of successive emperors had grown to so great a bulk or as livy expresses itu tam immensus aliarum super alias acervatarum legum cumulus that they were computed to be many camels load by an author who preceded justinianv this was in part remedied by the collections of three private lawyers gregorius hermogenes and papirius and then by the emperor theodosius the younger by whose orders a code was compiled ad     being a methodical collection of all the imperial constitutions then in force which theodosian code was the only book of civil law received as authentic in    the western part of europe till many centuries after and to this it is probable that the franks and goths might frequently pay some regard in framing legal constitutions for their newly erected kingdoms for justinian commanded only in the eastern remains of the empire and it was under his auspices that the present body of civil law was compiled and finished by tribonian and other lawyers about the year     this consists of   the institutes which contain the elements or first principles of the roman law in four books   the digests or pandects in fifty books containing the opinions and writings of eminent lawyers digested in a systematical method   a new code or collection of imperial constitutions in twelve books the lapse of a whole century having rendered the former code of theodosius imperfect   the novels or new constitutions posterior in time to the other books and amounting to a supplement to the code containing new decrees of successive emperors as new questions happened to arise these form the body of roman law or corpus juris civilis as published about the time of justinian which however fell soon into neglect and oblivion till about the year    0 when a copy of the digests was found at amalfi in italy which accident concurring with the policy of the roman ecclesiasticsw suddenly gave new vogue and authority to the civil law introduced it into several nations and     occasioned that mighty inundation of voluminous comments with which this system of law more than any other is now loaded the canon law is a body of roman ecclesiastical law relative to such matters as that church either has or pretends to have the proper jurisdiction over this is compiled from the opinions of the ancient latin fathers the decrees of general councils and the decretal epistles and bulls of the holy see all which lay in the same disorder and confusion as the roman civil law till about the year      one gratian an italian monk animated by the discovery of justinians pandects reduced the ecclesiastical constitutions also into some method in three books which he entitled concordia discordantium canonum but which are generally known by the name of decretum gratiani these reached as low as the time of pope alexander iii the subsequent papal decrees to the pontificate of gregory ix were published in much the same method under the auspices of that pope about the year    0 in five books entitled decretalia gregorii noni a sixth book was added by boniface viii about the year      which is called sextus decretalium the clementine constitutions or decrees of clement v were in like manner authenticated in      by his successor john xxii who also published twenty constitutions of his own called the extravagantes joannis all which in some measure answer to the novels of the civil law to these have been since added some decrees of later popes in five books called extravagantes communes and all these together gratians decree gregorys decretals the sixth decretal the clementine constitutions and the extravagants of john and his successors form the corpus juris canonici or body of the roman canon law besides these pontifical collections which during the times of popery were received as authentic in this island as well as in other parts of christendom there is also a kind of natural canon law composed of legatine and provincial constitutions and adapted only to the exigencies of this church     and kingdom the legatine constitutions were ecclesiastical laws enacted in national synods held under the cardinals otho and othobon legates from pope gregory ix and pope clement iv in the reign of king henry iii about the years    0 and      the provincial constitutions are principally the decrees of provincial synods held under divers archbishops of canterbury from stephen langton in the reign of henry iii to henry chichele in the reign of henry v and adopted also by the province of yorkx in the reign of henry vi at the dawn of the reformation in the reign of king henry viii it was enacted in parliamenty that a review should be had of the canon law and till such review should be made all canons constitutions ordinances and synodals    provincial being then already made and not repugnant to the law of the land or the kings prerogative should still be used and executed and as no such review has yet been perfected upon this statute now depends the authority of the canon law in england as for the canons enacted by the clergy under james i in the year   0  and never confirmed in parliament it has been solemnly adjudged upon the principles of law and the constitution that where they are not merely declaratory of the ancient canon law but are introductory of new regulations they do not bind the laityz whatever regard the clergy may think proper to pay them   there are four species of courts in which the civil and canon laws are permitted under different restrictions to be used   the courts of the archbishops and bishops and their derivative officers usually called in our law courts christian curiæ christianitatis or the ecclesiastical courts   the military courts   the courts of admiralty   the courts of the two universities in all their reception in general and the different degrees of that reception are grounded entirely upon custom corroborated in the latter instance by act of     parliament ratifying those charters which confirm the customary law of the universities the more minute consideration of these will fall properly under that part of these commentaries which treats of the jurisdiction of courts it will suffice at present to remark a few particulars relative to them all which may serve to inculcate more strongly the doctrine laid down concerning thema   and first the courts of common law have the superintendency over these courts to keep them within their jurisdictions to determine wherein they exceed them to restrain and prohibit such excess and in case of contumacy to punish the officer who executes and in some cases the judge who enforces the sentence so declared to be illegal   the common law has reserved to itself the exposition of all such acts of parliament as concern either the extent of these courts or the matters depending before them and therefore if these courts either refuse to allow these acts of parliament or will expound them in any other sense than what the common law puts upon them the kings courts at westminster will grant prohibitions to restrain and control them   an appeal lies from all these courts to the king in the last resort which proves that the jurisdiction exercised in them is derived from the crown of england and not from any foreign potentate or intrinsic authority of their own—and from these three strong marks and ensigns of superiority it appears beyond a doubt that the civil and canon laws though admitted in some cases by custom in some courts are only subordinate and leges sub graviori lege and that thus admitted restrained altered newmodelled and amended they are by no means with us a distinct independent species of laws but are inferior branches of the customary or unwritten laws of england properly called the kings ecclesiastical the kings military the kings maritime or the kings academical laws     let us next proceed to the leges scriptæ the written laws of the kingdom which are statutes acts or edicts made by the kings majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parliament assembledb the oldest of these now extant and printed in our statute books is the famous magna charta as confirmed in parliament   hen iii though doubtless there were many acts before that time the records of which    are now lost and the determinations of them perhaps at present currently received for the maxims of the old common law the manner of making these statutes will be better considered hereafter when we examine the constitution of parliaments at present we will only take notice of the different kinds of statutes and of some general rules with regard to their constructionc first as to their several kinds statutes are either general or special public or private a general or public act is an     universal rule that regards the whole community and of this the courts of law are bound to take notice judicially and ex officio without the statute being particularly pleaded or formally set forth by the party who claims an advantage under it special or private acts are rather exceptions than rules being those which only operate upon particular persons and private concerns such as the romans entitled senatus decreta in contradistinction to the senatus consulta which regarded the whole communityd and of these which are not promulgated with the same notoriety as the former the judges are not bound to take notice unless they be formally shown and pleaded thus to show the distinction the statute    eliz c  0 to prevent spiritual persons from making leases for longer terms than twentyone years or three lives is a public act it being a rule prescribed to the whole body of spiritual persons in the nation but an act to enable the bishop of chester to make a lease to ab for sixty years is an exception to this rule it concerns only the parties and the bishops successors and is therefore a private act      statutes also are either declaratory of the common law or remedial of some defects therein   declaratory where the old custom of the kingdom is almost fallen into disuse or become disputable in which case the parliament has thought proper in perpetuum rei testimonium and for avoiding all doubts and difficulties to declare what the common law is and ever hath been thus the statute of treasons    edw iii cap   doth not make any new species of treasons but only for the benefit of the subject declares and enumerates those several kinds of offence which before were treason at the common law remedial statutes are those which are made to supply such defects and abridge such superfluities in the common law as arise either from the general imperfection of all human laws from change of time and circumstances from the mistakes and unadvised determinations of unlearned or even learned judges or from any other cause whatsoever and this being done either by enlarging the common law where it was too narrow and circumscribed or by restraining it     where it was too lax and luxuriant hath occasioned another subordinate division of remedial acts of parliament into enlarging and restraining statutes to instance again in the case of treason clipping the current coin of the kingdom was an offence not sufficiently guarded against by the common law therefore it was thought expedient by statute   eliz c    to make it high treason which it was not at the common law so that this was an enlarging statute   at common law also spiritual corporations might lease out their estates for any term of years till prevented by the statute    eliz before mentioned this was therefore a restraining statute secondly the rules to be observed with regard to the construction of statutes are principally these which follow     there are three points to be considered in the construction of all remedial statutes the old law the mischief and the remedy that is how the common law stood at the making of the act what the mischief was for which the common law did not provide and what remedy the parliament hath provided to cure this mischief and it is the business of the judges so to construe the act as to suppress the mischief and advance the remedye let us instance again in the same restraining statute of    eliz c  0 by the common law ecclesiastical corporations might let as long leases as they thought proper the mischief was that they let long and unreasonable leases to the impoverishment of their successors the remedy applied by the statute was by making void all leases by ecclesiastical bodies for longer terms than three lives or twentyone years now in the construction of this statute it is held that leases though for a longer    term if made by a bishop are not void during the bishops continuance in his see or if made by a dean and chapter they are not void during the continuance of the dean for the act was made for the benefit and protection of the successorf the mischief is therefore sufficiently suppressed by vacating them after the determination of the interest of the     grantors but the leases during their continuance being not within the mischief are not within the remedy   a statute which treats of things or persons of an inferior rank cannot by any general words be extended to those of a superior   so a statute treating of deans prebendaries parsons vicars and others having spiritual promotion is held not to extend to bishops though they have spiritual promotion deans being the highest persons named and bishops being of a still higher orderg   penal statutes must be construed strictly thus the statute   edw vi c    having enacted that those who are convicted of stealing horses should not have the benefit of clergy the judges conceived that this should not extend to him that should steal but one horse   and therefore procured a new act for that purpose in the following yearh and to come nearer our own times by the statute    geo ii c   stealing sheep or other cattle was made felony without benefit of clergy but these general words or other cattle being looked upon as much too loose to create a capital offence the act was held to extend to nothing but mere sheep and therefore in the next sessions it was found necessary to make another statute    geo ii c    extending the former to bulls cows oxen steers bullocks heifers calves and lambs by name        statutes against frauds 0 are to be liberally and beneficially expounded this may seem a contradiction to the last rule most statutes against frauds being in their consequences penal but this difference is here to be taken where the statute acts upon the offender and inflicts a penalty as the pillory or a fire it is then to be taken strictly but when the statute acts upon the offence by setting aside the fraudulent transaction   here it is to be construed liberally upon this footing the statute of    eliz c   which avoids all gifts of goods c made to defraud creditors and others was     held to extend by the general words to a gift made to defraud the queen of a forfeiturei        one part of a statute must be so construed by another that the whole may if possible stand ut res magis valeat quam pereat as if land be vested in the king and his heirs by act of parliament saving the right of a and a has at that time a lease of it for three years here a shall hold it for his term of three years and afterwards it shall go to the king for this interpretation furnishes matter for every clause of the statute to work and operate upon but   a saving totally repugnant to the body of the act is void if therefore an act of parliament vests land in the king and his heirs saving the right of all persons whatsoever or vests the land of a in the king saving the right of a in either of these cases the saving is totally repugnant to the body of the statute and if good would render the statute of no effect or operation and therefore the saving is void and the land vests absolutely in the kingk     where the common law and a statute differ the common law gives place to the statute and an old statute gives place to a new one and this upon a general principle of universal law that leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant consonant to which it was laid down by a law of the twelve tables at rome that quod populus postremum jussit id jus ratum esto but this is to be understood only when the letter statute is couched in negative terms or where its matter is so clearly repugnant that it necessarily implies a negative as if a former act says that a juror upon such a trial shall have twenty pounds a year and a new statute afterwards enacts that he shall have twenty marks here the latter statute though it does not express yet necessarily implies a negative and virtually repeals the former for if twenty marks be made qualification sufficient the former statute which requires twenty pounds is at an endl but if both acts be merely affirmative   0 and the substance such that both may stand together here the latter does not repeal the former but they shall both have a concurrent efficacy if by a former law an offence be indictable at the quartersessions and a latter law makes the same offence indictable at the assizes here the jurisdiction of the sessions is not taken away but both have a concurrent jurisdiction and the offender may be prosecuted at either unless the new statute subjoins express negative words as that the offence shall be indictable at the assizes and not elsewherem    0   if a statute that repeals another is itself repealed afterwards the first statute is hereby revived without any formal words for that purpose so when the statutes of    and    hen viii declaring the king to be the supreme head of the church were repealed by a statute   and   philip and mary and this latter statute was afterwards repealed by an act of   eliz there needed not any express words of revival in queen elizabeths statute but these acts of king henry were impliedly and virtually revivedn     acts of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent parliaments bind not so the statute    hen vii c   which directs that no person for assisting a king de facto shall be attainted of treason by act of parliament or otherwise is held to be good only as to common prosecutions for high treason but will not restrain or clog any parliamentary attaindero because the legislature being in truth the sovereign power is always of equal always of absolute authority it acknowledges no superior upon earth which the prior legislature must have been if its ordinances could bind a subsequent parliament and upon the same principle cicero in his letters to atticus treats with a proper contempt these restraining clauses which endeavour to tie up the hands of succeeding legislatures when you repeal the     law itself says he you at the same time repeal the prohibitory clause which guards against such repealp  0 lastly acts of parliament that are impossible to be performed are of no validity and if there arise out of them collaterally any absurd consequences manifestly contradictory to common reason they are with regard to those collateral consequences void   i lay down the rule with these restrictions though i know it is generally laid down more largely that acts of parliament contrary to reason are void but if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable i know of no power in the ordinary forms of the constitution that is vested with authority to control it and the examples usually alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature which would be subversive of all government but where some collateral matter arises out of the general words and happens to be unreasonable there the judges are in decency to conclude that this consequence was not foreseen by the parliament and therefore they are at liberty to expound the statute by equity and only quoad hoc disregard it thus if an act of parliament gives a man power to try all causes that arise within his manor of dale yet if a cause should arise in    which he himself is party the act is construed not to extend to that because it is unreasonable that any man should determine his own quarrelq but if we could conceive it possible for the parliament to enact that he should try as well his own causes as those of other persons there is no court that has power to defeat the intent of the legislature when couched in such evident and express words as leave no doubt whether it was the intent of the legislature or no   these are the several grounds of the laws of england over and above which equity is also frequently called in to     assist to moderate and to explain them what equity is and how impossible in its very essence to be reduced to stated rules hath been shown in the preceding section i shall therefore only add that besides the liberality of sentiment with which our common law judges interpret acts of parliament and such rules of the unwritten law as are not of a positive kind there are also peculiar courts of equity established for the benefit of the subject to detect latent frauds and concealments which the process of the courts of law is not adapted to reach to enforce the execution of such matters of trust and confidence as are binding in conscience though not cognizable in a court of law to deliver from such dangers as are owing to misfortune or oversight and to give a more specific relief and more adapted to the circumstances of the case than can always be obtained by the generality of the rules of the positive or common law this is the business of our courts of equity which however are only conversant in matters of property for the freedom of our constitution will not permit that in criminal cases a power    should be lodged in any judge to construe the law otherwise than according to the letter this caution while it admirably protects the public liberty can never bear hard upon individuals a man cannot suffer more punishment than the law assigns but he may suffer less the laws cannot be strained by partiality to inflict a penalty beyond what the letter will warrant but in cases where the letter induces any apparent hardship the crown has the power to pardon section iv of the countries subject to the laws of england the kingdom of england over which our municipal laws have jurisdiction includes not by the common law either wales scotland or ireland or any other part of the kings dominions except the territory of england only and yet the civil laws and local customs of this territory do now obtain in part or in all with more or less restrictions in these and many other adjacent countries of which it will be proper first to take a review before we consider the kingdom of england itself the original and proper subject of these laws wales had continued independent of england unconquered and uncultivated in the primitive pastoral state which cæsar and tacitus ascribe to britain in general for many centuries even from the time of the hostile invasions of the saxons when the ancient and christian inhabitants of the island retired to those natural intrenchments for protection from their pagan visitants but when these invaders themselves were converted to christianity and settled into regular and potent governments this retreat of the ancient britons grew every day narrower they were overrun by little and little gradually driven from one fastness to another and by repeated losses abridged of their wild independence very early in our history we find their princes doing homage to the crown of england till at length in the reign of edward the first who may justly be styled the conqueror of     wales the line of their ancient princes was abolished and the king of englands eldest son became as a matter of course  their titular prince the territory of wales being then entirely reannexed by a kind of feodal resumption to the dominion of the crown of englanda or as the statute  of rhudlanb expresses it terra walliæ cum incolis suis prius regi jure feodali subjecta of which homage was the sign jam in proprietatis dominium totaliter et cum integritate conversa est et coronæ regni angliæ tanquam pars corporis ejusdem annexa et unita by the statute also of walesc very material alterations were made in divers parts of their laws so    as to reduce them nearer to the english standard especially in the forms of their judicial proceedings but they still retained very much of their original polity particularly their rule of inheritance viz that their lands were divided equally among all the issue male and did not descend to the eldest son alone by other subsequent statutes their provincial immunities were still farther abridged but the finishing stroke to their independency was given by the statute    hen viii c    which at the same time gave the utmost advancement to their civil prosperity by admitting them to a thorough communication of laws with the subjects of england thus were this brave people gradually conquered into the enjoyment of true liberty being insensibly put upon the same footing and made fellowcitizens with their conquerors a generous method of triumph which the republic of rome practised with great success till she reduced all italy to her obedience by admitting the vanquished states to partake of the roman privileges it is enacted by this statute    henry viii   that the dominion of wales shall be forever united to the kingdom of england   that all welshmen born shall have the same liberties as other the kings subjects   that lands in wales shall be inheritable according to the english tenures and rules of descent   that the laws of england and no other shall     be used in wales besides many other regulations of the police of this principality and the statute    and    hen viii c    confirms the same adds farther regulations divides it into twelve shires and in short reduces it into the same order in which it stands at this day differing from the kingdom of england in only a few particulars and those too of the nature of privileges such as having courts within itself independent of the process of westminsterhall and some other immaterial peculiarities hardly more than are to be found in many counties of england itself the kingdom of scotland notwithstanding the union of the crowns on the accession of their king james vi to that of england continued an entirely separate and distinct kingdom for above a century more though an union had been long projected which was judged to be the more easy to be done as both kingdoms were anciently under the same government and still retained a very great resemblance though far from an identity in their laws by an act of parliament   jac i c   it is declared that these two mighty famous and ancient kingdoms were formerly one and sir edward coke observesd how marvellous a conformity there was not only in the religion and language of the two nations but also in their ancient laws the descent of the crown their parliaments their titles of nobility their officers of state and of justice their writs their customs and even the language of their laws upon which account he supposes the common law of each to have been originally the same especially as their most ancient and authentic book called regiam majestatem and containing the rules of their ancient common law is extremely similar to that of glanvil which contains the principles of ours as it stood in the reign of henry ii and the many diversities subsisting between the two laws at present may be well enough accounted for from a diversity of practice in two large and uncommunicating jurisdictions and from the acts of two distinct and independent parliaments which have in many points altered and abrogated the old common law of both kingdoms         however sir edward coke and the politicians of that time conceived great difficulties in carrying on the projected union but these were at length overcome and the great work was happily effected in   0    anne when twentyfive articles of union were agreed to by the parliaments of both nations the purport of the most considerable being as follows   that on the first of may   0  and forever after the kingdoms of england and scotland shall be united into one kingdom by the name of great britain   the succession to the monarchy of great britain shall be the same as was before settled with regard to that of england   the united kingdom shall be represented by one parliament   there shall be a communication of all rights and privileges between the subjects of both kingdoms except where it is otherwise agreed   when england raises  000000l by a land tax scotland shall raise   000l       the standards of the coin of weights and of measures shall be reduced to those of england throughout the united kingdoms    the laws relating to trade customs and the excise shall be the same in scotland as in england but all the other laws of scotland shall remain in force though alterable by the parliament of great britain yet with this caution that laws relating to public policy are alterable at the discretion of the parliament laws relating to private right are not to be altered but for the evident utility of the people of scotland        sixteen peers are to be chosen to represent the peerage of scotland in parliament and fortyfive members to sit in the house of commons        the sixteen peers of scotland shall have all privileges of parliament and all peers of scotland shall be peers of great britain and rank next after those of the same degree at the time of the union and shall have all privileges of peers except sitting in the house of lords and voting on the trial of a peer     these are the principal of the twentyfive articles of union which are ratified and confirmed by statute   ann c   in which statute there are also two acts of parliament recited the one of scotland whereby the church of scotland and also the four universities of that kingdom are established forever and all succeeding sovereigns are to take an oath inviolably to maintain the same the other of england   ann c   whereby the acts of uniformity of    eliz and    car ii except as the same had been altered by parliament at that time and all other acts then in force for the preservation of the church of england are declared perpetual and it is stipulated that every subsequent king and queen shall take an oath inviolably to maintain the same within england ireland wales and the town of berwick upon tweed and it is enacted that these two acts shall forever be observed as fundamental and essential conditions of the union upon these articles and act of union it is to be observed   that the two kingdoms are now so inseparably united that nothing can ever disunite them again except the mutual consent of both or the successful resistance of either upon apprehending an infringement of those points which when they were separate and independent nations it was mutually stipulated should be fundamental and essential conditions of the unione   that whatever else may be deemed fundamental     and essential conditions the preservation of the two churches of england and scotland in the same state that they were in at the time of the union and the maintenance of the acts of uniformity which establish our common prayer are expressly declared so to be   that therefore any alteration in the constitution of either of those churches or in the liturgy of the church of england unless with the consent of the respective churches collectively or representatively given would be an infringement of these fundamental and essential conditions and greatly endanger the union   that the municipal laws of scotland are ordained to be still observed in that part of the island unless altered by parliament and as the parliament has not yet thought proper except in a few instances to alter them they still with regard to the particulars unaltered continue in full force wherefore    the municipal or common laws of england are generally speaking of no force or validity in scotland and of consequence in the ensuing commentaries we shall have very little occasion to mention any further than sometimes by way of illustration the municipal laws of that part of the united kingdoms the town of berwick upon tweed was originally part of the kingdom of scotland and as such was for a time reduced     by king edward i into the possession of the crown of england and during such its subjection it received from that prince a charter which after its subsequent cession by edward balliol to be forever united to the crown and realm of england was confirmed by king edward iii with some additions particularly that it should be governed by the laws and usages which it enjoyed during the time of king alexander that is before its reduction by edward i its constitution was newmodelled and put upon an english footing by a charter of king james i and all its liberties franchises and customs were confirmed in parliament by the statutes    edward iv c   and   jac i c    though therefore it hath some local peculiarities derived from the ancient laws of scotlandf yet it is clearly part of the realm of england being represented by burgesses in the house of commons and bound by all acts of the british parliament whether specially named or otherwise and therefore it was perhaps superfluously declared by statute  0 geo ii c    that where england only is mentioned in any act of parliament the same notwithstanding hath and shall be deemed to comprehend the dominion of wales and town of berwick upon tweed and though certain of the kings writs or processes of the courts of westminster do not usually run into berwick any more than the principality of wales yet it hath been solemnly adjudgedg that all prerogative writs as those of mandamus prohibition habeas corpus certiorari c may issue to berwick as well as to every other of the dominions of the crown of england and that indictments and other local matters arising in the town of berwick may be tried by a jury of the county of northumberland  as to ireland that is still a distinct kingdom though a dependent subordinate kingdom it was only entitled the dominion or lordship of irelandh and the kings style was no other than dominus hiberniæ lord of ireland till the thirtythird year of king henry the eighth when he assumed the   00 title of king which is recognised by act of parliament    hen viii c   but as scotland and england are now one and the same kingdom and yet differ in their municipal laws so england and ireland are on the other hand distinct kingdoms and yet in general agree in their laws the inhabitants of ireland are for the most part descended from the english who planted it as a kind of colony after the conquest of it by king henry the second and the laws of england were then received and sworn to by the irish nation assembled at the council of lismorei and as ireland thus conquered planted and governed still continues in a state of dependence it must necessarily conform to and be obliged by such laws as the superior state thinks proper to prescribe at the time of this conquest the irish were governed by what they called the brehon law so styled from the irish name of judges who were denominated brehonsk but king john in the twelfth year of his reign went into ireland and carried over with him many able sages of the law and there by his letters patent in right of the dominion of conquest is said to have ordained and established that ireland should be governed by the laws of englandl which letters patent sir edward cokem apprehends to have been there confirmed in parliament  00 but to this ordinance many of the irish were averse to conform and still stuck to their brehon law so that both henry the thirdn and edward the firsto were obliged to renew the injunction and at length in a parliament holden at kilkenny  0 edw iii under lionel duke of clarence the then lieutenant of ireland the brehon law was formally abolished it being unanimously declared to be indeed no law but a lewd custom crept in of later times and yet even in the reign of queen elizabeth the   0  wild natives still kept and preserved their brehon law which is describedp to have been a rule of right unwritten but delivered by tradition from one to another in which oftentimes there appeared great show of equity in determining the right between party and party but in many things repugnant quite both to gods laws and mans the latter part of this character is alone ascribed to it by the laws before cited of edward the first and his grandson but as ireland was a distinct dominion and had parliaments of its own it is to be observed that though the immemorial customs or common law of england were made the rule of justice in ireland also yet no acts of the english parliament since the twelfth of king john extended into that kingdom unless it were specially named or included under general words such as within any of the kings dominions and this is particularly expressed and the reason given in the year booksq a tax granted by the parliament of england shall not bind those of ireland because they are not summoned to our parliament and again ireland hath a parliament of its own and maketh and altereth laws and our statutes do not bind them because they do not send knights to our parliament but their persons are the kings subjects like as the inhabitants of calais gascoigne and guienne while they continued under the kings subjection the general run of laws enacted by the superior state are supposed to be calculated for its own internal government and do not extend to its distant dependent countries which bearing no part in the legislature are not therefore in its ordinary and daily contemplation but when the sovereign legislative power sees it necessary to extend its care to any of its subordinate dominions and mentions them expressly by name or includes them under general words there can be no doubt but then they are bound by its lawsr   0  the original method of passing statutes in ireland was nearly the same as in england the chief governor holding parliaments at his pleasure which enacted such laws as they thought propers but an ill use being made of this liberty particularly by lord gormanstown deputylieutenant in the reign of edward ivt a set of statutes were then enacted in the  0 hen vii sir edward poynings being then lord deputy whence they are called poynings laws one of whichu in order to restrain the power as well of the deputy as the irish parliament provides   that before any parliament be summoned or holden the chief governor and council of ireland shall certify to the king under the great seal of ireland the consideration and causes thereof and the articles of the acts proposed to be passed therein   that after the king in his council of england shall have considered approved or altered the said acts or any of them and certified them back under the great seal of england and shall have given license to summon and hold a parliament then the same shall be summoned and held and therein the said acts so certified and no other shall be proposed received or rejectedw but as this precluded any law from being proposed but such as were preconceived before the parliament was in being which occasioned many inconveniences and made frequent dissolutions necessary it was provided by the statute of philip and mary before cited that any new propositions might be certified to england in the usual forms even after the summons and during the session of parliament by this means however there was nothing left to the parliament in ireland but a bare negative  0  or power of rejecting not of proposing or altering any law but the usage now is that bills are often framed in either house under the denomination of heads for a bill or bills and in that shape they are offered to the consideration of the lord lieutenant and privy council who upon such parliamentary intimation or otherwise upon the application of private persons receive and transmit such   0  heads or reject them without any transmission to england and with regard to poynings law in particular it cannot be repealed or suspended unless the bill for that purpose before it be certified to england be approved by both the housesx but the irish nation being excluded from the benefit of the english statutes were deprived of many good and profitable laws made for the improvement of the common law and the measure of justice in both kingdoms becoming thence no longer uniform it was therefore enacted by another of poynings lawsy that all acts of parliament before made in england should be of force within the realm of irelandz but by the same rule that no laws made in england between king johns time and poynings law were then binding in ireland it follows that no acts of the english parliament made since the  0 hen vii do now bind the people of ireland unless specially named or included under general wordsa and on the other hand it is equally clear that where ireland is particularly named or is included under general words they are bound by such acts of parliament for this follows from the very nature and constitution of a dependent state dependence being very little else but an obligation to conform to the will or law of that superior person or state upon which the inferior depends the original and true ground of this superiority in the present case is what we usually call though somewhat improperly the right of conquest a right allowed by the law of nations if not by that of nature but which in reason and civil policy can mean nothing more than that in order to put an end to hostilities a compact is either expressly or tacitly made between the conqueror and the conquered that if they will acknowledge the victor for their master he will treat them for the future as subjects and not as enemiesb   0  but this state of dependence being almost forgotten and ready to be disputed by the irish nation it became necessary some years ago to declare how that matter really stood and therefore by statute   geo i c   it is declared that the kingdom of ireland ought to be subordinate to and dependent upon the imperial crown of great britain as being inseparably united thereto and that the kings majesty with the consent of the lords and commons of great britain in parliament hath power to make laws to bind the people of ireland  thus we see how extensively the laws of ireland communicate with those of england and indeed such communication is highly necessary as the ultimate resort from the courts of justice in ireland is as in wales to those in england a writ of error in the nature of an appeal lying from the kings bench in ireland to the kings bench in englandc as the appeal from the chancery in ireland lies immediately to the house of lords here it being expressly declared by the same statute   geo i c   that the peers of ireland have no jurisdiction to affirm or reverse any judgments or decrees whatsoever the propriety and even necessity in all inferior dominions of this constitution that though justice be in general administered by courts of their own yet that the appeal  0  in the last resort ought to be to the courts of the superior state is founded upon these two reasons   because otherwise the law appointed or permitted to such inferior dominion might be insensibly changed within itself without the assent of the superior   because otherwise judgments might be given to the disadvantage or diminution of the superiority or to make the dependence to be only of the person of the king and not of the crown of englandd   0  with regard to the other adjacent islands which are subject to the crown of great britain some of them as the isle of   0  wight of portland of thanet c are comprised within some neighbouring county and are therefore to be looked upon as annexed to the mother island and part of the kingdom of england but there are others which require a more particular consideration and first the isle of man is a distinct territory from england and is not governed by our laws neither doth any act of parliament extend to it unless it be particularly named therein and then an act of parliament is binding theree it was formerly a subordinate feudatory kingdom subject to the kings of norway then to king john and henry iii of england afterwards to the kings of scotland and then again to the crown of england and at length we find king henry iv claiming the island by right of conquest and disposing of it to the earl of northumberland upon whose attainder it was granted by the name of the lordship of man to sir john de stanley by letters patent   henry ivf in his lineal descendants it continued for eight generations till the death of ferdinando earl of derby ad      when a controversy arose concerning the inheritance thereof between his daughters and  0  william his surviving brother upon which and a doubt that was started concerning the validity of the original patentg the island was seized into the queens hands and afterwards various grants were made of it by king james the first all which being expired or surrendered it was granted afresh in   jac i to william earl of derby and the heirs male of his body with remainder to his heirs general which grant was the next year confirmed by act of parliament with a restraint of the power of alienation by the said earl and his issue male on the death of james earl of derby ad      the male line of earl william failing the duke of atholl succeeded to the island as heir general by a female branch in the mean time though the title of king had been long disused the earls of derby as lords of man had maintained a sort of royal authority therein by assenting or   0  dissenting to laws and exercising an appellate jurisdiction yet though no english writ or process from the courts of westminster was of any authority in man an appeal lay from a decree of the lord of the island to the king of great britain in councilh but the distinct jurisdiction of this little subordinate royalty being found inconvenient for the purposes of public justice and for the revenue it affording a commodious asylum for debtors outlaws and smugglers authority was given to the treasury by statute    geo i c    to purchase the interest of the then proprietors for the use of the crown which purchase was at length completed in the year      and confirmed by statutes   geo iii c    and    whereby the whole island and all its dependencies so granted as aforesaid except the landed property of the atholl family their manorial rights and emoluments and the patronage of the bishoprici and other ecclesiastical benefices are unalienably vested in the crown and subjected to the regulations of the british excise and customs the islands of jersey guernsey sark alderney and their appendages were parcel of the duchy of normandy and were united to the crown of england by the first princes of the norman line they are governed by their own laws which are for the most part the ducal customs of normandy being collected in an ancient book of very great authority entitled le grand coustumier the kings writ or process from the courts of westminster is there of no force but his commission is they are not bound by common acts of our parliaments unless particularly namedk all causes are originally determined by their own officers the bailiffs and jurats of the islands but an appeal lies from them to the king and council in the last resort besides these adjacent islands our more distant plantations in america and elsewhere are also in some respect subject to the english laws plantations or colonies in distant   0  countries are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only by finding them desert and uncultivated and peopling them from the mothercountry or where when already cultivated they have been either gained by conquest or ceded to us by treaties and both these rights are founded upon the law of nature or at least upon that of nations but there is a difference between these two species of colonies with respect to the laws by which they are bound for it hath  0  been heldl that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by english subjects all the english laws then in being which are the birthright of every subjectm are immediately there in force but this must be understood with very many and very great restrictions such colonists carry with them only so much of the english law as is applicable to their own situation and the condition of an infant colony such for instance as the general rules of inheritance and of protection from personal injuries the artificial refinements and distinctions incident to the property of a great and commercial people the laws of police and revenue such especially as are enforced by penalties the mode of maintenance for the established clergy the jurisdiction of spiritual courts and a multitude of other provisions are neither necessary nor convenient for them and therefore are not in force  what shall be admitted and what rejected at what times and under what restrictions must in case of dispute be decided in the first instance by their own provincial judicature subject to the revision and control of the king in council the whole of their constitution being also liable to be newmodelled and reformed by the general superintending power of the legislature in the mothercountry but in conquered or ceded countries that have already laws of their own the king may indeed alter and change those laws 0 but till he does actually change them the ancient laws of the country remain unless such as are against the law of god as in the case of an infidel countryn our american plantations are principally of this latter sort being obtained in the last century either by right of conquest and driving out the natives with what natural justice i shall not at present inquire   0  or by treaties and therefore the common law of england as such has no allowance or authority there they being no part of the mothercountry but distinct though dependent dominions they are subject however to the control of the parliament though like ireland man and the rest not bound by any acts of parliament unless particularly named    0  with respect to their interior polity our colonies are properly of three sorts   provincial establishments the constitutions of which depend on the respective commissions issued by the crown to the governors and the instructions which usually accompany those commissions under the authority of which provincial assemblies are constituted with the power of making local ordinances not repugnant to the laws of england   proprietary governments granted out by the crown to individuals in the nature of feudatory principalities with all the inferior regalities and subordinate powers of legislation which formerly belonged to the owners of countiespalatine yet still with these express conditions that the ends for which the grant was made be substantially pursued and that nothing be attempted which may derogate from the sovereignty of the mothercountry   charter governments in the nature of civil corporations with the power of making byelaws for their own interior regulations not contrary to the laws of england and with such rights and authorities as are specially given them in their several charters of incorporation the form of government in most of them is borrowed from that of england they have a governor named by the king or in some proprietary colonies by the proprietor who is his representative or deputy they have courts of justice of their own from whose decisions an appeal lies to the king and council here in england their general assemblies which are their house of commons together with their council of state being their upper house with the concurrence of the king or his representative the governor  0  make laws suited to their own emergencies   but it is particularly declared by statute   and   w iii c    that   0  all laws byelaws usages and customs which shall be in practice in any of the plantations repugnant to any law made or to be made in this kingdom relative to the said plantations shall be utterly void and of none effect and because several of the colonies had claimed a sole and exclusive right of imposing taxes upon themselves the statute   geo iii c    expressly declares that all his majestys colonies and plantations in america have been are and of right ought to be subordinate to and dependent upon the imperial crown and parliament of great britain who have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient validity to bind the colonies and people of america subjects of the crown of great britain in all cases whatsoever and this authority has been since very forcibly exemplified and carried into act by the statute   geo iii c    for suspending the legislation of new york and by several subsequent statutes   these are the several parts of the dominions of the crown of great britain in which the municipal laws of england are not of force or authority merely  0  as the municipal laws of england most of them have probably copied the spirit of their own law from this original but then it receives its obligation and authoritative force from being the law of the country as to any foreign dominions which may belong to the person of the king by hereditary descent by purchase or other acquisition as the territory of hanover and his majestys other property in germany as these do not in any wise appertain to the crown of these kingdoms they are entirely unconnected with the laws of england and do not communicate with this nation in any respect whatsoever the english legislature had wisely remarked the inconveniences that had formerly resulted from dominions on the continent of europe from the norman territory which william the conqueror brought with him and held in conjunction with the    0 english throne and from anjou and its appendages which fell to henry the second by hereditary descent they had seen the nation engaged for near four hundred years together in ruinous wars for defence of these foreign dominions till happily for this country they were lost under the reign of henry the sixth they observed that from that time the maritime interests of england were better understood and more closely pursued that in consequence of this attention the nation as soon as she had rested from her civil wars began at this period to flourish all at once and became much more considerable in europe than when her princes were possessed of a large territory and her councils distracted by foreign interests this experience and these considerations gave birth to a conditional clause in the acto of settlement which vested the crown in his present majestys illustrious house that in case the crown and imperial dignity of this realm shall hereafter come to any person not being a native of this kingdom of england this nation shall not be obliged to engage in any war for the defence of any dominions or territories which do not belong to the crown of england without consent of parliament we come now to consider the kingdom of england in particular the direct and immediate subject of those laws concerning which we are to treat in the ensuing commentaries and this comprehends not only wales and berwick of which enough has been already said but also part of the sea the main or high seas are part of the realm of england for thereon our courts of admiralty have jurisdiction as will be shown hereafter but they are not subject to the common lawp   this main sea begins at the lowwater mark but between the highwater mark and the lowwater mark where the sea ebbs and flows the common law and admiralty have divisum imperium an alternate jurisdiction one upon the water when it is full sea the other upon the land when it is an ebbq          the territory of england is liable to two divisions the one ecclesiastical the other civil   the ecclesiastical division is primarily into two provinces those of canterbury and york a province is the circuit of an archbishops jurisdiction each province contains divers dioceses or sees of suffragan bishops whereof canterbury includes twentyone and york three besides the bishopric of the isle of man which was annexed to the province of york by king henry viii every diocese is divided into archdeaconries whereof there are sixty in all each archdeaconry into rural deaneries which are the circuit of the archdeacons and rural deans jurisdiction of whom hereafter and every deanery is divided into parishesr a parish is that circuit of ground which is committed to the charge of one parson or vicar or other minister having cure of souls therein these districts are computed to be near ten thousand in numbers how ancient the division of parishes is may at present be difficult to ascertain for it seems to be agreed on all hands that in the early ages of christianity in this island parishes were unknown or at least signified the same that a diocese does now there was then no appropriation of ecclesiastical dues to any particular church but every man was at liberty to contribute his tithes to whatever priest or church he pleased provided only that he did it to some or if he made no special appointment or appropriation thereof they were paid into the hands of the bishop whose duty it was to distribute them among the clergy and for other pious purposes according to his own discretiont mr camdenu says england was divided into parishes by archbishop honorius about the year   0 sir henry hobartw lays it down that parishes were first erected by the council of lateran which was held ad      each widely differing      from the other and both of them perhaps from the truth which will probably be found in the medium between the two extremes for mr selden has clearly shownx that the clergy lived in common without any division of parishes long after the time mentioned by camden and it appears from the saxon laws that parishes were in being long before the date of that council of lateran to which they are ascribed by hobart we find the distinction of parishes nay even of motherchurches so early as in the laws of king edgar about the year   0 before that time the consecration of tithes was in general arbitrary that is every man paid his own as was before observed to what church or parish he pleased but this being liable to be attended with either fraud or at least caprice in the persons paying and with either jealousies or mean compliances in such as were competitors for receiving them it was now ordered by the law of king edgary that dentur omnes decimæ primariæ ecclesiæ ad quam parochia pertinet however if any thane or great lord had a church within his own demesnes distinct from the motherchurch in the nature of a private chapel then provided such church had a cemetery or consecrated place of burial belonging to it he might allot onethird of his tithes for the maintenance of the officiating minister but if it had no cemetery the thane must himself have maintained his chaplain by some other means for in such case all his tithes were ordained to be paid to the primariæ ecclesiæ or motherchurchz this proves that the kingdom was then generally divided into parishes which division happened probably not all at once but by degrees for it seems pretty clear and certain that the boundaries of parishes were originally ascertained by those of a manor or manors since it very seldom happens that a manor extends itself over more parishes than one though there are often many manors in one parish      the lords as christianity spread itself began to build churches upon their own demesnes or wastes to accommodate their tenants in one or two adjoining lordships and in order to have divine service regularly     performed therein obliged all their tenants to appropriate their tithes to the maintenance of the one officiating minister instead of leaving them at liberty to distribute them among the clergy of the diocese in general and this tract of land the tithes whereof were so appropriated formed a distinct parish which will well enough account for the frequent intermixture of parishes one with another for if a lord had a parcel of land detached from the main of his estate but not sufficient to form a parish of itself it was natural for him to endow his newly erected church with the tithes of those disjointed lands especially if no church was then built in any lordship adjoining to those outlying parcels thus parishes were gradually formed and parish churches endowed with the tithes that arose within the circuit assigned but some lands either because they were in the hands of irreligious and careless owners or were situate in forests and desert places or for other now unsearchable reasons were never united to any parish and therefore continue to this day extraparochial and their tithes are now by immemorial custom payable to the king instead of the bishop in trust and confidence that he will distribute them for the general good of the churcha yet extraparochial wastes and marshlands when improved and drained are by the statute    geo ii c    to be assessed to all parochial rates in the parish next adjoining and thus much for the ecclesiastical division of this kingdom   the civil division of the territory of england is into counties of those counties into hundreds of those hundreds into tithings or towns which division as it now stands seems to owe its original to king alfred   who to prevent      the rapines and disorders which formerly prevailed in the realm instituted tithings so called from the saxon because ten freeholders with their families composed one these all dwelt together and were sureties or free pledges to the king for the good behaviour of each other and if any offence was committed in their district they were bound to have the offender forthcomingb and therefore anciently no man was suffered to abide in england above forty days unless he were enrolled in some tithing or decennaryc one of the principal inhabitants of the tithing is annually appointed to preside ever the rest being called the tithingman the headborough words which speak their own etymology and in some countries the borsholder or boroughsealder being supposed the discreetest man in the borough town or tithingd tithings towns or vills are of the same signification in law and are said to have had each of them originally a church and celebration of divine service sacraments and burialse though that seems to be rather an ecclesiastical than a civil distinction the word town or vill is indeed by the alteration of times and language now become a generical term comprehending under it the several species of cities boroughs and common towns a city is a town incorporated which is or hath been the see of a bishop and though the     bishopric be dissolved as at westminster   yet it still remaineth a cityf a borough is now understood to be a town either corporate or not that sendeth burgesses to parliamentg other towns there are to the number sir edward coke saysh of   0  which are neither cities nor boroughs some of which have the privileges of markets and others not but both are equally towns in law to several of these towns there are small appendages belonging called      hamlets which are taken notice of in the statute of exeteri which makes frequent mention of entire vills demivills and hamlets entire vills sir henry spelmank conjectures to have consisted of ten freemen or frankpledges demivills of five and hamlets of less than five these little collections of houses are sometimes under the same administration as the town itself sometimes governed by separate officers in which last case they are to some purposes in law looked upon as distinct townships these towns as was before hinted contained each originally but one parish and one tithing though many of them now by the increase of inhabitants are divided into several parishes and tithings and sometimes where there is but one parish there are two or more vills or tithings as ten families of freeholders made up a town or tithing so ten tithings composed a superior division called a hundred as consisting of ten times ten families the hundred is governed by a high constable or bailiff and formerly there was regularly held in it the hundred court for the trial of causes though now fallen into disuse in some of the more northern counties these hundreds are called wapentakesl   the subdivision of hundreds into tithings seems to be most peculiarly the     invention of alfred the institution of hundreds themselves he rather introduced than invented for they seem to have obtained in denmarkm and we find that in france a regulation of this sort was made above two hundred years before set on foot by clotharius and childebert with a view of obliging each district to answer for the robberies committed in its own division these divisions were in that country as well military as civil and each contained a hundred freemen who were subject to an officer called the centenarius a number of which centenarii were themselves subject to a superior officer called the count or comesn and      indeed something like this institution of hundreds may be traced back as far as the ancient germans from whom were derived both the franks who became masters of gaul and the saxons who settled in england for both the thing and the name as a territorial assemblage of persons from which afterwards a territory itself might properly receive its denomination were well known to that warlike people centeni ex singulis pagis sunt idque ipsum inter suos vocantur et quod primo numerus fuit jam nomen et honor esto an indefinite number of these hundreds make up a county or shire shire is a saxon word signifying a division but a county comitatus is plainly derived from comes the count of the franks that is the earl or alderman as the saxons called him of the shire to whom the government of it was intrusted this he usually exercised by his deputy still called in latin vicecomes and in english the sheriff shrieve or shirereeve signifying the officer of the shire upon whom by process of time the civil administration of it is now totally devolved in some counties there is an intermediate division between the shire and the hundreds as lathes in kent and rapes in sussex each of them containing about three or four hundreds apiece these had formerly their lathereeves and rapereeves acting in subordination to the shirereeve where a county is divided into three of these intermediate jurisdictions they are called trithingsp which were anciently governed by a trithingreeve these trithings still subsist in the large county of york where by an easy corruption they are denominated ridings the north the east and the west riding the number of counties in england and wales have been different at different times at present they are forty in england and twelve in wales three of these counties chester durham and lancaster are called counties palatine the two former are such by prescription or immemorial custom or at least as old as      the norman conquestq the latter was created by king edward iii in favour of henry plantagenet first earl and then duke of lancasterr whose heiress being married to john of gaunt the kings son the franchise was greatly enlarged and confirmed in parliaments to honour john of gaunt himself whom on the death of his fatherinlaw the king had also created duke of lancastert counties palatine are so called a palatio because the owners thereof the earl of chester the bishop of durham and the duke of lancaster had in those counties jura regalia as fully as the king hath in his palace regalem potestatem in omnibus as bracton expresses itu they might pardon treasons murders and felonies they appointed all judges and justices of the peace all writs and indictments ran in their names as in other counties in the kings and all offences were said to be done against their peace and not as in other places contra pacem domini regisw and indeed by the ancient law in all peculiar jurisdictions offences were said to be done against his peace in whose court they were tried in a courtleet contra pacem domini in the court of a corporation contra pacem ballivorum in the sheriffs court or tourn contra pacem vicecomitisx these palatine privileges so similar to the regal independent jurisdictions usurped by the great barons on the continent during the weak and infant state of the first feodal kingdoms in europey were in all probability originally granted to the counties of chester and durham     because they bordered upon inimical countries wales and scotland in order that the inhabitants having justice administered at home might not be obliged to go out of the county and leave it open to the enemys incursions and that the owners being encouraged by so large an authority might be the more watchful in its defence and upon this account also there were formerly two other counties palatine      pembrokeshire and hexhamshire the latter now united with northumberland but these were abolished by parliament the former in    hen viii the latter in    eliz and in    hen viii likewise the powers before mentioned of owners of counties palatine were abridged the reason for their continuance in a manner ceasing though still all writs are witnessed in their names and all forfeitures for treason by the common law accrue to themz of these three the county of durham is now the only one remaining in the hands of a subject for the earldom of chester as camden testifies was united to the crown by henry iii and has ever since given title to the kings eldest son and the county palatine or duchy of lancaster was the property of henry bolingbroke the son of john of gaunt at the time when he wrested the crown from king richard ii and assumed the title of king henry iv but he was too prudent to suffer this to be united to the crown lest if he lost one he should lose the other also for as plowdena and sir edward cokeb observe he knew he had the duchy of lancaster by sure and indefeasible title but that his title to the crown was not so assured for that after the decease of richard ii the right heir of the crown was in the heir of lionel duke of clarence second son of edward iii john of gaunt father to this henry iv being but the fourth son and therefore he procured an act of parliament in the first year of his reign ordaining that the duchy of lancaster and all other his hereditary estates with all their royalties and franchises should remain to him and his heirs forever and should remain descend be administered and governed in like manner as if he never had attained the regal dignity and thus they descended to his son and grandson henry v and henry vi many new territories and privileges being annexed to the duchy by the formerc henry vi being attainted in   edw iv this duchy was declared in parliament      to have become forfeited to the crownd and at the same time an act was made to incorporate the duchy of lancaster to continue the county palatine which might otherwise have determined by the attaindere and to make the same parcel of the duchy and farther to vest the whole in king edward iv and his heirs kings of england forever but under a separate guiding and governance from the other inheritances of the crown and in   hen vii another act was made to resume such parts of the duchy lands as had been dismembered from it in the reign of edw iv and to vest the inheritance of the whole in the king and his heirs forever as amply and largely and in like manner form and condition separate from the crown of england and possession of the same as the three henries and edward iv or any of them had and held the samef the isle of ely is not a county palatine though sometimes erroneously called so but only a royal franchise the bishop having by grant of king henry the first jura regalia within the isle of ely whereby he exercises a jurisdiction over all causes as well criminal as civilg   0    0 there are also counties corporate which are certain cities and towns some with more some with less territory annexed to them to which out of special grace and favour the kings of england have granted the privilege to be counties of themselves and not to be comprised in any other county but to be governed by their own sheriffs and other magistrates so that no officers of the county at large have any power to intermeddle therein such are london york bristol norwich coventry and many others and thus much of the countries subject to the laws of england       commentaries on the laws of england book the first of the rights of persons chapter i of the absolute rights of individuals the objects of the laws of england are so very numerous and extensive that in order to consider them with any tolerable ease and perspicuity it will be necessary to distribute them methodically under proper and distinct heads avoiding as much as possible divisions too large and comprehensive on the one hand and too trifling and minute on the other both of which are equally productive of confusion      now as municipal law is a rule of civil conduct commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong or as ciceroa and after him our bractonb have expressed it sanctio justa jubens honesta et prohibens contraria it follows that the primary and principal object of the law are rights and wrongs in the prosecution therefore of these commentaries i shall follow this very simple and obvious division and shall in the first place consider the rights that are commanded and secondly the wrongs that are forbidden by the laws of england rights are however liable to another subdivision being either first those which concern and are annexed to the persons of men and are then called jura personarum or the rights of persons or they are secondly such as a man may acquire over external objects or things unconnected with his person which are styled jura rerum or the rights of things wrongs also are divisible into first private wrongs which being an infringement merely of particular rights concern individuals only and are called civil injuries and secondly public wrongs which being a breach of general and public rights affect the whole community and are called crimes and misdemesnors the objects of the laws of england falling into this fourfold division the present commentaries will therefore consist of the four following parts   the rights of persons with the means whereby such rights may be either acquired or lost   the rights of things with the means also of acquiring or losing them   private wrongs or civil injuries with the means of redressing them by law   public wrongs or crimes and misdemesnors with the means of prevention and punishment      we are now first to consider the rights of persons with the means of acquiring and losing them      now the rights of persons that are commanded to be observed by the municipal law are of two sorts first such as are due from every citizen which are usually called civil duties and secondly such as belong to him which is the more popular acceptation of rights or jura both may indeed be comprised in this latter division for as all social duties are of a relative nature at the same time that they are due from one man or set of men they must also be due to another but i apprehend it will be more clear and easy to consider many of them as duties required from rather than as rights belonging to particular persons thus for instance allegiance is usually and therefore most easily considered as the duty of the people and protection as the duty of the magistrate and yet they are reciprocally the rights as well as duties of each other allegiance is the right of the magistrate and protection the right of the people persons also are divided by the law into either natural persons or artificial natural persons are such as the god of nature formed us artificial are such as are created and devised by human laws for the purposes of society and government which are called corporations or bodies politic the rights of persons considered in their natural capacities are also of two sorts absolute and relative absolute which are such as appertain and belong to particular men merely as individuals or single persons relative which are incident to them as members of society and standing in various relations to each other the first that is absolute rights will be the subject of the present chapter by the absolute rights of individuals we mean those which are so in their primary and strictest sense such as would belong to their persons merely in a state of nature and which every man is entitled to enjoy whether out of society or in it but with regard to the absolute duties which man is bound      to perform considered as a mere individual it is not to be expected that any human municipal law should at all explain or enforce them for the end and intent of such laws being only to regulate the behaviour of mankind as they are members of society and stand in various relations to each other they have consequently no concern with any other but social or relative duties let a man therefore be ever so abandoned in his principles or vicious in his practice provided he keeps his wickedness to himself and does not offend against the rules of public decency he is out of the reach of human laws but if he makes his vices public though they be such as seem principally to affect himself as drunkenness or the like then they become by the bad example they set of pernicious effects to society and therefore it is then the business of human laws to correct them here the circumstance of publication is what alters the nature of the case public sobriety is a relative duty and therefore enjoined by our laws private sobriety is an absolute duty which whether it be performed or not human tribunals can never know and therefore they can never enforce     it by any civil sanction  but with respect to rights the case is different human laws define and enforce as well those rights which belong to a man considered as an individual as those which belong to him considered as related to others for the principal aim of society is to protect individuals in the enjoyment of those absolute rights which were vested in them by the immutable laws of nature but which could not be preserved in peace without that mutual assistance and intercourse which is gained by the institution of friendly and social communities hence it follows that the first and primary end of human laws is to maintain and regulate these absolute rights of individuals such rights as are social and relative result from and are posterior to the formation of states and societies so that to maintain and regulate these is clearly a subsequent consideration and therefore the principal view of human laws is or ought always to be to explain protect and enforce such rights as are absolute which in      themselves are few and simple and then such rights as are relative which arising from a variety of connections will be far more numerous and more complicated these will take up a greater space in any code of laws and hence may appear to be more attended to—though in reality they are not—than the rights of the former kind let us therefore proceed to examine how far all laws ought and how far the laws of england actually do take notice of these absolute rights and provide for their lasting security      the absolute rights of man considered as a free agent endowed with discernment to know good from evil and with power of choosing those measures which appear to him to be most desirable are usually summed up in one general appellation and denominated the natural liberty of mankind this natural liberty consists properly in a power of acting as one thinks fit without any restraint or control unless by the law of nature being a right inherent in us by birth and one of the gifts of god to man at his creation when he endued him with the faculty of free will but every man when he enters into society gives up a part of his natural liberty as the price of so valuable a purchase and in consideration of receiving the advantages of mutual commerce obligos himself to conform to those laws which the community has thought proper to establish and this species of legal obedience and conformity is infinitely more desirable than that wild and savage liberty which is sacrificed to obtain it for no man that considers a moment would wish to retain the absolute and uncontrolled power of doing whatever he pleases the consequence of which is that every other man would also have the same power and then there would be no security to individuals in any of the enjoyments of life political therefore or civil liberty which is that of a member of society is no other than natural liberty so far restrained by human laws and no farther as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of the publicc hence we may collect that the law which restrains a man from doing      mischief to his fellowcitizens though it diminishes the natural increases the civil liberty of mankind but that every wanton and causeless restraint of the will of the subject whether practised by a monarch a nobility or a popular assembly is a degree of tyranny nay that even laws themselves whether made with or without our consent if they regulate and constrain our conduct in matters of more indifference without any good end in view are regulations destructive     of liberty whereas if any public advantage can arise from observing such precepts the control of our private inclinations in one or two particular points will conduce to preserve our general freedom in others of more importance by supporting that state of society which alone can secure our independence thus the statute of king edward ivd which forbade the fine gentlemen of those times under the degree of a lord to wear pikes upon their shoes or boots of more than two inches in length was a law that savoured of oppression because however ridiculous the fashion then in use might appear the restraining it by pecuniary penalties could serve no purpose of common utility but the statute of king charles iie  which prescribes a thing seemingly as indifferent a dress for the dead who are all ordered to be buried in woollen is a law consistent with public liberty for it encourages the staple trade on which in great measure depends the universal good of the nation so that laws when prudently framed are by no means subversive but rather introductive of liberty for as mr locke has well observedf where there is no law there is no freedom but then on the other hand that constitution or frame of government that system of laws is alone calculated to maintain civil liberty which leaves the subject entire master of his own conduct except in those points wherein the public good requires some direction or restraint      the idea and practice of this political or civil liberty flourish in their highest vigour in these kingdoms where it falls      little short of perfection and can only be lost or destroyed by the folly or demerits of its owner the legislature and of course the laws of england being peculiarly adapted to the preservation of this inestimable blessing even in the meanest subject very     different from the modern constitutions of other states on the continent of europe and from the genius of the imperial law which in general are calculated to vest an arbitrary and despotic power of controlling the actions of the subject in the prince or in a few grandees and this spirit of liberty is so deeply implanted in our constitution and rooted even in our very soil that a slave or a negro the moment he lands in england falls under the protection of the laws and so far becomes a freemang though the masters right to his service may possibly still continue  the absolute rights of every englishman which taken in a political and extensive sense are usually called their liberties as they are founded on nature and reason so they are coeval with our form of government though subject at times to fluctuate and change their establishment excellent as it is being still human at some times we have seen them depressed by overbearing and tyrannical princes at others so luxuriant as even to tend to anarchy a worse state than tyranny itself as any government is better than none at all  but the vigour of our free constitution has always delivered the nation from these embarrassments and as soon as the convulsions consequent on the struggle have been over the balance of our rights and liberties has settled to its proper level and their fundamental articles have been from time to time asserted in parliament as often as they were thought to be in danger      first by the great charter of liberties which was obtained sword in hand from king john and afterwards with some alterations confirmed in parliament by king henry the third his son which charter contained very few new grants but as sir edward cokeh observes was for the most part declaratory of the principal grounds of the fundamental      laws of england afterwards by the statute called confirmatio cartarumi whereby the great     charter is directed to be allowed as the common law all judgments contrary to it are declared void copies of it are ordered to be sent to all cathedral churches and read twice a year to the people and sentence of excommunication is directed to be as constantly denounced against all those that by word deed or counsel act contrary thereto or in any degree infringe it next by a multitude of subsequent corroborating statutes sir edward coke i think reckons thirtytwok from the first edward to henry the fourth then after a long interval by the petition of right which was a parliamentary declaration of the liberties of the people assented to by king charles the first in the beginning of his reign which was closely followed by the still more ample concessions made by that unhappy prince to his parliament before the fatal rupture between them and by the many salutary laws particularly the habeas corpus act passed under charles the second to these succeeded the bill of rights or declaration delivered by the lords and commons to the prince and princess of orange   th of february      and afterwards enacted in parliament when they became king and queen which declaration concludes in these remarkable words—and     they do claim demand and insist upon all and singular the premises as their undoubted rights and liberties and the act of parliament itselfl recognises all and singular the rights and liberties asserted and claimed in the said declaration to be the true ancient and indubitable rights of the people of this kingdom lastly these liberties were again asserted at the commencement of the present century in the act of settlementm whereby the crown was limited to his present majestys illustrious house and some new provisions were added at the same fortunate era for better securing our religion laws and liberties which the statute declares to be the birthright of the people of england according to the ancient doctrine of the common lawn      thus much for the declaration of our rights and liberties the rights themselves thus defined by these several statutes consist in a number of private immunities which will appear from what has been premised to be indeed no other than either that residuum of natural liberty which is not required by the laws of society to be sacrificed to public convenience or else those civil privileges which society hath engaged to provide in lieu of the natural liberties so given up by individuals these therefore were formerly either by inheritance or purchase the rights of all mankind but in most other countries of the world being now more or less debased and destroyed they at present may be said to remain in a peculiar and emphatical manner the rights of the people of england and these may be reduced to three principal or primary articles the right of personal security the right of personal liberty and the right of private property because as there is no other known method of compulsion or abridging mans natural free will but by an infringement or diminution of one or other of these important rights the preservation of these inviolate may justly be said to include the preservation of our civil immunities in their largest and most extensive sense i the right of personal security consists in a persons legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life his limbs his body his health and his reputation   life is the immediate gift of god a right inherent by nature in every individual and it begins in contemplation of law as soon as an infant is able to stir in the mothers womb for if a woman is quick with child and by a potion or otherwise killeth it in her womb or if any one beat her whereby the child dieth in her body and she is delivered of a dead child this though not murder  was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughtero but the modern law doth not look    0 upon this offence in quite so atrocious a light 0 but merely as a heinous misdemesnorp an infant in ventre sa mere or in the mothers womb is supposed in law to be born for many purposes   it is capable of having a legacy or a surrender of a copyhold estate made to it it may have a guardian assigned to itq and it is enabled to have an estate limited to its use and to take afterwards by such limitation   0 as if it were then actually bornr and in this point the civil law agrees with ourss   a mans limbs by which for the present we only understand those members which may be useful to him in fight and the loss of which alone amounts to mayhem by the common law are also the gift of the wise creator to enable him to protect himself from external injuries in a state of nature to these therefore he has a natural inherent right and they cannot be wantonly destroyed or disabled without a manifest breach of civil liberty both the life and limbs of a man are of such high value in the estimation of the law of england that it pardons even homicide if committed se defendendo or in order to preserve them for whatever is done by a man to save either life or member is looked upon as done upon the highest necessity and compulsion therefore if a man through fear of death or mayhem is prevailed upon to execute a deed or do any other legal act these though accompanied with all other the requisite solemnities may be afterwards avoided if forced upon him by a wellgrounded apprehension of losing his life or even his limbs in case of his noncompliancet and the same is also a sufficient excuse for the commission of many misdemesnors as will appear in the fourth book the constraint a man is under in these circumstances is called in law duress from the latin durities of which there are two      sorts duress of imprisonment where a man actually loses his liberty of which we shall presently speak and duress per minas where the hardship is only threatened and impending which is that we are now discoursing of duress per minas is either for fear of loss of life or else for fear of mayhem or loss of limb and this fear must be upon sufficient reason non as bracton expresses it suspicio cujuslibet vani et meticulosi hominis sed talis qui possit cadere in virum constantem talis enim debet esse metus qui in se contineat vitæ periculum aut corporis cruciatumu a fear of battery or being beaten though never so well grounded is no duress neither is     the fear of having ones house burned or ones goods taken away and destroyed because in these cases should the threat be performed a man may have satisfaction by recovering equivalent damagesx but no suitable atonement can be made for the loss of life or limb and the indulgence shown to a man under this the principal sort of duress the fear of losing his life or limbs agrees also with that maxim of the civil law ignoscitur ei qui sanguinem suum qualiter redemptum voluit   the law not only regards life and member and protects every man in the enjoyment of them but also furnishes him with every thing necessary for their support for there is no man so indigent or wretched but he may demand a supply sufficient for all the necessities of life from the more opulent part of the community by means of the several statutes enacted for the relief of the poor of which in their proper places a humane provision yet though dictated by the principles of society discountenanced by the roman laws for the edicts of the emperor constantine commanding the public to maintain the children of those who were unable to provide for them in order to prevent the murder and exposure of infants an institution founded on the same principle as our foundling hospitals though comprised in the theodosian codey were rejected in justinians collection      these rights of life and member can only be determined by the death of the person which was formerly accounted to be either a civil or natural death the civil death commenced if any man was banished or abjured the realmz by the process of the common law or entered into religion that is went into a monastery and became there a monk professed in which cases he was absolutely dead in law and his next heir should have his estate for such banished man was entirely cut off from society and such a monk upon his profession renounced solemnly all secular concerns and besides as the popish clergy claimed an exemption from the duties of civil life and the commands of the temporal magistrate the genius of the english laws would not suffer those persons to enjoy the benefits of society who secluded themselves from it and refused to submit to its regulationsa a monk was therefore counted civiliter mortuus and when he entered into religion might like other dying men make his testament and executors or if he made none the ordinary might grant administration to his next of kin as if he were actually dead intestate and such executors and administrators had the same power and might bring the same actions for debts due to the religious and were liable to the same actions for those due from him as if he were naturally deceasedb nay so far has this principle been carried that when one was bound in a bond to an abbot and his successors and afterwards made his executors and professed himself a monk of the same abbey and in process of time was himself made abbot thereof here the law gave him in the capacity of abbot an action of debt against his own executors to recover the money duec in short a monk or religious was so effectually dead in law that a lease made even to a third person during the life generally of one who afterwards became a monk determined by such his entry into religion for which reason leases and other conveyances for life were usually made to have and to hold for the term of ones natural lifed     but      even in the times of popery the law of england took no cognizance of profession in any foreign country because the fact could not be tried in our courtse and therefore since the reformation this disability is held to be abolishedf as is also the disability of banishment consequent upon abjuration by statute    jac i c      this natural life being as was before observed the immediate donation of the great creator cannot legally be disposed of or destroyed by any individual neither by the person himself nor by any other of his fellowcreatures merely upon their own authority yet nevertheless it may by the divine permission be frequently forfeited for the breach of those laws of society which are enforced by the sanction of capital punishments of the nature restrictions expedience and legality of which we may hereafter more conveniently inquire in the concluding book of these commentaries at present i shall only observe that whenever the constitution of a state vests in any man or body of men a power of destroying at pleasure without the direction of laws the lives or members of the subject such constitution is in the highest degree tyrannical and that whenever any laws direct such destruction for light and trivial causes such laws are likewise tyrannical though in an inferior degree because here the subject is aware of the danger he is exposed to and may by prudent caution provide against it the statute law of england does therefore very seldom and the common law does never inflict any punishment extending to life or limb unless upon the highest necessity   and the constitution is an utter stranger to any arbitrary power of killing or maiming the subject without the express warrant of law nullus liber homo says the great charterg aliquo modo destruatur nisi per legale judicium parium suorum aut per legem terræ which words aliquo modo destruatur according to sir edward cokeh include a prohibition not only of killing and maiming but also of torturing to which our laws are strangers and of every oppression by colour of an illegal authority and it is enacted by the statute of   edw iii c   that no man shall be forejudged of life or limb contrary to the great charter and the      law of the land and again by statute    edw iii c   that no man shall be put to death without being brought to answer by due process of law   besides those limbs and members that may be necessary to a man in order to defend himself or annoy his enemy the rest of his person or body is also entitled by the same natural right to security from the corporal insults of menaces assaults beating and wounding though such insults amount not to destruction of life or member   the preservation of a mans health from such practices as may prejudice or annoy it and   the security of his reputation or good name from the arts of detraction and slander are rights to which every man is entitled by reason and natural justice since without these it is impossible to have the perfect enjoyment of any other advantage or right but these three last articles being of much less importance than those which have gone before and those which are yet to come it will suffice to have barely mentioned among the rights of persons referring     the more minute discussion of their several branches to those parts of our commentaries which treat of the infringement of these rights under the head of personal wrongs ii next to personal security the law of england regards asserts and preserves the personal liberty of individuals this personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion of changing situation or moving ones person to whatsoever place ones own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint unless by due course of law concerning which we may make the same observations as upon the preceding article that it is a right strictly natural that the laws of england have never abridged it without sufficient cause and that in this kingdom it cannot ever be abridged at the mere discretion of the magistrate without the explicit permission of the laws here again the language of the great      charteri is that no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned but by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land   and many subsequent old statutesj expressly direct that no man shall be taken or imprisoned by suggestion or petition to the king or his council unless it be by legal indictment or the process of the common law by the petition of right   car i it is enacted that no freeman shall be imprisoned or detained without cause shown to which he may make answer according to law by    car   c  0 if any person be restrained of his liberty by order or decree of any illegal court or by command of the kings majesty in person or by warrant of the council board or of any of the privy council he shall upon demand of his counsel have a writ of habeas corpus to bring his body before the court of kings bench or common pleas who shall determine whether the cause of his commitment be just and thereupon do as to justice shall appertain and by    car ii c   commonly called the habeas corpus act the methods of obtaining this writ are so plainly pointed out and enforced that so long as this statute remains unimpeached no subject of england can be long detained in prison except in those cases in which the law requires and justifies such detainer       and lest this act should be evaded by demanding unreasonable bail or sureties for the prisoners appearance it is declared by   w and m st   c   that excessive bail ought not to be required of great importance to the public is the preservation of this personal liberty for if once it were left in the power of any the highest magistrate to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought proper as in france it is daily practised by the crownk there would soon be an end of all other rights and immunities some have thought that unjust attacks even upon life or property at the arbitrary will of the magistrate      are less dangerous to the commonwealth than such as are made upon the personal liberty of the subject to bereave a man of life or by violence to confiscate his estate without accusation or trial would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole kingdom but confinement of the person by secretly hurrying him to jail where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten is a less public a less striking and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government and yet sometimes when the state is in real danger even this may be a necessary measure but the happiness of our constitution is that it is not left to the executive power to determine when the danger of the state is so great as to render this measure expedient for it is the parliament only or legislative power that whenever it sees proper can authorize the crown by suspending the habeas corpus act for a short and limited time to imprison suspected persons without giving any reason for so doing as the senate of rome was wont to have recourse to a dictator a magistrate of absolute authority when they judged the republic in any imminent danger the decree of the senate which usually preceded the nomination of this magistrate dent operam consules ne quid respublica detrimenti capiat was called the senatus consultum ultimæ necessitatis in like manner this experiment ought only to be tried in cases of extreme emergency and in these the nation parts with its liberty for a while in order to preserve it forever the confinement of the person in any wise is an imprisonment so that the keeping a man against his will in a private house putting him in the stocks arresting or forcibly detaining him in the street is an imprisonmentl and the law so much discourages unlawful confinement that if a man is under duress of imprisonment which we before explained to mean a compulsion by an illegal restraint of liberty until he seals a bond or the like he may allege this duress and avoid the extorted bond but if a man be lawfully imprisoned          and either to procure his discharge or on any other fair account seals a bond or a deed this is not by duress of imprisonment and he is not at liberty to avoid itm to make imprisonment lawful it must either be by process from the courts of judicature or by warrant from some legal officer having authority to commit to prison which warrant must be in writing under the hand and seal of the magistrate and express the causes of the commitment in order to be examined into if necessary upon a habeas corpus   if there be no cause expressed the jailer is not bound to detain the prisonern for the law judges in this respect saith sir edward coke like festus the roman governor that it is unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to signify withal the crimes alleged a natural and regular consequence of this personal liberty is that every englishman may claim a right to abide in his own country so long as he pleases and not to be driven from it unless by the sentence of the law the king indeed by his royal prerogative may issue out his writ ne exeat regno and prohibit any of his subjects from going into foreign parts without licenseo this may be necessary for the public service and safeguard of the commonwealth but no power on earth except the authority of parliament can send any subject of england out of the land against his will no not even a criminal for exile and transportation are punishments at present unknown to the common law and wherever the latter is now inflicted it is either by the choice of the criminal himself to escape a capital punishment or else by the express direction of some modern act of parliament   to this purpose the great charterp declares that no freeman shall be banished unless by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land and by the habeas corpus act    car ii c   that second magna carta and stable bulwark of our liberties it is enacted that no subject of this realm who is an inhabitant of england wales or berwick shall be sent prisoner into scotland ireland jersey guernsey or places beyond the seas where      they cannot have the full benefit and protection of the common law but that all such imprisonments shall be illegal that the person who shall dare to commit another contrary to this law shall be disabled from bearing any office shall incur the penalty of a præmunire and be incapable of receiving the kings pardon and the party suffering shall also have his private action against the person committing and all his aiders advisers and abettors and shall recover treble costs besides his damages which no jury shall assess at less than five hundred pounds the law is in this respect so benignly and liberally construed for the benefit of the subject that though within the realm the king may command the attendance and service of all his liegemen yet he cannot send any man out of the realm even upon the public service excepting sailors and soldiers the nature of whose employment necessarily implies an exception he cannot even constitute a man lord deputy or lieutenant of ireland against his will nor make him a foreign ambassadorq for this might in reality be no more than an honourable exile     iii the third absolute right inherent in every englishman is that of property which consists in the free use enjoyment and disposal of all his acquisitions without any control or diminution save only by the laws of the land the original of private property is probably founded in nature as will be more fully explained in the second book of the ensuing commentaries but certainly the modifications under which we at present find it the method of conserving it in the present owner and of translating it from man to man are entirely derived from society and are some of those civil advantages in exchange for which every individual has resigned a part of his natural liberty the laws of england are therefore in point of honour and justice extremely watchful in ascertaining and protecting this right upon this principle the great charterr has declared that no freeman shall be disseised or divested of his freehold or of his liberties or free      customs but by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land and by a variety of ancient statutess it is enacted that no mans lands or goods shall be seized into the kings hands against the great charter and the law of the land and that no man shall be disinherited nor put out of his franchises or freehold unless he be duly brought to answer and be forejudged by course of law and if any thing be done to the contrary it shall be redressed and holden for none so great moreover is the regard of the law for private property that it will not authorize the least violation of it no not even for the general good of the whole community if a new road for instance were to be made through the grounds of a private person it might perhaps be extensively beneficial to the public but the law permits no man or set of men to do this without consent of the owner of the land in vain may it be urged that the good of the individual ought to yield to that of the community for it would be dangerous to allow any private man or even any public tribunal to be the judge of this common good and to decide whether it be expedient or no besides the public good is in nothing more essentially interested than in the protection of every individuals private rights as modelled by the municipal law in this and similar cases the legislature alone can and indeed frequently does interpose and compel the individual to acquiesce but how does it interpose and compel not by absolutely stripping the subject of his property in an arbitrary manner but by giving him a full indemnification and equivalent for the injury thereby sustained the public is now considered as an individual treating with an individual for an exchange all that the legislature does is to oblige the owner to alienate his possessions for a reasonable price and even this is an exertion of power which the legislature indulges with caution and which nothing but the legislature can perform     0    0 nor is this the only instance in which the law of the land has postponed even public necessity to the sacred and inviolable rights of private property for no subject of england can be constrained to pay any aids or taxes even for the defence of the realm or the support of government but such as are imposed by his own consent or that of his representatives in parliament by the statute    edw i c   and   it is provided that the king shall not take any aids or tasks but by the common assent of the realm and what that common assent is is more fully explained by    edw i st   c   whicht enacts that no talliage or aid shall be taken without the assent of the archbishops bishops earls barons knights burgesses and other freemen of the land and again by    edw iii st   c   the prelates earls barons and commons citizens burgesses and merchants shall not be charged to make any aid if it be not by the common assent of the great men and commons in parliament and as this fundamental law had been shamefully evaded under many succeeding princes by compulsive loans and benevolences extorted without a real and voluntary consent it was made an article in the petition of right   car i that no man shall be compelled to yield any gift loan or benevolence tax or such like charge without common consent by act of parliament and lastly by the statute   w and m st   c   it is declared that levying money for or to the use of the crown by pretence of prerogative without grant of parliament or for longer time or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted is illegal in the three preceding articles we have taken a short view of the principal absolute rights which appertain to every englishman 0 but in vain would   0 these rights be declared ascertained and protected by the dead letter of the laws if the      constitution had provided no other method to secure their actual enjoyment it has therefore established certain other auxiliary subordinate rights of the subject which serve principally as outworks or barriers to protect and maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights of personal security personal liberty and private property these are   the constitution powers and privileges of parliament of which i shall treat at large in the ensuing chapter   the limitation of the kings prerogative by bounds so certain and notorious that it is impossible he should either mistake or legally exceed them without the consent of the people of this also i shall treat in its proper place the former of these keeps the legislative power in due health and vigour so as to make it improbable that laws should be enacted destructive of general liberty the latter is a guard upon the executive power by restraining it from acting either beyond or in contradiction to the laws that are framed and established by the other   a third subordinate right of every englishman is that of applying to the courts of justice for redress of injuries since the law is in england the supreme arbiter of every mans life liberty and property courts of justice must at all times be open to the subject and the law be duly administered therein the emphatical words of magna cartau spoken in the person of the king who in judgment of law says sir edward cokew is ever present and repeating them in all his courts are these nulli vendemus nulli negabimus aut differemus rectum vel justitiam and therefore every subject continues the same learned author for injury done to him in bonis in terris vel persona by any other subject be he ecclesiastical or temporal without any exception may take his remedy by the course of the law and have justice and right for the injury done to him freely without sale fully without any denial and speedily without delay it were endless to enumerate all the affirmative acts of parliament      wherein justice is directed to be done according to the law of the land and what that law is every subject knows or may know if he pleases for it depends not upon the arbitrary will of any judge but is permanent fixed and unchangeable unless by authority of parliament     i shall however just mention a few negative statutes whereby abuses perversions or delays of justice especially by the prerogative are restrained it is ordained by magna cartax that no freeman shall be outlawed that is put out of the protection and benefit of the laws but according to the law of the land by   edw iii c   and    ric ii c  0 it is enacted that no commands or letters shall be sent under the great seal or the little seal the signet or privy seal in disturbance of the law or to disturb or delay common right and though such commandments should come the judges shall not cease to do right which is also made a part of their oath by statute    edw iii st   and by   w and m st   c   it is declared that the pretended power of suspending or dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal not only the substantial part or judicial decisions of the law but also the formal part or method of proceeding cannot be altered but by parliament for if once those outworks were demolished there would be an inlet to all manner of innovation in the body of the law itself the king it is true may erect new courts of justice but then they must proceed according to the oldestablished forms of the common law for which reason it is declared in the statute    car i c  0 upon the dissolution of the court of starchamber that neither his majesty nor his privy council have any jurisdiction power or authority by english bill petition articles libel which were the course of proceeding in the starchamber borrowed from the civil law or by any other arbitrary way whatsoever to examine or draw into question determine or dispose of the lands or goods of any subjects of this kingdom but that the same ought to be tried and determined in the ordinary courts of justice and by course of law        if there should happen any uncommon injury or infringement of the rights before mentioned which the ordinary course of law is too defective to reach there still remains a fourth subordinate right appertaining to every individual namely the right of petitioning the king or either house of parliament for the redress of grievances   in russia we are toldy that the czar peter established a law that no subject might petition the throne till he had first petitioned two different ministers of state in case he obtained justice from neither he might then present a third petition to the prince but upon pain of death if found to be in the wrong the consequence of which was that no one dared to offer such third petition and grievances seldom falling under the notice of the sovereign he had little opportunity to redress them the restrictions for some there are which are laid upon petitioning in england are of a nature extremely different and while they promote the spirit of peace they are no check upon that of liberty care only must be taken lest under the pretence of petitioning the subject be guilty of any riot or tumult as happened in the opening of the memorable parliament in    0 and to prevent this it is provided by the statute    car ii st   c   that no petition to the king or either house of parliament for any alteration in church or state shall be signed by above twenty persons unless the matter thereof be approved by three justices of the peace or the major part of the grand jury   in the country and in london by the lord mayor aldermen and common     council nor shall any petition be presented by more than ten persons at a time but under these regulations it is declared by the statute   w and m st   c   that the subject hath a right to petition and that all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal   the fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject that i shall at present mention is that of having arms for their defence suitable to their condition and degree and such as are      allowed by law   which is also declared by the same statute   w and m st   c   and is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions of the natural right of resistance and selfpreservation when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression in these several articles consist the rights or as they are frequently termed the liberties of englishmen liberties more generally talked of than thoroughly understood and yet highly necessary to be perfectly known and considered by every man of rank and property lest his ignorance of the points whereon they are founded should hurry him into faction and licentiousness on the one hand or a pusillanimous indifference and criminal submission on the other and we have seen that these rights consist primarily in the free enjoyment of personal security of personal liberty and of private property so long as these remain inviolate the subject is perfectly free for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights having no other object upon which it can possibly be employed to preserve these from violation it is necessary that the constitution of parliament be supported in its full vigour and limits certainly known be set to the royal prerogative and lastly to vindicate these rights when actually violated or attacked the subjects of england are entitled in the first place to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law next to the right     of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances and lastly to the right of having and using arms for selfpreservation and defence and all these rights and liberties it is our birthright to enjoy entire unless where the laws of our country have laid them under necessary restraints restraints in themselves so gentle and moderate as will appear upon further inquiry that no man of sense or probity would wish to see them slackened for all of us have it in our choice to do every thing that a good man would desire to do and are restrained from nothing but what would be pernicious either to ourselves or our fellowcitizens so that this review      of our situation may fully justify the observation of a learned french author who indeed generally both thought and wrote in the spirit of genuine freedomz and who hath not scrupled to profess even in the very bosom of his native country that the english is the only nation in the world where political or civil liberty is the direct end of its constitution recommending therefore to the student in our laws a further and more accurate search into this extensive and important title i shall close my remarks upon it with the expiring wish of the famous father paul to his country esto perpetua chapter ii of the parliament we are next to treat of the rights and duties of persons as they are members of society and stand in various relations to each other these relations are either public or private and we will first consider those that are public the most universal public relation by which men are connected together is that of government namely as governors or governed or in other words as magistrates and people of magistrates some also are supreme in whom the sovereign power of the state resides others are subordinate deriving all their authority from the supreme magistrate accountable to him for their conduct and acting in an inferior secondary sphere in all tyrannical governments the supreme magistracy or the right of both making and of enforcing the laws is vested in one and the same man or one and the same body of men and wherever these two powers are united together there can be no public liberty the magistrate may enact tyrannical laws and execute them in a tyrannical manner since he is possessed in quality of dispenser of justice with all the power which he as legislator thinks proper to give himself but where the legislative and executive authority are in distinct hands the former will take care not to intrust the latter with so large a power as may tend to the subversion of its own independence and therewith of the liberty of the subject with us therefore in england this supreme power is divided into      two branches the one legislative to wit the parliament consisting of king lords and commons the other executive consisting of the king alone it will be the business of this chapter to consider the british parliament in which the legislative power and of course the supreme and absolute authority of the state is vested by our constitution      the original or first institution of parliament is one of those matters which lie so far hidden in the dark ages of antiquity that the tracing of it out is a thing equally difficult and uncertain the word parliament itself parlement or colloquium as some of our historians translate it is comparatively of modern date derived from the french and signifying an assembly that met and conferred together  it was first applied to general assemblies of the states under louis vii in france about the middle of the twelfth centurya but it is certain that long before the introduction of the norman language into england all matters of importance were debated and settled in the great councils of the realm a practice which seems to have been universal among the northern nations particularly the germansb and carried by them into all the countries of europe which they overran at the dissolution of the roman empire relics of which constitution under various modifications and changes are still to be met with in the diets of poland germany and sweden and the assembly of the estates in francec for what is there now called the parliament is only the supreme court of justice consisting of the peers certain dignified ecclesiastics and judges which neither is in practice nor is supposed to be in theory a general council of the realm with us in england this general council hath been held immemorially under the several names of michelsynoth or great council michelgemote or great meeting     and more      frequently wittenagemote or the meeting of wise men it was also styled in latin commune concilium regni magnum concilium regis curia magna conventus magnatum vel procerum assisa generalis and sometimes communitas regni angliæd we have instances of its meeting to order the affairs of the kingdom to make new laws and to mend the old or as fletae expresses it novis injuriis emersis nova constituere remedia so early as the reign of ina king of the west saxons offa king of the mercians and ethelbert king of kent in the several realms of the heptarchy and after their union the mirrorf informs us that king alfred ordained for a perpetual usage that these councils should meet twice in the year or oftener if need be to treat of the government of gods people how they should keep themselves from sin should live in quiet and should receive right our succeeding saxon and danish monarchs held frequent councils of this sort as appears from their respective codes of laws the titles whereof usually speak them to be enacted either by the king with the advice of his wittenagemote or wise men as hæc sunt instituta quæ edgarus rex consilio sapientum suorum instituit or to be enacted by those sages with the advice of the king as hæc sunt judicia quæ sapientes consilio regis ethelstani instituerunt or lastly to be enacted by them both together as hæc sunt institutiones quas rex edmundus et episcopi sui cum sapientibus suis instituerunt there is also no doubt but these great councils were occasionally held under the first princes of the norman line glanvil who wrote in the reign of henry the second speaking of the particular amount of an amercement in the sheriffs court says it had never been yet ascertained by the general assize or assembly but was left to the custom of particular countiesg here the general assize is spoken of as a meeting well known and its statutes or decisions are put in      a manifest contradistinction to custom or the common law and in edward the thirds time an act of parliament made in the reign of william the conqueror was pleaded in the case of the abbey of st edmundsbury and judicially allowed by the courth hence it indisputably appears that parliaments or general councils are coeval with the kingdom itself how those parliaments were constituted and composed is another question which has been matter of great dispute among our learned antiquaries and particularly whether the commons were summoned at all or if summoned at what period they began to form a distinct assembly but it is not my intention here to enter into controversies of this sort i hold it sufficient that it is generally agreed that in the main the constitution of parliament as it now stands was marked out so long ago as the seventeenth year of king john ad      in the great charter granted by that prince wherein he promises to summon all archbishops bishops abbots earls and greater barons personally and all other tenants in chief under the crown by the sheriff and bailiffs to meet at a certain place with forty days notice to assess aids and scutages when necessary and this constitution has subsisted in fact at least from the year         hen iii there being still extant writs of that date to summon knights citizens and burgesses to parliament i proceed therefore to inquire wherein consists this constitution of parliament as it now stands and has stood for the space of at least five hundred years and in the prosecution of this inquiry i shall consider first the manner and time of its assembling secondly its constituent parts thirdly the laws and customs relating to parliament considered as one aggregate body fourthly and fifthly the laws and customs relating to each house separately and distinctly taken sixthly the methods of proceeding and of making statutes in both houses and lastly the manner of the parliaments adjournment prorogation and dissolution    0 i as to the manner and time of assembling the parliament is regularly to be summoned by the kings writ or letter issued out of   0 chancery by advice of the privy council at least forty days before it begins to sit  it is a branch of the royal prerogative that no parliament can be convened by its own authority or by the authority of any except the king alone and this prerogative is founded upon very good reason for supposing it had a right to meet spontaneously without being called together it is impossible to conceive that all the members and each of the houses would agree unanimously upon the proper time and place of meeting and if half of the members met and half absented themselves who shall determine which is really the legislative body the part assembled or that which stays away it is therefore necessary that the parliament should be called together at a determinate time and place and highly becoming its dignity and independence that it should be called together by none but one of its own constituent parts and of the three constituent parts this office can only appertain to the king as he is a single person whose will may be uniform and steady the first person in the nation being superior to both houses in dignity and the only branch of the legislature that has a separate existence and is capable of performing any act at a time when no parliament is in beingi nor is it an exception to this rule that by some modern statutes on the demise of a king or queen if there be then no parliament in being the last parliament revives and it is to sit again for six months unless dissolved by the successor for this revived parliament must have been originally summoned by the crown      it is true that by a statute    car i c   it was enacted that if the king neglected to call a parliament for three years the peers might assemble and issue out writs for choosing one and in case of neglect of the peers the constituents might meet and elect one themselves but this if ever put in practice would have been liable to all the inconveniences i have just now stated and the act itself was esteemed so highly detrimental and injurious to the royal prerogative that it was repealed by statute    car ii c   from thence therefore no precedent can be drawn it is also true that the conventionparliament which restored king charles the second met above a month before his return the lords by their own authority and the commons in pursuance of writs issued in the name of the keepers of the liberty of england by authority of parliament and that the said parliament sat till the twentyninth of december full seven months after the restoration and enacted many laws several of which are still in force but this was     for the necessity of the thing which supersedes all law for if they had not so met it was morally impossible that the kingdom should have been settled in peace and the first thing done after the kings return was to pass an act declaring this to be a good parliament notwithstanding the defect of the kings writsk so that as the royal prerogative was chiefly wounded by their so meeting and as the king himself who alone had a right to object consented to waive the objection this cannot be drawn into an example in prejudice of the rights of the crown besides we should also remember that it was at that time a great doubt among the lawyersl whether even this healing act made it a good parliament and held by very many in the negative though it seems to have been too nice a scruple  and yet out of abundant caution it was thought necessary to confirm its acts in the next parliament by statute    car ii c   and c         it is likewise true that at the time of the revolution ad      the lords and commons by their own authority and upon the summons of the prince of orange afterwards king william met in a convention and therein disposed of the crown and kingdom but it must be remembered that this assembling was upon a like principle of necessity as at the restoration that is upon a full conviction that king james the second had abdicated the government and that the throne was thereby vacant which supposition of the individual members was confirmed by their concurrent resolution when they actually came together and in such a case as the palpable vacancy of a throne it follows ex necessitate rei that the form of the royal writs must be laid aside otherwise no parliament can ever meet again for let us put another possible case and suppose for the sake of argument that the whole royal line should at any time fail and become extinct which would indisputably vacate the throne in this situation it seems reasonable to presume that the body of the nation consisting of lords and commons would have a right to meet and settle the government otherwise there must be no government at all and upon this and no other principle did the convention in      assemble the vacancy of the throne was precedent to their meeting without any royal summons not a consequence of it they did not assemble without writ and then make the throne vacant but the throne being previously vacant by the kings abdication they assembled without writ as they must do if they assembled at all had the throne been full their meeting would not have been regular but as it was really empty such meeting became absolutely necessary and accordingly it is declared by statute   w and m st   c   that this convention was really the two houses of parliament notwithstanding the want of writs or other defects of form so that notwithstanding these two capital exceptions which were justifiable only on a principle of necessity and each of which by the way induced a revolution in the government the rule laid down is in general certain that the king only can convoke a parliament      and this by the ancient statutes of the realmm he is bound to do every year or oftener if need be not that he is or ever was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and despatch of business if need be  these last words are so loose and vague that such of our     monarchs as were inclined to govern without parliaments neglected the convoking them sometimes for a very considerable period under pretence that there was no need of them but to remedy this by the statute    car ii c   it is enacted that the sitting and holding of parliaments shall not be intermitted above three years at the most and by the statute   w and m st   c   it is declared to be one of the rights of the people that for redress of all grievances and for the amending strengthening and preserving the laws parliaments ought to be held frequently and this indefinite frequency is again reduced to a certainty by statute   w and m c   which enacts as the statute of charles the second had done before that a new parliament shall be called within three yearsn after the determination of the former  ii the constituent parts of a parliament are the next objects of our inquiry and these are the kings majesty sitting there in his royal political capacity and the three estates of the realm the lords spiritual the lords temporal who sit together with the king in one house and the commons who sit by themselves in another and the king and these three estates together form the great corporation or body politic of the kingdomo of which the king is said to be caput principium et finis for upon their coming together the king meets them     either in person or by representation without which there can be no beginning of a parliamentp and he also has alone the power of dissolving them      it is highly necessary for preserving the balance of the constitution that the executive power should be a branch though not the whole of the legislative the total union of them we have seen would be productive of tyranny the total disjunction of them for the present would in the end produce the same effects by causing that union against which it seems to provide the legislative would soon become tyrannical by making continual encroachments and gradually assuming to itself the rights of the executive power thus the long parliament of charles the first while it acted in a constitutional manner with the royal concurrence redressed many heavy grievances and established many salutary laws but when the two houses assumed the power of legislation in exclusion of the royal authority they soon after assumed likewise the reins of administration and in consequence of these united powers overturned both church and state and established a worse oppression than any they pretended to remedy to hinder therefore any such encroachments the king is himself a part of the parliament and as this is the reason of his being so very properly therefore the share of legislation which the constitution has placed in the crown consists in the power of rejecting rather than resolving this being sufficient to answer the end proposed for we may apply to the royal negative in this instance what cicero observes of the negative of the roman tribunes that the crown has not any power of doing wrong but merely of preventing wrong from being doneq the crown cannot begin of itself any alterations in the present established law but it may approve or disapprove of the alterations suggested and consented to by the two houses the legislative therefore cannot abridge the executive power of any rights which it now has by law without its own consent since the law must perpetually stand as it now does unless all the powers will agree to alter it and herein indeed consists the true excellence of the english government that all the parts of it form a mutual      check upon each other in the legislature the people are a check upon the nobility and the nobility a check upon the people by the mutual privilege of rejecting what the other has resolved while the king is a check upon both which preserves the executive power from encroachments and this very executive power is again checked and kept within due bounds by the two houses through the privilege they have of inquiring into impeaching and punishing the conduct not indeed of the kingr which would destroy his constitutional independence but which is more beneficial to the public of his evil and pernicious counsellors thus every branch of our civil polity supports and is supported regulates and is regulated by the rest for the two houses naturally drawing in two directions of opposite interest and the prerogative in another still different from them both they mutually keep each other from exceeding their proper limits while the whole is prevented from separation and artificially connected together by the mixed nature of the crown which is a part of the legislative and the sole executive magistrate like three distinct powers in mechanics they jointly impel the machine of government in a direction different from what either acting by itself would have done but at the same time in a direction partaking of each and formed out of all a direction which constitutes the true line of the liberty and happiness of the community      let us now consider these constituent parts of the sovereign power or parliament each in a separate view the kings majesty will be the subject of the next and many subsequent chapters to which we must at present refer the next in order are the spiritual lords these consist of two archbishops     and twentyfour bishops  and at the dissolution of monasteries by henry viii consisted likewise of twentysix mitred abbots and two priorss a very considerable body and in those times equal in number to the temporal nobilityt  all these hold or are supposed to hold      certain ancient baronies under the king for william the conqueror thought proper to change the spiritual tenure of frankalmoign or free alms under which the bishops held their lands during the saxon government into the feodal or norman tenure by barony which subjected their estates to all civil charges and assessments from which they were before exemptu and in right of succession to those baronies which were unalienable from their respective dignities the bishops and abbots were allowed their seats in the house of lordsx 0 but though these lords spiritual are in the eye of the law a distinct estate from the lords temporal and are so distinguished in most of our acts of parliament yet in practice they are usually blended together under the one name of the lords they intermix in their votes and the majority of such intermixture binds both estates and from this want of a separate assembly and separate negative of the prelates some writers have arguedy very cogently that the lords temporal and spiritual are now in reality only one estatez which is unquestionably true in every effectual sense though the ancient distinction between them still nominally continues for if a bill should pass their house there is no doubt of its validity though every lord spiritual should vote against it of which seldena and sir edward cokeb     give many instances as on the other hand i presume it would be equally good if the lords temporal present were inferior to the bishops in number and every one of those temporal lords gave his vote to reject the bill though sir edward coke seems to doubtc whether this would not be an ordinance rather than an act of parliament      the lords temporal consist of all the peers of the realm   the bishops not being in strictness held to be such but merely lords of parliamentd by whatever title of nobility distinguished dukes marquisses earls vicounts or barons of which dignities we shall speak more hereafter some of these sit by descent as do all ancient peers some by creation as do all newmade ones others since the union with scotland by election which is the case of the sixteen peers who represent the body of the scots nobility their number is indefinite and may be increased at will by the power of the crown and once in the reign of queen anne there was an instance of creating no less than twelve together in contemplation of which in the reign of king george the first a bill passed the house of lords and was countenanced by the then ministry for limiting the number of the peerage this was thought by some to promise a great acquisition to the constitution by restraining the prerogative from gaining the ascendant in that august assembly by pouring in at pleasure an unlimited number of newcreated lords but the bill was ill relished and miscarried in the house of commons whose leading members were then desirous to keep the avenues to the other house as open and easy as possible   the distinction of rank and honours is necessary in every wellgoverned state in order to reward such as are eminent for their services to the public in a manner the most desirable to individuals and yet without burden to the community exciting thereby an ambitious yet laudable ardour and generous emulation in others and emulation or virtuous ambition is a spring of action which however dangerous or invidious in a mere republic or under a despotic sway will certainly be attended with good effects under a free monarchy where without     destroying its existence its excesses may be continually restrained by that superior power from which all honour is derived such a spirit when nationally diffused gives life and vigour to the community it sets all the wheels of government in motion      which under a wise regulator may be directed to any beneficial purpose and thereby every individual may be made subservient to the public good while he principally means to promote his own particular views a body of nobility is also more peculiarly necessary in our mixed and compounded constitution in order to support the rights of both the crown and the people by forming a barrier to withstand the encroachments of both it creates and preserves that gradual scale of dignity which proceeds from the peasant to the prince rising like a pyramid from a broad foundation and diminishing to a point as it rises it is this ascending and contracting proportion that adds stability to any government for when the departure is sudden from one extreme to another we may pronounce that state to be precarious the nobility therefore are the pillars which are reared from among the people more immediately to support the throne and if that falls they must also be buried under its ruins accordingly when in the last century the commons had determined to extirpate monarchy they also voted the house of lords to be useless and dangerous and since titles of nobility are thus expedient in the state it is also expedient that their owners should form an independent and separate branch of the legislature if they were confounded with the mass of the people and like them had only a vote in electing representatives their privileges would soon be borne down and overwhelmed by the popular torrent which would effectually level all distinctions it is therefore highly necessary that the body of nobles should have a distinct assembly distinct deliberations and distinct powers from the commons the commons consist of all such men of property in the kingdom as have not seats in the house of lords every one of whom has a voice in parliament either personally or by his representatives in a free state every man who is supposed a free agent ought to be in some measure his own governor and therefore a branch at least of the legislative power should reside in the whole body of the people and this power when the territories of the state are small and its citizens easily known should be exercised by the people      in their aggregate or collective capacity as was wisely ordained in the petty republics of greece and the first rudiments of the roman state but this will be highly inconvenient when the public territory is extended to any considerable degree and the number of citizens is increased thus when after the social war all the burghers of italy were admitted free citizens of rome and each had a vote in the public assemblies it became impossible to distinguish the spurious from the real voter and from that time all elections and popular deliberations grew tumultuous and disorderly which paved the way for marius and sylla pompey and cæsar to trample on the liberties of their country and at last to dissolve the commonwealth in so large a state as ours it is therefore very wisely contrived that the people should do that by their representatives which it is impracticable to perform in person representatives chosen by a number of minute and separate districts wherein all the voters are or easily may be distinguished the counties are therefore represented by knights elected by the proprietors of lands the citizens and boroughs are represented by citizens and burgesses chosen by the mercantile part or supposed trading interest of the nation much in the same manner as the burghers in the diet of sweden are chosen by the corporate towns stockholm sending four as london does with us other cities two and some only onee the number of english representatives is     and of scots    in all       and every member though chosen by one particular district when elected and returned serves for the whole realm for the end of his coming thither is not particular but general not barely to advantage his     constituents but the common wealth to advise his majesty as appears from the writ of summonsf de communi consilio super negotiis quibusdam arduis et urgentibus regem statum defensionem regni angliæ et ecclesiæ anglicanæ concernentibus and therefore he is not bound like a deputy in the united provinces to consult with or take the advice of his constituents upon any particular point unless he himself thinks it proper or prudent so to do    0 these are the constituent parts of a parliament the king the lords spiritual and temporal and the commons parts of which each is so necessary that the consent of all three is required to make any new law that shall bind the subject whatever is enacted for law by one or by two only of the three is no statute and to it no regard is due unless in matters relating to their own privileges for though in the times of madness and anarchy the commons once passed a voteg that whatever is enacted or declared for law by the commons in parliament assembled hath the force of law and all the people of this nation are concluded thereby although the consent and concurrence of the king or house of peers be not had thereto yet when the constitution was restored in all its forms it was particularly enacted by statute    car ii c   that if any person shall maliciously or advisedly affirm that both or either of the houses of parliament have any legislative authority without the king such person shall incur all the penalties of a præmunire   iii we are next to examine the laws and customs relating to parliament thus united together and considered as one aggregate body the power and jurisdiction of parliament says sir edward cokeh is so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds and of this high court he adds it may be truly said si antiquitatem spectes est vetustissima si dignitatem est honoratissima si jurisdictionem est capacissima it hath sovereign and uncontrollable authority in the making confirming enlarging restraining abrogating repealing reviving and expounding of laws concerning matters of all possible denominations ecclesiastical or temporal civil military maritime or criminal this being the place where that absolute despotic power which must in all governments reside   0 somewhere is intrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms all mischiefs and      grievances operations and remedies that transcend the ordinary course of the laws are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal it can regulate or newmodel the succession to the crown as was done in the reign of henry viii and william iii it can alter the established religion of the land as was done in a variety of instances in the reign of king henry viii and his three children it can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themselves as was done by the act of union and the several statutes for triennial and septennial elections it can in short do every thing that is not naturally impossible and therefore some have not scrupled to call its power by a figure rather too bold the omnipotence of parliament true it is that what the parliament doth no authority upon earth can undo so that it is a matter most essential to the liberties of this kingdom that such members be delegated to this important trust as are most eminent for their probity their fortitude and their knowledge for it was a known apophthegm of the great lord treasurer burleigh that england could never be ruined but by a parliament and as sir matthew hale observesi this being the highest and greatest court over which none other can have jurisdiction in the kingdom if by any means a misgovernment should any way fall upon it the subjects of this kingdom are left without all manner of remedy to the same purpose the president montesquieu though i trust too hastily presagesk that as rome sparta and carthage have lost their liberty and perished so the constitution of england will in time lose its liberty will perish it will perish whenever the legislative power shall become more corrupt than the executive it must be owned that mr lockel and other theoretical writers have held that there remains still inherent in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust      reposed in them for when such trust is absued it is thereby forfeited and devolves to those who gave it but however just this conclusion may be in theory we cannot practically adopt it nor take any legal steps for carrying it into execution under any dispensation of government at present actually existing for this devolution of power to the people at large includes in it a dissolution of the whole form of government established by that people reduces all the members to their original state of equality and by annihilating the sovereign power repeals all positive laws whatsoever before enacted no human laws will therefore suppose a case which at once must destroy all law and compel men to build afresh upon a new foundation nor will they make provision for so desperate an event as must render all legal provisions ineffectualm so long therefore as the english constitution lasts we may venture to affirm that the power of parliament is absolute and without control       in order to prevent the mischiefs that might arise by placing this extensive authority in hands that are either incapable or else improper to manage it it is provided by the custom and law of parliamentn that no one shall sit or     vote in either house unless he be twentyone years of age this is also expressly declared by statute   and   w iii c    with regard to the house of commons doubts having arisen from some contradictory adjudications whether or no a minor was incapacitated from sitting in that houseo   it is also enacted by statute   jac i c   that no member be permitted to enter into the house of commons till he hath taken the oath of allegiance before the lord steward or his deputy and by  0 car ii st   and   geo i c      that no member shall vote or sit in either house till he hath in the presence of the house taken the oath of allegiance supremacy and abjuration and subscribed and repeated the declaration against transubstantiation and invocation of saints and the sacrifice of the mass   aliens unless naturalized were likewise by the law of parliament incapable to serve thereinp and now it is enacted by statute    and    w iii c   that no alien      even though he be naturalized shall be capable of being a member of either house of parliament and there are not only these standing incapacities but if any person is made a peer by the king or elected to serve in the house of commons by the people yet may the respective houses upon complaint of any crime in such person and proof thereof adjudge him disabled and incapable to sit as a memberq and this by the law and custom of parliament       for as every court of justice hath laws and customs for its direction some the civil and canon some the common law others their own peculiar laws and customs so the high court of parliament hath also its own peculiar law called the lex et consuetudo parliamenti a law which sir edward coker observes is ab omnibus quærenda a multis ignorata 0 a paucis cognitas it will not therefore be expected that we should enter into the examination of this law with any degree of minuteness since as the same learned author assures ust it is much better to be learned out of the rolls of parliament and other records and by precedents and continual experience than can be expressed by any one man it will be sufficient to observe that the whole of the law and custom of parliament has its original from this one maxim that whatever matter arises concerning either house of parliament ought to be examined discussed and adjudged in that house to which it relates and not elsewhereu hence for instance the lords will not suffer the commons to interfere in settling the election of a peer of scotland the commons will not allow the lords to judge of the election of a burgess nor will either house permit the subordinate courts of law to examine the merits of either case   but the maxims upon which they     proceed together with the method of proceeding rest entirely in the breast of the parliament itself and are not defined and ascertained by any particular stated laws        the privileges of parliament are likewise very large and indefinite and therefore when in    hen vi the house of lords propounded a question to the judges concerning them the chief justice sir john fortescue in the name of his brethren declared that they ought not to make answer to that question for it hath not been used aforetime that the justices should in any wise determine the privileges of the high court of parliament for it is so high and mighty in its nature that it may make law and that which is law it may make no law and the determination and knowledge of that privilege belongs to the lords of parliament and not to the justicesx privilege of parliament     was principally established in order to protect its members not only from being molested by their fellowsubjects but also more especially from being oppressed by the power of the crown if therefore all the privileges of parliament were once to be set down and ascertained and no privilege to be allowed but what was so defined and determined it were easy for the executive power to devise some new case not within the line of privilege and under pretence thereof to harass any refractory member and violate the freedom of parliament the dignity and independence of the two houses are therefore in great measure preserved by keeping their privileges indefinite   some however of the more notorious privileges of the members of either house are privilege of speech of person of their domestics and of their lands and goods   as to the first privilege of speech it is declared by the statute   w and m st   c   as one of the liberties of the people that the freedom of speech and debates and proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament and this freedom of speech is particularly demanded of the king in person by the speaker of the house of commons at the opening of every new parliament   so likewise are the other privileges of persons servants lands and goods which are immunities as ancient as edward the confessor in whose lawsz      we find this precept ad synodos venientibus sive summoniti sint sive per se quid agendum habuerint sit summa pax and so too in the old gothic constitutions extenditur hæc pax et securitas ad quatuordecim dies convocato regni senatua this included formerly not only privilege from illegal violence but also from legal arrests and seizures by process from the courts of law and still to assault by violence a member of either house or his menial servant is a high contempt of parliament and there punished with the utmost severity it has likewise peculiar penalties annexed to it in the courts of law by the statutes   henry iv c   and    hen vi c    neither can any member of either house be arrested and taken into custody unless for some indictable offence without a breach of the privilege of parliament   but all other privileges which derogate from the common law in matters of     civil right are now at an end save only as to the freedom of the members person which in a peer by the privilege of peerage is forever sacred and inviolable and in a commoner by the privilege of parliament for forty days after every prorogation and forty days before the next appointed meetingb which is now in effect as long as the parliament subsists it seldom being prorogued for more than fourscore days at a time as to all other privileges which obstruct the ordinary course of justice they were restrained by the statutes    w iii c     and   anne c    and    geo ii c    and are now totally abolished by statute  0 geo iii c  0 which enacts that any suit may at any time be brought against any peer or member of parliament their servants or any other person entitled to privilege of parliament which shall not be impeached or delayed by pretence of any such privilege except that the person of a member of the house of commons shall not thereby be subjected to any arrest of imprisonment likewise for the benefit of commerce it is provided by statute   geo iii c    that any trader having privilege of parliament may be served      with legal process for any just debt to the amount of  00l and unless he make satisfaction within two months it shall be deemed an act of bankruptcy and that commissions of bankrupt may be issued against such privileged traders in like manner as against any other the only way by which courts of justice could anciently take cognizance of privilege of parliament was by writ of privilege in the nature of a supersedeas to deliver the party out of custody when arrested in a civil suitc for when a letter was written by the speaker to the judges to stay proceedings against a privileged person they rejected it as contrary to their oath of officed but since the statute    w iii c   which enacts that no privileged person shall be subject to arrest or imprisonment it hath been held that such arrest is irregular ab initio and that the party may be discharged upon motione it is to be observed that there is no precedent of any such writ of privilege but only in civil suits and that the statute of   jac i c    and that of king william which remedy some inconveniences arising from privilege of parliament speak only of civil actions and therefore the claim of privilege hath been usually guarded with an exception as to the case of indictable crimesf or as it has been frequently expressed of treason felony and breach or     surety of the peaceg whereby it seems to have been understood that no privilege was allowable to the members their families or servants in any crime whatsoever for all crimes are treated by the law as being contra pacem domini regis and instances have not been wanting wherein privileged persons have been convicted of misdemesnors and committed or prosecuted to outlawry even in the middle of a sessionh which proceeding has afterwards received the sanction and approbation of parliamenti      to which may be added that a few years ago the case of writing and publishing seditious libels was resolved by both housesk not to be entitled to privilege   and that the reasons upon which that case proceededl extended equally to every indictable offence   so that the chief if not the only privilege of parliament in such cases seems to be the right of receiving immediate information of the imprisonment or detention of any member with the reason for which he is detained a practice that is daily used upon the slightest military accusation preparatory to a trial by a court martialm and which is recognised by the several temporary statutes for suspending the habeas corpus actn whereby it is provided that no member of either house shall be detained till the matter of which he stands suspected be first communicated to the house of which he is a member and the consent of the said house obtained for his commitment or detaining but yet the usage has uniformly been ever since the revolution that the communication has been subsequent to the arrest these are the general heads of the laws and customs relating to parliament considered as one aggregate body we will next proceed to iv the laws and customs relating to the house of lords in particular these if we exclude their judicial capacity which will be more properly treated of in the third and fourth books of these commentaries will take up but little of our time one very ancient privilege is that declared by the charter of the foresto confirmed in parliament   hen iii viz that every lord spiritual or temporal summoned to parliament and passing through the kings forests may both in going and returning kill one or two of the kings deer without      warrant in view of the forester if he be present or on blowing a horn if he be absent that he may not seem to take the kings venison by stealth in the next place they have a right to be attended and constantly are by the judges of the court of kings bench and common pleas and such of the barons of the exchequer as are of the degree of the coif or have been made serjeants at law as likewise by the kings learned counsel being serjeants and by the masters of the court of chancery for their advice in point of law and for the greater dignity of their proceedings the secretaries of state with the attorney and solicitor general were also used to attend the house of peers and have to this day together with the judges c their regular writs of summons issued out at the beginning of every parliamentp ad tractandum et consilium impendendum though not ad consentiendum but whenever of late years they have been members of the house of commonsq their attendance here hath fallen into disuse       another privilege is that every peer by license obtained from the king 0 may make another lord of parliament his proxy to vote for him in his absencer a privilege which a member of the other house can by no means have as he is himself but a proxy for a multitude of other peoples each peer has also a right by leave of the house when a vote passes contrary to his sentiments to enter his dissent on the journals of the house with the reasons for such dissent which is usually styled his protest   all bills likewise that may in their consequences any way affect the right of the peerage are by the custom of parliament to have their first rise and beginning in the house of peers and to suffer no changes or amendments in the house of commons      there is also one statute peculiarly relative to the house of lords   anne c    which regulates the election of the sixteen representative peers of north britain in consequence of the twentysecond and twentythird articles of the union and for that purpose prescribes the oaths c to be taken by the electors directs the mode of balloting prohibits the peers electing from being attended in an unusual manner and expressly provides that no other matter shall be treated of in that assembly save only the election on pain of incurring a præmunire v the peculiar laws and customs of the house of commons relate principally to the raising of taxes and the election of members to serve in parliament first with regard to taxes it is the ancient indisputable privilege and right of the house of commons that all grants of subsidies or parliamentary aids do begin in their house and are first bestowed by themt although their grants are not effectual to all intents and purposes until they have the assent of the other two branches of the legislature   the general reason given for this exclusive privilege of the house of commons is that the supplies are raised upon the body of the people and therefore it is proper that they alone should have the right of taxing themselves this reason would be unanswerable if the commons taxed none but themselves but it is notorious that a very large     share of property is in the possession of the house of lords that this property is equally taxable and taxed as the property of the commons and therefore the commons not being the sole persons taxed this cannot be the reason of their having the sole right of raising and modelling the supply the true reason arising from the spirit of our constitution seems to be this the lords being a permanent hereditary body created at pleasure by the king are supposed more liable to be influenced by the crown and when once influenced to continue so than the commons who are a temporary elective body freely    0 nominated by the people it would therefore be extremely dangerous to give the lords any power of framing new taxes for the subject it is sufficient that they have a power of rejecting if they think the commons too lavish or improvident in their grants but so reasonably jealous are the commons of this valuable privilege that herein they will not suffer the other house to exert any power but that of rejecting they will not permit the least alteration or amendment to be made by the lords to the mode of taxing the people by a money bill under which appellation are included all bills by which money is directed to be raised upon the subject for any purpose or in any shape whatsoever either for the exigencies of government and collected from the kingdom in general as the landtax or for private benefit and collected in any particular district as by turnpikes parish rates and the like   yet sir matthew haleu mentions one case founded on the practice of parliament in the reign of henry viw wherein he thinks the lords may alter a money bill and that is if the commons grant a tax as that of tonnage and poundage for four years and the lords alter it to a less time as for two years here he says the bill need not be sent back to the commons for their concurrence but may receive the royal assent without further ceremony for the alteration of the lords is consistent with the grant of the commons but such an experiment will hardly be repeated by the lords under the present improved idea of the privilege of the house of commons and in any case where a money bill is remanded to the commons all amendments in the mode of taxation are sure to be rejected next with regard to the election of knights citizens and burgesses we may observe that herein consists the exercise of the democratical part of our constitution for in a democracy there can be no exercise of sovereignty but by suffrage which is the declaration of the peoples will in all democracies therefore it is of the utmost importance to regulate by whom and in what manner the suffrages are to      be given and the athenians were so justly jealous of this prerogative that a stranger who interfered in the assemblies of the people was punished by their laws with death because such a man was esteemed guilty of high treason by usurping those rights of sovereignty to which he had no title in england where the people do not debate in a collective body but by representation the exercise of his sovereignty consists in the choice of representatives the laws have therefore very strictly guarded against usurpation or abuse of this power by many salutary provisions which may be reduced to these three points   the qualifications of the electors   the qualifications of the elected   the proceedings at elections       as to the qualifications of the electors the true reason of requiring any qualification with regard to property in voters is to exclude such persons as are in so mean a situation that they are esteemed to have no will of their own if these persons had votes they would be tempted to dispose of them under some undue influence or other this would give a great an artful or a wealthy man a larger share in elections than is consistent with general liberty if it were probable that every man would give his vote freely and without influence of any kind then upon the true theory and genuine principles of liberty every member of the community however poor should have a vote in electing those delegates to whose charge is committed the disposal of his property his liberty and his life but since that can hardly be expected in persons of indigent fortunes or such as are under the immediate dominion of others all popular states have been obliged to establish certain qualifications whereby some who are suspected to have no will of their own are excluded from voting in order to set other individuals whose wills may be supposed independent more thoroughly upon a level with each other and this constitution of suffrages is framed upon a wiser principle with us than either of the methods of voting by centuries or by tribes among the romans in the method      by centuries instituted by servius tullius it was principally property and not numbers that turned the scale in the method by tribes gradually introduced by the tribunes of the people numbers only were regarded and property entirely overlooked hence the laws passed by the former method had usually too great a tendency to aggrandize the patricians or rich nobles and those by the latter had too much of a levelling principle our constitution steers between the two extremes only such are entirely excluded as can have no will of their own there is hardly a free agent to be found who is not entitled to a vote in some place or other in the kingdom nor is comparative wealth or property entirely disregarded in elections for though the richest man has only one vote at one place yet if his property be at all diffused he has probably a right to vote at more places than one and therefore has many representatives this is the spirit of our constitution not that i assert it is in fact quite so perfectx as i have here endeavoured to describe it for if any alteration might be wished or suggested in the present frame of parliaments it should be in favour of a more complete representation of the people   but to return to our qualifications and first those of electors for knights of the shire   by statute   hen vi c   and  0 hen vi c   amended by    geo iii c      the knights of the shire shall be chosen of people whereof     every man shall have freehold to the value of forty shillings by the year within the county which by subsequent statutes is to be clear of all charges and deductions except parliamentary and parochial taxes   the knights of shires are the representatives of the landholders or landed interest of the kingdom their electors must therefore have estates in lands or tenements within the county represented these estates must be freehold that is for term of life at least because beneficial leases for long terms of years were not in use at the making of these statutes and copyholders were then little better than villeins absolutely dependent upon their lords this freehold must be of forty shillings annual value because that sum would then with proper industry furnish all the      necessaries of life and render the freeholder if he pleased an independent man for bishop fleetwood in his chronicon preciosum written at the beginning of the present century has fully proved forty shillings in the reign of henry vi to have been equal to twelve pounds per annum in the reign of queen anne and as the value of money is very considerably lowered since the bishop wrote i think we may fairly conclude from this and other circumstances that what was equivalent to twelve pounds in his days is equivalent to twenty at present the other less important qualifications of the electors for counties in england and wales may be collected from the statutes cited in the marginy which direct   that no person under twentyone years of age shall be capable of voting for any member this extends to all sorts of members as well for boroughs as counties as does also the next viz   that no person convicted of perjury or subornation of perjury shall be capable of voting in any election   that no person shall vote in right of any freehold granted to him fraudulently to qualify him to vote fraudulent grants are such as contain an agreement to reconvey or to defeat the estate granted which agreements are made void and the estate is absolutely vested in the person to whom it is so granted and to guard the better against such frauds it is further provided   that every voter shall have been in the actual possession or receipt of the profits of his freehold to his own use for twelve calendar months before except it came to him by descent marriage marriagesettlement will or promotion to a benefice or office   that no person shall vote in respect of an annuity or rentcharge unless registered with the clerk of the peace twelve calendar months before     that in mortgaged or trust estates the person in possession under the abovementioned restrictions shall have the vote   that only one person shall be admitted to vote for any one house or tenement to prevent the splitting of freeholds     that no estate     shall qualify a voter unless the estate has been assessed to some landtax aid at least twelve months before the election    0 that no tenant by copy of courtroll shall      be permitted to vote as a freeholder thus much for the electors in counties 0     as for the electors of citizens and burgesses these are supposed to be the mercantile part or trading interest of this kingdom but as trade is of a fluctuating nature and seldom long fixed in a place it was formerly left to the crown to summon pro re nata the most flourishing towns to send representatives to parliament so that as towns increased in trade and grew populous they were admitted to a share in the legislature but the misfortune is that the deserted boroughs continued to be summoned as well as those to whom their trade and inhabitants were transferred except a few which petitioned to be eased of the expense then usual of maintaining their members four shillings a day being allowed for a knight of the shire and two shillings for a citizen or burgess which was the rate of wages established in the reign of edward iiiz   hence the members for boroughs now bear above a quadruple proportion     to those for counties and the number of parliament men is increased since fortescues time in the reign of henry the sixth from  00 to upwards of  00 exclusive of those for scotland the universities were in general not empowered to send burgesses to parliament though once in    edw i when a parliament was summoned to consider of the kings right to scotland there were issued writs which required the university of oxford to send up four or five and that of cambridge two or three of their most discreet and learned lawyers for that purposea but it was king james the first who indulged them with the permanent privilege to send constantly two of their own body to serve for those students who though useful members of the community were neither concerned in the landed nor the trading interest and to protect     in the legislature the rights of the republic of letters the right of election in boroughs is various depending entirely on the several charters customs and constitutions of the respective places which has occasioned infinite disputes though now by statute        geo ii c    the right of voting for the future shall be allowed according to the last determination of the house of commons concerning it   and by the statute   geo iii c    no freeman of any city or borough other than such as claim by birth marriage or servitude shall be admitted to vote therein unless he hath been admitted to his freedom twelve calendar months before     next as to the qualifications of persons to be elected members of the house of commons some of these depend upon the law and custom of parliament declared by the house of commonsb others upon certain statutes and from these it appears   that they must not be aliens bornc or minorsd   that they must not be any of the twelve judgese because they sit in the lords house nor the clergyf for they sit in the convocation   nor persons attainted     of treason or felonyg for they are unfit to sit anywhere   that sheriffs of counties and mayors and bailiffs of boroughs are not eligible in their respective jurisdictions as being returning officersh but that sheriffs of one county are eligible to be knights of anotheri     that in strictness all members ought to have been inhabitants of the places for which they are chosenk but this having been long disregarded was at length entirely repealed by statute    geo iii c      that no persons concerned in the management of any duties or taxes created since      except the commissioners of the treasuryl nor any of the officers followingm viz commissioners of prizes transports sick and wounded wine licenses navy and victualling secretaries or receivers of prizes comptrollers of the army accounts agents for regiments governors of plantations and their deputies officers of minorca or gibraltar officers of the excise and customs      clerks or deputies in the several offices of the treasury exchequer navy victualling admiralty pay of the army or navy secretaries of state salt stamps appeals wine licenses hackney coaches hawkers and pedlars nor any persons that hold any new office under the crown created since   0 n are capable of being elected or sitting as members     that no person having a pension under the crown during pleasure or for any term of years is capable of being elected or sittingo   that if any member accepts an office under the crown except an officer in the army or navy accepting a new commission his seat is void but such member is capable of being reelectedp   that all knights of the shire shall be actual knights or such notable esquires and gentlemen as have     estates sufficient to be knights and by no means of the degree of yeomenq this is reduced to a still greater certainty by ordaining   that every knight of a shire shall have a clear estate of freehold of freehold or copyhold to the value of six hundred pounds per annum and every citizen and burgess to the value of three hundred pounds except the eldest sons of peers and of persons qualified to be knights of shires and except the members for the two universitiesr which somewhat balances the ascendant which the boroughs have gained over the counties by obliging the trading interest to make choice of landed men and of this qualification the member must make oath and give the particulars in writing at the time of his taking his seats but subject to these standing restrictions and disqualifications every subject of the realm is eligible of common right though there are instances wherein persons in particular circumstances have forfeited the common right and have been declared ineligible for that parliament by vote of the house of commonst or forever by an act of the legislatureu   but it was an unconstitutional prohibition which was grounded on an ordinance of the house of lordsw and inserted in the kings writs for the parliament holden at coventry   hen iv that no apprentice or      other man of the law should be elected a knight of the shire thereinx in return for which our law books and historiansy have branded this parliament with the name of parliamentum indoctum or the lacklearning parliament and sir edward coke observes with some spleenz that there was never a good law made thereat   the third point regarding elections is the method of proceeding therein this is also regulated by the law of parliament and the several statutes referred to in the margina all which i shall blend together and extract out of them a summary account of the method of proceeding to elections as soon as the parliament is summoned the lord chancellor or if a vacancy happens during the sitting of parliament the speaker by order of the house and without such order if a vacancy happens by death or the members becoming a peer   in the time of a recess for upwards of twenty days sends his warrant     to the clerk of the crown in chancery who thereupon issues out writs to the sheriff of every county for the election of all the members to serve for that county and every city and borough therein within three days after the receipt of this writ the sheriff is to send his precept under his seal to the proper returning officers of the cities and boroughs commanding them to elect their members and the said returning officers are to proceed to election within eight days from the receipt of the precept giving four days notice of the sameb and to return the persons chosen together with the precept to the sheriff but elections of knights of the shire must be proceeded to by the sheriffs themselves in person at the next county court      that shall happen after the delivery of the writ the county court is a court held every month or oftener by the sheriff intended to try little causes not exceeding the value of forty shillings in what part of the county he pleases to appoint for that purpose but for the election of knights of the shire it must be held at the most usual place if the county court falls upon the day of delivering the writ or within six days after the sheriff may adjourn the court and election to some other convenient time not longer than sixteen days nor shorter than ten but he cannot alter the place without the consent of all the candidates and in all such cases ten days public notice must be given of the time and place of the election and as it is essential to the very being of parliament that elections should be absolutely free therefore all undue influences upon the electors are illegal and strongly prohibited   for mr lockec ranks it among those breaches of trust in the executive magistrate which according to his notions amount to a dissolution of the government if he employs the force treasure and offices of the society to corrupt the representatives or openly to preengage the electors and prescribe what manner of persons shall be chosen for thus to regulate candidates and electors and newmodel the ways of election what is it says he but to cut up the government by the roots and poison the very fountain of public security as soon therefore as the time and place of election either in counties or boroughs are fixed all soldiers quartered in the place are to remove at least one day before the election to the distance of two miles or more and not to return till one day after the poll is ended riots likewise have been frequently     determined to make an election void by vote also of the house of commons to whom alone belongs the power of determining contested elections no lord of parliament or lord lieutenant of a county hath any right to interfere in the elections of commoners and by statute the lord warden of the cinque ports shall not recommend any members there if any officer of the excise customs stamps      or certain other branches of the revenue presume to intermeddle in elections by persuading any voter or dissuading him he forfeits  00l and is disabled to hold any office thus are the electors of one branch of the legislature secured from any undue influence from either of the other two and from all external violence and compulsion but the greatest danger is that in which themselves cooperate by the infamous practice of bribery and corruption to prevent which it is enacted that no candidate shall after the date usually called the teste of the writs or after the vacancy give any money or entertainment to his electors or promise to give any either to particular persons or to the place in general in order to his being elected on pain of being incapable to serve for that place in parliament 0 and if any money gift office employment or reward be given or promised     to be given to any voter at any time in order to influence him to give or withhold his vote as well he that takes as he that offers such bribe forfeits  00l and is forever disabled from voting and holding any office in any corporation unless before conviction he will discover some other offender of the same kind and then he is indemnified for his own offenced   the first instance that occurs of election bribery was so early as    eliz when one thomas longe being a simple man and of small capacity to serve in parliament acknowledged that he had given the returning officer and others of the borough for which he was chosen four pounds to be returned member and was for that premium elected but for this offence the borough was amerced   the member was removed and the officer fined and imprisonede but as this practice hath since taken much deeper and more universal root it hath occasioned the making of these wholesome statutes to complete the efficacy of which there is nothing wanting but resolution and integrity to put them in strict execution      0 undue influence being thus i wish the depravity of mankind would permit me to say effectually guarded against the election is to be proceeded to on the day appointed the sheriff or other returning officer first taking an oath against bribery and for the due execution of his office the   0 candidates likewise if required must swear to their qualification and the electors in counties to theirs and the electors both in counties and boroughs are also compellable to take the oath of abjuration and that against bribery and corruption and it might not be amiss if the members elected were bound to take the latter oath as well as the former which in all probability would be much more effectual than administering it only to the electors   the election being closed the returning officer in boroughs returns his precept to the sheriff with the persons elected by the majority and the sheriff returns the whole together with the writ for the county and the knights elected thereupon to the clerk of the crown in chancery before the day of meeting if it be a new parliament or within fourteen days after the election if it be an occasional vacancy and this under penalty of  00l if the sheriff does not return such knights only as are duly elected he forfeits by the old statutes of hen vi  00l and the returning officer in boroughs for a like false return  0l and they are besides liable to an action in which double damages shall be recovered by the latter statutes of king william and any person bribing the returning officer shall also forfeit  00l but the members returned by him are the sitting members until the house of commons upon petition shall adjudge the return to be false and illegal the form and manner of proceeding upon such petition are now regulated by statute  0 geo iii c  0   amended by      0 geo iii c    and made perpetual by    geo iii c    which directs the method of choosing by lot a select committee of fifteen members who are sworn well and truly to try the same and a true judgment to give according to the evidence and this abstract of the proceedings at elections of knights citizens and burgesses concludes our inquiries into the laws and customs more peculiarly relative to the house of commons      vi i proceed now sixthly to the method of making laws which is much the same in both houses and i shall touch it very briefly ginning in the house of commons but first i must premise that for despatch of business each house of parliament has its speaker the speaker of the house of lords whose office it is to preside there and manage the formality of business is the lord chancellor or keeper of the kings great seal or any other appointed by the kings commission and if none be so appointed the house of lords it is said may elect the speaker of the house of commons is chosen by the house   but must be approved by the king   and herein the usage of     the two houses differ that the speaker of the house of commons cannot give his opinion or argue any question in the house but the speaker of the house of lords if a lord of parliament may in each house the act of the majority   binds the whole and this majority is declared by votes openly and publicly given not as at venice and many other senatorial assemblies privately or by ballot this latter method may be serviceable to prevent intrigues and unconstitutional combinations but it is impossible to be practised with us at least in the house of commons where every members conduct is subject to the future censure of his constituents and therefore should be openly submitted to their inspection     to bring a bill into the house if the relief sought by it is of a private nature it is first necessary to prefer a petition which must be presented by a member and usually sets forth the grievance desired to be remedied this petition when founded on facts that may be in their nature disputed is referred to a committee of members who examine the matter alleged and accordingly report it to the house and then or otherwise upon the mere petition leave is given to bring in the bill in public matters the bill is brought in upon motion made to the house without any petition at all formerly all bills were drawn in the form of petitions   which were entered upon the parliament rolls with the kings answer thereunto subjoined not in any settled forms of words but      as the circumstances of the case requiredf and at the end of each parliament the judges drew them into the form of a statute which was entered on the statute rolls in the reign of henry v to prevent mistakes and abuses the statutes were drawn up by the judges before the end of the parliament and in the reign of henry vi bills in the form of acts according to the modern customs were first introduced the persons directed to bring in the bill present it in a competent time to the house drawn out on paper with a multitude of blanks or void spaces where any thing occurs that is dubious or necessary to be settled by the parliament itself such especially as the precise date of times the nature and quantity of penalties or of any sums of money to be raised being indeed only the skeleton of the bill in the house of lords if the bill begins there it is when of a private nature referred to two of the judges to examine and report the state of the facts alleged to see that all necessary parties consent and to settle all points of technical propriety this is read a first time and at a convenient distance a second time and after each reading the speaker opens to the house the substance of the bill and puts the question whether it shall proceed any further the introduction of the bill may be originally opposed as the bill itself may at either of the readings and if the opposition succeeds the bill must be dropped for that session as it must also if opposed with success in any of the subsequent stages after the second reading it is committed that is referred to a committee which is either selected by the house in matters of small importance or else upon a bill of consequence the house resolves itself into a committee of the whole house a committee of the whole house is composed of every member and to form it the speaker quits the chair another member being appointed chairman and may sit and debate as a private member in these committees the bill is debated clause by clause amendments made the blanks filled up and sometimes the bill entirely newmodelled after it      has gone through the committee the chairman reports it to the house with such     amendments as the committee have made and then the house reconsiders the whole bill again and the question is repeatedly put upon every clause and amendment when the house hath agreed or disagreed to the amendments of the committee and sometimes added new amendments of its own the bill is then ordered to be engrossed or written in a strong gross hand on one or more long rolls or presses of parchment sewed together when this is finished it is read a third time and amendments are sometimes then made to it and if a new clause be added it is done by tacking a separate piece of parchment on the bill which is called a riderg the speaker then again opens the contents and holding it up in his hands puts the question whether the bill shall pass if this is agreed to the title to it is then settled which used to be a general one for all the acts passed in the session till in the first year of henry viii distinct titles were introduced for each chapter after this one of the members is directed to carry it to the lords and desire their concurrence who attended by several more carries it to the bar of the house of peers and there delivers it to their speaker who comes down from his woolsack to receive it it there passes through the same forms as in the other house except engrossing which is already done and if rejected no more notice is taken but it passes sub silentio to prevent unbecoming altercations but if it is agreed to the lords send a message by two masters in chancery or upon matters of high dignity or importance by two of the judges that they have agreed to the same and the bill remains with the lords if they have made no amendment to it but if any amendments are made such amendments are sent down with the bill to receive the concurrence of the commons if the commons disagree to the amendments a conference usually follows between members deputed from each house who for the most part settle and adjust the difference but if both houses remain inflexible the bill is dropped if the commons agree to the amendments the bill is sent back to the lords by one of the members      with a message to acquaint them therewith the same forms are observed mutatis mutandis when the bill begins in the house of lords but when an act of grace or pardon is passed it is first signed by his majesty and then read once only in each of the houses without any new engrossing or amendmenth and when both houses have done with any bill it always is deposited in the house of peers to wait the royal assent except in the case of a bill of supply which after receiving the concurrence of the lords is sent back to the house of commonsi the royal assent may be given two ways   in person when the king comes to the house of peers in his crown and royal robes and sending for the commons to the bar the titles of all the bills that have passed both houses are read and the kings answer is declared by the clerk of the parliament in normanfrench 0 a badge it must be owned now the only one remaining of conquest and which one could wish to see fall into total oblivion unless it be reserved as a solemn memento to remind us that our liberties are mortal having once been destroyed by a foreign force if the king consents to a public bill the clerk usually declares le roy le veut the king wills it so to be if to a private bill soit fait comme il est desiré be it as it is desired if the king refuses his assent it is in the gentle language of le roy savisera   the     king will advise upon it when a bill of supply is passed it is carried up and presented to the king by the speaker of the house of commonsk and the royal assent is thus expressed le roy remercie ses loyal subjects accepte lour benevolence et aussi le veut the king thanks his loyal subjects accepts their benevolence and wills it so to be in case of an act of grace which originally proceeds from the crown and has the royal assent in the first stage of it the clerk of the parliament thus pronounces the gratitude of the subject les prelats seigneurs et commons en ce present parliament assembleés au nom de touts vous autres subjects      remercient tres humblement votre majesté et prient a dieu vous donner en santé bone vie et longue the prelates lords and commons in this present parliament assembled in the name of all your other subjects most humbly thank your majesty and pray to god to grant you in health and wealth long to livel   by the statute    hen viii c    the king may give his assent by letters patent under his great seal signed with his hand and notified in his absence to both houses assembled together in the high house and when the bill has received the royal assent in either of these ways it is then and not before a statute or act of parliament   this statute or act is placed among the records of the kingdom there needing no formal promulgation to give it the force of a law as was necessary by the civil law with regard to the emperors edicts because every man in england is in judgment of law party to the making of an act of parliament being present thereat by his representatives however a copy thereof is usually printed at the kings press for the information of the whole land and formerly before the invention of printing it was used to be published by the sheriff of every county the kings writ being sent to him at the end of every session together with a transcript of all the acts made at that session commanding him ut statuta illa et omnes articulos in eisdem contentos in singulis locis ubi expedire viderit publice proclamari et firmiter teneri et observari faciat and the usage was to proclaim them at his county court and there to keep them that whoever would might read or take copies thereof which custom continued till the reign of henry the seventhm an act of parliament thus made is the exercise of the highest authority that     this kingdom acknowledges upon earth it hath power to bind every subject in the land and the dominions thereunto belonging nay even the king himself if particularly named therein and it cannot be altered      amended dispensed with suspended or repealed but in the same forms and by the same authority of parliament for it is a maxim in law that it requires the same strength to dissolve as to create an obligation it is true it was formerly held that the king might in many cases dispense with penal statutesn but now by statute   w and m st   c   it is declared that the suspending or dispensing with laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal vii there remains only in the seventh and last place to add a word or two concerning the manner in which parliaments may be adjourned prorogued or dissolved an adjournment is no more than a continuance of the session from one day to another as the word itself signifies and this is done by the authority of each house separately every day and sometimes for a fortnight or a month together as at christmas or easter or upon other particular occasions but the adjournment of one house is no adjournment of the othero it hath also been usual when his majesty hath signified his pleasure that both or either of the houses should adjourn themselves to a certain day to obey the kings pleasure so signified and to adjourn accordinglyp otherwise besides the indecorum of a refusal a prorogation would assuredly follow which would often be very inconvenient to both public and private business for prorogation puts an end to the session and then such bills as are only begun and not perfected must be resumed de novo if at all in a subsequent session whereas after an adjournment all things continue in the same state as at the time of the adjournment made and may be proceeded on without any fresh commencement   a prorogation is the continuance of the parliament from one session to another as an adjournment is a      continuation of the session from day to day this is done by the royal authority expressed either by the lord chancellor in his majestys presence or by commission from the crown or frequently by proclamation   both houses are necessarily prorogued at the same time it not being a prorogation of the house of lords or commons but of the parliament the session is never understood to be at an end until a prorogation     though unless some act be passed or some judgment given in parliament it is in truth no session at allq and formerly the usage was for the king to give the royal assent to all such bills as he approved at the end of every session and then to prorogue the parliament though sometimes only for a day or twor after which all business then depending in the houses was to be begun again which custom obtained so strongly that it once became a questions whether giving the royal assent to a single bill did not of course put an end to the session and though it was then resolved in the negative yet the notion was so deeply rooted that the statute   car i c   was passed to declare that the kings assent to that and some other acts should not put an end to the session and even so late as the reign of charles ii we find a proviso frequently tacked to a billt that his majestys assent thereto should not determine the session of parliament but it now seems to be allowed that a prorogation must be expressly made in order to determine the session and if at the time of an actual rebellion or imminent danger of invasion the parliament shall be separated by adjournment or prorogation the king is empoweredu to call them together by proclamation with fourteen days notice of the time appointed for their reassembling   a dissolution is the civil death of the parliament and this may be effected three ways   by the kings will expressed either in person or by representation for as the king has the sole right of convening the parliament so also      it is a branch of the royal prerogative that he may whenever he pleases prorogue the parliament for a time or put a final period to its existence if nothing had a right to prorogue or dissolve a parliament but itself it might happen to become perpetual and this would be extremely dangerous if at any time it should attempt to encroach upon the executive power as was fatally experienced by the unfortunate king charles the first who having unadvisedly passed an act to continue the parliament then in being till such time as it should please to dissolve itself at last fell a sacrifice to that inordinate power which he himself had consented to give them it is therefore extremely necessary that the crown should be empowered to regulate the duration of these assemblies under the limitations which the english constitution has prescribed so that on the one hand they may frequently and regularly come together for the despatch of business and redress of grievances and may not on the other even with the consent of the crown be continued to an inconvenient or unconstitutional length   a parliament may be dissolved by the demise of the crown this dissolution formerly happened immediately upon the death of the reigning sovereign for he being considered in law as the head of the parliament caput principium et finis that failing the whole body was held to be extinct but the calling a new parliament immediately on the inauguration of the successor being found inconvenient and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament in being in case of a disputed succession it was enacted by the statutes      w iii c    and   anne c   that the parliament in being shall continue for six months after the death of any king or queen unless sooner prorogued or dissolved by the successor that if the parliament be at the time of the kings death separated by adjournment or prorogation it shall notwithstanding assemble immediately and that if no parliament is then in being the members of the last parliament shall assemble and be again a parliament        lastly a parliament may be dissolved or expire by length or time for if either the legislative body were perpetual or might last     for the life of the prince who convened them as formerly and were so to be supplied by occasionally filling the vacancies with new representatives in these cases if it were once corrupted the evil would be past all remedy but when different bodies succeed each other if the people see cause to disapprove of the present they may rectify its faults in the next a legislative assembly also which is sure to be separated again whereby its members will themselves become private men and subject to the full extent of the laws which they have enacted for others will think themselves bound in interest as well as duty to make only such laws as are good the utmost extent of time that the same parliament was allowed to sit by the statute   w and m c   was three years after the expiration of which reckoning from the return of the first summons the parliament was to have no longer continuance but by the statute   geo i st   c    in order professedly to prevent the great and continued expenses of frequent elections and the violent heats and animosities consequent thereupon and for the peace and security of the government then just recovering from the late rebellion this term was prolonged to seven years and what alone is an instance of the vast authority of parliament the very same house that was chosen for three years enacted its own continuance for seven   so that as our constitution now stands the parliament must expire or die a natural death at the end of every seventh year if not sooner dissolved by the royal prerogative chapter iii of the king and his title the supreme executive power of these kingdoms is vested by our laws in a single person the king or queen for it matters not to which sex the crown descends but the person entitled to it whether male or female is immediately invested with all the ensigns rights and prerogatives of sovereign power as is declared by statute   mar st   c        in discoursing of the royal rights and authority i shall consider the king under six distinct views   with regard to his title   his royal family   his councils   his duties   his prerogative   his revenue and first with regard to his title   0 the executive power of the english nation being vested in a single person by the general consent of the people the evidence of which general consent is long and immemorial usage it became necessary to the freedom and peace of the state that a rule should be laid down uniform universal and permanent in order to mark out with precision who is that single person to whom are committed in subservience to the law of the land the care and protection of the community and to whom in return the duty and allegiance of every individual are due it is of the highest importance to the public tranquillity and to the consciences      of private men that this rule should be clear and indisputable and our constitution has not left us in the dark upon this material occasion it will therefore be the endeavour of this chapter to trace out the constitutional doctrine of the royal succession with that freedom     and regard to truth yet mixed with that reverence and respect which the principles of liberty and the dignity of the subject require the grand fundamental maxim upon which the jus coronæ or right of succession to the throne of these kingdoms depends i take to be this that the crown is by common law and constitutional custom hereditary and this in a manner peculiar to itself but that the right of inheritance may from time to time be changed or limited by act of parliament under which limitations the crown still continues hereditary and this proposition it will be the business of this chapter to prove in all its branches first that the crown is hereditary secondly that it is hereditary in a manner peculiar to itself thirdly that this inheritance is subject to limitation by parliament lastly that when it is so limited it is hereditary in the new proprietor   first it is in general hereditary or descendible to the next heir on the death or demise of the last proprietor all regal governments must be either hereditary or elective and as i believe there is no instance wherein the crown of england has ever been asserted to be elective except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled trial of king charles i it must of consequence be hereditary yet while i assert an hereditary i by no means intend a jure divino title to the throne such a title may be allowed to have subsisted under the theocratic establishments of the children of israel in palestine but it never yet subsisted in any other country save only so far as kingdoms like other human fabrics are subject to the general and ordinary dispensations of providence nor indeed have a jure divino and an hereditary right any necessary connection with each other as some have very weakly imagined the titles of david and jehu were      equally jure divino as those of either solomon or ahab and yet david slew the sons of his predecessor and jehu his predecessor himself and when our kings have the same warrant as they had whether it be to sit upon the throne of their fathers or to destroy the house of the preceding sovereign they will then and not before possess the crown of england by a right like theirs immediately derived from heaven the hereditary right which the laws of england acknowledge owes its origin to the founders of our constitution and to them only it has no relation to nor depends upon the civil laws of the jews the greeks the romans or any other nation upon earth the municipal laws of one society having no connection with or influence upon the fundamental polity of another the founders of our english monarchy might perhaps if they had thought proper have made it an elective monarchy but they rather chose and upon good reason to establish originally a succession by inheritance this has been acquiesced in by general consent and ripened by degrees into common law the very same title that every private man has to his own estate lands are not naturally descendible any more than thrones but the law has thought proper for the benefit and peace of the public to establish hereditary succession in the one as well as the other it must be owned an elective monarchy seems to be the most obvious and best suited of any to the rational principles of government and the freedom of human nature and accordingly we find from history that in the infancy and first rudiments of almost every state the leader chief magistrate or prince hath usually been elective and if the individuals who compose that state could always continue true to first principles uninfluenced by passion or prejudice unassailed by corruption and unawed by violence elective succession were as much to be desired in a kingdom as in other inferior communities the best the wisest and the bravest man would then be sure of receiving that crown which his endowments have merited and the sense of an unbiassed majority would be dutifully acquiesced in by the few who were      of different opinions but history and observation will inform us that elections of every kind in the present state of human nature are too frequently brought about by influence partiality and artifice and even where the case is otherwise these practices will be often suspected and as constantly charged upon the successful by a splenetic disappointed minority this is an evil to which     all societies are liable as well those of a private and domestic kind as the great community of the public which regulates and includes the rest but in the former there is this advantage that such suspicions if false proceed no further than jealousies and murmurs which time will effectually suppress and if true the injustice may be remedied by legal means by an appeal to the tribunals to which every member of society has by becoming such virtually engaged to submit whereas in the great and independent society which every nation composes there is no superior to resort to but the law of nature no method to redress the infringements of that law but the actual exertion of private force as therefore between two nations complaining of mutual injuries the quarrel can only be decided by the law of arms so in one and the same nation when the fundamental principles of their common union are supposed to be invaded and more especially when the appointment of their chief magistrate is alleged to be unduly made the only tribunal to which the complainants can appeal is that of the god of battles the only process by which the appeal can be carried on is that of a civil and intestine war an hereditary succession to the crown is therefore now established in this and most other countries in order to prevent that periodical bloodshed and misery which the history of ancient imperial rome and the more modern experience of poland and germany may show us are the consequences of elective kingdoms   but secondly as to the particular mode of inheritance it in general corresponds with the feodal path of descents chalked out by the common law in the succession to landed estates yet with one or two material exceptions like estates the crown will descend lineally to the issue of the reigning monarch as it did from king john to richard ii through      a regular pedigree of six lineal generations as in common descents the preference of males to females and the right of primogeniture among the males are strictly adhered to thus edward v succeeded to the crown in preference to richard his younger brother and elizabeth his elder sister like lands or tenements the crown on failure of the male line descends to the issue female according to the ancient british custom remarked by tacitusa solent fœminarum ductu bellare et sexum in imperiis non discernere thus mary i succeeded to edward vi and the line of margaret queen of scots the daughter of henry vii succeeded on failure of the line of henry viii his son but among the females the crown descends by right of primogeniture to the eldest daughter only and her issue and not as in common inheritances to all the daughters at once the evident necessity of a sole succession to the throne having occasioned the royal law of descents to depart from the common law in this respect and therefore queen mary on the death of her brother succeeded to the crown alone and not in partnership with her sister elizabeth again the doctrine of representation prevails in the descent of the crown as it does in other inheritances whereby the lineal descendants of any person deceased stand in the same place as their ancestor if living would have done thus richard ii succeeded his grandfather edward iii in right of his father the black prince to the exclusion of all his uncles his grandfathers younger children lastly on failure of lineal descendants the crown goes to the next collateral relations of the late king provided they are lineally descended from the blood royal that is from that royal stock which originally acquired the crown thus henry i succeeded to william ii john to richard i and james i to elizabeth being all derived from the conqueror who was then the only regal stock but herein there is no objection as in the case of common descents to the succession of a brother an uncle or other collateral relation of the half blood that is where the relationship proceeds not from the same couple of ancestors which constitutes a kinsman of the whole blood but from a single ancestor only as when two persons are derived from the same father and not from the same      mother or vice versa provided only that the one ancestor from whom both are descended be that from whose veins the blood royal is communicated to each thus mary i inherited to edward vi and elizabeth     inherited to mary all children of the same father king henry viii but all by different mothers the reason of which diversity between royal and common descents will be better understood hereafter when we examine the nature of inheritances in general   the doctrine of hereditary right does by no means imply an indefeasible right to the throne no man will i think assert this that has considered our laws constitution and history without prejudice and with any degree of attention it is unquestionably in the breast of the supreme legislative authority of this kingdom the king and both houses of parliament to defeat this hereditary right and by particular entails limitations and provisions to exclude the immediate heir and vest the inheritance in any one else this is strictly consonant to our laws and constitution as may be gathered from the expression so frequently used in our statute book of the kings majesty his heirs and successors in which we may observe that as the word heirs necessarily implies an inheritance of hereditary right generally subsisting in the royal person so the word successors distinctly taken must imply that this inheritance may sometimes be broken through or that there may be a successor without being the heir of the king and this is so extremely reasonable that without such a power lodged somewhere our polity would be very defective for let us barely suppose so melancholy a case as that the heir apparent should be a lunatic an idiot or otherwise incapable of reigning how miserable would the condition of the nation be if he were also incapable of being set aside it is therefore necessary that this power should be lodged somewhere and yet the inheritance and regal dignity would be very precarious indeed if this power were expressly and avowedly lodged in the hands of the subject only to be exerted whenever prejudice caprice or discontent should happen to take the lead consequently it can nowhere be so properly lodged as in the two houses of parliament by and with the      consent of the reigning king who it is not to be supposed will agree to any thing improperly prejudicial to the rights of his own descendants and therefore in the king lords and commons in parliament assembled our laws have expressly lodged it   but fourthly however the crown may be limited or transferred it still retains its descendible quality and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it and hence in our law the king is said never to die in his political capacity though in common with other men he is subject to mortality in his natural because immediately upon the natural death of henry william or edward the king survives in his successor for the right of the crown vests eo instanti upon his heir either the hæres natus if the course of descent remains unimpeached or the hæres factus if the inheritance be under any particular settlement so that there can be no interregnum  but as sir matthew haleb observes the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown and therefore however acquired it becomes in him absolutely hereditary unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined in the same manner as landed estates to continue our former comparison are by the law hereditary or descendible to the heirs of the owner but still there exists a power by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person if this transfer be made simply and absolutely the lands will be hereditary in the new owner and descend to his heiratlaw but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations conditions or entails the lands must descend in that channel so limited and prescribed and no other in these four points consists as i take it the constitutional notion of hereditary right to the throne which will be still further elucidated and made clear     beyond all dispute from a short historical view of the successions to the crown of england the doctrines of our ancient lawyers and the several acts of parliament that have from time to time been made to create to declare to confirm to limit or to bar the hereditary      title to the throne and in the pursuit of this inquiry we shall find that from the days of egbert the first sole monarch of this kingdom even to the present the four cardinal maxims above mentioned have ever been held the constitutional canons of succession it is true the succession through fraud or force or sometimes through necessity when in hostile times the crown descended on a minor or the like has been very frequently suspended but has generally at last returned back into the old hereditary channel though sometimes a very considerable period has intervened and even in those instances where the succession has been violated the crown has ever been looked upon as hereditary in the wearer of it of which the usurpers themselves were so sensible that they for the most part endeavoured to vamp up some feeble show of a title by descent in order to amuse the people while they gained the possession of the kingdom and when possession was once gained they considered it as the purchase or acquisition of a new estate of inheritance and transmitted or endeavoured to transmit it to their own posterity by a kind of hereditary right of usurpation king egbert about the year  00 found himself in possession of the throne of the west saxons by a long and undisturbed descent from his ancestors of above three hundred years how his ancestors acquired their title whether by force by fraud by contract or by election it matters not much to inquire and is indeed a point of such high antiquity as must render all inquiries at best but plausible guesses his right must be supposed indisputably good because we know no better the other kingdoms of the heptarchy he acquired some by consent but most by a voluntary submission and it is an established maxim in civil polity and the law of nations that when one country is united to another in such a manner as that one keeps its government and states and the other loses them the latter entirely assimilates with or is melted down in the former and must adopt its laws and customsc and in pursuance of this maxim there hath ever been since the union of the heptarchy in king egbert a      general acquiescence under the hereditary monarchy of the west saxons through all the united kingdoms from egbert to the death of edmund ironside a period of above two hundred years the crown descended regularly through a succession of fifteen princes without any deviation or interruption save only that the sons of king ethelwolf succeeded to each other in the kingdom without regard to the children of the elder branches according to the rule of succession prescribed by their father and confirmed by the wittenagemote in the heat of the danish invasions and also that king edred the uncle of edwy mounted the throne for about nine years in the right of his nephew a minor the times being very troublesome and dangerous but this was with a view to preserve and not to destroy the succession and accordingly edwy succeeded him  king edmund ironside was obliged by the hostile irruption of the danes at first to divide his kingdom with canute king of denmark and canute after his death seized the whole of it edmunds sons being driven into foreign countries here the succession was suspended by actual force and a new family introduced upon the throne in whom however this newacquired throne continued hereditary for three reigns when upon the death of hardiknute the ancient saxon line was restored in the person of edward the confessor he was not indeed the true heir to the crown being the younger brother of king edmund ironside who had a son edward sirnamed from his exile the outlaw still living  but this son was then in hungary and the english     having just shaken off the danish yoke it was necessary that somebody on the spot should mount the throne and the confessor was the next of the royal line then in england on his decease without issue harold ii usurped the throne and almost at the same instant came on the norman invasion the right to the crown being all the time in edgar sirnamed atheling which signifies in the saxon language illustrious or of royal blood who was the son of edward the outlaw and grandson of edmund      ironside or as matthew parisd well expresses the sense of our old constitution edmundus autem latusferreum rex naturalis de stirpe regum genuit edwardum et edwardus genuit edgarum cui de jure debebatur regnum anglorum william the norman claimed the crown by virtue of a pretended grant from king edward the confessor a grant which if real was in itself utterly invalid because it was made as harold well observed in his reply to williams demande absque generali senatus et populi conventu et edicto which also very plainly implies that it then was generally understood that the king with consent of the general council might dispose of the crown and change the line of succession williams title however was altogether as good as harolds he being a mere private subject and an utter stranger to the royal blood edgar athelings undoubted right was overwhelmed by the violence of the times though frequently asserted by the english nobility after the conquest till such time as he died without issue but all their attempts proved unsuccessful and only served the more firmly to establish the crown in the family which had newly acquired it this conquest then by william of normandy was like that of canute before a forcible transfer of the crown of england into a new family but the crown being so transferred all the inherent properties of the crown were with it transferred also for the victory obtained at hastings not beingf a victory over the nation collectively but only over the person of harold the only right that the conqueror could pretend to acquire thereby was the right to possess the crown of england not to alter the nature of the government and therefore as the english laws still remained in force he must necessarily take the crown subject to those laws and with all its inherent properties the first and principal of which was its descendibility here then we must drop our race of saxon kings at least for a while and derive our descents from william the conqueror as from a new stock who acquired by right of war such as it is yet still the   00 dernier resort of kings a strong and undisputed title to the inheritable crown of england accordingly it descended from him to his sons william ii and henry i robert it must be owned his eldest son was kept out of possession by the arts and violence of his brethren who perhaps might proceed upon a notion which prevailed for some time in the law of descents though never adopted as the rule of public successionsg that when the eldest son was already provided for as robert was constituted duke of normandy by his fathers will in such a case the next brother was entitled to enjoy the rest of their fathers inheritance but as he died without issue henry at last had a good title to the throne whatever he might have at first stephen of blois who succeeded him was indeed the grandson of the conqueror by adelicia his daughter and claimed the throne by a feeble kind of hereditary right not as being the nearest of the male line but as the nearest male of the blood royal excepting his elder brother theobald who was earl of blois and therefore seems to have waived as he certainly never insisted on so troublesome and precarious a claim the real right was in the empress matilda or maud the daughter of henry i the rule of succession being where women are admitted at all that the daughter of a son shall be preferred to the son of a daughter so that stephen was little better than a mere usurper and therefore  0  he rather chose to rely on a title by electionh while the empress maud did not fail to assert her hereditary right by the sword which dispute was attended with various success and ended at last in the compromise made at wallingford that stephen should keep the crown but that henry the son of maud should succeed him as he afterwards accordingly did henry the second of that name was next after his mother matilda the undoubted heir of william the conqueror but he had also another connection in blood which endeared   0  him still further to the english he was lineally descended from edmund ironside the last of the saxon race of hereditary kings for edward the outlaw the son of edmund ironside had besides edgar atheling who died without issue a daughter margaret who was married to malcolm king of scotland and in her the saxon hereditary right resided by malcolm she had several children and among the rest matilda the wife of henry i who by him had the empress maud the mother of henry ii upon which account the saxon line is in our histories frequently said to have been restored in his person though in reality that right subsisted in the sons of malcolm by queen margaret king henrys best title being as heir to the conqueror from henry ii the crown descended to his eldest son richard i who dying childless the right vested in his nephew arthur the son of geoffrey his next brother but john the youngest son of king henry seized the throne claiming as appears from his charters the crown by hereditary righti that is to say he was next of kin to the deceased king being his surviving brother whereas arthur was removed one degree further being his brothers son though by right of representation he stood in the place of his father geoffrey and however flimsy this title and those of william rufus and stephen of blois may appear at this distance to us after the law of descents hath now been settled for so many centuries they were sufficient to puzzle the understandings of our brave but unlettered ancestors nor indeed can we wonder at the number of partisans who espoused the pretensions of king john in particular since even in the reign of his father king henry ii it was a point undeterminedk whether even in common inheritances the child of an elder brother should succeed to the land in right of representation or the younger surviving brother in right of proximity of blood nor is it to this day decided in the collateral succession to the fiefs of the empire whether the order of the stocks or the proximity of degree shall take placel however on the death of arthur   0  and his sister eleanor without issue a clear and indisputable title vested in henry iii the son of john and from him to richard the second a succession of six generations the crown descended in the true hereditary line under one of which race of princesm we find it declared in parliament that the law of the crown of england is and always hath been that the children of the king of england whether born in england or elsewhere ought to bear the inheritance after the death of their ancestors which law our sovereign lord the king the prelates earls and barons and other great men together with all the commons in parliament assembled do approve and affirm forever upon richard the seconds resignation of the crown he having no children he right resulted to the issue of his grandfather edward iii that king had many children besides his eldest edward the black prince of wales the father of richard ii but to avoid confusion i shall only mention three—william his second son who died without issue lionel duke of clarence his third son and john of gaunt duke of lancaster his fourth by the rules of succession therefore the posterity of lionel duke of clarence were entitled to the throne upon the resignation of king richard and had accordingly been declared by the king many years before the presumptive heirs of the crown which declaration  0  was also confirmed in parliamentn but henry duke of lancaster the son of john of gaunt having then a large army in the kingdom the pretence of raising which was to recover his patrimony from the king and to redress the grievances of the subject it was impossible for any other title to be asserted with any safety and he became king under the title of henry iv but as sir matthew hale remarkso though the people unjustly assisted henry iv in his usurpation of the crown yet he was not admitted thereto until he had declared that he claimed not as a conqueror which he very much inclined to dop but as a successor descended by right line of the blood royal as appears from the rolls of parliament in those times and in order to this he set up a show of two titles   0  the one upon the pretence of being the first of the blood royal in the entire male line whereas the duke of clarence left only one daughter philippa from which female branch by a marriage with edmond mortimer earl of march the house of york descended the other by reviving an exploded rumour first propagated by john of gaunt that edmond earl of lancaster to whom henrys mother was heiress was in reality the elder brother of king edward i though his parents on account of his personal deformity had imposed him on the world for the younger and therefore henry would be entitled to the crown either as successor to richard ii in case the entire male line was allowed a preference to the female or even prior to that unfortunate prince if the crown could descend through a female while an entire male line was existing however as in edward the thirds time we find the parliament approving and affirming the law of the crown as before stated so in the reign of henry iv they actually exerted their right of newsettling the succession to the crown and this was done by the statute   hen iv c   whereby it is enacted that the inheritance of the crown and realms of england and france and all other the kings dominions shall be set and remainq in the person of our sovereign lord the king and in the heirs of his body issuing and prince henry is declared heir apparent to the crown to hold to him and the heirs of his body issuing with remainder to the lord thomas lord john and lord humphry the kings sons and the heirs of their bodies respectively which is indeed nothing more than the law would have done before provided henry the fourth had been a rightful king it however serves to show that it was then generally understood that the king and parliament had a right to newmodel and regulate the succession to the crown and we may also observe with what caution and delicacy the parliament then avoided declaring any sentiment of henrys original title however sir edward coke more than once expressly declaresr that at the time of   0  passing this act the right of the crown was in the descent from philippa daughter and heir of lionel duke of clarence nevertheless the crown descended regularly from henry iv to his son and grandson henry v and vi in the latter of whose reigns the house of york asserted their dormant title and after imbruing the kingdom in blood and confusion for seven years together at last established it in the person of edward iv at his accession to the throne after a breach of the succession that continued for three descents and above threescore years the distinction of a king de jure and a king de facto began to be first taken in order to indemnify such as had submitted to the late establishment and to provide for the peace of the kingdom by confirming all honours conferred and all acts done by those who were now called the usurpers not tending to the disherison of the rightful heir in statute   edw iv c   the three henrys are styled late kings of england successively in dede and not of ryght and in all the charters which i have met with of king edward wherever he has occasion to speak of any of the line of lancaster he calls them nuper de facto et non de jure reges angliæ  0  edward iv left two sons and a daughter the eldest of which sons king edward v enjoyed the regal dignity for a very short time and was then deposed by richard his unnatural uncle who immediately usurped the royal dignity having previously insinuated to the populace a suspicion of bastardy in the children of edward iv to make a show of some hereditary title after which he is generally believed to have murdered his two nephews upon whose death the right of the crown devolved to their sister elizabeth the tyrannical reign of king richard iii gave occasion to henry earl of richmond to assert his title to the crown a title the most remote and unaccountable that was ever set up and which nothing could have given success to but the universal detestation of the then usurper richard for besides that he claimed under a descent from john of gaunt whose title was now exploded the claim such as it was was through john earl of somerset a bastard son hegotten by john of   0  gaunt upon catherine swinford it is true that by an act of parliament  0 ric ii this son was with others legitimated and made inheritable to all lands offices and dignities as if he had been born in wedlock but still with an express reservation of the crown excepta dignitate regalis  notwithstanding all this immediately after the battle of bosworth field he assumed the regal dignity the right of the crown then being as sir edward coke expressly declarest in elizabeth eldest daughter of edward iv and his possession was established by parliament holden the first year of his reign in the act for which purpose the parliament seems to have copied the caution of their predecessors in the reign of henry iv and therefore as lord bacon the historian of this reign observes carefully avoided any recognition of henry viis right which indeed was none at all and the king would not have it by way of new law or ordinance whereby a right might seem to be created and conferred upon him and therefore a middle way was rather chosen by way as the noble historian expresses it of establishment and that under covert and indifferent words that the inheritance of the crown should rest remain and abide in king henry vii and the heirs of his body thereby providing for the future and at the same time acknowledging his present possession but not determining either way whether that possession was de jure or de facto merely however he soon after married elizabeth of york the undoubted heiress of the conqueror and thereby gained as sir edward cokeu declares by much his best title to the crown whereupon the act made in his favour was so much disregarded that it never was printed in our statute books henry the eighth the issue of this marriage succeeded to the crown by clear indisputable hereditary right and transmitted it to his three children in successive order but in his reign we at several times find the parliament busy in regulating the succession to the kingdom and first by   0  statute    hen viii c    which recites the mischiefs which have and may ensue by disputed titles because no perfect and substantial provision hath been made by law concerning the succession and then enacts that the crown shall be entailed to his majesty and the sons or heirs male of his body and in default of such sons to the lady elizabeth who is declared to be the kings eldest issue female in exclusion of the lady mary on account of her supposed  0  illegitimacy by the divorce of her mother queen catherine and to the lady elizabeths heirs of her body and so on from issue female to issue female and the heirs of their bodies by course of inheritance according to their ages as the crown of england hath been accustomed and ought to go in case where there be heirs female of the same and in default of issue female then to the kings right heirs forever this single statute is an ample proof of all the four positions we at first set out with but upon the kings divorce from anne boleyn this statute was with regard to the settlement of the crown repealed by statute    hen viii c   wherein the lady elizabeth is also as well as the lady mary bastardized and the crown settled on the kings children by queen jane seymour and his future wives and in defect of such children then with this remarkable remainder to such persons as the king by letters patent or last will and testament should limit and appoint the same a vast power but notwithstanding as it was regularly vested in him by the supreme legislative authority it was therefore indisputably valid but this power was never carried into execution for by statute    hen viii c   the kings two daughters are legitimated again and the crown is limited to prince edward by name after that to the lady mary and then to the lady elizabeth and the heirs of their respective bodies which succession took effect accordingly being indeed no other than the usual course of the law with regard to the descent of the crown but lest there should remain any doubt in the minds of the people through this jumble of acts for limiting the succession by statute   mar st   c   queen marys   0  hereditary right to the throne is acknowledged and recognised in these words—the crown of these realms is most lawfully justly and rightly descended and come to the queens highness that now is being the very true and undoubted heir and inheritrix thereof and again upon the queens marriage with philip of spain in the statute which settles the preliminaries of that matchx the hereditary right to the crown is thus asserted and declared—as touching the right of the queens inheritance in the realm and dominions of england the children whether male or female shall succeed in them according to the known laws statutes and customs of the same which determination of the parliament that the succession shall continue in the usual course seems tacitly to imply a power of newmodelling and altering it in case the legislature had thought proper on queen elizabeths accession her right is recognised in still stronger terms than her sisters the parliament acknowledgingy that the queens highness is and in very deed and of most mere right ought to be by the laws of god and the laws and statutes of this realm our most lawful and rightful sovereign liege lady and queen and that her highness is rightly lineally and lawfully descended and come of the blood royal of this realm of england in and to whose princely person and to the heirs of her body lawfully to be begotten after her the imperial crown and dignity of this realm doth belong and in the same reign by statute    eliz c   we find the right of parliament to direct the succession of the crown asserted in the most explicit words—if any person shall hold affirm or maintain that the common laws of this realm not altered by parliament ought not to direct the right of the crown of england or that the queens majesty with and by the authority of parliament is not able to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to limit and bind the crown of this realm and the descent limitation inheritance and government thereof such person so holding affirming or maintaining shall   0  during the life of the queen be guilty of high treason and after her decease shall be guilty of a misdemesnor and forfeit his goods and chattels on the death of queen elizabeth without issue the line of henry viii became extinct it therefore became necessary to recur to the other issue of henry vii by elizabeth of york his queen whose eldest daughter margaret having married james iv king of scotland king james the sixth of scotland  0  and of england the first was the lineal descendant from that alliance so that in his person as clearly as in henry viii centred all the claims of different competitors from the conquest downwards he being indisputably the lineal heir of the conqueror  and what is still more remarkable in his person also centred the right of the saxon monarchs which had been suspended from the conquest till his accession for as formerly observed margaret the sister of edgar atheling the daughter of edward the outlaw and granddaughter of king edmund ironside was the person in whom the hereditary right of the saxon kings supposing it not abolished by the conquest resided she married malcolm king of scotland and henry ii by a descent from matilda their daughter is generally called the restorer of the saxon line but it must be remembered that malcolm by his saxon queen had sons as well as daughters and that the royal family of scotland from that time downwards were the offspring of malcolm and margaret of this royal family king james the first was the direct lineal heir and therefore united in his person every possible claim by hereditary right to the english as well as scottish throne being the heir both of egbert and william the conqueror and it is no wonder that a prince of more learning than wisdom who could deduce an hereditary title for more than eight hundred years should easily be taught by the flatterers of the times to believe there was something divine in his right and that the finger of providence was visible in its   0  preservation whereas though a wise institution it was clearly a human institution and the right inherent in him no natural but a positive right and in this and no other light was it taken by the english parliament who by statute   jac i c   did recognise and acknowledge that immediately upon the dissolution and decease of elizabeth late queen of england the imperial crown thereof did by inherent birthright and lawful and undoubted succession descend and come to his most excellent majesty as being lineally justly and lawfully next and sole heir of the blood royal of this realm not a word here of any right immediately derived from heaven which if it existed anywhere must be sought for among the aborigines of the island the ancient britons among whose princes indeed some have gone to search it for himz but wild and absurd as the doctrine of divine right most undoubtedly is it is still more astonishing that when so many hereditary rights had centred in this king his son and heir king charles the first should be told by those infamous judges who pronounced his unparalleled sentence that he was an elective prince elected by his people and therefore accountable to them in his own proper person for his conduct the confusion instability and madness which followed the fatal catastrophe of that pious and unfortunate prince will be a standing argument in favour of hereditary monarchy to all future ages as they proved at last to the then deluded people who in order to recover that peace and happiness which for twenty years together they had lost in a solemn parliamentary convention of the states restored the right heir of the crown and in the proclamation for that purpose which was drawn up and attended by both housesa they declared that according to their duty and allegiance they did heartily joyfully and unanimously acknowledge and proclaim that immediately upon the    0 decease of our late sovereign lord king charles the imperial crown of these realms did by inherent birthright and lawful and undoubted succession descend and come to his most excellent majesty charles the second as being lineally justly and lawfully next heir of the blood royal of   0 this realm and thereunto they most humbly and faithfully did submit and oblige themselves their heirs and posterity forever thus i think it clearly appears from the highest authority this nation is acquainted with that the crown of england hath been ever an hereditary crown though subject to limitations by parliament the remainder of this chapter will consist principally of those instances wherein the parliament has asserted or exercised this right of altering and limiting the succession a right which we have seen was before exercised and asserted in the reigns of henry iv henry vii henry viii queen mary and queen elizabeth the first instance in point of time is the famous bill of exclusion which raised such a ferment in the latter end of the reign of king charles the second it is well known that the purport of this bill was to have set aside the kings brother and presumptive heir the duke of york from the succession on the score of his being a papist that it passed the house of commons but was rejected by the lords the king having also declared beforehand that he never would be brought to consent to it and from this transaction we may collect two things   that the crown was universally acknowledged to be hereditary and the inheritance indefeasible unless by parliament else it had been needless to prefer such a bill   that the parliament had a power to have defeated the inheritance else such a bill had been ineffectual the commons acknowledged the hereditary right then subsisting and the lords did not dispute the power but merely the propriety of an exclusion however as the bill took no effect king james the second succeeded to the throne of his ancestors and might have enjoyed it during the remainder of his life but for his own infatuated conduct which with other concurring circumstances brought on the revolution in           the true ground and principle upon which that memorable event proceeded was an entirely new case in politics which had never before happened in our history—the abdication of the reigning monarch and the vacancy of the throne thereupon it was not a defeasance of the right of succession and a new limitation of the crown by the king and both houses of parliament it was the act of the nation alone upon a conviction that there was no king in being for in a full assembly of the lords and commons met in a convention upon the supposition of this vacancy both housesb came to this resolution—that king james the second having endeavoured to subvert the constitution of the kingdom by breaking the original contract between king and people and by the advice of jesuits and other wicked persons having violated the fundamental laws and having withdrawn himself out of this kingdom has abdicated the government and that the throne is thereby vacant thus ended at once by this sudden and unexpected vacancy of the throne the old line of succession which from the conquest had lasted above six hundred years and from the union of the heptarchy in king egbert almost nine hundred the facts themselves thus appealed to the kings endeavour to subvert the constitution by breaking the original contract his violation of the fundamental laws and his withdrawing himself out of the kingdom were evident and notorious and the consequences drawn from these facts namely that they amounted to an abdication of the government which abdication did not affect only the person of the king himself but also all his heirs and rendered the throne absolutely and completely vacant it belonged to our ancestors to determine  for whenever     a question arises between the society at large and any magistrate vested with powers originally delegated by that society it must be decided by the voice of the society itself there is not upon earth any other tribunal to resort to and that these consequences were fairly deduced from these facts our ancestors have solemnly determined in a full parliamentary convention representing the whole society the      reasons upon which they decided may be found at large in the parliamentary proceedings of the times and may be matter of distructive amusement for us to contemplate as a speculative point of history but care must be taken not to carry this inquiry further than merely for instruction or amusement  the idea that the consciences of posterity were concerned in the rectitude of their ancestors decisions gave birth to those dangerous political heresies which so long distracted the state but at length are all happily extinguished i therefore rather choose to consider this great political measure upon the solid footing of authority than to reason in its favour from its justice moderation and expedience because that might imply a right of dissenting or revolting from it in case we should think it to have been unjust oppressive or inexpedient whereas our ancestors having most indisputably a competent jurisdiction to decide this great and important question and having in fact decided it it is now become our duty at this distance of time to acquiesce in their determination being born under that establishment which was built upon this foundation and obliged by every tie religious as well as civil to maintain it  but while we rest this fundamental transaction in point of authority upon grounds the least liable to cavil we are bound both in justice and gratitude to add that it was conducted with a temper and moderation which naturally arose from its equity that however it might in some respects go beyond the letter of our ancient laws the reason of which will more fully appear hereafterc it was agreeable to the spirit of our constitution and the rights of human nature and that though in other points owing to the peculiar circumstances of things and persons it was not altogether so perfect as might have been wished yet from thence a new era commenced in which the bounds of prerogative and liberty have been better defined the principles of government more thoroughly     examined and understood and the rights of the subject more explicitly guarded by legal provisions than in any other period of the english history in particular it is      worthy observation that the convention in this their judgment avoided with great wisdom the wild extremes into which the visionary theories of some zealous republicans would have led them they held that this misconduct of king james amounted to an endeavour to subvert the constitution and not to an actual subversion or total dissolution of the government according to the principles of mr locked which would have reduced the society almost to a state of nature would have levelled all distinctions of honour rank offices and property would have annihilated the sovereign power and in consequence have repealed all positive laws and would have left the people at liberty to have erected a new system of state upon a new foundation of polity they therefore very prudently voted it to amount to no more than an abdication of the government and a consequent vacancy of the throne whereby the government was allowed to subsist though the executive magistrate was gone and the kingly office to remain though king james was no longer kinge and thus the constitution was kept entire which upon every sound principle of government must otherwise have fallen to pieces had so principal and constituent a part as the royal authority been abolished or even suspended this single postulatum the vacancy of the throne being once established the rest that was then done followed almost of course for if the throne be at any time vacant which may happen by other means besides that of abdication as if all the blood royal should fail without any successor appointed by parliament if i say a vacancy by any means whatsoever should happen the right of disposing of this vacancy seems naturally to result to the lords and commons the trustees and representatives of the nation 0 for there are no other hands in which it can so properly be intrusted and there is a necessity of its being intrusted somewhere else the whole frame of government must be dissolved and perish the lords and commons having therefore determined this main fundamental article that there was a vacancy of the throne they proceeded to fill up that vacancy in such manner as they      judged the most proper and this was done by their declaration of    february     f in the following manner—that william and mary prince and princess of orange be and be declared king and queen to hold the crown and royal dignity during their lives and the life of the survivor of them and that the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said prince of orange in the names of the said prince and princess during their joint lives and after their deceases the said crown and royal dignity to be to the heirs of the body of the said princess and for default of such issue to the princess anne of denmark and the heirs of her body and for default of such issue to the heirs of the body of the said prince of orange perhaps upon the principles before established the convention might if they pleased have vested the regal dignity in a family entirely new and strangers to the royal blood but they were too well acquainted with the benefits of hereditary succession and the influence which it has by custom over the minds of the people to depart any farther from the ancient line than temporary necessity and selfpreservation required they therefore settled the crown first on king william and queen mary king jamess eldest daughter for their joint lives then on the survivor of them and then on the issue of queen mary upon failure     of such issue it was limited to the princess anne king jamess second daughter and her issue and lastly on failure of that to the issue of king william who was the grandson of charles the first and nephew as well as soninlaw of king james the second being the son of mary his eldest sister this settlement included all the protestant posterity of king charles i except such other issue as king james might at any time have which was totally omitted through fear of a popish succession and this order of succession took effect accordingly these three princes therefore king william queen mary and queen anne did not take the crown by hereditary right or descent but by way of donation or purchase as the      lawyers call it by which they mean any method of acquiring an estate otherwise than by descent the new settlement did not merely consist in excluding king james and the person pretended to be prince of wales and then suffering the crown to descend in the old hereditary channel for the usual course of descent was in some instances broken through and yet the convention still kept it in their eye and paid a great though not total regard to it let us see how the succession would have stood if no abdication had happened and king james had left no other issue than his two daughters queen mary and queen anne it would have stood thus queen mary and her issue queen anne and her issue king william and his issue but we may remember that queen mary was only nominally queen jointly with her husband king william who alone had the regal power and king william was personally preferred to queen anne though his issue was postponed to hers clearly therefore these princes were successively in possession of the crown by a title different from the usual course of descents it was towards the end of king williams reign when all hopes of any surviving issue from any of these princes died with the duke of gloucester that the king and parliament thought it necessary again to exert their power of limiting and appointing the succession in order to prevent another vacancy of the throne which must have ensued upon their deaths as no further provision was made at the revolution than for the issue of queen mary queen anne and king william the parliament had previously by the statute of   w and m st   c   enacted that every person who should be reconciled to or hold communion with the see of rome should profess the popish religion or should marry a papist should be excluded and be forever incapable to inherit possess or enjoy the crown and that in such case the people should be absolved from their allegiance and the crown should descend to such persons being protestants as would have inherited the same in case the person so reconciled holding communion professing or marrying were naturally dead to act therefore consistently with themselves and at the same      time pay as much regard to the old hereditary line as their former resolutions would admit they turned their eyes on the princess sophia electress and duchess dowager of hanover the most accomplished princess of her ageg for upon the impending extinction of the protestant posterity of charles the first the old law of legal descent directed them to recur to the descendants of james the first and the princess sophia being the youngest daughter of elizabeth queen of bohemia who was the daughter of james the first was the nearest of the ancient blood royal who was not incapacitated by professing the popish religion on her therefore and the heirs of her body being protestants the remainder of the crown expectant on the death of king william and queen anne without issue was settled by statute        w iii c   and at the same time it was enacted that whosoever should hereafter come to the possession of the crown should join in the communion of the church of england as by law established this is the last limitation of the crown that has been made by parliament and these several actual limitations from the time of henry iv to the present do clearly prove the power of the king and parliament to newmodel or alter     the succession and indeed it is now again made highly penal to dispute it for by the statute   anne c   it is enacted that if any person maliciously advisedly and directly shall maintain by writing or printing that the kings of this realm with the authority of parliament are not able to make laws to bind the crown and the descent thereof he shall be guilty of high treason or if he maintains the same by only preaching teaching or advised speaking he shall incur the penalties of a præmunire the princess sophia dying before queen anne the inheritance thus limited descended on her son and heir king george the first and having on the death of the queen taken effect in his person from him it descended to his late majesty king george the second and from him to his grandson and heir our present gracious sovereign king george the third        hence it is easy to collect that the title to the crown is at present hereditary though not quite so absolutely hereditary as formerly and the common stock or ancestor from whom the descent must be derived is also different formerly the common stock was king egbert then william the conqueror afterwards in james the firsts time the two common stocks united and so continued till the vacancy of the throne in      now it is the princess sophia in whom the inheritance was vested by the new king and parliament formerly the descent was absolute and the crown went to the next heir without any restriction but now upon the new settlement the inheritance is conditional being limited to such heirs only of the body of the princess sophia as are protestant members of the church of england and are married to none but protestants and in this due medium consists i apprehend the true constitutional notion of the right of succession to the imperial crown of these kingdoms the extremes between which it steers are each of them equally destructive of those ends for which societies were formed and are kept on foot where the magistrate upon every succession is elected by the people and may by the express provision of the laws be deposed if not punished by his subjects this may sound like the perfection of liberty and look well enough when delineated on paper but in practice will be ever productive of tumult contention and anarchy and on the other hand divine indefeasible hereditary right when coupled with the doctrine of unlimited passive obedience is surely of all constitutions the most thoroughly slavish and dreadful but when such an hereditary right as our laws have created and vested in the royal stock is closely interwoven with those liberties which we have seen in a former chapter are equally the inheritance of the subject this union will form a constitution in theory the most beautiful of any in practice the most approved and i trust in duration the most permanent it was the duty of an expounder of our laws to lay this constitution before the student in its true and genuine light it is the duty of every good englishman to understand to revere to defend it     chapter iv of the kings royal family the first and most considerable branch of the kings royal family regarded by the laws of england is the queen the queen of england is either queen regent queen consort or queen dowager the queen regent regnant or sovereign is she who holds the crown in her own right as the first and perhaps the second queen mary queen elizabeth and queen anne and such a one has the same powers prerogatives rights dignities and duties as if she had been a king this was observed in the entrance of the last chapter and is expressly declared by statute   mar i st   c    but the queen consort is the wife of the reigning king and she by virtue of her marriage is participant of divers prerogatives above other womena and first she is a public person exempt and distinct from the king and not like other married women so closely connected as to have lost all legal or separate existence so long as the marriage continues for the queen is of ability to purchase lands and to convey them to make leases to grant copyholds and do other acts of ownership without the concurrence of her lord which no other married woman can dob a privilege as old as the saxon erac she is also capable of taking a grant from the king which no other wife is from her husband and in this particular she agrees with the augusta or piissima regina conjux divi imperatoris of the roman laws who according to justiniand was equally      capable of making a grant to and receiving one from the emperor the queen of england hath separate courts and offices distinct from the kings not only in matters of ceremony but even of law and her attorney and solicitor general are entitled to a place within the bar of his majestys courts together with the kings counsele she may likewise sue and be sued alone without joining her husband  she may also have a separate property in goods as well as lands and has a right to dispose of them by will  in short she is in all legal proceedings looked upon as a feme sole and not as a feme covert as a single not as a married womanf for which the reason given by sir edward coke is this because the wisdom of the common law would not have the king whose continual care and study is for the public and circa ardua regni to be troubled and disquieted on account of his wifes domestic affairs and therefore it vests in the queen a power of transacting her own concerns without the intervention of the king as if she was an unmarried woman the queen hath also many exemptions and minute prerogatives for instance she pays no tollg nor is she liable to any amercement in any courth but     in general unless where the law has expressly declared her exempted she is upon the same footing with other subjects being to all intents and purposes the kings subject and not his equal in like manner as in the imperial law augusta legibus soluta non esti the queen hath also some pecuniary advantages which form her a distinct revenue as in the first place she is entitled to an ancient perquisite called queengold or aurum reginæ which is a royal revenue belonging to every queen consort during her marriage with the king and due from every person who hath made a voluntary offering or fine to the king amounting to ten marks or upwards for and in consideration of any privileges grants licenses pardons or    0 other matter of royal favour conferred upon him by the king and it is due in the proportion of onetenth part or more over and above the entire offering or fine made to the king and becomes an actual debt of record to the queens majesty by the mere recording of the finek as if an hundred marks of silver be given to the king for liberty to take in mortmain or to have a fair market park chase or freewarren there the queen is entitled to ten marks in silver or what was formerly an equivalent denomination to one mark in gold by the name of queengold or aurum reginæl but no such payment is due for any aids or subsidies granted to the king in parliament or convocation nor for fines imposed by courts on offenders against their will nor for voluntary presents to the king without any consideration moving from him to the subject nor for any sale or contract whereby the present revenues or possessions of the crown are granted away or diminishedm the original revenue of our ancient queens before and soon after the conquest seems to have consisted in certain reservations or rents out of the demesne lands of the crown which were expressly appropriated to her majesty distinct from the king it is frequent in domesday book after specifying the rent due to the crown to add likewise the quantity of gold or other renders reserved to the queenn these were frequently appropriated to particular purposes to buy wool for her majestys useo to purchase oil for her lampsp or to furnish her attire from head to footq which was frequently very costly as one single robe in the fifth year of henry ii      stood the city of london in upwards of fourscore poundsr a practice somewhat similar to that of the eastern countries where whole cities and provinces were specifically assigned to purchase particular parts of the queens apparels and for a further addition to her income this duty of queengold is supposed to have been originally granted those matters of grace and favour out of which it arose being frequently obtained from the crown by the powerful intercession of the queen there are traces of its payment though obscure ones in the book of domesday and in the great piperoll of henry the firstt in the reign of henry the second the manner of collecting it appears to have been well understood and it forms a distinct head in the ancient dialogue of the exchequeru written in the time of that prince and usually attributed to gervase of tilbury from that time downwards it was regularly claimed and enjoyed by all the queen consorts of england till the death of henry viii though after the accession of the tudor family the collecting of it seems to have been much neglected and there being no queen consort afterwards till the accession of james i a period of near sixty years its very nature and quantity became then a matter of doubt and being referred by the king to the chief justices and chief baron their report of it was so very unfavourablev that his consort queen anne though she claimed     it yet never thought proper to exact it in         car i a time fertile of expedients for raising money upon dormant precedents in our old records of which shipmoney was a fatal instance the king at the petition of his queen henrietta maria issued out his writw for levying it but afterwards purchased it of his consort at the price of ten thousand pounds finding it perhaps too trifling and troublesome to levy and when afterwards at the restoration by      the abolition of the military tenures and the fines that were consequent upon them the little that legally remained of this revenue was reduced to almost nothing at all in vain did mr prynne by a treatise which does honour to his abilities as a painful and judicious antiquary endeavour to excite queen catherine to revive this antiquated claim another ancient perquisite belonging to the queen consort mentioned by all our old writersx and therefore only worthy notice is this that on the taking of a whale on the coasts which is a royal fish it shall be divided between the king and queen the head only being the kings property and the tail of it the queens de sturgione observatur quod rex illum habebit integrum de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam the reason of this whimsical division as assigned by our ancient recordsy was to furnish the queens wardrobe with whalebone  but further though the queen is in all respects a subject yet in point of the security of her life and person she is put on the same footing with the king it is equally treason by the statute    edw iii to compass or imagine the death of our lady the kings companion as of the king himself and to violate or defile the queen consort amounts to the same high crime as well in the person committing the fact as in the queen herself if consenting a law of henry the eighthz made it treason also for any woman who was not a virgin to marry the king without informing him thereof but this law was soon after repealed it trespassing too strongly as well on natural justice as female modesty  if however the queen be accused of any species of treason she shall whether consort or dowager be tried by the peers of parliament as queen anne boleyn was in    hen viii  the husband of a queen regnant as prince george of denmark was to queen anne is her subject and may be guilty of high treason against her  but in the instance of conjugal infidelity he is not subjected to the same penal      restrictions for which the reason seems to be that if a queen consort is unfaithful to the royal bed this may debase or bastardize the heirs to the crown     but no such danger can be consequent on the infidelity of the husband to a queen regnant a queen dowager is the widow of the king and as such enjoys most of the privileges belonging to her as queen consort but it is not high treason to conspire her death or to violate her chastity for the same reason as was before alleged because the succession to the crown is not thereby endangered yet still pro dignitate regali no man can marry a queen dowager without special license from the king on pain of forfeiting his lands and goods this sir edward cokea tells us was enacted in parliament in   hen vi though the statute be not in print  but she though an alien born shall still be entitled to dower after the kings demise which no other alien isb a queen dowager when married again to a subject doth not lose her regal dignity as peeresses dowager do their peerage when they marry commoners for catherine queen dowager of henry v though she married a private gentleman owen ap meredith ap theodore commonly called owen tudor yet by the name of catherine queen of england maintained an action against the bishop of carlisle  and so the queen dowager of navarre marrying with edmond earl of lancaster brother to king edward the first maintained an action of dower after the death of her second husband by the name of queen of navarrec the prince of wales or heirapparent to the crown and also his royal consort and the princess royal or eldest daughter of the king are likewise peculiarly regarded by the laws for by statute    edw iii to compass or conspire the death of the former or to violate the chastity of either of the latter are as much high treason as to conspire the death of the king or violate the chastity of the queen and this upon the same reason as was before given because the prince of wales is next in succession to the crown and to violate his wife might taint the blood royal with bastardy and the eldest daughter of the king is also alone inheritable 0 to the      crown on failure of issue male and therefore more respected by the laws than any of her younger sisters   insomuch that upon this united with other feodal principles while our military tenures were in force the king might levy an aid for marrying his eldest daughter and her only the heirapparent to the crown   is usually made     prince of wales and earl of chester   by special creation and investiture   but being the kings eldest son   he is by inheritance duke of cornwall without any new creationd       the rest of the royal family may be considered in two different lights according to the different senses in which the term royal family is used the larger sense includes all those who are by any possibility inheritable to the crown such before the revolution were all the descendants of william the conqueror who had branched into an amazing extent by intermarriages with the ancient nobility since the revolution and act of settlement it means the protestant issue of the princess sophia now comparatively few in number but which in process of time may possibly be as largely diffused the more confined sense includes only those who are within a certain degree of propinquity to the reigning prince and to whom therefore the law pays an extraordinary regard and respect but after that degree is past they fall into the rank of ordinary subjects and are seldom considered any further unless called to the succession upon failure of the nearer lines for though collateral consanguinity is regarded indefinitely with respect to inheritance or succession yet it is and can only be regarded within some certain limits in any other respect by the natural constitution of things and the dictates of positive lawe the younger sons and daughters of the king and other branches of the royal family who are not in the immediate line of succession were therefore little further regarded by the ancient law than to give them to a certain degree precedence before all peers and public officers as well ecclesiastical as temporal this is done by the statute    hen viii c  0      which enacts that no person except the kings children shall presume to sit or have place at the side of the cloth of estate in the parliament chamber and that certain great officers therein named shall have precedence above all dukes except only such as shall happen to be the kings son brother uncle nephew which sir edward cokef explains to signify grandson or nepos or brothers or sisters son therefore after these degrees are past peers or others of the blood royal are entitled to no place or precedence except what belongs to them by their personal rank or dignity which made sir edward walker complaing that by the hasty creation of prince rupert to be duke of cumberland and of the earl of lenox to be duke of that name previous to the creation of king charless second son james to be duke of york it might happen that their grandsons would have precedence of the grandsons of the duke of york indeed under the description of the kings children his grandsons are held to be included without having recourse to sir edward cokes interpretation of nephew and therefore when his late majesty king george ii created his grandson edward the second son of frederick prince of wales deceased duke of york and referred it to the house of lords to settle his place and precedence they certifiedh that he ought to have place next to the late duke of cumberland the then kings youngest son and that he might have a seat on the left hand of the cloth of estate but when on the accession of his present majesty those royal personages ceased to take place as the children and ranked only as the brother and uncle of the king they also left their seats on the side of the cloth of estate so that when the duke of gloucester his majestys second brother took his seat in the house of peersi he was placed on the upper end of     the carls bench on which the dukes usually sit next to his royal highness the duke of york and in      upon a question referred to all the judges by king george i it was resolved by the opinion of ten against the other two that the education and care of all the kings grandchildren while minors did belong of right to his majesty as king of this realm even during their fathers lifek   but they all agreed that the care and approbation of their marriages when grown up belonged to the king their grandfather and the judges have more recently concurred in the opinionl that this care and approbation extend also to the presumptive heir of the crown though to what other branches of the royal family the same did extend they did not find precisely determined the most frequent instances of the crowns interposition go no      further than nephews and niecesm but examples are not wanting of its reaching to more distant collateralsn and the statute   henry vi before mentioned which prohibits the marriage of a queen dowager without the consent of the king assigns this reason for it  —because the disparagement of the queen shall give greater comfort and example to other ladies of estate who are of the bloodroyal more lightly to disparage themselveso therefore by the statute    hen viii c    repealed among other statutes of treasons by   edw vi c    it was made high treason for any man to contract marriage with the kings children or reputed children his sisters or aunts ex parte paterna or the children of his brethren or sisters being exactly the same degrees to which precedence is allowed by the statute    hen viii before mentioned and now by statute    geo iii c    no descendant of the body of king george ii other than the issue of princesses married into foreign families is capable of contracting matrimony without the previous consent of the king signified under the great seal and any marriage contracted without such consent is void provided that such of the said descendants as are above the age of twentyfive may after a twelvemonths notice given to the kings privy council contract and solemnize marriage without the consent of the crown unless both houses of parliament shall before the expiration of the said year expressly declare their disapprobation of such intended marriage and all persons solemnizing assisting or being present at any such prohibited marriage shall incur the penalties of the statute of præmunire       chapter v of the councils belonging to the king the third point of view in which we are to consider the king is with regard to his councils for in order to assist him in the discharge of his duties the maintenance of his dignity and the exertion of his prerogative the law hath assigned him a diversity of councils to advise with    the first of these is the high court of parliament whereof we have already treated at large   secondly the peers of the realm are by their birth hereditary counsellors of the crown and may be called together by the king to impart their advice in all matters of importance to the realm either in time of parliament or which hath been their principal use when there is no parliament in beinga accordingly bractonb speaking of the nobility of his time says they might probably be called consules a consulendo reges enim tales sibi associant ad consulendum and in our law booksc it is laid down that peers are created for two reasons   ad consulendum   ad defendendum regem on which account the law gives them certain great and high privileges such as freedom from arrests c even when no parliament is sitting because it intends that they are always assisting the king with their counsel for the commonwealth or keeping the realm in safety by their prowess and valour      instances of conventions of the peers to advise the king have been in former times very frequent though now fallen into disuse by reason of the more regular meetings of parliament sir edward coked gives us an extract of a record   hen iv concerning an exchange of lands between the king and the earl of northumberland wherein the value of each was agreed to be settled by advice of parliament if any should be called before the feast of saint lucia or otherwise by advice of the grand council of peers which the king promises to assemble before the said feast in case no parliament shall be called many other instances of this kind of meeting are to be found under our ancient kings though the formal method of convoking them had been so long left off that when king charles i in    0 issued out writs under the great seal to call a great council of all the peers of england to meet and attend his majesty at york previous to the meeting of the long parliament the earl of clarendone mentions it as a new invention not before heard of that is as he explains himself so old that it had not been practised in some hundreds of years but though there had not so long before been an instance nor has there been any since of assembling them in so solemn a manner yet in cases of emergency our princes have at several times thought proper to call for and consult as many of the nobility as could easily be got together as was particularly the case with king james the second after the landing of the prince of orange and with the prince of orange himself before he called that conventionparliament which afterwards called him to the throne besides this general meeting it is usually looked upon to be the right of each     particular peer of the realm to demand an audience of the king and to lay before him with decency and respect such matters as he shall judge of importance to the public weal and therefore in the reign of edward ii it was made an article of impeachment in parliament against      the two hugh spencers father and son for which they were banished the kingdom that they by their evil covin would not suffer the great men of the realm the kings good counsellors to speak with the king or to come near him but only in the presence and hearing of the said hugh the father and hugh the son or one of them and at their will and according to such things as pleased themf   a third council belonging to the king are according to sir edward cokeg his judges of the courts of law for law matters and this appears frequently in our statutes particularly    edw iii c   and in other books of law so that when the kings council is mentioned generally it must be defined particularized and understood secundum subjectam materiam and if the subject be of a legal nature then by the kings council is understood his council for matters of law namely his judges therefore when by st    ric ii c   it was made a high offence to import into this kingdom any papal bulles or other processes from rome and it was enacted that the offenders should be attached by their bodies and brought before the king and his council to answer for such offence here by the expression of the kings council were understood the kings judges of his courts of justice the subject matter being legal this being the general way of interpreting the word councilh    but the principal council belonging to the king is his privy council which is generally called by way of eminence the council and this according to sir edward cokes description of iti is a noble honourable and reverend assembly of the king and such as he wills to be of his privy council in the kings court or palace the kings will is the sole constituent of a privy counsellor and this also regulates their number which of ancient time was twelve or thereabouts afterwards it increased to so large a number that it was found inconvenient for secrecy and dispatch and    0 therefore king charles the second      limited it to thirty whereof fifteen were to be the principal officers of state and those to be counsellors virtue officii and the other fifteen were composed of ten lords and five commoners of the kings choosingk but since that time the number has been much augmented and now continues indefinite  at the same time also the ancient office of lord president of the   0 council was revived in the person of anthony earl of shaftsbury an officer that by the statute of    hen viii c  0 has precedence next after the lord chancellor and lord treasurer  privy counsellors are made by the kings nomination without either patent or grant and on taking the necessary oaths they become immediately privy counsellors during the life of the king that chooses them but subject to removal at his discretion as to qualifications of members to sit at this board any naturalborn subject of england is capable of being a member of the privy council taking the proper oaths for security of the government and the test for security of the church  but in order to prevent any person under foreign attachments from insinuating themselves into this important trust as happened in the reign of king william in many instances it is enacted by the act of settlementl that no person born out of the dominions of the crown of england unless born of english parents even though naturalized by parliament shall be capable of being of the privy council the duty of a privy counsellor appears from the oath of officem which consists of seven articles—  to advise the king according to the best of his cunning and discretion   to advise for the kings honour and good of the public without partiality through affection love reward doubt or dread   to keep the kings council secret   to avoid corruption   to help and strengthen the execution of what      shall be there resolved   to withstand all persons who shall attempt the contrary and lastly in general   to observe keep and do all that a good and true counsellor ought to do to his sovereign lord     the power of the privy council is to inquire into all offences against the government and to commit the offenders to safe custody in order to take their trial in some of the courts of law but their jurisdiction herein is only to inquire and not to punish and the persons committed by them are entitled to their habeas corpus by statute    car i c  0 as much as if committed by an ordinary justice of the peace and by the same statute the court of starchamber and the court of requests both of which consisted of privy counsellors were dissolved and it was declared illegal for them to take cognizance of any matter of property belonging to the subjects of this kingdom but in plantation or admiralty causes which arise out of the jurisdiction of this kingdom and in matters of lunacy or idiocyn being a special flower of the prerogative with regard to these although they may eventually involve questions of extensive property the privy council continues to have cognizance being the court of appeal in such cases or rather the appeal lies to the kings majesty himself in council whenever also a question arises between two provinces in america or elsewhere as concerning the extent of their charters and the like the king in his council exercises original jurisdiction therein upon the principles of feodal sovereignty and so likewise when any person claims an island or a province in the nature of a feodal principality by grant from the king or his ancestors the determination of that right belongs to his majesty in council as was the case of the earl of derby with regard to the isle of man in the reign of queen elizabeth and the earl of cardigan and others as representatives of the duke of montague with relation to the island of st vincent in      but from all the dominions of the crown excepting great britain and ireland an appellate jurisdiction      in the last resort is vested in the same tribunal which usually exercises its judicial authority in a committee of the whole privy council who hear the allegations and proofs and make their report to his majesty in council by whom the judgment is finally given  the privileges of privy counsellors as such abstracted from their honorary precedenceo consist principally in the security which the law has given them against attempts and conspiracies to destroy their lives for by statute   hen vii c    if any of the kings servants of his household conspire or imagine to take away the life of a privy counsellor it is felony though nothing be done upon it the reason of making this statute sir edward cokep tells us was because such a conspiracy was just before this parliament made by some of king henry the sevenths household servants and great mischief was like to have ensued thereupon this extends only to the kings menial servants but the statute   anne c    goes further and enacts that any person that shall unlawfully attempt to kill or shall unlawfully assault and strike or wound any privy counsellor in the execution of his office shall be a felon without benefit of clergy this statute was made upon the daring attempt of the sieur guiscard who stabbed mr harley afterwards earl of oxford with a penknife when under examination for high crimes in a committee of the privy council the dissolution of the privy council depends upon the kings pleasure and he     may whenever he thinks proper discharge any particular member or the whole of it and appoint another by the common law also it was dissolved ipso facto by the kings demise as deriving all its authority from him but now to prevent the inconveniences of having no council in being at the accession of a new prince it is enacted by statute   anne c   that the privy council shall continue for six months after the demise of the crown unless sooner determined by the successor chapter vi of the kings duties i proceed next to the duties incumbent on the king by our constitution in consideration of which duties his dignity and prerogative are established by the laws of the land it being a maxim in the law that protection and subjection are reciprocala and these reciprocal duties are what i apprehend were meant by the convention in      when they declared that king james had broken the original contract between king and people but however as the terms of that original contract were in some measure disputed being alleged to exist principally in theory and to be only deducible by reason and the rules of natural law in which deduction different understandings might very considerably differ it was after the revolution judged proper to declare these duties expressly and to reduce that contract to a plain certainty so that whatever doubts might be formerly raised by weak and scrupulous minds about the existence of such an original contract they must now entirely cease especially with regard to every prince who hath reigned since the year       the principal duty of the king is to govern his people according to law nec regibus infinita aut libera potestas was the constitution of our german ancestors on the continentb and this is not only consonant to the principles of nature of      liberty of reason and of society but has always been esteemed an express part of the common law of england even when prerogative was at the highest the king saith bractonc who wrote under henry iii ought not to be subject to man but to god and to the law for     the law maketh the king let the king therefore render to the law what the law has invested in him with regard to others dominion and power for he is not truly king where will and pleasure rules and not the law and againd the king also hath a superior namely god and also the law by which he was made a king  thus bracton and fortescue alsoe having first well distinguished between a monarchy absolutely and despotically regal which is introduced by conquest and violence and a political or civil monarchy which arises from mutual consent of which last species he asserts the government of england to be immediately lays it down as a principle that the king of england must rule his people according to the decrees of the laws thereof insomuch that he is bound by an oath at his coronation to the observance and keeping of his own laws but to obviate all doubts and difficulties concerning this matter it is expressly declared by statute        w iii c   that the laws of england are the birthright of the people thereof and all the kings and queens who shall ascend the throne of this realm ought to administer the government of the same according to the said laws and all their officers and ministers ought to serve them respectively according to the same and therefore all the laws and statutes of this realm for securing the established religion and the rights and liberties of the people thereof and all other laws and statutes of the same now in force are ratified and confirmed accordingly and as to the terms of the original contract between king and people these i apprehend to be now couched in the      coronation oath which by the statute   w and m st   c   is to be administered to every king and queen who shall succeed to the imperial crown of these realms by one of the archbishops or bishops of the realm in the presence of all the people who on their parts do reciprocally take the oath of allegiance to the crown this coronation oath is conceived in the following terms— the archbishop or bishop shall say—will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of england and the dominions thereto belonging according to the statutes in parliament agreed on and the laws and customs of the same the king or queen shall say—i solemnly promise so to do archbishop or bishop—will you to your power cause law and justice in mercy to be executed in all your judgments king or queen—i will archbishop or bishop—will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of god the true profession of the gospel and the protestant reformed religion established by the law and will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm and the churches committed to their charge all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them or any of them king or queen—all this i promise to do after this the king or queen laying his or her hand upon the holy gospels shall say—the things which i have here before promised i will perform and keep so help me god and then shall kiss the book  this is the form of the coronation oath as it is now prescribed by our laws the principal articles of which appear to be at least as ancient as the mirror of justicesf and even as the time of bractong but the wording of it was changed at the revolution because as the statute alleges the oath itself      had been framed in doubtful words and expressions with relation to     ancient laws and constitutions at this time unknownh however in what form soever it be conceived this is most indisputably a fundamental and original express contract though doubtless the duty of protection is impliedly as much incumbent on the sovereign before coronation as after in the same manner as allegiance to the king becomes the duty of the subject immediately on the descent of the crown before he has taken the oath of allegiance or whether he ever takes it at all this reciprocal duty of the subject will be considered in its proper place at present we are only to observe that in the kings part of this original contract are expressed all the duties that a monarch can owe to his people viz to govern according to law to execute judgment in mercy and to maintain the established religion and with respect to the latter of these three branches we may further remark that by the act of union   anne c   two preceding statutes are recited and confirmed the one of the parliament of scotland the other of the parliament of england which enact—the former that every king at his accession shall take and subscribe an oath to preserve the protestant religion and presbyterian church government in scotland the latter that at his coronation he shall take and subscribe a similar oath to preserve the settlement of the church of england within england ireland walos and berwick and the territories thereunto belonging chapter vii of the kings prerogative it was observed in a former chaptera that one of the principal bulwarks of civil liberty or in other words of the british constitution was the limitation of the kings prerogative by bounds so certain and notorious that it is impossible he should ever exceed them without the consent of the people on the one hand or without on the other a violation of that original contract which in all states impliedly and in ours most expressly subsists between the prince and the subject it will now be our business to consider this prerogative minutely to demonstrate its necessity in general and to mark out in the most important instances its particular extent and restrictions from which considerations this conclusion will evidently follow that the powers which are vested in the crown by the laws of england are necessary for the support of society and do not intrench any further on our natural liberties than is expedient for the maintenance of our civil      there cannot be a stronger proof of that genuine freedom which is the boast of this age and country than the power of discussing and examining with decency and respect the limits of the kings prerogative a topic that in some former ages was thought too delicate and sacred to be profaned by the pen of a subject it was ranked among the arcana imperii and like the mysteries of the bona dea was      not suffered to be pried into by any but such as were initiated in its service because perhaps the exertion of the one like the solemnities of the other would not bear the inspection of a rational and sober inquiry the glorious queen elizabeth herself made no scruple to direct her parliaments to abstain from discoursing of matters of stateb and it was the constant language of this favourite princess and her ministers that even that august assembly ought not to deal to judge or to meddle with her majestys prerogative royalc and her successor king james the first who had imbibed high notions of the divinity of regal sway more than once laid it down in his speeches that as it is atheism and blasphemy in a creature to dispute what the deity may do so it is presumption and sedition in a subject to dispute what a king may do in the height of his power good christians he adds will be content with gods will revealed in his word and good subjects will rest in the kings will revealed in his lawd but whatever might be the sentiments of some of our princes this was never the language of our ancient constitution and laws the limitation of the regal authority was a first and essential principle in all the gothic systems of government established in europe though gradually driven out and overborne by violence and chicane in most of the kingdoms on the continent we have seen     in the preceding chapter the sentiments of bracton and fortescue at the distance of two centuries from each other and sir henry finch under charles the first after the lapse of two centuries more though he lays down the law of prerogative in very strong and emphatical terms yet qualifies it with a general restriction in regard to the liberties of the people the king hath a prerogative in all things that are not injurious to the subject for in them all it must be remembered that the kings prerogative stretcheth not to the doing of any wronge nihil enim aliud potest rex nisi id solum quod      de jure potestf and here it may be some satisfaction to remark how widely the civil law differs from our own with regard to the authority of the laws over the prince or as a civilian would rather have expressed it the authority of the prince over the laws it is a maxim of the english law as we have seen from bracton that rex debet esse sub lege quia lex facit regem the imperial law will tell us that in omnibus imperatoris excipitur fortuna cui ipsas leges deus subjecitg we shall not long hesitate to which of them to give the preference as most conducive to those ends for which societies were framed and are kept together especially as the roman lawyers themselves seem to be sensible of the unreasonableness of their own constitution decet tamen principem says paulus servare leges quibus ipse solutus esth this is at once laying down the principle of despotic power and at the same time acknowledging its absurdity by the word prerogative we usually understand that special preeminence which the king hath over and above all other persons and out of the ordinary course of the common law in right of his regal dignity it signifies in its etymology from præ and rogo something that is required or demanded before or in preference to all others and hence it follows that it must be in its nature singular and eccentrical that it can only be applied to those rights and capacities which the king enjoys alone in contradistinction to others and not to those which he enjoys in common with any of his subjects for if once any one prerogative of the crown could be held in common with the subject it would cease to be prerogative any longer and therefore finchi lays it down as a maxim that the prerogative is that law in case of the king which is law in no case of the subject prerogatives are either direct or incidental the direct are such positive substantial parts of the royal character and    0 authority as are rooted in and spring from the kings political person considered merely by itself without reference to any other extrinsic circumstance as the right of sending ambassadors of creating peers and of making war or peace but such prerogatives as are incidental bear always a relation to something else distinct from the kings person and are indeed only exceptions in favour of the crown to those general rules that are established for the rest of the community such as that no costs shall be recovered against the king that the king can never be a jointtenant and that his debt shall be preferred before a debt to any of his subjects these and an infinite number of other instances will better be understood when we come regularly to consider the rules themselves to which these incidental prerogatives are exceptions and therefore we will at present only dwell upon the kings substantive or direct prerogatives these substantive or direct prerogatives may again be divided into three kinds being such as regard first the kings royal character secondly his royal authority and lastly his royal income these are necessary to secure reverence to his person obedience to his commands and an affluent supply for the ordinary expenses of government without all of which it is impossible to maintain the executive power in due independence and vigour yet in every branch of this large and extensive dominion our free constitution has interposed such seasonable checks and restrictions as may curb it from trampling on those liberties which it was meant to secure and establish the enormous weight of   0 prerogative if left to itself as in arbitrary governments it is spreads havoc and destruction among all the inferior movements but when balanced and regulated as with us by its proper counterpoise timely and judiciously applied its operations are then equable and certain it invigorates the whole machine and enables every part to answer the end of its construction in the present chapter we shall only consider the two first of these divisions which relate to the kings political      character and authority or in other words his dignity and regal power to which last the name of prerogative is frequently narrowed and confined the other division which forms the royal revenue will require a distinct examination according to the known distribution of the feodal writers who distinguish the royal prerogatives into the majora and minora regalia in the latter of which classes the rights of the revenue are ranked for to use their own words majora regalia imperii præeminentiam spectant minora vero ab commodum pecuniarum immediate attinent et hæc proprie fiscalia sunt et ad jus fisci pertinentk first then of the royal dignity under every monarchical establishment it is necessary to distinguish the prince from his subjects not only by the outward pomp and decorations of majesty but also by ascribing to him certain qualities as inherent in his royal capacity distinct from and superior to those of any other individual in the nation for though a philosophical mind will consider the royal person merely as one man appointed by mutual consent to presido over many others and will pay him that reverence and duty which the principles of society demand yet the mass of mankind will be apt to grow insolent and refractory if taught to consider their prince as a man of no greater perfection than themselves the law therefore ascribes to the king in his high political character not only large powers and emoluments which form his prerogative and revenue but likewise certain attributes of a great and transcendent nature by which the people are led to consider him in the light of a superior being and to pay him that awful respect which may enable him with greater ease to carry on the business of government this is what i understand by the royal dignity the several branches of which we will now proceed to examine i and first the law ascribes to the king the attribute of sovereignty or preeminence rex est vicarius says bractonl et minister dei in terra omnis quidem sub eo est et ipse      sub nullo nisi tantum sub deo  he is said to have imperial dignity and in charters before the conquest is frequently styled basileus and imperator the titles respectively assumed by the emperors of the east and westm his realm is declared to be an empire and his crown imperial by many acts of parliament particularly the statutes    hen viii c    and    hen viii c   n which at the same time declare the king to be the supreme head of the realm in matters both civil and ecclesiastical and of consequence inferior to no man upon earth dependent on no man accountable to no man formerly there prevailed a ridiculous notion propagated by the german and italian civilians that an emperor could do many things which a king could not as the creation of notaries and the like and that all kings were in some degree subordinate and subject to the emperor of germany or rome the     meaning therefore of the legislature when it uses these terms of empire and imperial and applies them to the realm and crown of england is only to assert that our king is equally sovereign and independent within these his dominions as any emperor is in his empireo and owes no kind of subjection to any other potentate upon earth hence it is that no suit or action can be brought against the king even in civil matters because no court can have jurisdiction over him for all jurisdiction implies superiority of power authority to try would be vain and idle without an authority to redress and the sentence of a court would be contemptible unless that court had power to command the execution of it but who says finchp shall command the king hence it is likewise that by law the person of the king is sacred even though the measures pursued in his reign be completely tyrannical and arbitrary for no jurisdiction upon earth has power to try him in a criminal way much less to condemn him to punishment if any foreign jurisdiction had this power as was formerly claimed by the pope the independence of the kingdom would be no more and if such a power were vested in any domestic      tribunal there would soon be an end of the constitution by destroying the free agency of one of the constituent parts of the sovereign legislative power  are then it may be asked the subjects of england totally destitute of remedy in case the crown should invade their rights either by private injuries or public oppressions to this we may answer that the law has provided a remedy in both cases and first as to private injuries if any person has in point of property a just demand upon the king he must petition him in his court of chancery where his chancellor will administer right as a matter of grace though not upon compulsionq  and this is entirely consonant to what is laid down by the writers on natural law a subject says puffendorfr so long as he continues a subject hath no way to oblige his prince to give him his due when he refuses it though no wise prince will ever refuse to stand to a lawful contract and if the prince gives the subject leave to enter an action against him upon such contract in his own courts the action itself proceeds rather upon natural equity than upon the municipal laws for the end of such action is not to compel the prince to observe the contract but to persuade him and as to personal wrongs it is well observed by mr lockes the harm which the sovereign can do in his own person not being likely to happen often nor to extend itself far nor being able by his single strength to subvert the laws nor oppress the body of the people should any prince have so much weakness and ill nature as to endeavour to do it the inconveniency therefore of some particular mischiefs that may happen sometimes when a heady prince comes to the throne are well recompensed by the peace of the public and security of the government     in the person of the chief magistrate being thus set out of the reach of danger      next as to cases of ordinary public oppression where the vitals of the constitution are not attacked the law hath also assigned a remedy for as the king cannot misuse his power without the advice of evil counsellors and the assistance of wicked ministers these men may be examined and punished the constitution has therefore provided by means of indictments and parliamentary impeachments that no man shall dare to assist the crown in contradiction to the laws of the land but it is at the same time a maxim in those laws that the king himself can do no wrong since it would be a great weakness and absurdity in any system of positive law to define any possible wrong without any possible redress for as to such public oppressions as tend to dissolve the constitution and subvert the fundamentals of government they are cases which the law will not out of decency suppose being incapable of distrusting those whom it has invested with any part of the supreme power since such distrust would render the exercise of that power precarious and impracticablet for wherever the law expresses its distrust of abuse of power it always vests a superior coercive authority in some other hand to correct it the very notion of which destroys the idea of sovereignty if therefore for example the two houses of parliament or either of them had avowedly a right to animadvert on the king or each other or if the king had a right to animadvert on either of the houses that branch of the legislature so subject to animadversion would cease to be part of the supreme power the balance of the constitution would be overturned and that branch or branches in which this jurisdiction resided would be completely sovereign the supposition of law therefore is that neither the king nor either house of parliament collectively taken is capable of doing any wrong since in such cases the law feels itself incapable of furnishing any adequate      remedy for which reason all oppression which may happen to spring from any branch of the sovereign power must necessarily be out of the reach of any stated rule or express legal provision but if ever they unfortunately happen the prudence of the times must provide new remedies upon new emergencies indeed it is found by experience that whenever the unconstitutional oppressions even of the sovereign power advance with gigantic strides and threaten desolation to a state mankind will not be reasoned out of the feelings of humanity nor will sacrifice their liberty by a scrupulous adherence to those political maxims which were originally established to preserve it and therefore though the positive laws are silent experience will furnish us with a very remarkable case wherein nature and reason prevailed when king james the second invaded the fundamental constitution of the realm the convention declared an abdication whereby the throne was rendered vacant which induced a new settlement of the crown and so far as the precedent leads and no further we may now be allowed to lay down the law of redress against public oppression if therefore any future prince should endeavour to subvert the constitution by breaking the original contract between king and people should violate the fundamental laws and should withdraw himself out of the kingdom we are now authorized to declare that this conjunction of circumstances would amount to an abdication and the throne would be thereby vacant but it is not for us to say that any one or two of these ingredients would amount to such a situation for there our precedent would fail us in these therefore or other circumstances which a fertile imagination may furnish since both law and history are silent it becomes us to be silent too leaving to future generations whenever necessity and the safety of the whole shall require it the exertion of those inherent though latent powers of society which no climate no time no constitution no contract can ever destroy or diminish      ii besides the attribute of sovereignty the law also ascribes to the king in his political capacity absolute perfection the king can do     no wrong which ancient and fundamental maxim is not to be understood as if every thing transacted by the government was of course just and lawful but means only two things first that whatever is exceptionable in the conduct of public affairs is not to be imputed to the king nor is he answerable for it personally to his people for this doctrine would totally destroy that constitutional independence of the crown which is necessary for the balance of power in our free and active and therefore compounded constitution and secondly it means that the prerogative of the crown extends not to any injury it is created for the benefit of the people and therefore cannot be exerted to their prejudiceu  the king moreover is not only incapable of doing wrong but even of thinking wrong he can never mean to do an improper thing in him is no folly or weakness and therefore if the crown should be induced to grant any franchise or privilege to a subject contrary to reason or in any wise prejudicial to the commonwealth or a private person the law will not suppose the king to have meant either an unwise or an injurious action but declares that the king was deceived in his grant and thereupon such grant is rendered void merely upon the foundation of fraud and deception either by or upon those agents whom the crown has thought proper to employ for the law will not cast an imputation on that magistrate whom it intrusts with the executive power as if he was capable of intentionally disregarding his trust but attributes to mere imposition to which the most perfect of sublunary beings must still continue liable those little inadvertencies which if charged on the will of the prince might lessen him in the eyes of his subjects      yet still notwithstanding this personal perfection which the law attributes to the sovereign the sovereign the constitution has allowed a latitude of supposing the contrary in respect to both houses of parliament each of which in its turn hath exerted the right of remonstrating and complaining to the king even of those acts of royalty which are most properly and personally his own such as messages signed by himself and speeches delivered from the throne and yet such is the reverence which is paid to the royal person that though the two houses have an undoubted right to consider these acts of state in any light whatever and accordingly treat them in their addresses as personally proceeding from the prince yet among themselves to preserve the more perfect decency and for the greater freedom of debate they usually suppose them to flow from the advice of the administration but the privilege of canvassing thus freely the personal acts of the sovereign either directly or even through the medium of his reputed advisers belongs to no individual but is consigned to those august assemblies and there too the objections must be proposed with the utmost respect and deference one member was sent to the towerv for suggesting that his majestys answer to the address of the commons contained high words to fright the members out of their duty and anotherw for saying that a part of the kings speech seemed rather to be calculated for the meridian of germany than great britain and that the king was a stranger to our language and constitution in further pursuance of this principle the law also determines that in the king can be no negligence or laches and therefore no delay will bar his right nullum tempus occurrit regi has been the standing maxim upon all occasions for the law intends that the king is always busied for the public good and     therefore has not leisure to assert his right within the times limited to subjectsy  in the king also can be no stain or corruption of      blood for if the heir to the crown were attained of treason or felony and afterwards the crown should descend to him this would purge the attainder ipso factoz and therefore when henry vii who as earl of richmond stood attained came to the crown it was not thought necessary to pass an act of parliament to reverse this attainder because as lord bacon in his history of that prince informs us it was agreed that the assumption of the crown had at once purged all attainders neither can the king in judgment of law as king ever be a minor or under age and therefore his royal grants and assents to acts of parliament are good though he has not in his natural capacity attained the legal age of twentyonea by a statute indeed    hen viii c    power was given to future kings to rescind and revoke all acts of parliament that should be made while they were under the age of twentyfour but this was repealed by the statute   edw vi c    so far as related to that prince and both statutes are declared to be determined by    geo ii c    it hath also been usually thought prudent when the heirapparent hath been very young to appoint a protector guardian or regent for a limited time but the very necessity of such extraordinary provision is sufficient to demonstrate the truth of that maxim of the common law that in the king is no minority and therefore he hath no legal guardianb           iii a third attribute of the kings majesty is his perpetuity the law ascribes to him in his political capacity an absolute immortality the king never dies henry edward or george may die but the king survives them all for immediately upon the decease of the reigning prince in his natural capacity his kingship or imperial dignity by act of law without any interregnum or interval is vested at once in his heir who is eo instanti king to all intents and purposes and so tender is the law of supposing even a possibility of his death that his natural dissolution is generally called his demise demissio regis vel coronæ an expression which signifies merely a transfer of property for as is observed in plowdenc when we say the demise of the crown we mean only that in consequence of the disunion of the kings natural body from his body politic the kingdom is transferred or demised to his successor and so the royal dignity remains perpetual thus too when edward the fourth in the tenth year of his reign was driven from his throne for a few months by the house of lancaster this temporary transfer of his dignity was denominated his demise and all process was held to be discontinued as upon a natural death of the kingd     0 we are next to consider those branches of the royal prerogative which invest this our sovereign lord thus allperfect and immortal in his kingly capacity with a number of authorities and powers in the exertion whereof consists the executive part of government this is wisely placed in a single hand by the british constitution for the sake of unanimity strength and despatch were it placed in many hands it would be subject to many wills many wills if disunited and drawing different ways create weakness in a government and to unite those several wills and reduce them to one is a work of more time and delay than the exigencies of state will afford the king of england is therefore not only the chief but properly the sole magistrate   0 of the nation all others acting by commission from and in due subordination to him in like manner as upon the great revolution in the roman state all the powers of the ancient magistracy of the commonwealth were concentrated in the new emperor so that as gravinae expresses it in ejus unius versona veteris reipublicæ vis atque majestas per cumulatas magistratuum potestates exprimebatur after what has been premised in this chapter i shall not i trust be considered as an advocate for arbitrary power when i lay it down as a principle that in the exertion of lawful prerogative the king is and ought to be absolute that is so far absolute that there is no legal authority that can either delay or resist him he may reject what bills may make what treaties may coin what money may create what peers may pardon what offences he pleases unless where the constitution hath expressly or by evident consequence laid down some exception or boundary declaring that thus far the prerogative shall go and no further for otherwise the power of the crown would indeed be but a name and a shadow insufficient for the ends of government if where its jurisdiction is clearly established and allowed any man or body of men were permitted to disobey it in the ordinary course of law i say in the ordinary course of law for i do not      now speak of those extraordinary recourses to first principles which are necessary when the contracts of society are in danger of dissolution and the law proves too weak a defence against the violence of fraud or oppression and yet the want of attending to this obvious distinction has occasioned these doctrines of absolute power in the prince and of national resistance by the people to be much misunderstood and perverted by the advocates of slavery on the one hand and the demagogues of faction on the other the former observing the absolute sovereignty and transcendent dominion of the crown laid down as it certainly is most strongly and emphatically in our lawbooks as well as our homilies have denied that any case can be excepted from so general and positive a rule forgetting how impossible it is in any practical system of laws to point out beforehand those eccentrical remedies which the sudden emergence of national distress may dictate and which that alone can justify on the other hand overzealous republicans feeling the absurdity of unlimited passive obedience have fancifully or sometimes factiously gone over to the other extreme and because resistance is justifiable to the person of the prince when the being of the state is endangered and the public voice proclaims such resistance necessary they have therefore allowed to every individual the right of determining this expedience and of employing private force to resist even private oppression a doctrine productive of anarchy and in consequence equally fatal to civil liberty as tyranny itself for civil liberty rightly understood consists in protecting the rights of individuals by the united force of society society cannot be maintained and of course can exert no protection without obedience to some sovereign power and obedience is an empty name if every individual has a right to decide how far he himself shall obey in the exertion therefore of those prerogatives which the law has given the king is irresistible and absolute according to the forms of the constitution and yet if the consequence of that exertion be manifestly to the grievance or dishonour of the kingdom the parliament will call his advisers      to a just and severe account for prerogative consisting as mr lockef has well defined it in the discretionary power of acting for the public good where the positive laws are silent if that discretionary power be abused to the public detriment such prerogative is exerted in an unconstitutional manner thus the king may make a treaty with a foreign state which shall irrevocably bind the nation and yet when such treaties have been judged pernicious impeachments have pursued those ministers by whose agency or advice they were concluded the prerogatives of the crown in the sense under which we are now considering     them respect either this nations intercourse with foreign nations or its own domestic government and civil polity with regard to foreign concerns the king is the delegate or representative of his people it is impossible that the individuals of a state in their collective capacity can transact the affairs of that state with another community equally numerous as themselves unanimity must be wanting to their measures and strength to the execution of their counsels in the king therefore as in a centre all the rays of his people are united and form by that union a consistency splendour and power that make him feared and respected by foreign potentates who would scruple to enter into any engagement that must afterwards be revised and ratified by a popular assembly what is done by the royal authority with regard to foreign powers is the act of the whole nation what is done without the kings concurrence is the act only of private men and so far is this point carried by our law that it hath been heldg that should all the subjects of england make war with a king in league with the king of england without the royal assent such war is no breach of the league and by the statute   hen v c   any subject committing acts of hostility upon any nation in league with the king was declared to be guilty of high treason and though that act was repealed by the statute  0 hen vi c    so far as      relates to the making this offence high treason yet still it remains a very great offence against the law of nations and punishable by our laws either capitally or otherwise according to the circumstances of the case i the king therefore considered as the representative of his people has the sole power of sending ambassadors to foreign states and receiving ambassadors at home this may lead us into a short digression by way of inquiry how far the municipal laws of england intermeddle with or protect the rights of these messengers from one potentate to another whom we call ambassadors the rights the powers the duties and the privileges of ambassadors are determined by the law of nature and nations and not by any municipal constitutions for as they represent the persons of their respective masters who owe no subjection to any laws but those of their own country their actions are not subject to the control of the private law of that state wherein they are appointed to reside he that is subject to the coercion of laws is necessarily dependent on that power by whom those laws were made but an ambassador ought to be independent of every power except that by which he is sent and of consequence ought not to be subject to the mere municipal laws of that nation wherein he is to exercise his functions if he grossly offends or makes an ill use of his character he may be sent home and accused before his masterh who is bound either to do justice upon him or avow himself the accomplice of his crimesi but there is great dispute among the writers on the laws of nations whether this exemption of ambassadors extends to all crimes as well natural as positive or whether it only extends to such as are mala prohibita as coining and not to those that are mala in se as murderk our law seems to have formerly taken in the restriction as well as the general exemption      for it has been held both by our common lawyers and civiliansl that an ambassador is privileged by the law of nature and nations and yet if he commits any offence against the law of reason and nature he shall lose his privilegem and that therefore if an ambassador conspires the death of the king in whose land he is he may be condemned and executed for treason but if he commits any other species of treason it is otherwise and he must be sent to his own kingdomn and these positions seem to be built upon good appearance of reason for since as we have formerly shown all municipal laws act in subordination to the primary law of nature and where they annex a punishment to natural crimes are only declaratory of and auxiliary to that law therefore to this     natural universal rule of justice ambassadors as well as other men are subject in all countries and of consequence it is reasonable that wherever they transgress it there they shall be liable to make atonemento but however these principles might formerly obtain the general practice of this country as well as of the rest of europe seems now to pursue the sentiments of the learned grotius that the security of ambassadors is of more importance than the punishment of a particular crimep and therefore few if any examples have happened within a century past where an ambassador has been punished for any offence however atrocious in its nature  in respect to civil suits all the foreign jurists agree that neither an ambassador or any of his train or comites can be prosecuted for any debt or contract in the courts of that kingdom wherein he is sent to reside yet sir edward coke maintains that if an ambassador make a contract which is good jure gentium he shall answer for it hereq but the truth is so few cases if any had arisen wherein the privilege was either claimed or disputed even with regard to civil suits that our lawbooks are in general quite silent upon it previous to the      reign of queen anne when an ambassador from peter the great czar of muscovy was actually arrested and taken out of his coach in londonr for a debt of fifty pounds which he had there contracted instead of applying to be discharged upon his privilege he gave bail to the action and the next day complained to the queen the persons who were concerned in the arrest were examined before the privy council of which the lord chief justice holt was at the same time sworn a members and seventeen were committed to prisont most of whom were prosecuted by information in the court of queens bench at the suit of the attorney generalu and at their trial before the lord chief justice were convicted of the facts by the juryv reserving the question of law how far those facts were criminal to be     afterwards argued before the judges which question was never determined 0 in the mean time the czar resented this affront very highly and demanded that the sheriff of middlesex and all others concerned in the arrest should be punished with instant deathw but the queen to the amazement of that despotic court directed her secretary to inform him that she could inflict no punishment upon any the meanest of her subjects unless warranted by the law of the land and therefore was persuaded that he would not insist upon impossibilitiesx to satisfy however the clamours of the foreign ministers who made it a common cause as well as to appease the wrath of peter a bill was brought into parliamenty and afterwards passed into a lawz to prevent and punish such outrageous insolence for the future and with a copy of this act elegantly engrossed and illuminated accompanied by a letter from the queen an ambassador extraordinarya was commissioned to appear at moscowb who declared that though her majesty could not inflict such a punishment as was required      because of the defect in that particular of the former established constitutions of her kingdom yet with the unanimous consent of the parliament she had caused a new act to be passed to serve as a law for the future this humiliating step was accepted as a full satisfaction by the czar and the offenders at his request were discharged from all further prosecution this statutec recites the arrest which had been made in contempt of the protection granted by her majesty contrary to the law of nations and in prejudice of the rights and privileges which ambassadors and other public ministers have at all times been thereby possessed of and ought to be kept sacred and inviolable wherefore it enacts that for the future all process whereby the person of any ambassador or of his domestic or domestic servant may be arrested or his goods distrained or seised shall be utterly null and void and the persons prosecuting soliciting or executing such process shall be deemed violators of the law of nations and disturbers of the public repose and shall suffer such penalties and corporal punishment as the lord chancellor and the two chief justices or any two of them shall think fit but it is expressly provided that no trader within the description of the bankrupt laws who shall be in the service of any ambassador shall be privileged or protected by this act nor shall any one be punished for arresting an ambassadors servant unless his name be registered with the secretary of state and by him transmitted to the sheriffs of london and middlesex exceptions that are strictly conformable to the rights of ambassadorsd as observed in the most civilized countries and in consequence of this statute thus declaring and enforcing the law of nations these privileges are      now held to be part of the law of the land and are constantly allowed in the courts of common lawe       ii it is also the kings prerogative to make treaties leagues and alliances with foreign states and princes for it is by the law of nations essential to the goodness of a league that it be made by the sovereign powerf and then it is binding upon the whole community and in england the sovereign power     quoad hoc is vested in the person of the king whatever contracts therefore he engages in no other power in the kingdom can legally delay resist or annul and yet lest this plenitude of authority should be abused to the detriment of the public the constitution as was hinted before hath here interposed a check by the means of parliamentary impeachment for the punishment     of such ministers as from criminal motives advise or conclude any treaty which shall afterwards be judged to derogate from the honour and interest of the nation iii upon the same principle the king has also the sole prerogative of making war and peace   for it is held by all the writers on the law of nature and nations that the right of making war which by nature subsisted in every individual is given up by all private persons that enter into society and is vested in the sovereign powerg and this right is given up not only by individuals but even by the entire body of people that are under the dominion of a sovereign it would indeed be extremely improper that any number of subjects should have the power of binding the supreme magistrate and putting him against his will in a state of war whatever hostilities therefore may be committed by private citizens the state ought not to be affected thereby unless that should justify their proceedings and thereby become partner in the guilt such unauthorized volunteers in violence are not ranked among open enemies but are treated like pirates and robbers according to that rule of the civil lawh hostes hi sunt qui nobis aut quibus nos publice bellum decrevimus cæteri latrones aut      prædones sunt and the reason which is given by grotiusi why according to the law of nations a denunciation of war ought always to precede the actual commencement of hostilities is not so much that the enemy may be put upon his guard which is matter rather of magnanimity than right but that it may be certainly clear that the war is not undertaken by private persons but by the will of the whole community whose right of willing is in this case transferred to the supreme magistrate by the fundamental laws of society so that in order to make a war completely effectual it is necessary with us in england that it be publicly declared and duly proclaimed by the kings authority and then all parts of both the contending nations from the highest to the lowest are bound by it and wherever the right resides of beginning a national war there also must reside the right of ending it or the power of making peace and the same check of parliamentary impeachment for improper or inglorious conduct in beginning conducting or concluding a national war is in general sufficient to restrain the ministers of the crown from a wanton or injurious exertion of this great prerogative iv but as the delay of making war may sometimes be detrimental to individuals who have suffered by depredations from foreign potentates our laws have in some respects armed the subject with powers to impel the prerogative by directing the ministers of the crown to issue letters of marque and reprisal upon due demand the prerogative of granting which is nearly related to and plainly derived from that other of making war this being indeed only an incomplete state of hostilities and generally ending in a formal declaration of war these letters are grantable by the law of nationsk whenever the subjects of one state are oppressed and injured by those of another and justice is denied by that state to which the oppressor belongs in this case letters of marque and reprisal words used as synonymous and signifying the latter a taking in return the former the passing the frontiers in order to such takingl may be obtained in order to seize the bodies or goods of the subjects of the offending state until satisfaction      be made wherever they happen to be found and indeed this custom of reprisals seems dictated by nature herself     for which reason we find in the most ancient times very notable instances of itm but here the necessity is obvious of calling in the sovereign power to determine when reprisals may be made else every private sufferer would be a judge in his own cause in pursuance of which principle it is with us declared by the statute   hen v c   that if any subjects of the realm are oppressed in the time of truce by any foreigners the king will grant marque in due form to all that feel themselves grieved which form is thus directed to be observed the sufferer must first apply to the lord privyseal and he shall make out letters of request under the privyseal and if after such request of satisfaction be made the party required do not within convenient time make due satisfaction or restitution to the party grieved the lord chancellor shall make him out letters of marque under the great seal and by virtue of these he may attack and seize the property of the aggressor nation without hazard of being condemned as a robber or pirate       v upon exactly the same reason stands the prerogative of granting safeconducts without which by the law of nations no member of one society has a right to intrude into another   and therefore puffendorf very justly resolvesn that it is left in the power of all states to take such measures about the admission of strangers as they think convenient those being ever excepted who are driven on the coast by necessity or by any cause that deserves pity or compassion great tenderness is shown by our laws not only to foreigners in distress as will appear when we come to speak of shipwrecks but with regard also to the admission of strangers who come spontaneously for so long as their nation continues at peace with ours and they themselves behave peaceably they are under    0 the kings protection though liable to be sent home whenever the king sees occasion but no subject of a nation at war with us can by the law of nations come into the realm nor can travel himself upon the high seas or send his goods or merchandise from one place to another without danger of being seized by our subjects unless he has letters of safeconduct which by divers ancient statuteso must be granted under the kings great seal and enrolled in chancery or else are of no effect the king being supposed the best judge of such emergencies as may deserve exception from the general law of arms but passports under the kings signmanual or licenses from his ambassadors abroad are now more usually obtained and are allowed to be of equal validity   indeed the law of england as a commercial country pays a very particular regard to foreign merchants in innumerable instances one i cannot omit to mention that by magna cartap it is provided that all merchants unless publicly prohibited beforehand shall have safeconduct to depart from to come into to tarry in and to go through england for the exercise of merchandise without any unreasonable imposts except in time of war and if a war breaks out between us and their country they shall be attached if in england without harm of body or goods till the king or his chief justiciary be informed how our merchants are treated in the land with which we are at war and if ours be secure in that land they shall be secure in ours this seems to have been a common rule of equity among all the northern nations for we learn from stiernhookq that it was a maxim among the goths and swedes quam legem exteri nobis posuere eandem illis ponemus but it is somewhat extraordinary that it should have found a place in magna carta a mere interior treaty between the   0 king and his naturalborn subjects which occasions the learned montesquieu to remark with a degree of admiration that the english have made      the protection of foreign merchants one of the articles of their national libertyr but indeed it well justifies another observation which he has mades that the english know better than any other people upon earth how to value at the same time these three great advantages religion liberty and commerce very different from the genius of the roman people who in their manners their constitution and even in their laws treated commerce as a dishonourable employment and prohibited the exercise thereof to persons of birth or rank or fortunet and equally different from the bigotry of the canonists who looked on trade as inconsistent with christianityu and determined at the council of melfi under pope urban ii ad  0 0 that it was impossible with a safe conscience to exercise any traffic or follow the profession of the laww these are the principal prerogatives of the king respecting this nations intercourse with foreign nations in all of which he is considered as the delegate or representative of his people but in domestic affairs he is considered in a great variety of characters and from thence there arises an abundant number of other prerogatives i first he is a constituent part of the supreme legislative power and as such has the prerogative of rejecting such provisions in parliament as he judges improper to be passed the expediency of which constitution has before been evinced at largex i shall only further remark that the king is not bound by any act of parliament unless he be named therein by special and particular words the most general words that can be devised any person or persons bodies politic or corporate c affect not him in the least if      they may tend to restrain or diminish any of his rights or interestsy for it would be of most mischievous consequence to the public if the strength of the executive power were liable to be curtailed without its own express consent by constructions and implications of the subject yet where an act of parliament is expressly made for the preservation of public rights and the suppression of public wrongs and does not interfere with the established rights of the crown it is said to be binding as well upon the king as upon the subjectz and likewise the king may take the benefit of any particular act though he be not nameda ii the king is considered in the next place as the generalissimo or the first in military command within the kingdom the great end of society is to protect the weakness of individuals by the united strength of the community and the principal use of government is to direct that united strength in the best and most effectual manner to answer the end proposed monarchical government is allowed to be the fittest of any for this purpose it follows therefore from the very end of its institution that in a monarchy the military power must be trusted in the hands of the prince in this capacity therefore of general of the kingdom the king has the sole power of raising and regulating fleets and armies of the manner in which they are raised and regulated i shall speak more when i come to consider the military state we are now only to consider the prerogative of enlisting and of governing them which indeed was disputed and claimed contrary to all reason and precedent by the long parliament of king charles i but upon the restoration of his son was solemnly declared by the statute    car ii c   to be in the king alone for that the sole supreme government and command of the militia within all his majestys realms and dominions and of all forces by sea and land and of all forts and places of strength ever was and is the          undoubted right of his majesty and his royal predecessors kings and queons of england and that both or either house of parliament cannot nor ought to pretend to the same   this statute it is obvious to observe extends not only to fleets and armies but also to forts and other places of strength within the realm the sole prerogative as well of erecting as manning and governing of which belongs to the king in his capacity of general of the kingdomb and all lands were formerly subject to a tax for building of castles wherever the king thought proper this was one of the three things from contributing to the performance of which no lands were exempted and therefore called by our saxon ancestors the trinoda necessitas sc pontis réparatio arcis constructio et expeditio contra hostemc and this they were called upon to do so often that as sir edward coke from m paris assures usd there were in the time of hen ii      castles subsisting in england the inconveniences of which when granted out to private subjects the lordly barons of those times was severely felt by the whole kingdom for as william of newburgh remarks in the reign of king stephen erant in anglia quodammodo tot reges vel potius tyranni quot domini castellorum but it was felt by none more sensibly than by two succeeding princes king john and king henry iii and therefore the greatest part of them being demolished in the barons wars the kings of aftertimes have been very cautious of suffering them to be rebuilt in a fortified manner and sir edward coke lays it downe that no subject can build a castle or house of strength embattled or other fortress defensible without the license of the king for the danger which might ensue if every man at his pleasure might do it it is partly upon the same and partly upon a fiscal foundation to secure his marine revenue that the king has the      prerogative of appointing ports and havens or such places only for persons and merchandise to pass into and out of the realm as he in his wisdom sees proper by the feodal law all navigable rivers and havens were computed among the regaliaf and were subject to the sovereign of the state and in england it hath always been holden that the king is lord of the whole shoreg and particularly is the guardian of the ports and havens which are the inlets and gates of the realmh and therefore so early as the reign of king john we find ships seized by the kings officers for putting in at a place that was not a legal porti these legal ports were undoubtedly at first assigned by the crown since to each of them a court of portmote is incidentj the jurisdiction of which must flow from the royal authority the great ports of the sea are also referred to as well known and established by statute   hen iv c  0 which prohibits the landing elsewhere under pain of confiscation and the statute   eliz c    recites that the franchise of lading and discharging had been frequently granted by the crown but though the king had a power of granting the franchise of havens and ports yet he had not the power of resumption or of narrowing and confining their limits when once established but any person had a right to load or discharge his merchandise in any part of the haven whereby the revenue of the customs was much impaired and diminished by fraudulent landings in obscure and private corners this occasioned the statutes of   eliz c    and        car ii c    §    which enable the crown by commission to ascertain the limits of all ports and to assign proper wharfs and quays in each port for the exclusive landing and loading of merchandise the erection of beacons lighthouses and seamarks is also a branch of the     royal prerogative whereof the first was      anciently used in order to alarm the country in case of the approach of an enemy and all of them are signally useful in guiding and preserving vessels at sea by night as well as by day for this purpose the king hath the exclusive power by commission under his great sealk to cause them to be erected in fit and convenient placesl as well upon the lands of the subject as upon the demesnes of the crown which power is usually vested by letters patent in the office of lord high admiralm and by statute   eliz c    the corporation of the trinityhouse are empowered to set up any beacons or seamarks wherever they shall think them necessary and if the owner of the land or any other person shall destroy them or shall take down any steeple tree or other known seamark he shall forfeit  00l or in case of inability to pay it shall be ipso facto outlawed to this branch of the prerogative may also be referred the power vested in his majesty by statutes    car ii c   and    geo ii c    of prohibiting the exportation of arms or ammunition out of this kingdom under severe penalties and likewise the right which the king has whenever he sees proper of confining his subjects to stay within the realm or of recalling them when beyond the seas by the common lawn every man may go out of the realm for whatever cause he pleaseth without obtaining the kings leave provided he is under no injunction of staying at home which liberty was expressly declared in king johns great charter though left out in that of henry iii but because that every man ought of right to defend the king and his realm therefore the king at his pleasure may command him by his writ that he go not beyond the seas or out of the realm without license and if he do the contrary he shall be punished for disobeying the kings command some persons there anciently were that by reason of their stations were under a perpetual prohibition of going abroad without license obtained among which were reckoned all peers on account of their being counsellors of      the crown all knights who were bound to defend the kingdom from invasions all ecclesiastics who were expressly confined by the fourth chapter of the constitutions of clarendon on account of their attachment in the times of popery to the see of rome all archers and other artificers lest they should instruct foreigners to rival us in their several trades and manufactures this was law in the times of brittono who wrote in the reign of edward i and sir edward cokep gives us many instances to this effect in the time of edward iii in the succeeding reign the affair of travelling wore a very different aspect an act of parliament being madeq forbidding all persons whatever to go abroad without license except only the lords and other great men of the realm and true and notable merchants and the kings soldiers but this act was repealed by the statute   jac i c   and at present everybody has or at least assumes the liberty of going abroad when he pleases yet undoubtedly if the king by writ of ne exeat regnum under his great seal or privy seal thinks proper to prohibit him from so doing or if the king sends a writ to any man when abroad commanding his return and in either case the subject disobeys it is a high contempt of the kings prerogative for which the offenders lands shall be seized till he return and then he is liable to fine and imprisonmentr       iii another capacity in which the king is considered in domestic affairs is as the fountain of justice and general conservator of the peace of the kingdom by the fountain of justice the law does not mean the author or original but only the distributor justice is not derived from the king as from his free gift but he is the steward of the public to dispense it to whom it is dues he is not the spring but the reservoir from whence right and equity are conducted by a thousand channels to every individual the original power of judicature by the fundamental principles of society is      lodged in the society at large but as it would be impracticable to render complete justice to every individual by the people in their collective capacity therefore every nation has committed that power to certain select magistrates who with more ease and expedition can hear and determine complaints and in england this authority has immemorially been exercised by the king or his substitutes he therefore has alone the right of erecting courts of judicature for though the constitution of the kingdom hath intrusted him with the whole executive power of the laws it is impossible as well as improper that he should personally carry into execution this great and extensive trust it is consequently necessary that courts should be erected to assist him in executing this power and equally necessary that if erected they should be erected by his authority and hence it is that all jurisdictions of courts are either mediately or immediately derived from the crown their proceedings run generally in the kings name they pass under his seal and are executed by his officers it is probable and almost certain that in very early times before our constitution arrived at its full perfection our kings in person often heard and determined causes between party and party but at present by the long and uniform usage of many ages our kings have delegated their whole judicial power to the judges of their several courts which are the grand depositories of the fundamental laws of the kingdom and have gained a known and stated jurisdiction regulated by certain established rules which the crown itself cannot now alter but by act of parliamentt and in order to maintain both the dignity and independence of the judges in the superior courts it is enacted by the statute    w iii c   that their commissions shall be made not as formerly durante bene placito but quamdiu bene se gesserintu and their salaries ascertained and established but that it may be lawful to remove them on the address     of both houses of parliament and now by the noble improvements of that law in the statute of   geo iii c    enacted at the earnest recommendation of      the king himself from the throne the judges are continued in their offices during their good behaviour notwithstanding any demise of the crown which was formerly heldw immediately to vacate their seats   and their full salaries are absolutely secured to them during the continuance of their commissions his majesty having been pleased to declare that he looked upon the independence and uprightness of the judges as essential to the impartial administration of justice as one of the best securities of the rights and liberties of his subjects and as most conducive to the honour of the crownx   in criminal proceedings or prosecutions for offences it would still be a higher absurdity if the king personally sat in judgment because in regard to these he appears in another capacity that of prosecutor all offences are either against the kings peace or his crown and dignity and are so laid in every indictment for though in their consequences they generally seem except in the case of treason and a very few others to be rather offences against the kingdom than the king yet as the public which is an invisible body has delegated all its power and rights with regard to the execution of the laws to one visible magistrate all affronts to that power and breaches of those rights are immediately offences against him to whom they are so delegated by the public he is therefore the proper person to prosecute for all public offences and breaches of the peace being the person injured in the eye of the law and this notion was carried so far in the old gothic constitution wherein the king was bound by his coronation oath to conserve the peace that in case of any forcible injury offered to the person of a fellowsubject the offender was accused     of a kind of perjury in having violated the kings coronation oath dicebatur fregisse juramentum regis juratumy and hence also arises another      branch of the prerogative that of pardoning offences for it is reasonable that he only who is injured should have the power of forgiving 0 of prosecutions and pardons i shall treat more at large hereafter and only mention them here in this cursory manner to show the constitutional grounds of this power of the crown and how regularly connected all the links are in the vast chain of prerogative in this distinct and separate existence of the judicial power in a peculiar body of men nominated indeed but not removable at pleasure by the crown consists one main preservative of the public liberty which cannot subsist long in any state unless the administration of common justice be in some degree separated both from the legislative and also from the executive power were it joined with the legislative the life liberty and property of the subject would be in the hands of arbitrary judges whose decisions would be then regulated only by their own opinions and not by any fundamental principles of law which though legislators may depart from yet judges are bound to observe were it joined with the executive this union might soon be an overbalance for the legislative for which reason by the statute of    car i c  0 which abolished the court of starchamber effectual care is taken to remove all judicial power out of the hands of the kings privy council who as then was evident from recent instances might soon be inclined to pronounce that for law which was most agreeable to the prince or his officers nothing therefore is more to be avoided in a free constitution than uniting the provinces of a judge and a minister of state and indeed that the absolute power claimed and exercised in a neighbouring nation is more tolerable than that of the eastern empires is in great measure owing to their having vested the judicial power in their parliaments a body separate and distinct from both the legislative and executive and if ever that nation recovers its former liberty it will owe it to the efforts of those assemblies in turkey where every thing is centred in     the sultan or his ministers    0 despotic power is in its meridian and wears a more dreadful aspect a consequence of this prerogative is the legal ubiquity of the king his majesty in the eye of the law is always present in all his courts though he cannot personally distribute justicez his judges are the mirror by which the kings image is reflected it is the regal office and not the royal person that is always present in court always ready to undertake prosecutions or pronounce judgment for the benefit and protection of the subject and from this ubiquity it follows that the king can never be nonsuita for a nonsuit is the desertion of a suit or action by the nonappearance of the plaintiff in court   for the same reason also in the forms of legal proceedings the king is not said to appear by his attorney as other men do for in contemplation of law he is always present in courtb from the same original of the kings being the fountain of justice we may also deduce the prerogative of issuing proclamations which is vested in the king alone these proclamations have then a binding force when as sir edward coke observesc they are grounded upon and enforce the laws of the realm for though the making of laws is entirely the work of a distinct part the legislative branch of the sovereign power yet the manner time and circumstances of putting those laws in execution must frequently be left to the discretion of the executive magistrate and therefore his constitutions or edicts concerning these points which we call proclamations are binding upon the subject where they do not either contradict the old laws or tend to establish new ones but only enforce the execution of such laws as are already in being in such manner as the king shall judge necessary thus the established law is that the king may prohibit any of his subjects from leaving the realm a proclamation therefore forbidding this in general for three weeks by laying      an embargo upon all shipping in time of ward will be equally binding as an act of parliament because founded upon a prior law but a proclamation to lay an embargo in time of peace upon all vessels laden with wheat though in the time of public scarcity being contrary to law and particularly to statute    car ii c    the advisers of such a proclamation and all persons acting under it found it necessary to be indemnified by a special act of parliament   geo iii c   a proclamation for disarming papists is also binding being only in execution of what the legislature has first ordained but a proclamation for allowing arms to papists or for disarming any protestant subjects will not bind because the first would be to assume a dispensing power the latter a legislative one to the vesting of either of which in any single person the laws of england are absolutely strangers indeed by the statute    hen viii c   it was enacted that the kings proclamations should have the force of acts of parliament a statute which was calculated to introduce the most despotic tyranny and which must have proved fatal to the liberties of this kingdom had it not been luckily repealed in the minority of his successor about five years aftere   iv the king is likewise the fountain of honour of office and of privilege and this in a different sense from that wherein he is styled the fountain of justice for here he is really the parent of them it is impossible that government can be maintained without a due subordination of rank that the people may know and distinguish such as are set over them in order to yield them their due respect and obedience and also that the officers themselves being encouraged     by emulation and the hopes of superiority may the better discharge their functions and the law supposes that no one can be so good a judge of their several merits and services as the king himself who employs them it has therefore intrusted him with the sole power of conferring dignities and honours in confidence that he will bestow them upon none but such as deserve them and therefore all degrees of      nobility and knighthood and other titles are received by immediate grant from the crown either expressed in writing by writs or letters patent as in the creations of peers and baronets or by corporeal investiture as in the creation of a simple knight from the same principle also arises the prerogative of erecting and disposing of offices for honours and offices are in their nature convertible and synonymous all offices under the crown carry in the eye of the law an honour along with them because they imply a superiority of parts and abilities being supposed to be always filled with those that are most able to execute them and on the other hand all honours in their original had duties or offices annexed to them an earl comes was the conservator or governor of a county and a knight miles was bound to attend the king in his wars for the same reason therefore that honours are in the disposal of the king offices ought to be so likewise and as the king may create new titles so may he create new offices but with this restriction that he cannot create new offices with new fees annexed to them nor annex new fees to old offices for this would be a tax upon the subject which cannot be imposed but by act of parliamentf wherefore in    hen iv a new office being created by the kings letters patent for measuring cloths with a new fee for the same the letters patent were on account of the new fee revoked and declared void in parliament   upon the same or a like reason the king has also the prerogative of conferring privileges upon private persons such as granting place or precedence to any of his subjects   as shall seem good to his royal wisdomg or such as converting aliens or persons born out of the kings dominions into denizens whereby some very considerable privileges of naturalborn subjects are conferred upon them such also is the prerogative of erecting corporations whereby a number of private persons are united and knit together and enjoy many liberties powers and immunities in their politic      capacity which they were utterly incapable of in their natural of aliens denizens naturalborn and naturalized subjects i shall speak more largely in a subsequent chapter as also of corporations at the close of this book of our commentaries       i now only mention them incidentally in order to remark the kings prerogative of making them which is grounded upon this foundation that the king having the sole administration of the government in his hands is the best and the only judge in what capacities with what privileges and under what distinctions his people are the best qualified to serve and to act under him a principle which was carried so far by the imperial law that it was determined to be the crime of sacrilege even to doubt whether the prince had appointed proper officers in the stateh v another light in which the laws of england consider the king with regard to domestic concerns is as the arbiter of commerce by commerce i at present mean domestic commerce only it would lead me into too large a field if i were to attempt to enter upon the nature of foreign trade its privileges regulations and restrictions and would be also quite beside the purpose of these commentaries which are confined to the laws of england whereas no municipal laws can be sufficient to order and determine the very extensive and complicated affairs of traffic and merchandise neither can they have a proper authority for this purpose for as these are transactions carried on between subjects of independent states the municipal laws of one will not be regarded by the other for which reason the affairs of commerce are regulated by a law of their own called the law merchant or lex mercatoria which all nations agree in and take notice of and in particular it is held to be part of the law of england which decides the causes of merchants by the general rules which obtain in all commercial countries and that often even in matters relating to domestic trade as for instance with regard to the drawing the acceptance and the transfer of inland bills of exchangei        with us in england the kings prerogative so far as it relates to mere domestic commerce will fall principally under the following articles— first the establishment of public marts or places of buying and selling such as markets and fairs with the tolls thereunto belonging these can only be set up by virtue of the kings grant or by long and immemorial usage and prescription which presupposes such a grantk the limitation of these public resorts to such time and such place as may be most convenient for the neighbourhood forms a part of economics or domestic polity which considering the kingdom as a large family and the king as the master of it he clearly has a right to dispose and order as he pleases secondly the regulation of weights and measures these for the advantage of the public ought to be universally the same throughout the kingdom being the general criterions which reduce all things to the same or an equivalent value but as weight and measure are things in their nature arbitrary and uncertain it is therefore expedient that they be reduced to some fixed rule or standard which standard it is impossible to fix by any written law or oral proclamation for no man can by words only give another an adequate idea of a footrule or a poundweight it is therefore necessary to have recourse to some visible palpable material standard by forming a comparison with which all weights and measures may be reduced to one uniform size and the prerogative of fixing this standard our ancient law vested in the crown as in normandy it belonged to the dukel this standard was originally kept at     winchester and we find in the laws of king edgarm near a century before the conquest an injunction that one measure which was kept at winchester should be observed throughout the realm most nations have regulated the standard of measures of length by      comparison with the parts of the human body as the palm the hand the span the foot the cubit the ell ulna or arm the pace and the fathom but as these are of different dimension in men of different proportions our ancient historiansn inform us that a new standard of longitudinal measure was ascertained by king henry the first who commanded that the ulna or ancient ell which answers to the modern yard should be made of the exact length of his own arm and one standard of measures of length being gained all others are easily derived from thence those of greater length by multiplying those of less by subdividing that original standard thus by the statute called compositio ulnarum et perticarum five yards and a half make a perch and the yard is subdivided into three feet and each foot into twelve inches which inches will be each of the length of three grains of barley superficial measures are derived by squaring those of length and measures of capacity by cubing them the standard of weights was originally taken from corns of wheat whence the lowest denomination of weights we have is still called a grain thirtytwo of which are directed by the statute called compositio mensurarum to compose a pennyweight whereof twenty make an ounce twelve ounces a pound and so upwards and upon these principles the first standards were made which being originally so fixed by the crown their subsequent regulations have been generally made by the king in parliament thus under king richard i in his parliament holden at westminster ad      it was ordained that there should be only one weight and one measure throughout the kingdom and that the custody of the assize or standard of weights and measures should be committed to certain persons in every city and borougho from whence the ancient office of the kings aulnager seems to have been derived whose duty it was for a certain fee to measure all cloths made for sale till the office was abolished by the statute        w iii c  0 in king johns time this ordinance of king richard was      frequently dispensed with for moneyp which occasioned a provision to be made for enforcing it in the great charters of king john and his sonq these original standards were called pondus regisr and mensura domini regiss and are directed by a variety of subsequent statutes to be kept in the exchequer and all weights and measures to be made conformable theretot but as sir edward coke observesu though this hath so often by authority of parliament been enacted yet it could never be effected so forcible is custom with the multitude       thirdly as money is the medium of commerce it is the kings prerogative as the arbiter of domestic commerce to give it authority or make it current money is an universal medium or common standard by comparison with which the value of all merchandise may be ascertained or it is a sign which represents the respective values of all commodities metals are well calculated for this sign because they are durable and are capable of many subdivisions and a precious metal is still better calculated for this purpose because it is the most portable a metal is also the most proper for a common measure because it can easily be reduced to the same standard in all nations and every particular nation fixes on it its own impression that the weight and standard wherein consists the intrinsic value may both be known by inspection only as the quantity of precious metals increases that is the more of them there is extracted from the mine this universal medium or common sign will sink in value and grow less precious above a thousand millions of bullion are calculated to have been imported into europe from america within less than three centuries and the quantity is daily increasing      the consequence is that more money must be given now for the same commodity than was given a hundred years ago and if any accident were to diminish the quantity of gold and silver their value would proportionably rise a horse that was formerly worth ten pounds is now perhaps worth twenty and by any failure of current specie the price may be reduced to what it was yet is the horse in reality neither dearer nor cheaper at one time than another for if the metal which constitutes the coin was formerly twice as scarce as at present the commodity was then as dear at half the price as now it is at the whole       the coining of money is in all states the act of the sovereign power for the reason just mentioned that its value may be known on inspection and with respect to coinage in general there are three things to be considered therein the materials the impression and the denomination with regard to the materials sir edward coke lays it downv that the money of england must either be of gold or silver and none other was ever issued by the royal authority till      when copper farthings and halfpence were coined by king charles the second and ordered by proclamation to be current in all payments under the value of sixpence and not otherwise but this copper coin is not upon the same footing with the other in many respects particularly with regard to the offence of counterfeiting it and as to the silver coin it is enacted by statute    geo iii c    that no tender of payment in silver money exceeding twentyfive pounds at one time shall be a sufficient tender in law for more than its value by weight at the rate of  s  d an ounce   as to the impression the stamping thereof is the unquestionable prerogative of the crown for though divers bishops and monasteries had formerly the privilege of coining money yet as sir matthew hale observesw this was usually done by special grant from the king or by prescription which supposes one and therefore was derived from and not in derogation of the royal prerogative besides that they had only the profit of the coinage and not the power of      instituting either the impression or denomination but had usually the stamp sent them from the exchequer the denomination or the value for which the coin is to pass current is likewise in the breast of the king and if any unusual pieces are coined that value must be ascertained by proclamation in order to fix the value the weight and the fineness of the metal are to be taken into consideration together when a given weight of gold or silver is of a given fineness it is then of the true standardx and called esterling or sterling metal a name for which there are various reasons giveny but none of them entirely satisfactory 0 and of this sterling or esterling metal all the coin of the kingdom must be made by the statute    edw iii c    so that the kings prerogative seemeth not to extend to the debasing or enhancing the value of the coin below or above the sterling     valuez though sir matthew halea appears to be of another opinion   the king may also by his proclamation legitimate foreign coin and make it current here declaring at what value it shall be taken in paymentsb but this i apprehend ought to be by comparison with the standard of our own coin otherwise the consent of parliament will be necessary there is at present no such legitimated money portugal coin being only current by private consent so that any one who pleases may refuse to take it in payment the king may also at any time decry or cry down any coin of the kingdom and make it no longer currentc   vi the king is lastly considered by the laws of england as the head and supreme governor of the national church to enter into the reasons upon which this prerogative is founded is matter rather of divinity than of law i shall therefore only observe that by statute    hen viii c   reciting that the kings majesty justly and rightfully is and ought      to be the supreme head of the church of england and so had been recognised by the clergy of this kingdom in their convocation it is enacted that the king shall be reputed the only supreme head in earth of the church of england and shall have annexed to the imperial crown of this realm as well the title and style thereof as all jurisdictions authorities and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the church appertaining and another statute to the same purport was made   eliz c   in virtue of this authority the king convenes prorogues restrains regulates and dissolves all ecclesiastical synods or convocations this was an inherent prerogative of the crown long before the time of henry viii as appears by the statute   hen vi c   and the many authors both lawyers and historians vouched by sir edward coked so that the statute    hen viii c    which restrains the convocation from making or putting in execution any canons repugnant to the kings prerogative or the laws customs and statutes of the realm was merely declaratory of the old common lawe that part of it only being new which makes the kings royal assent actually necessary to the validity of every canon the convocation or ecclesiastical synod in england differs considerably in its constitution from the synods of other christian kingdoms those consisting wholly of bishops whereas with us the convocation is the miniature of parliament wherein the archbishop presides with regal state the upper house of bishops represents the house of lords and the lower house composed of representatives of the several dioceses at large and of each particular chapter therein resembles the house of commons with its knights of the shire and burgessesf   this constitution is said to be owing to the policy of     edward i who thereby at one and the same time let in the inferior clergy to the privileges of forming    0 ecclesiastical canons which before they had not and also introduced a method of taxing ecclesiastical benefices by consent of convocationg   from this prerogative also of being the head of the church arises the kings right of nomination to vacant bishoprics and certain other ecclesiastical preferments which will more properly be considered when we come to treat of the clergy i shall only here observe that this is now done in consequence of the statute    hen viii c  0 as head of the church the king is likewise the dernier resort in all ecclesiastical causes an appeal lying ultimately to him in chancery from the sentence of every ecclesiastical judge which right was restored to the crown by statute    hen viii c    as will more fully be shown hereafter       chapter viii of the kings revenue having in the preceding chapter considered at large those branches of the kings prerogative which contribute to his royal dignity and constitute the executive power of the government we proceed now to examine the kings fiscus prerogatives or such as regard his revenue which the british constitution hath vested in the royal person in order to support his dignity and maintain his power being a portion which each subject contributes of his property in order to secure the remainder this revenue is either ordinary or extraordinary the kings ordinary revenue is such as has either subsisted time out of mind in the crown or else has been granted by parliament by way of purchase or exchange for such of the kings inherent hereditary revenues as were found inconvenient to the subject when i say that it has subsisted time out of mind in the crown i do not mean that the king is at present in the actual possession of the whole of this revenue much nay the greatest part of it is at this day in the hands of subjects to whom it has been granted out from time to time by the kings of england which has rendered the crown in some measure dependent on the people for its ordinary support and subsistence so that i must be obliged to recount as part of the royal revenue what lords of manors and other subjects      frequently look upon to be their own absolute inherent rights because they are and have been vested in them and their ancestors for ages though in reality originally derived from the grants of our ancient princes i the first of the kings ordinary revenues which i shall take notice of is of an ecclesiastical kind as are also the three succeeding ones viz the custody of the temporalties of bishops by which are meant all the lay revenues lands and tenements in which is included his barony which belong to an archbishops or bishops see and these upon the vacancy of the bishopric are immediately the right of the king as a consequence of his prerogative in church matters whereby he is considered as the founder of all archbishoprics and bishoprics to whom during the vacancy they revert and for the same reason before the dissolution of abbeys the king had the custody of the temporalties of all such abbeys and priories as were of royal foundation but not of those founded by subjects on the death of the abbot or priora another reason may also be given why the policy of the law hath vested this custody in the king because as the successor is not known the lands and possessions of the see would be liable to spoil and devastation if no one had a property therein therefore the law has given the king not the temporalties themselves but the custody of the temporalties till such time as a successor is appointed with power of taking to himself all the intermediate profits without any account of the successor and with the right of presenting which the crown very frequently exercises to such benefices and other preferments as fall within the time of vacationb this revenue is of so high a nature that it could not be granted out to a subject before or even after it accrued but now by the statute    edw iii st   c   and   the king may after the vacancy lease the temporalties to the dean and chapter saving to himself all advowsons escheats and the like our ancient kings and particularly william rufus were not only remarkable for keeping the bishoprics a long time      vacant for the sake of enjoying the temporalties but also committed horrible waste on the woods and other parts of the estate and to crown all would never when the see was filled up restore to the bishop his temporalties again unless he purchased them at an exorbitant price to remedy which king henry the firstc granted a charter at the beginning of his reign promising     neither to sell nor let to farm nor take any thing from the domains of the church till the successor was installed  and it was made one of the articles of the great charterd that no waste should be committed in the temporalties of bishoprics neither should the custody of them be sold the same is ordained by the statute of westminster the  ste and the statute    edw iii st   c   which permits as we have seen a lease to the dean and chapter is still more explicit in prohibiting the other exactions it was also a frequent abuse that the king would for trifling or no causes seize the temporalties of bishops even during their lives into his own hands but this is guarded against by statute   edw iii st   c   this revenue of the king which was formerly very considerable is now by a customary indulgence almost reduced to nothing for at present as soon as the new bishop is consecrated and confirmed he usually receives the restitution of his temporalties quite entire and untouched from the king and at the same time does homage to his sovereign and then and not sooner he has a fee simple in his bishopric and may maintain an action for the profitsf ii the king is entitled to a corody as the law calls it out of every bishopric that is to send one of his chaplains to be maintained by the bishop or to have a pension allowed him till the bishop promotes him to a beneficeg this is also in the nature of an acknowledgment to the king as founder of the see since he had formerly the same corody or pension from every abbey or priory of royal foundation  it is i      apprehend now fallen into total disuse though sir matthew hale saysh that it is due of common right  and that no prescription will discharge it iii the king also as was formerly observedi is entitled to all the tithes arising in extraparochial placesk though perhaps it may be doubted how far this article as well as the last can be properly reckoned a part of the kings own royal revenue since a corody supports only his chaplains and these extraparochial tithes are held under an implied trust that the king will distribute them for the good of the clergy in general iv the next branch consists in the firstfruits and tenths of all spiritual preferments in the kingdom both of which i shall consider together these were originally a part of the papal usurpations over the clergy of this kingdom first introduced by pandulph the popes legate during the reigns of king john and henry the third in the see of norwich and afterwards attempted to be made universal by the popes clement v and john xxii about the beginning of the fourteenth century the firstfruits primitiæ or annates were the first years whole profits of the spiritual preferment according to a rate or valor made under the direction of pope innocent iv by walter bishop of norwich in    hen iii and afterwards advanced in value by commission from pope nicholas iii ad       0 edw il which valuation of pope nicholas is still preserved in the exchequerm  the tenths or decimæ were     the tenth part of the annual profit of each living by the same valuation which was also claimed by the holy see under no better pretence than a strange misapplication of that precept of the levitical law which directsn that the levites should offer the tenth part of their tithes as a heaveoffering to the lord and give it to aaron the high priest but      this claim of the pope met with a vigorous resistance from the english parliament and a variety of acts were passed to prevent and restrain it particularly the statute   hen iv c   which calls it a horrible mischief and damnable custom but the popish clergy blindly devoted to the will of a foreign master still kept it on foot sometimes more secretly sometimes more openly and avowedly so that in the reign of henry viii it was computed that in the compass of fifty years  00000 ducats had been sent to rome for firstfruits only and as the clergy expressed this willingness to contribute so much of their income to the head of the church it was thought proper when in the same reign the papal power was abolished and the king was declared the head of the church of england to annex this revenue to the crown which was done by statute    hen viii c   confirmed by statute   eliz c   and a new valor beneficiorum was then made by which the clergy are at present rated  by these lastmentioned statutes all vicarages under ten pounds a year and all rectories under ten marks are discharged from the payment of firstfruits and if in such livings as continue chargeable with this payment the incumbent lives but half a year he shall pay only one quarter of his firstfruits if but one whole year then half of them if a year and a half three quarters and if two years then the whole and not otherwise  likewise by the statute    hen viii c   no tenths are to be paid for the first year for then the firstfruits are due and by other statutes of queen anne in the fifth and sixth years of her reign if a benefice be under fifty pounds per annum clear yearly value it shall be discharged of the payment of firstfruits and tenths  thus the richer clergy being by the criminal bigotry of their popish predecessors subjected at first to a foreign exaction were afterwards when that yoke was shaken off liable to a like misapplication of their revenues through the rapacious disposition of the then reigning monarch till at length the piety     of queen anne restored to the church what had been      thus indirectly taken from it this she did not by remitting the tenths and firstfruits entirely but in a spirit of the truest equity by applying these superfluities of the larger benefices to make up the deficiencies of the smaller and to this end she granted her royal charter which was confirmed by the statute   anne c    whereby all the revenue of firstfruits and tenths is vested in trustees forever to form a perpetual fund for the augmentation of poor livings this is usually called queen annes bounty which has been still further regulated by subsequent statuteso  v the next branch of the kings ordinary revenue which as well as the subsequent branches is of a lay or temporal nature consists in the rents and profits of the demesne lands of the crown these demesne lands terræ dominicales regis being either the share reserved to the crown at the original distribution of landed property or such as came to it afterwards by forfeitures or other means were anciently very large and extensive comprising divers manors honours and lordships the tenants of which had very peculiar privileges     as will be shown in the second book of these commentaries when we speak of the tenure in ancient demesne at present they are contracted within a very narrow compass having been almost entirely granted away to private subjects this has occasioned the parliament frequently to interpose and particularly after king william iii had greatly impoverished the crown an act passedp whereby all future grants or leases from the crown for any longer term than thirtyone years or three lives are declared to be void except with regard to houses which may be granted for fifty years and no reversionary lease can be made so as to exceed together with the estate in being the same term of three lives or thirtyone years that is where there is a subsisting lease of which there are twenty years still to come the king cannot grant a future interest to commence after the expiration of the former for any longer term than eleven years the tenant must also be made liable to be punished for committing waste      and the usual rent must be reserved or where there has usually been no rent onethird of the clear yearly valueq the misfortune is that this act was made too late after almost every valuable possession of the crown had been granted away forever or else upon very long leases but may be of some benefit to posterity when those leases come to expire  vi hither might have been referred the advantages which used to arise to the king from the profits of his military tenures to which most lands in the kingdom were subject till the statute    car ii c    which in great measure abolished them all the explication of the nature of which tenures must be postponed to the second book of these commentaries hither also might have been referred the profitable prerogative of purveyance and preemption which was a right enjoyed by the crown of buying up provisions and other necessaries by the intervention of the kings purveyors for the use of his royal household at an appraised valuation in preference to all others and even without the consent of the owner and also of forcibly impressing the carriages and horses of the subject to do the kings business on the public roads in the conveyance of timber baggage and the like however inconvenient to the proprietor upon paying him a settled price a prerogative which prevailed pretty generally throughout europe during the scarcity of gold and silver and the high valuation of money consequential thereupon in those early times the kings household as well as those of inferior lords were supported by specific renders of corn and other victuals from the tenants of the respective demesnes and there was also a continual market kept at the palace gate to furnish viands for the royal user and this answered all purposes in those ages of simplicity so long as the kings court continued in any certain place but when it removed from one part of the kingdom to another as was formerly very frequently done it was found necessary to send      purveyors beforehand to get together a sufficient quantity of provisions and other necessaries for the household and lest the unusual demand should raise them to an exorbitant price the powers before mentioned were vested in these purveyors who in process of time very greatly abused their authority and became a great oppression to the subject though of little advantage to the crown ready money in open market when the royal residence was more permanent and specie began to be plenty being found upon experience to be the best proveditor of any wherefore by degrees the powers of purveyance have declined in foreign countries as well as our own and particularly were abolished in sweden by gustavus adolphus towards the beginning of the last centurys and with us in england having fallen into disuse during the suspension of monarchy king charles at his restoration     consented by the same statute to resign entirely these branches of his revenue and power and the parliament in part of recompense settled on him his heirs and successors forever the hereditary excise of fifteen pence per barrel on all beer and ale sold in the kingdom and a proportionable sum for certain other liquors so that this hereditary excise the nature of which shall be further explained in the subsequent part of this chapter now forms the sixth branch of his majestys ordinary revenue vii a seventh branch might also be computed to have arisen from wine licenses or the rents payable to the crown by such persons as are licensed to sell wine by retail throughout england except in a few privileged places these were first settled on the crown by the statute    car ii c    and together with the hereditary excise made up the equivalent in value for the loss sustained by the prerogative in the abolition of the military tenures and the right of preemption and purveyance but this revenue was abolished by the statute  0 geo ii c    and an annual sum of upwards of  000l per annum issuing out of the new stamp duties imposed on wine licenses was settled on the crown in its stead      viii an eighth branch of the kings ordinary revenue is usually reckoned to consist in the profits arising from his forests forests are waste grounds belonging to the king replenished with all manner of beasts of chase or venary which are under the kings protection for the sake of his royal recreation and delight and to that end and for preservation of the kings game there are particular laws privileges courts and offices belonging to the kings forests all which will be in their turns explained in the subsequent books of these commentaries what we are now to consider are only the profits arising to the king from hence which consist principally in amercements or fines levied for offences against the forest laws but as few if any courts of this kind for levying amercementst have been held since        car i 0 and as from the accounts given of the proceedings in that court by our histories and lawbooksu nobody would now wish to see them again revived it is needless at least in this place to pursue this inquiry any further ix the profits arising from the kings ordinary courts of justice make a ninth branch of his revenue and these consist not only in fines imposed upon offenders forfeitures of recognizances and amercements levied upon defaulters but also in certain fees due to the crown in a variety of legal matters as for setting the great seal to charters original writs and other forensic proceedings and for permitting fines to be levied of lands in order to bar entails or otherwise to insure their title as none of these can be done without the immediate intervention of the king by himself or his officers the law allows him certain perquisites and profits as a recompense for the trouble he undertakes for the public these in process of time have been almost all granted out to private persons or else appropriated to certain particular uses so that though our lawproceedings are still loaded with their payment very little of them is now returned into the kings    0 exchequer for a part of whose royal maintenance they were originally intended all future grants of them however by the statute   anne st   c   are to endure for no longer time than the princes life who grants them x a tenth branch of the kings ordinary revenue said to be grounded on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from pirates and robbers is the right to royal fish which are whale and sturgeon and these when either thrown ashore or caught near the coast are the property of the king on accountv of their superior excellence indeed our ancestors seem to have entertained a very high notion of the importance of this right it being the prerogative of the kings of denmark and the dukes of normandyw and   0 from one of these it was probably derived to our princes it is expressly claimed and allowed in the statute de prærogativa regisx and the most ancient treatises of law now extant make mention of ity though they seem to have made a distinction between whale and sturgeon as was incidentally observed in a former chapterz xi another maritime revenue and founded partly upon the same reason is that of shipwrecks which are also declared to be the kings property by the same prerogative statute    edw ii c    and were so long before at the common law it is worthy observation how greatly the law of wrecks has been altered and the rigour of it gradually softened in favour of the distressed proprietors wreck by the ancient common law was where any ship was lost at sea and the goods or cargo were thrown upon the land in which case these goods so wrecked were adjudged to belong to the king for it was held that by the loss of the ship all property was gone out of the original ownera but this was undoubtedly adding sorrow to sorrow and was consonant neither to reason nor humanity wherefore it was first      ordained by king henry i that if any person escaped alive out of the ship it should be no wreckb and afterwards king henry ii by his charterc declared that if on the coasts of either england poictou oleron or gascony any ship should be distressed and either man or beast should escape or be found therein alive the goods should remain to the owners if they claimed them within three months but otherwise should be esteemed a wreck and should belong to the king or other lord of the franchise this was again confirmed with improvements by king richard the first who in the second year of his reignd not only established these concessions by ordaining that the owner if he was shipwrecked and escaped omnes res suas liberas et quietas haberete but also that if he perished his children or in default of them his brethren and sisters should retain the property and in default of brother or sister then the goods should remain to the kingf and the law as laid down by bracton in the reign of henry iii seems still to have improved in its equity for then if not only a dog for instance escaped by which the owner might be discovered but if any certain mark were set on the goods by which they might be known again it was held to be no wreckg and this is certainly most agreeable to reason the rational claim of the king being only founded upon this that the true owner cannot be ascertained afterwards in the statute of westminster the firsth the time of limitation of claims given by the charter of henry ii is extended to a year and a day according to the usage of normandyi and it enacts that if a man a dog or a cat escape alive the vessel shall not be adjudged a wreck these animals as in bracton are only put for examplesj for it is now heldk that not only if any live thing escape but if proof can be made of the      property of any of the goods or lading which come to shore they shall not be forfeited as wreck the statute further ordains that the sheriff of the county shall be bound to keep the goods a year and a day as in france for one year agreeably to the maritime laws of oleronl and in holland for a year and a half that if any man can prove a property in them either in his own right or by right of representationm they shall be restored to him without delay but if no such property be proved within that time they then shall be the kings if the goods are of a perishable nature the sheriff may sell them and the money shall be liable in their steadn this revenue of wrecks is frequently granted out to lords of manors as a royal franchise     and if any one be thus entitled to wrecks in his own land and the kings goods are wrecked thereon the king may claim them at any time even after the year and dayo it is to be observed that in order to constitute a legal wreck the goods must come to land if they continue at sea the law distinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appellations of jetsam flotsam and ligan jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea and there sink and remain under water flotsam is where they continue swimming on the surface of the waves ligan is where they are sunk in the sea but tied to a cork or buoy in order to be found againp these are also the kings if no owner appears to claim them but if any owner appears he is entitled to recover the possession for even if they be cast overboard without any mark or buoy in order to lighten the ship the owner is not by this act of necessity construed to have renounced his propertyq much less can things ligan be supposed to be abandoned since the owner has done all in his power to assert and retain his property these three are therefore accounted so far a distinct thing from the former that by the      kings grant to a man of wrecks things jetsam flotsam and ligan will not passr wrecks in their legal acceptation are at present not very frequent for if any goods come to land it rarely happens since the improvement of commerce navigation and correspondence that the owner is not able to assert his property within the year and day limited by law and in order to preserve this property entire for him and if possible to prevent wrecks at all our laws have made many very humane regulations in a spirit quite opposite to those savage laws which formerly prevailed in all the northern regions of europe and a few years ago were still said to subsist on the coasts of the baltic sea permitting the inhabitants to seize on whatever they could get as lawful prize or as an author of their own expresses it in naufragorum miseria et calamitate tanquam vultures ad prædam curreres for by the statute    edw iii c    if any ship be lost on the shore and the goods come to land which cannot says the statute be called wreck they shall be presently delivered to the merchants paying only a reasonable reward to those that saved and preserved them which is entitled salvage and by the common law if any persons other than the sheriff take any goods so cast on shore which are not legal wreck the owners might have a commission to inquire and find them out and compel them to make restitutiont and by statute    anne st   c    confirmed by   geo i c    in order to assist the distressed and prevent the scandalous illegal practices on some of our seacoasts too similar to those on the baltic it is enacted that all head officers and others of towns near the sea shall upon application made to them summon as many hands as are necessary and send them to the relief of any ship in distress on forfeiture of  00l and in case of assistance given salvage shall be paid by the owners to be assessed by three neighbouring justices all persons that secrete any goods shall forfeit their treble value and if they wilfully do any act whereby the ship is lost or destroyed      by making holes in her stealing her pumps or otherwise they are guilty of felony without benefit of clergy lastly by the statute    geo ii c    plundering any vessel either in distress or wrecked and whether any living creature be on board or not for whether wreck or otherwise it is clearly not the property of the populace such plundering i say or preventing the escape of any person that endeavours to save his life or wounding him with intent to destroy him or putting out false lights in order to bring any vessel into danger are all declared to be capital felonies in like manner as the destroying of trees steeples or other stated seamarks is punished by the statute   eliz c    with a forfeiture of  00l or outlawry moreover by the statute of george ii pilfering any goods cast ashore is declared to be petty larceny and many other salutary     regulations are made for the more effectually preserving ships of any nation in distressu   xii a twelfth branch of the royal revenue the right to mines has its original from the kings prerogative of coinage in order to supply him with materials and therefore those mines which are properly royal and to which the king is entitled when found are only those of silver and goldv by the old common law if gold or silver be found in mines of base metal according to the opinion of some the whole was a royal mine and belonged to the king though others held that it only did so if the quantity of gold or silver was of greater value than the quantity of base metalw but now by the statutes   w and m st   c  0 and   w and m c   this difference is made immaterial it being enacted that no mines of copper tin iron or lead shall be looked upon as royal mines notwithstanding gold or silver may be extracted from them in any quantities but that the king or      persons claiming royal mines under his authority may have the ore other than tin ore in the counties of devon and cornwall paying for the same a price stated in the act this was an extremely reasonable law for now private owners are not discouraged from working mines through a fear that they may be claimed as royal ones neither does the king depart from the just rights of his revenue since he may have all the precious metal contained in the ore paying no more for it than the value of the base metal which it is supposed to be to which base metal the landowner is by reason and law entitled xiii to the same original may in part be referred the revenue of treasuretrove derived from the french word trover to find called in latin thesaurus inventus which is where any money or coin gold silver plate or bullion is found hidden in the earth or other private place the owner thereof being unknown in which case the treasure belongs to the king but if he that hid it be known or afterwards found out the owner and not the king is entitled to itx   also if it be found in the sea or upon the earth it doth not belong to the king but the finder if no owner appearsy so that it seems it is the hiding and not the abandoning of it that gives the king a property bractonz defining it in the words of the civilians to be vetus depositio pecuniæ this difference clearly arises from the different intentions which the law implies in the owner a man that hides his treasure in a secret place evidently does not mean to relinquish his property but reserves a right of claiming it again when     he sees occasion and if he dies and the secret also dies with him the law gives it the king in part of his royal revenue but a man that scatters his treasure into the sea or upon the public surface of the earth is construed to have absolutely abandoned his property and returned it into the common stock without any intention of reclaiming it and therefore it belongs as in a state of nature to the first occupant or finder   unless the owner appear and assert his right which      then proves that the loss was by accident and not with an intent to renounce his property formerly all treasuretrove belonged to the findera as was also the rule of the civil lawb afterwards it was judged expedient for the purposes of the state and particularly for the coinage to allow part of what was so found to the king which part was assigned to be all hidden treasure such as is casually lost and unclaimed and also such as is designedly abandoned still remaining the right of the fortunate finder and that the prince shall be entitled to this hidden treasure is now grown to be according to grotiusc jus commune et quasi gentium for it is not only observed he adds in england but in germany france spain and denmark the finding of deposited treasure was much more frequent and the treasures themselves more considerable in the infancy of our constitution than at present when the romans and other inhabitants of the respective countries which composed their empire were driven out by the northern nations they concealed their money under ground with a view of resorting to it again when the heat of the irruption should be over and the invaders driven back to their deserts but as this never happened the treasures were never claimed and on the death of the owners the secret also died along with them the conquering generals being aware of the value of these hidden mines made it highly penal to secrete them from the public service in england therefore as among the feudistsd the punishment of such as concealed from the king the finding of hidden treasure was formerly no less than death but now it is only fine and imprisonmente xiv waifs bona waviata are goods stolen and waved or thrown away by the thief in his flight for fear of being apprehended these are given to the king by the law as a punishment upon the owner for not himself pursuing the felon and taking away his goods from himf and therefore      if the party robbed do his diligence immediately to follow and apprehend the thief which is called making fresh suit or do convict him afterwards or procure evidence to convict him he shall have his goods againg waved goods do also not belong to the king till seized by somebody for his use for if the party robbed can seize them first though at the distance of twenty years the king shall never have themh if the goods are hid by the thief or left anywhere by him so that he had them not about him when he fled and therefore did not throw them away in his flight these also are not bona waviata but the owner may have them again when he pleasesi the goods of a foreign merchant though stolen and thrown away in flight shall never be waifsj the reason whereof may be not only for the encouragement of trade but also because there is no wilful default in the foreign merchants not pursuing the thief he being generally a stranger to our laws our usages and our language   xv estrays are such valuable animals as are found wandering in any manor     or lordship and no man knoweth the owner of them in which case the law gives them to the king as the general owner and lord paramount of the soil in recompense for the damage which they may have done therein   and they now most commonly belong to the lord of the manor by special grant from the crown but in order to vest an absolute property in the king or his grantees they must be proclaimed in the church and two market towns next adjoining to the place where they are found and then if no man claims them after proclamation and a year and a day passed they belong to the king or his substitute without redemptionk even though the owner were a minor or under any other legal incapacityl a provision similar to which obtained in the old gothic constitution with regard to all things that were found which were to be thrice proclaimed primum coram comitibus et viatoribus obviis deinde in proxima      villa vel pago postremo coram ecclesia vel judicio and the space of a year was allowed for the owner to reclaim his propertym if the owner claims them within the year and day he must pay the charges of finding keeping and proclaiming themn   the king or lord has no property till the year and day passed for if a lord keepeth an estray threequarters of a year and within the year it strayeth again and another lord getteth it the first lord cannot take it againo any beasts may be estrays that are by nature tame or reclaimable and in which there is a valuable property as sheep oxen swine and horses which we in general call cattle and so fletap defines them pecus vagans quod nullus petit sequitur vel advocat for animals upon which the law sets no value as a dog or cat and animals feræ naturæ as a bear or wolf cannot be considered as estrays so swans may be estrays but not any other fowlq whence they are said to be royal fowl the reason of which distinction seems to be that cattle and swans being of a reclaimable nature the owners property in them is not lost merely by their temporary escape and they also from their intrinsic value are a sufficient pledge for the expense of the lord of the franchise in keeping them the year and day for he that takes an estray is bound so long as he keeps it to find it in provisions and preserve it from damager and may not use it by way of labour but is liable to an action for so doings yet he may milk a cow or the like for that tends to the preservation and is for the benefit of the animalt       besides the particular reasons before given why the king should have the several revenues of royal fish shipwrecks treasuretrove waifs and estrays there is also one general reason which holds for them all and that is because they are bona vacantia or goods in which no one else can claim a property and therefore by the law of nature they belonged to the first occupation or finder and so continued under the      imperial law but in settling the modern constitutions of most of the governments in europe it was thought proper to prevent that strife and contention which the mere title of occupancy is apt to create and continue and to provide for the support of public authority in a manner the least burdensome to individuals that these rights should be annexed to the supreme power by the positive laws of the state and so it came to pass that as bracton expresses itu hæc quæ nullius in bonis sunt et olim fuerunt inventoris de jure naturali jam efficiuntur principis de jure gentiumv   xvi the next branch of the kings ordinary revenue consists in forfeitures of lands and goods for offences bona confiscata as they are called by the civilians because they belonged to the fiscus or imperial treasury or as our lawyers term them forisfacta that is such whereof the property is gone away or departed from the owner the true reason and only substantial ground of any forfeiture for crimes consists in this that all property is derived from society being one of those civil rights which are conferred upon individuals in exchange for that degree of natural freedom which every man must sacrifice when he enters into social communities if therefore a member of any national community violates the fundamental contract of his association by transgressing the municipal law he forfeits his right to such privileges as he claims by that contract and the state may very justly resume that portion of property or any part of it which the laws have before assigned him hence in every offence of an atrocious kind the laws of england have exacted a total confiscation     of the movables or personal estate and in many cases a perpetual in others only a temporary loss of the offenders immovables or landed property and have vested them both in the king who is the person supposed to be offended being the one visible magistrate in whom the majesty of the public resides the particulars of these forfeitures will be more properly recited when we treat of crimes and misdemesnors i therefore only mention them here for   00 the sake of regularity as a part of the census regalis and shall postpone for the present the further consideration of all forfeitures excepting one species only which arises from the misfortune rather than the crime of the owner and is called a deodand by this is meant whatever personal chattel is the immediate occasion of the death of any reasonable creature which is forfeited to the king to be applied to pious uses and distributed in alms by his high almonerw though formerly destined to a more superstitious purpose it seems to have been originally designed in the blind days of popery as an expiation for the souls of such as were snatched away by sudden death and for that purpose ought properly to have been given to holy churchx in the same manner as the apparel of a stranger who was found dead was applied to purchase masses for the good of his soul and this may account for that rule of law that no deodand is due where an infant under the age of discretion is killed by a fall from a cart or horse or the like not being in motiony whereas if an adult person falls from thence and is killed the thing is certainly forfeited for the reason given by sir matthew hale seems to be very inadequate viz because an infant is not able to take care of himself for why should the owner save his forfeiture on account of the imbecility of the child which ought rather to have made him more cautious to prevent any accident or mischief the true ground of this rule seems rather to have been that the child by reason of its want of discretion was presumed incapable of actual sin and therefore needed no deodand to purchase propitiatory masses but every adult who died in actual sin stood in need of such atonement according to the humane superstition of the founders of the english law thus stands the law if a person be killed by a fall from a thing standing still but if a horse or ox or other animal   0  of his own motion kill as well an infant as an adult or if a cart run over him they shall in either case be forfeited as deodandsz which is grounded upon this additional reason that such misfortunes are in part owing to the negligence of the owner and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture a like punishment is in like cases inflicted by the mosaical lawa if an ox gore a man that he die the ox shall be stoned and his flesh shall not be eaten and among the atheniansb whatever was the cause of a mans death by falling upon him was exterminated or cast out of the dominions of the republic   where a thing not in motion is the occasion of a mans death that part only which is the immediate cause is forfeited as if a man be climbing up the wheel of a cart and is killed by falling from it the wheel alone is a deodandc but wherever the thing is in motion not only that part which immediately gives the wound as the wheel which runs over his body but all things which move with it and help to make  0  the wound more dangerous as the cart and loading which increase the pressure of the wheel are forfeitedd it matters not whether the owner were concerned in the killing or not for if a man kills another with my sword the sword is forfeitede as an accursed thingf and therefore in all indictments for homicide the instrument of death and the value are presented and found by the grand jury as that the stroke was given by a certain penknife value sixpence that the king or his grantee may claim the deodand for it is no deodand unless it be presented as such by a jury of twelve meng no deodands are due for accidents happening upon the high sea that being out of the jurisdiction of the common law but if a   0  man falls from a boat or ship in fresh water and is drowned it hath been said that the vessel and cargo are in strictness of law a deodandh but juries have of late very frequently taken upon themselves to mitigate these forfeitures by finding only some trifling thing or part of an entire thing to have been the occasion of the death and in such cases although the finding by the jury be hardly warrantable by law the court of kings bench hath generally refused to interfere on behalf of the lord of the franchise to assist so unequitable a claimi 0 deodands and forfeitures in general as well as wrecks treasuretrove royal fish mines waifs and estrays may be granted by the king to particular subjects as a royal franchise and indeed they are for the most part granted out to the lords of manors or other liberties to the perversion of their original design   xvii another branch of the kings ordinary revenue arises from escheats of lands which happen upon the defect of heirs to succeed to the inheritance whereupon they in general revert to and vest in the king who is esteemed in the eye of the law the original proprietor of all the lands in the kingdom but the discussion of this topic more properly belongs to the second book of these commentaries wherein we shall particularly consider the manner in which lands may be acquired or lost by escheat xviii i proceed therefore to the eighteenth and last branch of the kings ordinary revenue which consists in the custody of idiots from whence we shall be naturally led to consider also the custody of lunatics an idiot or natural fool is one that hath had no understanding from his nativity and therefore is by law presumed never likely to attain any for which reason the custody of   0  him and of his lands was formerly vested in the lord of the feej and therefore still by special custom in some manors the lord shall have the ordering of idiot and lunatic copyholdersk  0  but by reason of the manifold abuses of this power by subjects it was at last provided by common consent that it should be given to the king as the general conservator of his people in order to prevent the idiot from wasting his estate and reducing himself and his heirs to poverty and distressl this fiscal prerogative of the king is declared in parliament by statute    edw ii c   which directs in affirmance of the common lawm that the king shall have ward of the lands of natural fools taking the profits without waste or destruction and shall find them necessaries and after the death of such idiots he shall render the estate to the heirs in order to prevent such idiots from alienating their lands and their heirs from being disinherited   by the old common law there is a writ de idiota inquirendo to inquire wheth a man be an idiot or notn which must be tried by a jury of twelve men and if they find him purus idiota the profits of his lands and the custody of his person may be granted by the king to some subject who has interest enough to obtain themo this branch of the revenue hath been long considered as a hardship upon private families and so long ago as in the   jac i it was under the consideration of parliament to vest this custody in the relations of the party and to settle an equivalent on the crown in lieu of it it being then proposed to share the same fate with the slavery of the feodal tenures which has been since abolishedp yet few instances can be given of the oppressive exertion of it since it seldom happens that a jury finds a man an idiot a nativitate but only non compos mentis from some particular time which has an operation very different in point of law   0  a man is not an idiotq if he hath any glimmering of reason so that he can tell his parents his age or the like common matters but a man who is born deaf dumb and blind is looked upon by the law as in the same state with an idiotr he being supposed incapable of any understanding as wanting all those senses which furnish the human mind with ideas   a lunatic or non compos mentis is one who hath had understanding but by disease grief or other accident hath lost the use of his reasons a lunatic is indeed properly one that hath lucid intervals sometimes enjoying his senses and sometimes not and that frequently depending upon the change of the moon   but under the general name of non compos mentis which sir edward coke says is the most legal namet are comprised not only lunatics but persons  0  under frenzies or who lose their intellects by disease those that grow deaf dumb and blind not being born so or such in short as are judged by the court of chancery incapable of conducting their own affairs to these also as well as idiots the king is guardian but to a very different purpose for the law always imagines that these accidental misfortunes may be removed and therefore only constitutes the crown a trustee for the unfortunate persons to protect their property and to account to them for all profits received if they recover or after their decease to their representatives and therefore it is declared by the statute    edw ii c  0 that the king shall provide for the custody and sustentation of lunatics and preserve their lands and the profits of them for their use when they come to their right mind and the king shall take nothing to his own use and if the parties die in such estate the residue shall be distributed for their souls by the advice of the ordinary and of course by the subsequent amendments of the law of administration shall now go to their executors or administrators   0  on the first attack of lunacy or other occasional insanity while there may be hope of a speedy restitution of reason it is usual to confine the unhappy objects in private custody under the direction of their nearest friends and relations and the legislature to prevent all abuses incident to such private custody hath thought proper to interpose its authority by statute    geo iii c    continued by    geo iii c    for regulating private madhouses   but when the disorder is grown permanent and the circumstances of the party will bear such additional expense it is proper to apply to the royal authority to warrant a lasting confinement the method of proving a person non compos is very similar to that of proving him an idiot the lord chancellor to whom by special authority from the king the custody of idiots and lunatics is intrustedu upon petition or information grants a commission in nature of the writ de idiota inquirendo to inquire into the partys state of mind and if he be found non compos he usually commits the care of his person with a suitable allowance for his maintenance to some friend who is then called his committee however to prevent sinister practices the next heir is seldom permitted to be this committee of the person because it is his interest that the party should die   but it hath been said there lies not the same objection against his next of kin provided he be not his heir for it is his interest to preserve the lunatics life in order to increase the personal estate by savings which he or his family may hereafter be entitled to enjoyv the heir is generally made the manager or committee of the estate it being clearly his interest by good management to keep it in condition accountable however to the court of chancery and to the non compos himself if he recovers or otherwise to his administrators in this case of idiots and lunatics the civil law agrees with ours by assigning them tutors to protect their persons and curators to manage their estates but  0  in another instance the roman law goes much beyond the english for if a man by notorious prodigality was in danger of wasting his estate he was looked upon as non compos and committed to the care of curators or tutors by the prætorw and by the laws of solon such prodigals were branded with perpetual infamyx but with us when a man on an inquest of idiocy hath been   0  returned an unthrift and not an idioty no further proceedings have been had and the propriety of the practice itself seems to be very questionable it was doubtless an excellent method of benefiting the individual and of preserving estates in families but it hardly seems calculated for the genius of a free nation who claim and exercise the liberty of using their own property as they please sic utere tuo ut alienum non lædas is the only restriction our laws have given with regard to economical prudence and the frequent circulation and transfer of lands and other property which cannot be effected without extravagance somewhere are perhaps not a little conducive towards keeping our mixed constitution in its due health and vigour this may suffice for a short view of the kings ordinary revenue or the proper patrimony of the crown which was very large formerly and capable of being increased to a magnitude truly formidable for there are very few estates in the kingdom that have not at some period or other since the norman conquest been vested in the hands of the king by forfeiture escheat or otherwise but fortunately for the liberty of the subject this hereditary landed revenue by a series of improvident management is sunk almost to nothing and the casual profits arising from the other branches of the census regalis are likewise almost all of them alienated from the crown in order to supply the deficiencies of which we are now obliged to have recourse to new methods of raising money unknown to our early ancestors which methods constitute the kings extraordinary revenue for the public patrimony being got into the hands of private subjects it is but reasonable that private contributions should supply the public service which though it may perhaps fall harder upon some individuals whose ancestors have had no share in the general plunder than upon others yet taking the nation throughout it amounts to nearly the same provided the gain by the extraordinary should appear to be no greater than the loss by the ordinary revenue and perhaps if every   0  gentleman in the kingdom was to be stripped of such of his lands as were formerly the property of the crown was to be again subject to the inconveniences of purveyances and preemption the oppression of forest laws and the slavery of feodal tenures and was to resign into the kings hands all his royal franchises of waifs wrecks estrays treasuretrove mines deodands forfeitures and the like he would find himself a greater loser than by paying his quota to such taxes as are necessary to the support of government the thing therefore to be wished and aimed at in a land of liberty is by no means the total abolition of taxes which would draw after it very pernicious consequences and the very supposition of which is the height of political absurdity for as the true idea of government and magistracy will be found to consist in this that some few men are deputed by many others to preside over public affairs so that individuals may the better be enabled to attend their private concerns it is necessary that those individuals should be bound to contribute a portion of their private gains in order to support that government and reward that magistracy which protects them in the enjoyment of their respective properties but the things to be aimed at are wisdom and moderation not only in granting but also in the method of raising the necessary supplies by contriving to do both in such a manner as may be most conducive to the national welfare and at the same time most consistent with economy and the liberty of the subject who when properly taxed contributes only as was before observedz some part of his property in order to enjoy the rest  0  these extraordinary grants are usually called by the synonymous names of aids subsidies and supplies and are granted as we have formerly seena by the commons of great britain in parliament assembled who when they have voted a supply to his majesty and settled the quantum of that supply usually resolve themselves into what is called a committee of ways and means to consider the ways and means of raising the supply so voted and in this committee every   0  member though it is looked upon as the peculiar province of the chancellor of the exchequer may propose such scheme of taxation as he thinks will be least detrimental to the public the resolutions of this committee when approved by a vote of the house are in general esteemed to be as it were final and conclusive for though the supply cannot be actually raised upon the subject till directed by an act of the whole parliament yet no moneyed man will scruple to advance to the government any quantity of ready cash on the credit of a bare vote of the house of commons though no law be yet passed to establish it the taxes which are raised upon the subject are either annual or perpetual the usual annual taxes are those upon land and malt     the landtax in its modern shape has superseded all the former methods of rating either property or persons in respect of their property whether by tenths or fifteenths subsidies on land hydages scutages or talliages a short explication of which will however greatly assist us in understanding our ancient laws and history tenths and fifteenthsb were temporary aids issuing out of personal property and granted to the king by parliament they were formerly the real tenth or fifteenth part of all the movables belonging to the subject when such movables or personal estates were a very different and a much less considerable thing than what they usually are at this day tenths are said to have been first granted under henry the second who took advantage of the fashionable zeal for croisades to introduce this new taxation in order to defray the expense of a pious expedition to palestine which he really or seemingly had projected against saladine emperor of the saracens whence it was originally denominated the saladine tenthc but afterwards fifteenths were more usually granted than tenths originally the amount of these taxes was   0  uncertain being levied by assessments new made at every fresh grant of the commons a commission for which is preserved by matthew parisd but it was at length reduced to a certainty in the eighth year of edward iii when by virtue of the kings commission new taxations were made of every township borough and city in the kingdom and recorded in the exchequer which rate was at the time the fifteenth part of the value of every township the whole amounting to about   000l and therefore it still kept up the name of a fifteenth when by the alteration of the value of money and the increase of personal property things came to be in a very different situation so that when of later years the commons granted the king a fifteenth every parish in england  0  immediately knew their proportion of it that is the same identical sum that was assessed by the same aid in the eighth of edward iii and then raised it by a rate among themselves and returned it into the royal exchequer the other ancient levies were in the nature of a modern landtax for we may trace up the original of that charge as high as to the introduction of our military tenurese when every tenant of a knights fee was bound if called upon to attend the king in his army for forty days in every year but this personal attendance growing troublesome in many respects the tenants found means of compounding it by first sending others in their stead and in process of time by making a pecuniary satisfaction to the crown in lieu of it this pecuniary satisfaction at last came to be levied by assessments at so much for every knights fee under the name of scutages which appear to have been levied for the first time in the fifth year of henry the second on account of his expedition to toulouse and were then i apprehend mere arbitrary compositions as the king and the subject could agree but this precedent being afterwards abused into a means of oppression in levying scutages on the landholders by the royal authority only whenever our kings went to war in    0 order to hire mercenary troops and pay their contingent expenses it became thereupon a matter of national complaint and king john was obliged to promise in his magna cartaf that no scutage should be imposed without the consent of the common council of the realm this clause was indeed omitted in the charters of henry iii whereg we only find it stipulated that scutages should be taken as they were used to be in the time of king henry the second yet afterwards by a variety of statutes under edward i and his grandsonh it was provided that the king shall not take any aids or tasks any talliage or tax but by the common assent of the great men and commons in parliament of the same nature with scutages upon knights fees were the assessments of hydage upon all other lands and of talliage upon cities and burghsi but they all gradually fell into disuse upon the introduction of subsidies about the time of king richard ii and king henry iv these were a tax not immediately imposed upon property but upon persons in respect of their reputed estates after the nominal rate of  s in the pound for lands and  s  d for goods and for those of aliens in a double proportion but this assessment was also made according to an ancient valuation wherein the computation was so very moderate and the rental of the kingdom was supposed to be so exceeding low that one subsidy of this sort did not according to sir edward cokej amount to more than  0000l whereas a modern landtax at the same rate produces two millions it was anciently the rule never to grant more than one subsidy and two fifteenths at a time but this rule was broken through for the first time on a very pressing occasion the spanish invasion in      when the parliament gave queen elizabeth two subsidies and four fifteenths afterwards as money sunk in value more subsidies were given and we have an instance in the first parliament of    0 of the kings desiring twelve subsidies of the      commons to be levied in three years which was looked upon as a startling proposal though lord clarendon saysk that the speaker serjeant glanville made it manifest to the house how very inconsiderable a sum twelve subsidies amounted to by telling them he had computed what he was to pay for them himself and when he named the sum he being known to be possessed of a great estate it seemed not worth any further deliberation and indeed upon calculation we shall find that the total amount of these twelve subsidies to be raised in three years is less than what is now raised in one year by a landtax of two shillings in the pound the grant of scutages talliages or subsidies by the commons did not extend to spiritual preferments those being usually taxed at the same time by the clergy themselves in convocation which grants of the clergy were confirmed in parliament otherwise they were illegal and not binding as the same noble     writer observes of the subsidies granted by the convocation which continued sitting after the dissolution of the first parliament in    0 a subsidy granted by the clergy was after the rate of  s in the pound according to the valuation of their livings in the kings books and amounted as sir edward coke tells usl to about  000l while this custom continued convocations were wont to sit as frequently as parliaments but the last subsidies thus given by the clergy were those confirmed by statute    car ii cap  0 since which another method of taxation has generally prevailed which takes in the clergy as well as the laity in recompense for which the beneficed clergy have from that period been allowed to vote at the election of knights of the shirem and thence forward also the practice of giving ecclesiastical subsidies hath fallen into total disuse   the lay subsidy was usually raised by commissioners appointed by the crown or the great officers of state and therefore in the beginning of the civil wars between charles i and      his parliament the latter having no other sufficient revenue to support themselves and their measures introduced the practice of laying weekly and monthly assessmentsn of a specific sum upon the several counties of the kingdom to be levied by a pound rate on lands and personal estates which were occasionally continued during the whole usurpation sometimes at the rate of   0000l a month sometimes at inferior rateso after the restoration the ancient method of granting subsidies instead of such monthly assessments was twice and twice only renewed viz in      when four subsidies were granted by the temporalty and four by the clergy and in    0 when  00000l was raised by way of subsidy which was the last time of raising supplies in that manner   for the monthly assessments being now established by custom being raised by commissioners named by parliament and producing a more certain revenue from that time forwards we hear no more of subsidies but occasional assessments were granted as the national emergencies required these periodical assessments the subsidies which preceded them and the more ancient scutage hydage and talliage were to all intents and purposes a landtax and the assessments were sometimes expressly called sop yet a popular opinion has prevailed that the landtax was first introduced in the reign of king william iii because in the year      a new assessment or valuation of estates was made throughout the kingdom which though by no means a perfect one had this effect that a supply of  00000l was equal to  s in the pound of the value of the estates given in and according to this enhanced valuation from the year      to the present a period of above fourscore years the landtax has continued an annual charge upon the subject above half the time at  s in the pound sometimes at      s sometimes at  s twiceq at  s but without any total intermission the medium has been  s  d in the pound being equivalent with twentythree ancient subsidies and amounting annually      to more than a million and a half of money the method of raising it is by charging a particular sum upon each county according to the valuation given in ad      and this sum is assessed and raised upon individuals their personal estates as well as real being liable thereto by commissioners appointed in the act being the principal landholders of the county and their officers ii the other annual tax is the malttax which is a sum of   0000l raised every year by parliament ever since      by a duty of  d in the bushel on malt and a proportionable sum on certain liquors such as cider and perry which might otherwise prevent the consumption of malt this is under the management of the commissioners of the excise and is indeed itself no other than an annual excise the nature of which species of taxation i shall presently explain only premising at present that in the year    0 an additional perpetual excise of  d per bushel was laid upon malt to the produce of which a duty of    per cent or nearly an additional halfpenny per bushel was added in      0 and that in      a proportionable excise was laid upon eider and perry but so newmodelled in      as scarce to be worth collecting   the perpetual taxes are i the customs or the duties toll tribute or tariff payable upon merchandise exported and imported the considerations upon which this revenue or the more ancient part of it which arose only from exports was invested in the king were said to be twor   because he gave the subject leave to depart the kingdom and to carry his goods along with him   because the king was bound of common right to maintain and keep up the ports and havens and to protect the merchants from pirates some have imagined they are called with us customs because they were the inheritance of the king by immemorial usage and the common law and not granted him by any statutes but sir edward coke hath clearly shownt that the kings first claim to them was by      grant of parliament   edw i though the record thereof is not now extant   and indeed this is in express words confessed by statute        edw i c   wherein the king promises to take no customs from merchants without the common assent of the realm saving to us and our heirs the customs on wool skins and leather formerly granted to us by the commonalty aforesaid these were formerly called the hereditary customs of the crown and were due on the exportation only of the said three commodities and of none other which were styled the staple commodities of the kingdom because they were obliged to be brought to those ports where the kings staple was established in order to be there first rated and then exportedu they were denominated in the barbarous latin of our ancient records custumav not consuetudines which is the language of our law whenever it means merely usages the duties on wool sheepskins or woolfells and leather exported were called custuma antiqua sive magna and were payable by every merchant as well native as stranger with this difference that merchant strangers paid an additional toll viz half as much again as was paid by natives the custuma parva et nova were an impost of  d in the pound due from merchant strangers only for all commodities as well imported as exported which was usually called the aliens duty and was first granted in    edw iw but these ancient hereditary customs especially those on wool and woolfells came to be of little account when the nation became sensible of the advantage of a home manufacture and prohibited the exportation of wool by statute    edw iii c   there is also another very ancient hereditary duty belonging to the crown called the prisage or butlerage of wines which is considerably older than the customs being taken notice of in the great roll of the exchequer   ric i still extantx prisage was a right of taking two tons of wine from      every ship english or foreign importing into england twenty tons or more one before and one behind the mast which by charter of edward i was exchanged into a duty of  s for every ton imported by merchant strangers and called butlerage because paid to the kings butlery other customs payable upon exports and imports were distinguished into subsidies tonnage poundage and other imposts subsidies were such as were imposed by parliament upon any of the staple commodities before mentioned over and above the custuma antiqua et magna tonnage was a duty upon all wines imported over and above the prisage and butlerage aforesaid poundage was a duty imposed ad valorem at the rate of   d in the pound on all other merchandise whatsoever and the other imposts were such as were occasionally laid on by parliament as circumstances and times requiredz these distinctions are now in a manner forgotten except by the officers immediately concerned in this department their produce being in effect all blended together under the one denomination of the customs by these we understand at present a duty or subsidy paid by the merchant at the quay upon all imported as well as exported commodities by authority of parliament unless where for particular national reasons certain rewards bounties or drawbacks are allowed for particular exports or imports those of tonnage and poundage in particular were at first granted as the old statutes and particularly   eliz c  0 express it for the defence of the realm and the keeping and safeguard of the seas and for the intercourse of merchandise safely to come into and pass out of the same they were at first usually granted only for a stated term of years as for two years in   ric     iia but in henry the sixths time they were granted him for life by a statute in the thirtyfirst year of his reign and again to edward iv for the term of his life also since which time they were regularly granted to all his successors for life sometimes at the first sometimes at other subsequent parliaments till the reign of charles the      first when as the noble historian expresses itb his ministers were not sufficiently solicitous for a renewal of this legal grant and yet these imposts were imprudently and unconstitutionally levied and taken without consent of parliament for fifteen years together which was one of the causes of those unhappy discontents justifiable at first in too many instances but which degenerated at last into causeless rebellion   and murder for as in every other so in this particular case the king previous to the commencement of hostilities gave the nation ample satisfaction for the errors of his former conduct by passing an actc whereby he renounced all power in the crown of levying the duty of tonnage and poundage without the express consent of parliament and also all power of imposition upon any merchandises whatever upon the restoration this duty was granted to king charles the second for life and so it was to his two immediate successors but now by three several statutes   anne c     geo i c    and   geo i c   it is made perpetual and mortgaged for the debt of the public the customs thus imposed by parliament are chiefly contained in two books of rates set forth by parliamentary authorityd one signed by sir harbottle grimston speaker of the house of commons in charles the seconds time and the other an additional one signed by sir spenser compton speaker in the reign of george the first to which also subsequent additions have been made   aliens pay a larger proportion than natural subjects which is what     is now generally understood by the aliens duty to be exempted from which is one principal cause of the frequent applications to parliaments for acts of naturalization   these customs are then we see a tax immediately paid by the merchant although ultimately by the consumer and yet these are the duties felt least by the people and if prudently managed the people hardly consider that they pay them at all for the merchant is easy being sensible he does not pay them for himself and the consumer who really      pays them confounds them with the price of the commodity in the same manner as tacitus observes that the emperor nero gained the reputation of abolishing the tax upon the sale of slaves though he only transferred it from the buyer to the seller so that it was as he expresses it remissum magis specie quam vi quia cum venditor pendere juberetur in partem pretii emptoribus accrescebate but this inconvenience attends it on the other hand that these imposts if too heavy are a check and cramp upon trade and especially when the value of the commodity bears little or no proportion to the quantity of the duty imposed this in consequence gives rise also to smuggling which then becomes a very lucrative employment and its natural and most reasonable punishment viz confiscation of the commodity is in such cases quite ineffectual the intrinsic value of the goods which is all that the smuggler has paid and therefore all that he can lose     being very inconsiderable when compared with his prospect of advantage in evading the duty recourse must therefore be had to extraordinary punishments to prevent it perhaps even to capital ones which destroys all proportion of punishmentf and puts murderers upon an equal footing with such as are really guilty of no natural but merely a positive offence there is also another ill consequence attending high imposts on merchandise not frequently considered but indisputably certain that the earlier any tax is laid on a commodity the heavier it falls upon the consumer in the end for every trader through whose hands it passes must have a profit not only upon the raw material and his own labour and time in preparing it but also upon the very tax itself which he advances to the government otherwise he loses the use and interest of the money which he so advances to instance in the article of foreign paper the merchant pays a duty upon importation which he does not receive again till he sells the commodity perhaps at the end of three months he is therefore equally entitled to a profit upon that duty      which he pays at the customhouse as to a profit upon the original price which he pays to the manufacturer abroad and considers it accordingly in the price he demands of the stationer when the stationer sells it again he requires a profit of the printer or bookseller upon the whole sum advanced by him to the merchant and the bookseller does not forget to charge the full proportion to the student or ultimate consumer who therefore does not only pay the original duty but the profits of these three intermediate traders who have successively advanced it for him this might be carried much further in any mechanical or more complicated branch of trade   ii directly opposite in its nature to this is the excise duty which is an inland imposition paid sometimes upon the consumption of the commodity or frequently upon the retail sale which is the last stage before the consumption this is doubtless impartially speaking the most economical way of taxing the subject the charges of levying collecting and managing the excise duties being considerably less in proportion than in other branches of the revenue   it also renders the commodity cheaper to the consumer than charging it with customs to the same amount would do for the reason just now given because generally paid in a much later stage of it but at the same time the rigour and arbitrary proceedings of excise laws seem hardly compatible with the temper of a free nation for the frauds that might be committed in this branch of the revenue unless a strict watch is kept make it necessary wherever it is established to give the officers the power of entering and searching the houses of such as deal in excisable commodities at any hour of the day and in many cases of the night likewise and the proceedings in case of transgressions are so summary and sudden that a man may be convicted in two days time in the penalty of many thousand pounds by two commissioners or justices of the peace to the total exclusion of the trial by jury and disregard of the common     law   for which reason though lord      clarendon tells usg that to his knowledge the earl of bedford who was made lord treasurer by king charles the first to oblige his parliament intended to have set up the excise in england yet it never made a part of that unfortunate princes revenue being first introduced on the model of the dutch prototype by the parliament itself after its rupture with the crown yet such was the opinion of its general unpopularity that when in      aspersions were cast by malignant persons upon the house of commons that they intended to introduce excises the house for its vindication therein did declare that these rumours were false and scandalous and that their authors should be apprehended and brought to condign punishmenth however its originali establishment was in      and its progress was gradual being at first laid upon those persons and commodities where it was supposed the hardship would be least perceivable viz the makers or vendors of beer ale cider and perryk and the royalists at oxford soon followed the example of their brethren at westminster by imposing a similar duty both sides protesting that it should be continued no longer than to the end of the war and then be utterly abolishedl but the parliament at westminster soon after imposed it on flesh wine tobacco sugar and such a multitude of other commodities that it might fairly be denominated general in pursuance of the plan laid down by mr pymme who seems to have been the father of the excise in his letter to sir john hothamm signifying that they had proceeded in the excise to many particulars and intended to go on further but that it    0 would be necessary to use the people to it by little and little and afterwards when the nation had been accustomed to it for a series of years the succeeding champions of liberty boldly and openly declared the impost of excise to be the most easy and indifferent that could be laid upon the peoplen and accordingly continued it during the whole usurpation upon king charless return it having then been long established and its produce well known some part of it was given to the crown in    car ii by way of purchase as was before observed for the feodal tenures and other oppressive parts of the hereditary revenue but from its first original to the present time its very name has been odious to the people of england it has nevertheless been imposed on abundance of other commodities in the reign of king william iii and every succeeding prince to support the enormous expenses occasioned by our wars on the continent thus brandies and other spirits are now excised at the distillery printed silks and linens at the printers starch and hairpowder at the makers gold and silver wire at the wiredrawers plate in the hands of the vendor who pays yearly for a license to sell it lands and goods sold by auction for which a poundrate is payable by the auctioneer who also is charged with an annual duty for his license and coaches and other wheelcarriages for which the occupier is excised though not with the same circumstances of arbitrary strictness as in most of the other instances to these we may add coffee and tea   0 chocolate and cocoapaste for which the duty is paid by the retailer all artificial wines commonly called sweets paper and pasteboard first when made and again if stained or printed malt as before mentioned vinegars and the manufacture of glass for all which the duty is paid by the manufacturer hops for which the person that gathers them is answerable candles and soap which are paid for at the makers malt liquors brewed for sale which are excised at the brewery cider and perry at the vendors and leather and skins at the tanners—a list which no friend to his country would wish to see further increased      iii i proceed therefore to a third duty namely that upon salt which is another distinct branch of his majestys extraordinary revenue and consists in an excise of  s  d per bushel imposed upon all salt by several statutes of king william and other subsequent reigns this is not generally called an excise because under the management of different commissioners but the commissioners of the salt duties have by statute   anne c    the same powers and must observe the same regulations as those of other excises this tax had usually been only temporary but by statute    geo ii c   was made perpetual iv another very considerable branch of the revenue is levied with greater cheerfulness as instead of being a burden it is a manifest advantage to the public i mean the postoffice or duty for the carriage of letters as we have traced the original of the excise to the parliament of      so it is but justice to observe that this useful invention owes its first legislative establishment to the same assembly it is true there existed postmasters in much earlier times but i apprehend their business was confined to the furnishing of posthorses to persons who were desirous to travel expeditiously and to the despatching of extraordinary pacquets upon special occasions king james i originally erected a postoffice under the control of one matthew de quester or de lequester for the conveyance of letters to and from foreign parts which office was afterwards claimed by lord stanhopeo but was confirmed and continued to william frizell and thomas witherings by king charles i ad      for the better accommodation of the english merchantsp in      the same prince erected a letteroffice for england and scotland under the direction of the same thomas witherings and settled certain rates of postageq but this extended only to a few of the principal roads the times of carriage were uncertain and the postmasters on each road were required to furnish the mail with horses at the rate of  ½d a mile      witherings was superseded for abuses in the exertion of both his offices in    0 and they were sequestered into the hands of philip burlamachy to be exercised under the care and oversight of the kings principal secretary of stater on the breaking out of the civil war great confusions and interruptions were necessarily occasioned in the conduct of the letteroffice and about that time the outline of the present more extended and regular plan seems to have been conceived by mr edmond prideaux who was appointed attorneygeneral to the commonwealth after the murder of king charles he was chairman of a committee in      for considering what rates should be set upon inland letterss and afterwards appointed postmaster by an ordinance of both the housest in the execution of which office he first established a weekly conveyance of letters into all parts of the nationu thereby saving to the public the charge of maintaining postmasters to the amount of  000l per annum and his own emoluments being probably very considerable the common council of london endeavoured to erect another postoffice in opposition to his till checked by a resolution of the house of commonsw declaring that the office of postmaster is and ought to be in the sole power and disposal of the parliament this office was afterwards farmed by one manley in     x but in      a regular postoffice     was erected by the authority of the protector and his parliament   upon nearly the same model as has been ever since adopted and with the same rates of postage as continued till the reign of queen anney after the restoration a similar office with some improvements was established by statute    car ii c    but the rates of letters were altered and some further regulations added by the statutes   anne c  0   geo i c       geo ii c      geo iii c    and   geo iii c  0 and penalties were enacted in order to confine the carriage of letters to the public office only except in some few cases a provision which is absolutely necessary for nothing but      an exclusive right can support an office of this sort many rival independent offices would only serve to ruin one another the privilege of letters coming free of postage to and from members of parliament was claimed by the house of commons in    0 when the first legal settlement of the present postoffice was madez but afterwards droppeda upon a private assurance from the crown that this privilege should be allowed the membersb 0 and accordingly a warrant was constantly issued to the postmastergeneralc directing the allowance thereof to the extent of two ounces in weight till at length it was expressly confirmed by statute   geo iii c    which adds many new regulations rendered necessary by the great abuses crept into the practice of franking   whereby the annual     amount of franked letters had gradually increased from    00l in the year      to   0 00l in the year     d there cannot be devised a more eligible method than this of raising money upon the subject for therein both the government and the people find a mutual benefit the government acquires a large revenue and the people do their business with greater ease expedition and cheapness than they would be able to do if no such tax and of course no such office existed   v a fifth branch of the perpetual revenue consists in the stamp duties which are a tax imposed upon all parchment and paper whereon any legal proceedings or private instruments of almost any nature whatsoever are written and also upon licenses for retailing wines letting horses to hire and for certain other purposes and upon all almanacs newspapers advertisements cards dice and pamphlets containing less than six sheets of paper these imposts are very various according to the nature of the thing stamped rising gradually from a penny to ten pounds this is also a tax which though in some instances it may be heavily felt by greatly increasing the expense of all mercantile as well as legal proceedings yet if moderately imposed is of service to the public in general by authenticating      instruments and rendering it much more difficult than formerly to forge deeds of any standing since as the officers of this branch of the revenue vary their stamps frequently by marks perceptible to none but themselves a man that would forge a deed of king williams time must know and be able to counterfeit the stamp of that date also in france and some other countries the duty is laid on the contract itself not on the instrument in which it is contained as with us too besides the stamps on the indentures a tax is laid by statute   anne c   of  d in the pound upon every apprenticefee if it be  0l or under and  s in the pound if it be a greater sum but this tends to draw the subject into a thousand nice disquisitions and disputes concerning the nature of his contract and whether taxable or not in which the farmers of the revenue are sure to have the advantagee   our general method answers the purposes of the state as well     and consults the ease of the subject much better the first institution of the stamp duties was by statute      w and m c    and they have since in many instances been increased to ten times their original amount vi a sixth branch is the duty upon houses and windows as early as the conquest mention is made in domesday book of fumage or fuage vulgarly called smokefarthings which were paid by custom to the king for every chimney in the house and we read that edward the black prince soon after his successes in france in imitation of the english custom imposed a tax of a florin upon every hearth in his french dominionsf but the first parliamentary establishment of it in england was by statute        car ii c  0 whereby an hereditary revenue of  s for every hearth in all houses paying to church and poor was granted to the king forever and by subsequent statutes for the more regular assessment of this tax the constable and two other substantial inhabitants of the parish to be appointed yearly or the surveyor appointed by the crown together with such constable or other public officer were once in every      year empowered to view the inside of every house in the parish but upon the revolution by statute   w and m st   c  0 hearthmoney was declared to be not only a great oppression to the poorer sort but a badge of slavery upon the whole people exposing every mans house to be entered into and searched at pleasure by persons unknown to him and therefore to erect a lasting monument of their majesties goodness in every house in the kingdom the duty of hearthmoney was taken away and abolished this monument of goodness remains among us to this day but the prospect of it was somewhat darkened when in six years afterwards by statute   w iii c    a tax was laid upon all houses except cottages of  s now advanced to  s per annum and a tax also upon all windows if they exceeded nine in such house which rates have been from time to timeg varied being now extended to all windows exceeding six and power is given to surveyors appointed by the crown to inspect the outside of houses and also to pass through any house two days in the year into any court or yard to inspect the windows there a new duty from  d to  s in the pound was also imposed by statutes    geo iii c    and    geo iii c    on every dwellinghouse inhabited together with the offices and gardens therewith occupied which duty as well as the former is under the direction of the commissioners of the landtax vii the seventh branch of the extraordinary perpetual revenue is a duty of   s per annum for every male servant retained or employed in the several capacities specifically mentioned in the act of parliament and which almost amount to a universality except such as are employed in husbandry trade or manufactures this was imposed by statute    geo iii c    amended by    geo iii c    and is under the management of the commissioners of the land and window tax   viii an eighth branch is the duty arising from licenses to hackney coaches and chairs in london and the parts adjacent in      two hundred hackney coaches were allowed within london westminster and six miles round under the direction of the court of aldermenh by statute        car ii c   four hundred were licensed and the money arising thereby was applied to repairing the streetsi this number was increased to seven hundred by statute   w and m c    and the duties vested in the crown and by statute   anne     c    and other subsequent statutes for their governmentj there are now a thousand licensed coaches and four hundred chairs this revenue is governed by commissioners of its own and      is in truth a benefit to the subject as the expense of it is felt by no individual and its necessary regulations have established a competent jurisdiction whereby a very refractory race of men may be kept in some tolerable order ix the ninth and last branch of the kings extraordinary perpetual revenue is the duty upon offices and pensions consisting in an annual payment of  s in the pound over and above all other dutiesk out of all salaries fees and perquisites of offices and pensions payable by the crown exceeding the value of  00l per annum this highly popular taxation was imposed by statute    geo ii c    and is under the direction of the commissioners of the landtax the clear net produce of these several branches of the revenue after all charges of collecting and management paid amounts at present annually to about seven millions and threequarters sterling besides more than two millions and a quarter raised by the land and malt tax how these immense sums are appropriated is next to be considered and this is first and principally to the payment of the interest of the national debts in order to take a clear and comprehensive view of the nature of this national debt it must first be premised that after the revolution when our new connections with europe introduced a new system of foreign politics the expenses of the nation not only in settling the new establishment but in maintaining long wars as principals on the continent for the security of the dutch barrier reducing the french monarchy settling the spanish succession supporting the house of austria maintaining the liberties of the germanic body and other purposes increased to an unusual degree insomuch that it was not thought advisable to raise all the expenses of any one year by taxes to be levied within that year lest the unaccustomed weight of them should create murmurs among the people it was therefore the policy of the times to anticipate the revenues of their posterity by borrowing immense sums for the current service of the state and to lay no more taxes upon the subject than would suffice to pay the annual interest of the sums so borrowed by this means converting      the principal debt into a new species of property transferable from one man to another at any time and in any quantity a system which seems to have had its original in the state of florence ad      which government then owed about  0000l sterling and being unable to pay it formed the principal into an aggregate sum called metaphorically a mount or bank the shares whereof were transferable like our stocks with interest at five per cent the prices varying according to the exigencies of the statel this policy of the english parliament laid the foundation of what is called the national debt for a few long annuities created in the reign of charles ii will hardly deserve that name and the example then set has been so closely followed during the long wars in the reign of queen anne and since that the capital of the national debt funded and unfunded amounted at the close of the session in june      to about an hundred and thirtysix millions   to pay the interest of which together     with certain annuities for lives and years and the charges of management amounting annually to upwards of four millions and threequarters the extra ordinary revenues just now enumerated excepting only the landtax and annual malttax are in the first place mortgaged and made perpetual by parliament perpetual i say but still redeemable by the same authority that imposed them which if it at any time can pay off the capital will abolish those taxes which are raised to discharge the interest by this means the quantity of property in the kingdom is greatly increased in idea compared with former times yet if we coolly consider it not at all increased in reality we may boast of large fortunes and quantities of money in the funds but where does this money exist it exists only in name in paper in public faith in parliamentary security and that is undoubtedly sufficient for the creditors of the public to rely on but then what is the pledge which the public faith has pawned for the security of these debts the land the trade and the personal industry of the subject from which the money must arise that supplies the several taxes in these therefore and these only the property of the public      creditors does really and intrinsically exist and of course the land the trade and the personal industry of individuals are diminished in their true value just so much as they are pledged to answer if as income amounts to  00l per annum and he is so far indebted to b that he pays him  0l per annum for his interest onehalf of the value of as property is transferred to b the creditor the creditors property exists in the demand which he has upon the debtor and nowhere else and the debtor is only a trustee to his creditor for onehalf of the value of his income in short the property of a creditor of the public consists in a certain portion of the national taxes by how much therefore he is the richer by so much the nation which pays these taxes is the poorer       the only advantage that can result to a nation from the public debts is the increase of circulation by multiplying the cash of the kingdom and creating a new species of currency assignable at any time and in any quantity always therefore ready to be employed in any beneficial undertaking by means of this its transferable quality and yet producing some profit even when it lies idle and unemployed a certain proportion of debt seems therefore to be highly useful to a trading people but what that proportion is it is not for me to determine thus much is indisputably certain that the present magnitude of our national encumbrances very far exceeds all calculations of commercial benefit and is productive of the greatest inconveniences for first the enormous taxes that are raised upon the necessaries of life for the payment of the interest of this debt are a hurt both to trade and manufactures by raising the price as well of the artificers subsistence as of the raw material and of course in a much greater proportion the price of the commodity itself nay the very increase of paper circulation itself when extended beyond what is requisite for commerce or foreign exchange has a natural tendency to increase the price of provisions as well as of all other merchandise for as its effect is to multiply the cash of the kingdom and this to such an extent that much must remain unemployed that cash which is the      universal measure of the respective values of all other commodities must necessarily sink in its own valuem and every thing grow comparatively dearer secondly if part of this debt be owing to foreigners either they draw out of the kingdom annually a considerable quantity of specie for the interest or else it is made an argument to grant them unreasonable privileges in order to induce them to reside here thirdly if the whole be owing to subjects only it is then charging the active and industrious subject who pays his share of the taxes to maintain the indolent and idle creditor who receives them lastly and principally it weakens the internal strength of a state by anticipating those resources which should be reserved to defend it in case of necessity   the interest we now pay for our     debts would be nearly sufficient to maintain any war that any national motives could require and if our ancestors in king williams time had annually paid so long as their exigencies lasted even a less sum than we now annually raise upon their accounts they would in the time of war have borne no greater burdens than they have bequeathed to and settled upon their posterity in time of peace and might have been eased the instant the exigence was over the respective produces of the several taxes before mentioned were originally separate and distinct funds being securities for the sums advanced on each several tax and for them only but at last it became necessary in order to avoid confusion as they multiplied yearly to reduce the number of these separate funds by uniting and blending them together superadding the faith of parliament for the general security of the whole so that there are now only three capital funds of any account the aggregate fund and the general fund so called from such union and addition and the south sea fund being the produce of the taxes appropriated to pay the interest of such part of the national debt as was advanced by that company and its annuitants whereby the separate funds which were thus united are become mutual securities for each other and the whole produce of them thus aggregated liable to pay such interest or annuities as were    0 formerly charged upon each distinct fund the faith of the legislature being moreover engaged to supply any casual deficiencies the customs excises and other taxes which are to support these funds depending upon contingencies upon exports imports and consumptions must necessarily be of a very uncertain amount but though some of them have proved unproductive and others deficient the sum total hath always been considerably more than was sufficient to answer the charge upon them the surpluses therefore of the three great national funds the aggregate general and south sea funds over and above the interest and annuities charged upon them are directed by statute   geo i c   to be carried together and to attend the disposition of parliament and are usually denominated the sinking fund because originally destined to sink and lower the national debt to this have been since added many other entire duties granted in subsequent years and the annual interest of the sums borrowed on their respective credits is charged on and payable out of the produce of the sinking fund however the net surpluses and savings after all deductions paid amount annually to a very considerable sum for as the interest on the national debt has been at several times reduced by the consent of the proprietors who had their option either to lower their interest or be paid their principal the savings from the appropriated revenues came at length to be extremely large this sinking fund is the last resort of the nation its only domestic resource on which must chiefly depend all the hopes we can entertain of ever discharging or moderating our encumbrance and therefore the prudent and steady application of the large sums now arising from this fund is a point of the utmost importance and well worthy the serious attention of parliament which was thereby enabled in the year      to reduce above two millions sterling of the public debt and several additional millions in several succeeding years     0 but before any part of the aggregate fund the surpluses whereof are one of the chief ingredients that form the sinking      fund can be applied to diminish the principal of the public debt it stands mortgaged by parliament to raise an annual sum for the maintenance of the kings household and the civil list for this purpose in the late reigns the produce of certain branches of the excise and customs the postoffice the duty on wine licenses the revenues of the remaining crown lands the profits arising from courts of justice which articles include all the hereditary revenues of the crown and also a clear annuity of   0000l in money were settled on the king for life for the support of his majestys household and the honour and dignity of the crown and as the amount of these several branches was uncertain though in the last reign they were computed to have sometimes raised almost a million if they did not arise annually to  00000l the parliament engaged to make up the deficiency but his present majesty having soon after his accession spontaneously signified his consent that his own hereditary revenues might be so disposed of as might best conduce to the utility and satisfaction of the public and having graciously accepted the limited sum of  00000l per annum for the support of his civil list the said hereditary and other revenues were carried into and made a part of the aggregate fund and the aggregate fund was chargedn with the payment of the whole annuity to the crown of  00000l which being found insufficient was increased in      to  00000l per annum hereby the revenues themselves being put under the same care and management as the other branches of the public patrimony produce more and are better collected than heretofore and the public is still a gainer of near  00000l per annum by this disinterested conduct of his majesty the civil list thus liquidated together with the four millions and threequarters interest of the national debt and more than two millions produced from the sinking fund make up the seven millions and threequarters per annum net money which were before stated to be the annual produce of our perpetual taxes besides the immense though uncertain sums arising from the annual taxes on land and malt but which at an     average      may be calculated at more than two millions and a quarter and added to the preceding sum make the clear produce of the taxes exclusive of the charge of collecting which are raised yearly on the people of this country amount to about ten millions sterling the expenses defrayed by the civil list are those that in any shape relate to the civil government as the expenses of the royal household the revenues allotted to the judges previous to the year      all salaries to officers of state and every of the kings servants the appointments to foreign ambassadors the maintenance of the queen and royal family the kings private expenses or privy purse and other very numerous outgoings as secret service money pensions and other bounties which sometimes have so far exceeded the revenues appointed for that purpose that application has been made to parliament to discharge the debts contracted on the civil list as particularly in      when one milliono was granted for that purpose by the statute    geo i c    and in      and      when half a million and  00000l were appropriated to the like uses by the statutes   geo iii c    and    geo iii c    the civil list is indeed properly the whole of the kings revenue in his own distinct capacity the rest being rather the revenue of the public or its creditors though collected and distributed again in the name and by the officers of the crown it now standing in the same place as the hereditary income did formerly and as that has gradually diminished the parliamentary appointments have in creased the whole revenue of queen elizabeth did not amount to more than  00000l a yearp that of king charles i wasq  00000l   and the revenue voted for king charles ii wasr   00000l though complaints were made in the first years at least that it did not amount to so muchs but it must be observed that under these sums were included all manner of public expenses among which lord clarendon in his speech to the parliament computed that the charge of the navy and land forces amounted annually to  00000l which was ten times      more than before the former troublest the same revenue subject to the same charges was settled on king james iiu but by the increase of trade and more frugal management it amounted on an average to a million and a half per annum besides other additional customs granted by parliamentv which produced an annual revenue of  00000l out of which his fleet and army were maintained at the yearly expense ofw   00000l after the revolution when the parliament took into its own hands the annual support of the forces both maritime and military 0 a civil list revenue     was settled on the new king and queen amounting with the hereditary duties to  00000l per annumx and the same was continued to queen anne and king george iy that of king george ii we have seen was nominally augmented toz  00000l and in fact was considerably more and that of his present majesty is avowedly increased to the limited sum of  00000l and upon the whole it is doubtless much better for the crown and also for the people to have the revenue settled upon the modern footing rather than the ancient for the crown because it is more certain and collected with greater ease for the people because they are now delivered from the feodal hardships and other odious branches of the prerogative and though complaints have sometimes been made of the increase of the civil list yet if we consider the sums that have been formerly granted the limited extent under which it is now established the revenues and prerogatives given up in lieu of it by the crown the numerous branches of the present royal family and above all the diminution of the value of money compared with what it was worth in the last century we must acknowledge these complaints to be void of any rational foundation and that it is impossible to support that dignity which a king of great britain should maintain with an income in any degree less than what is now established by parliament      this finishes our inquiries into the fiscal prerogatives of the king or his revenue both ordinary and extraordinary we have therefore now chalked out all the principal outlines of this vast title of the law the supreme executive magistrate or the kings majesty considered in his several capacities and points of view but before we entirely dismiss this subject it may not be improper to take a short comparative review of the power of the executive magistrate or prerogative of the crown as it stood in former days and as it stands at present and we cannot but observe that most of the laws for ascertaining limiting and restraining this prerogative have been made within the compass of little more than a century past from the petition of right in   car i to the present time so that the powers of the crown are now to all appearance greatly curtailed and diminished since the reign of king james the first particularly by the abolition of the starchamber and high commission courts in the reign of charles the first and by the disclaiming of martial law and the power of levying taxes on the subject by the same prince by the disuse of forest laws for a century past and by the many excellent provisions enacted under charles the second especially the abolition of military tenures purveyance and preemption the habeas corpus act and the act to prevent the discontinuance of parliaments for above three years and since the revolution by the strong and emphatical words in which our liberties are asserted in the bill of rights and act of settlement by the act for triennial since turned into septennial elections by the exclusion of certain officers from the house of commons by rendering the seats of the judges permanent and their salaries liberal and     independent and by restraining the kings pardon from obstructing parliamentary impeachments besides all this if we consider how the crown is impoverished and stripped of all ancient revenues so that it must greatly rely on the liberality of parliament for its necessary support and maintenance we may perhaps be led to think that the balance is inclined pretty strongly to the popular scale and that the executive magistrate has neither independence nor power enough left to form that check upon the lords and commons which the founders of our constitution intended      but on the other hand it is to be considered that every prince in the first parliament after his accession has by long usage a truly royal addition to his hereditary revenue settled upon him for his life and has never any occasion to apply to parliament for supplies but upon some public necessity of the whole realm this restores to him that constitutional independence which at his first accession seems it must be owned to be wanting and then with regard to power we may find perhaps that the hands of government are at least sufficiently strengthened and that an english monarch is now in no danger of being overborne by either the nobility or the people the instruments of power are not perhaps so open and avowed as they formerly were and therefore are the less liable to jealous and invidious reflections but they are not the weaker upon that account in short our national debt and taxes besides the inconveniences before mentioned have also in their natural consequences thrown such a weight of power into the executive scale of government as we cannot think was intended by our patriot ancestors who gloriously struggled for the abolition of the then formidable parts of the prerogative and by an unaccountable want of foresight established this system in their stead the entire collection and management of so vast a revenue being placed in the hands of the crown have given rise to such a multitude of new officers created by and removable at the royal pleasure that they have extended the influence of government to every corner of the nation witness the commissioners and the multitude of dependants on the customs in every port of the kingdom the commissioners of excise and their numerous subalterns in every inland district the postmasters and their servants planted in every town and upon every public road the commissioners of the stamps and their distributors which are full as scattered and full as numerous the officers of the salt duty which though a species of excise and conducted in the same manner are yet made a distinct corps from the ordinary managers of that revenue the surveyors of houses and windows the receivers of the landtax the managers of lotteries and the commissioners of hackney coaches all which      are either mediately or immediately appointed by the crown and removable at pleasure without any reason assigned these it requires but little penetration to see must give that power on which they depend for subsistence an influence most amazingly extensive to this may be added the frequent opportunities of conferring particular obligations by preference in loans subscriptions tickets remittances and other money transactions which will greatly increase this influence and that over those persons whose attachment on account of their wealth is frequently the most desirable all this is the natural though perhaps the unforeseen consequence of erecting our funds of credit and to support them establishing our present perpetual taxes the whole of which is entirely new since the restoration in    0 and by far the greatest part since the revolution in      and the same may be said with regard to the officers in our numerous army and the places which the army has created all which put together give the executive power so persuasive an energy with respect to the persons themselves and so prevailing an interest with their friends and families as will amply make amends for the loss of external prerogative but though this profusion of offices should have no effect on individuals there is still another newly acquired branch of power and that is not the influence only but the force of a disciplined army paid indeed ultimately by the people but immediately by the crown raised by the crown officered by the crown commanded by the crown they are kept on foot it is true only from     year to year and that by the power of parliament but during that year they must by the nature of our constitution if raised at all be at the absolute disposal of the crown and there need but few words to demonstrate how great a trust is thereby reposed in the prince by his people a trust that is more than equivalent to a thousand little troublesome prerogatives add to all this that besides the civil list the immense revenue of almost seven millions sterling which is annually paid to the creditors of the public or carried to the sinking      fund is first deposited in the royal exchequer and thence issued out to the respective offices of payment this revenue the people can never refuse to raise because it is made perpetual by act of parliament which also when well considered will appear to be a trust of great delicacy and high importance upon the whole therefore i think it is clear that whatever may have become of the nominal the real power of the crown has not been too far weakened by any transactions in the last century much is indeed given up but much is also acquired the stern commands of prerogative have yielded to the milder voice of influence the slavish and exploded doctrine of nonresistance has given way to a military establishment by law and to the disuse of parliaments has succeeded a parliamentary trust of an immense perpetual revenue when indeed by the free operation of the sinking fund our national debts shall be lessened when the posture of foreign affairs and the universal introduction of a wellplanned and national militia will suffer our formidable army to be thinned and regulated and when in consequence of all our taxes shall be gradually reduced this adventitious power of the crown will slowly and imperceptibly diminish as it slowly and imperceptibly rose but till that shall happen it will be our especial duty as good subjects and good englishmen to reverence the crown and yet guard against corrupt and servile influence from those who are intrusted with its authority to be loyal yet free obedient and yet independent and above every thing to hope that we may long very long continue to be governed by a sovereign who in all those public acts that have personally proceeded from himself hath manifested the highest veneration for the free constitution of britain hath already in more than one instance remarkably strengthened its outworks and will therefore never harbour a thought or adopt a persuasion in any the remotest degree detrimental to public liberty chapter ix of subordinate magistrates in a former chapter of these commentariesa we distinguished magistrates into two kinds supreme or those in whom the sovereign power of the state resides and subordinate or those who act in an inferior secondary sphere we have hitherto considered the former kind only namely the supreme legislative power or parliament and the supreme executive power which is the king and are now to proceed to inquire into the rights and duties of the principal subordinate magistrates and herein we are not to investigate the powers and duties of his majestys great officers of state the lord treasurer lord chamberlain the principal secretaries or the like because i do not know that they are in that capacity in any considerable degree the objects of our laws or have any very important share of magistracy conferred upon them except that the secretaries of state are allowed the power of commitment in order to bring offenders to trialb neither shall i here treat of the office and authority of the lord chancellor or the other judges of the superior courts of justice because they will find a more proper place in the third part of these commentaries nor shall i enter into     any minute disquisitions with regard to the rights and dignities of mayors and      aldermen or other magistrates of particular corporations because these are mere private and strictly municipal rights depending entirely upon the domestic constitution of their respective franchises but the magistrates and officers whose rights and duties it will be proper in this chapter to consider are such as are generally in use and have a jurisdiction and authority dispersedly throughout the kingdom which are principally sheriffs coroners justices of the peace constables surveyors of highways and overseers of the poor in treating of all which i shall inquire into first their antiquity and original next the manner in which they are appointed and may be removed and lastly their rights and duties and first of sheriffs i the sheriff is an officer of very great antiquity in this kingdom his name being derived from two saxon words  the reeve bailiff or officer of the shire he is called in latin vicecomes as being the deputy of the earl or comes to whom the custody of the shire is said to have been committed at the first division of this kingdom into counties but the earls in process of time by reason of their high employments and attendance on the kings person not being able to transact the business of the county were delivered of that burdenc reserving to themselves the honour but the labour was laid on the sheriff so that now the sheriff does all the kings business in the county and though he be still called vicecomes yet he is entirely independent of and not subject to the earl the king by his letterspatent committing custodiam comitatus to the sheriff and him alone sheriffs were formerly chosen by the inhabitants of the several counties in confirmation of which it was ordained by statute    edw i c   that the people should have election of sheriffs in every shire where the shrievalty is not of inheritance for anciently in some counties the sheriffs were hereditary as i apprehend they were in scotland  till the statute  0 geo ii c    and still continue in the county of westmoreland to this day     0 the city of london having also the inheritance of the shrievalty of middlesex vested in their body by charterd  the reason of these popular elections is assigned in the same statute c    that the commons might choose such as would not be a burden to them and herein appears plainly a strong trace of the democratical part of our constitution in which form of government it is an indispensable   0 requisite that the people should choose their own magistratese this election was in all probability not absolutely vested in the commons but required the royal approbation for in the gothic constitution the judges of the county courts which office is executed by our sheriff were elected by the people but confirmed by the king and the form of their election was thus managed the people or incolæ territorii chose twelve electors and they nominated three persons ex quibus rex unum confirmabatf but with us in england these popular elections growing tumultuous were put an end to by the statute   edw ii st   which enacted that the sheriffs should from thenceforth be assigned by the chancellor treasurer and the judges as being persons in whom the same trust might with confidence be reposed by statutes    edw iii c      hen vi c   and    hen viii c  0 the chancellor treasurer president of the kings council chief justices and chief baron are to make this election and that on the morrow of all souls in the exchequer and the kings letterspatent appointing the new sheriffs used commonly to bear date the  th day of novemberg the statute of cambridge    ric ii c   ordains that the chancellor treasurer keeper of the privy seal steward of the kings house the kings chamberlain clerk of the rolls the justices of the one bench and the other barons of the exchequer and all other that shall be called to ordain name or make justices of the peace sheriffs and other officers of the king shall be sworn to act indifferently and to appoint no man that sueth either privily or openly to be put in office but such only as they shall judge to be the best and most sufficient and the custom now is and has been at least      ever since the time of fortescueh who was chief justice and chancellor to henry the sixth that all the judges together with the other great officers and privy counsellors meet in the exchequer on the morrow of all souls yearly which day is now altered to the morrow of st martin by the last act for abbreviating michaelmas term and then and there the judges propose three persons to be reported if approved of to the king who afterwards appoints one of them to be sheriff  this custom of the twelve judges proposing three persons seems borrowed from the gothic constitution before mentioned with this difference that among the goths the twelve nominors were first elected by the people themselves and this usage of ours at its first introduction i am apt to believe was founded     upon some statute though not now to be found among our printed laws first because it is materially different from the direction of all the statutes before mentioned which it is hard to conceive that the judges would have countenanced by their concurrence or that fortescue would have inserted in his book unless by the authority of some statute and also because a statute is expressly referred to in the record which sir edward coke tells usi he transcribed from the council book of   march    henry vi and which is in substance as follows  the king had of his own authority appointed a man sheriff of lincolnshire which office he refused to take upon him whereupon the opinions of the judges were taken what should be done in this behalf and the two chief justices sir john fortescue and sir john prisot delivered the unanimous opinion of them all that the king did an error when he made a person sheriff that was not chosen and presented to him according to the statute that the person refusing was liable to no fine for disobedience as if he had been one of the three persons chosen according to the tenor of the statute  that they would advise the king to have recourse to the three persons that were chosen according to the statute or that some other thrifty man be entreated to occupy the office for this year and that the next year to eschew such inconveniences the order of the statute in this behalf made be observed but notwithstanding this unanimous resolution of      all the judges of england thus entered in the council book and the statute        hen viii c    §    which expressly recognises this to be the law of the land some of our writersj have affirmed that the king by his prerogative may name whom he pleases to be sheriff whether chosen by the judges or no this is grounded on a very particular case in the fifth year of queen elizabeth when by reason of the plague there was no michaelmas term kept at westminster so that the judges could not meet there in crastino animarum to nominate the sheriffs whereupon the queen named them herself without such previous assembly appointing for the most part one of the two remaining in the last years listk and this case thus circumstanced is the only authority in our books for the making these extraordinary sheriffs it is true the reporter adds that it was held that the queen by her prerogative might make a sheriff without the election of the judges non obstante aliquo statuto in contrarium but the doctrine of non obstantes which sets the prerogative above the laws was effectually demolished by the bill of rights at the revolution and abdicated westminster hall when king james abdicated the kingdom however it must be acknowledged that the practice of occasionally naming what are called pocketsheriffs by the sole authority of the crown hath uniformly continued to the     reign of his present majesty in which i believe few if any compulsory instances have occurred      sheriffs by virtue of several old statutes are to continue in their office no longer than one year and yet it hath been saidl that a sheriff may be appointed durante bene placito or during the kings pleasure and so is the form of the royal writm therefore till a new sheriff be named his office cannot be determined unless by his own death or the demise of the king in which last case it was usual for the successor to send a new writ to the old sheriffn but now by statute   anne st   c   all officers appointed by the      preceding king may hold their offices for six months after the kings demise unless sooner displaced by the successor we may further observe that by statute   ric ii c    no man that has served the office of sheriff for one year can be compelled to serve the same again within three years after  we shall find it is of the utmost importance to have the sheriff appointed according to law when we consider his power and duty these are either as a judge as the keeper of the kings peace as a ministerial officer of the superior courts of justice or as the kings bailiff in his judicial capacity he is to hear and determine all causes of forty shillings value and under in his county court of which more in its proper place and he has also a judicial power in divers other civil caseso he is likewise to decide the elections of knights of the shire subject to the control of the house of commons of coroners and of verderors to judge of the qualifications of voters and to return such as he shall determine to be duly elected as the keeper of the kings peace both by common law and special commission he is the first man in the county and superior in rank to any nobleman therein during his officep he may apprehend and commit to prison all persons who break the peace or attempt to break it and may bind any one in recognizance to keep the kings peace  he may and is bound ex officio to pursue and take all traitors murderers felons and other misdoers and commit them to gaol for safe custody he is also to defend his county against any of the kings enemies when they come into the land and for this purpose as well as for keeping the peace and pursuing felons he may command all the people of his county to attend him which is called the posse comitatus or power of the countyq and this summons every person above fifteen years old and under the degree of a peer is bound to attend upon warningr      under pain of fine and imprisonments but though the sheriff is thus the principal conservator of the peace in his county yet by the express directions of the great chartert he together with the constable coroner and certain other officers of the king are forbidden to hold any pleas of the crown or in     other words to try any criminal offence for it would be highly unbecoming that the executioners of justice should be also the judges should impose as well as levy fines and amercements should one day condemn a man to death and personally execute him the next neither may he act as an ordinary justice of the peace during the time of his officeu for this would be equally inconsistent he being in many respects the servant of the justices in his ministerial capacity the sheriff is bound to execute all process issuing from the kings courts of justice 0 in the commencement of civil causes he is to serve the writ to arrest and to take bail when the cause comes to trial he must summon and return the jury when it is determined he must see the judgment of the court carried into execution in criminal matters he also arrests and imprisons he returns the jury he has the custody of the delinquent and he executes the sentence of the court though it extend to death itself as the kings bailiff it is his business to preserve the rights of the king within his bailiwick for so his county is frequently called in the writs a word introduced by the princes of the norman line in imitation of the french whose territory is divided into bailiwicks as that of england into countiesw he must seize to the kings use all lands devolved to the crown by attainder or escheat must levy all fines and forfeitures must seize and keep all waits wrecks estrays and the like unless they be granted to some subject and must also collect the kings rents within the bailiwick if commanded by process from the exchequerx      to execute these various offices the sheriff has under him many inferior officers an undersheriff bailiffs and gaolers who must neither buy sell nor farm their offices on forfeiture of  00ly       the undersheriff usually performs all the duties of the office   a very few only excepted where the personal presence of the highsheriff is necessary but no undersheriff shall abide in his office above one yearz and if he does by statute    hen vi c   he forfeits  00l a very large penalty in those early days and no undersheriff or sheriffs officer shall practise as an attorney during the time he continues in such officea for this would be a great inlet to partiality and oppression but these salutary regulations are shamefully evaded by practising in the names of other attorneys and putting in sham deputies by way of nominal undersheriffs by reason of which says daltonb the undersheriffs and bailiffs do grow so cunning in their several places that they are able to deceive and it may well be feared that many of them do deceive both the king the highsheriff and the county bailiffs or sheriffs officers are either bailiffs of hundreds or special bailiffs   bailiffs of hundreds are officers appointed over those respective districts by the sheriffs to collect fines therein to summon juries to attend the judges and justices at the assizes and quarter sessions and also to execute writs and process     in the several hundreds but as these are generally plain men and not thoroughly skilful in this latter part of their office that of serving writs and making arrests and executions it is now usual to join special bailiffs with them who are generally mean persons employed by the sheriffs on account only of their adroitness and dexterity in hunting and seizing their prey the sheriff being      answerable for the misdemesnors   of these bailiffs they are therefore usually bound in an obligation with sureties for the due execution of their office and thence are called boundbailiffs which the common people have corrupted into a much more homely appellation gaolers are also the servants of the sheriff and he must be responsible for their conduct   their business is to keep safely all such persons as are committed     to them by lawful warrant and if they suffer any such to escape the sheriff shall answer it to the king if it be a criminal matter or in a civil case to the party injuredc and to this end the sheriff mustd have lands sufficient within the county to answer the king and his people   the abuses of gaolers     and sheriffs officers towards the unfortunate persons in their custody are well restrained and guarded against by statute    geo ii c    and by statute    geo iii c    provisions are made for better preserving the health of prisoners and preventing the gaoldistemper the vast expense which custom has introduced in serving the office of highsheriff was grown such a burden to the subject that it was enacted by statute        car ii c    that no sheriff except of london westmoreland and towns which are counties of themselves should keep any table at the assizes except for his own family or give any presents to the judges or their servants or have more than forty men in livery yet for the sake of safety and decency he may not have less than twenty men in england and twelve in wales upon forfeiture in any of these cases of  00l   ii the coroners is also a very ancient office at the common law iie is called coroner coronator because he hath principally to do with pleas of the crown or such wherein the king is more immediately concernede and in this light the lord chief justice of the kings bench is the principal coroner in the kingdom and may if he pleases exercise the jurisdiction of a coroner in any part of the realmf but      there are also particular coroners for every county of england usually four but sometimes six and sometimes fewerg this officeh is of equal antiquity with the sheriff and was ordained together with him to keep the peace when the earls gave up the wardship of the county he is still chosen by all the freeholders in the county court   as by the policy     of our ancient laws the sheriffs and conservators of the peace and all other officers were who were concerned in matters that affected the liberty of the peoplei and as verderors of the forest still are whose business it is to stand between the prerogative and the subject in the execution of the forest laws for this purpose there is a writ at common law de coronatore eligendoj in which it is expressly commanded the sheriff quod talem eligi faciat qui melius et sciat et velit et possit officio illi intendere and in order to effect this the more surely it was enacted by the statutek of westm   that none but lawful and discreet knights should be chosen and there was an instance in the   edw iii of a man being removed from this office because he was only a merchantl 0 but it seems it is now sufficient if a man hath lands enough to be made a knight   whether he be really knighted or notm for the coroner ought to have an estate sufficient to maintain the dignity of his office and answer any fines that may be set upon him for his misbehaviourn and if he hath not enough to answer his fine shall be levied on the county as the punishment for electing an insufficient officero now indeed through the culpable neglect of gentlemen of property this office has been suffered to fall into disrepute and get into low and indigent hands so that although formerly no coroners would condescend to be paid for serving their country and they were by the aforesaid statute of westm   expressly forbidden to take a      reward under pain of a great forfeiture to the king yet for many years past they have only desired to be chosen for the sake of their perquisites being allowed fees for their attendance by the statute   henry vii c   which sir edward coke complains of heavilyp though since his time those fees have been much enlargedq   the coroner is chosen for life but may be removed either by being made sheriff or chosen verderor which are offices incompatible with the other or by the kings writ de coronatore exonerando for a cause to be therein assigned as that he is engaged in other business is incapacitated by years or sickness hath not a sufficient estate in the county or lives in an inconvenient part of itr and by the statute    geo ii c    extortion neglect or misbehaviour are also made causes of removal the office and power of a coroner are also like those of the sheriff either judicial or ministerial but principally judicial this is in great measure ascertained     by statute   edw i de officio coronatoris and consists first in inquiring when any person is slain or dies suddenly or in prison concerning the manner of his death and this must be super visum corporiss   for if the body be not found the coroner cannot sitt he must also sit at the very place where the death happened and his inquiry is made by a jury from four five or six of the neighbouring towns over whom he is to preside if any be found guilty by this inquest of murder or other homicide he is to commit them to prison for further trial and is also to inquire concerning their lands goods and chattels which are forfeited thereby but whether it be homicide or not he must     inquire whether any deodand has accrued to the king or the      lord of the franchise by this death and must certify the whole of this inquisition under his own seal and the seals of his jurorsu together with the evidence thereon to the court of kings bench or the next assizes another branch of his office is to inquire concerning shipwrecks and certify whether wreck or not and who is in possession of the goods concerning treasuretrove he is also to inquire who were the finders and where it is and whether any one be suspected of having found or concealed a treasure and that may be well perceived saith the old statute of edw i where one liveth riotously haunting taverns and hath done so of long time whereupon he might be attached and held to bail upon this suspicion only the ministerial office of the coroner is only as the sherirfs substitute for when just exception can be taken to the sheriff for suspicion of partiality as that he is interested in the suit or of kindred to either plaintiff or defendant the process must then be awarded to the coroner instead of the sheriff for execution of the kings writsv   iii the next species of subordinate magistrates whom i am to consider are justices of the peace the principal of whom is the custos rotulorum or keeper of the records of the county the common law hath ever had a special care and regard for the conservation of the peace for peace is the very end and foundation of civil society and therefore before the present constitution of justices was invented there were peculiar officers appointed by the common law for the maintenance of the public peace of these some had and still have this power annexed to other offices which they hold others had it merely by itself and were thence named custodes or conservatores pacis those that were so virtute officii still continue but the latter sort are superseded by the modern justices the kings majestyw is by his office and dignity royal the principal conservator of the peace within all his dominions    0 and may give authority to any other to see the peace kept and to punish such as break it hence it is usually called the kings peace the lord chancellor or keeper the lord treasurer the lord high steward of england the lord mareschal the lord high constable of england when any such officers are in being and all the justices of the court of kings bench by virtue of their offices and the master of the rolls by prescription are general conservators of the peace throughout the whole kingdom and may commit all breakers of it or bind them in recognizances to keep itx the other judges are only so in their own courts the coroner is also a conservator of the peace within his own countyy as is also the sheriffz and both of them may take a recognizance or security for the peace constables tithingmen and the like are also conservators of the peace within their own jurisdictions and may apprehend all breakers of the peace and commit them till they find sureties for their keeping ita   those that were without any office simply and merely conservators of the   0 peace either claimed that power by prescriptionb or were bound to exercise it by the tenure of their landsc or lastly were chosen by the freeholders in full county court before the sheriff the writ for their election directing them to be chosen de probioribus et potentioribus comitatus sui in custodes pacisd but when queen isabel the wife of edward ii had contrived to depose her husband by a forced resignation of the crown and had set up his son edward iii in his place this being a thing then without example in england it was feared would much alarm the people especially as the old king was living though hurried about from castle to castle till at last he met with an untimely death to prevent therefore any risings or other disturbances of the peace the new king sent writs to all the sheriffs in england the form of which is preserved by      thomas walsinghame giving a plausible account of the manner of his obtaining the crown to wit that it was done ipsius patris bene placito and withal commanding each sheriff that the peace be kept throughout his bailiwick on pain and peril of disinheritance and loss of life and limb and in a few weeks after the date of these writs it was ordained in parliamentf that for the better maintaining and keeping of the peace in every county good men and lawful which were no maintainers of evil or barretors in the country should be assigned to keep the peace and in this manner and upon this occasion was the election of the conservators of the peace taken from the people and given to the kingg this assignment being construed to be by the kings commissionh but still they were only called conservators wardens or keepers of the peace till the statute    edw iii c   gave them the power of trying felonies and then they acquired the more honourable appellation of justicesi these justices are appointed by the kings special commission under the great seal the form of which was settled by all the judges ad    0j this appoints them allk jointly and severally to keep the peace and any two or more of them to inquire of and determine felonies and other misdemesnors in which number some particular justices or one of them are directed to be always included and no business to be done without their presence the words of the commission running thus quorum aliquem vestrum a b c d c unum esse volumus whence the persons so named are usually called justices of the quorum and formerly it was customary to appoint only a select number of justices eminent for their skill and discretion to be of the quorum but now the practice is to advance almost all of them to that dignity naming them all over again in the quorum clause except perhaps only some one inconsiderable person for the sake of propriety and no exception is now allowable      for not expressing in the form of warrants c that the justice who issued them is of the quoruml when any justice intends to act under this commission he sues out a writ of dedimus potestatem from the clerk of the crown in chancery empowering certain persons therein named to administer the usual oaths to him which done he is at liberty to act touching the number and qualifications of these justices it was ordained by statute    edw iii c   that two or three of the best reputation in each county shall be assigned to be keepers of the peace but these being found rather too few for that purpose it was provided by statute    edw iii c   that one lord and three or four of the most worthy men in the county with some learned in the law shall be made justices in every county but afterwards the number of justices through the ambition of private persons became so large that it was thought necessary by statute    ric ii c  0 and    ric ii c    to restrain them at first to six and afterwards to eight only but this rule is now disregarded and the cause seems to be as lambard observed long agom that the growing number of statute laws committed from time to time to the charge of justices of the peace have occasioned also and very     reasonably their increase to a larger number and as to their qualifications the statutes just cited direct them to be of the best reputation and most worthy men in the county and the statute    ric ii c   orders them to be of the most sufficient knights esquires and gentlemen of the law also by statute   hen v st   c   and st   c   they must be resident in their several counties and because contrary to these statutes men of small substance had crept into the commission whose poverty made them both covetous and contemptible it was enacted by statute    hen vi c    that no justice should be put in commission if he had not lands to the value of  0l per annum and the rate of money being greatly altered since that time it is now enacted by statute   geo ii c    that every justice except      as is therein excepted shall have  00l per annum clear of all deductions   and if he acts without such qualification he shall forfeit  00l this qualificationn is almost an equivalent to the  0l per annum required in henry the sixths time and of thiso the justice must now make oath also it is provided by the act   geo ii that no practising attorney solicitor or proctor shall be capable of acting as a justice of the peace as the office of these justices is conferred by the king so it subsists only during his pleasure and is determinable   by the demise of the crown that is in six months afterp but if the same justice is put in commission by the successor he shall not be obliged to sue out a new dedimus or to swear to his qualification afreshq nor by reason of any new commission to take the oaths more than once in the same reignr   by express writ under the great seals discharging any particular person from being any longer justice   by superseding the commission by writ of supersedeas which suspends the power of all the justices but does not totally destroy it seeing it may be revived again by another writ called a procedendo   by a new commission which virtually though silently discharges all the former justices that are not included therein for two commissions cannot subsist at once   by accession of the office of sheriff or coronert   formerly it was thought that if a man was named in any commission of the peace and had afterwards a new dignity conferred upon him that this determined his office he no longer answering     the description of the commission but nowu it is provided that notwithstanding a new title of dignity the justice on whom it is conferred shall still continue a justice the power office and duty of a justice of the peace depend on his commission and on the several statutes which      have created objects of his jurisdiction his commission first empowers him singly to conserve the peace and thereby gives him all the power of the ancient conservators at the common law in suppressing riots and affrays in taking securities for the peace and in apprehending and committing felons and other inferior criminals it also empowers any two or more to hear and determine all felonies and other offences which is the ground of their jurisdiction at sessions of which more will be said in its proper place and as to the powers given to one two   or more justices by the several statutes which from time to time have heaped upon them such an infinite variety of business that few care to undertake and fewer understand the office they are such and of so great importance to the public that the country is greatly obliged to any worthy magistrate that without sinister views of his own will engage in this troublesome service and therefore if a wellmeaning justice makes any undesigned slip in his practice great lenity and indulgence are shown to him in the courts of law and there are many statutes made to protect him in the upright discharge of his officew which among other privileges prohibit such justices from being sued for any oversights without notice beforehand   and stop all suits begun on tender     made of sufficient amends but on the other hand any malicious or tyrannical abuse of their office is usually severely punished and all persons who recover a verdict against a justice for any wilful or malicious injury are entitled to double costs 0 it is impossible upon our present plan to enter minutely into the particulars of the accumulated authority thus committed to the charge of these magistrates i must therefore refer myself at present to such subsequent parts of these commentaries as will in their turns comprise almost every object of the justices jurisdiction and in the mean time recommend to the student the perusal of mr lambards eirenarcha and dr burns justice of the peace wherein he will find every thing relative to this subject both in ancient and modern practice collected with great care and accuracy and disposed in a most clear and judicious method      i shall next consider some officers of lower rank than those which have gone before and of more confined jurisdiction but still such as are universally in use through every part of the kingdom iv fourthly then of the constable the word constable is frequently said to be derived from the saxon koninapel and to signify the support of the king but as we borrowed the name as well as the office of constable from the french i am rather inclined to deduce it with sir henry spelman and dr cowel from that language wherein it is plainly derived from the latin comes stabuli an officer well known in the empire so called because like the great constable of france as well as the lord high constable of england he was to regulate all matters of chivalry tilts tournaments and feats of arms which     were performed on horseback   this great office of lord high constable hath been disused in england except only upon great and solemn occasions as the kings coronation and the like ever since the attainder of stafford duke of buckingham under king henry viii as in france it was suppressed about a century after by an edict of louis xiiix but from his office says lambardy this lower constableship was first drawn and fetched and is as it were a very finger of that hand for the statute of winchesterz which first appoints them directs that for the better keeping of the peace two constables in every hundred and franchise shall inspect all matters relating to arms and armour   constables are of two sorts high constables and petty constables the former were first ordained by the statute of winchester as before mentioned are appointed at the courtleets of the franchise or hundred over which they preside or in default of that by the justices at their quarter sessions and are removable by the same authority that      appoints thema   the petty constables are inferior officers in every town and parish subordinate to the     high constable of the hundred first instituted about the reign of edw iiib these petty constables have two offices united in them the one antient the other modern their antient office is that of headborough tithingman or borsholder of whom we formerly spokec and who are as antient as the time of king alfred their more modern office is that of constable merely which was appointed as was observed so lately as the reign of edward iii in order to assist the high constabled and in general the antient headboroughs tithingmen and borsholders were made use of to serve as petty constables though not so generally but that in many places they still continue distinct officers from the constable they are all chosen by the jury at the courtleet or if no courtleet be held are appointed by two justices of the peacee the general duty of all constables both high and petty as well as of the other officers is to keep the kings peace in their several districts and to that purpose they are armed with very large powers of arresting and imprisoning of breaking open houses and the like of the extent of which powers considering what manner of men are for the most part put into these offices it is perhaps very well that they are generally kept in ignorance   one of their principal duties arising from the statute of winchester which appoints them is to keep watch and ward in their respective jurisdictions ward guard or custodia is chiefly applied to the daytime in order to apprehend rioters and robbers on the highways the manner of doing which is left to the discretion of the justices of the peace and the constablef the hundred being however answerable for all robberies committed therein by daylight for having kept negligent guard watch is properly applicable to the night only being called among our teutonic     ancestors wacht or wactag and it      begins at the time when ward ends and ends when that begins for by the statute of winchester in walled towns the gates shall be closed from sunsetting to sunrising and watch shall be kept in every borough and town especially in the summer season to apprehend all rogues vagabonds and nightwalkers and make them give an account of themselves the constable may appoint watchmen at his discretion regulated by the custom of the place and these being his deputies have for the timebeing the authority of their principal but with regard to the infinite number of other minute duties that are laid upon constables by a diversity of statutes i must again refer to mr lambard and dr burn in whose compilations may be also seen what powers and duties belong to the constable or tithingman indifferently and what to the constable only for the constable may do whatever the tithingman may but it does not hold e converso the tithingman not having an equal power with the constable   v we are next to consider the surveyors of the highways every parish is bound of common right to keep the highroads that go through it in good and sufficient repair unless by reason of the tenure of lands or otherwise this care is consigned to some particular private person from this burthen no man was exempt by our ancient laws whatever other immunities he might enjoy this being part of the trinoda necessitas to which every mans estate was subject viz expeditio contra hostem arcium constructio et pontium reparatio for though the reparation of bridges only is expressed yet that of roads also must be understood as in the roman law ad instructiones reparationesque itinerum et pontium nullum genus hominum nulliusque dignitatis ac venerationis meritis cessare oporteth and indeed now for the most part the care of the roads only seems to be left to parishes that of bridges being in great measure devolved upon the county at large by statute    hen viii c   if the parish neglected these repairs they might formerly as they may still be indicted for such their neglect but it was not then      incumbent on any particular officer to call the parish together and set them upon this work for which reason by the statute      ph and m c   surveyors of the highways were ordered to be chosen in every parishi these surveyors were originally according to the statutes of philip and mary to be appointed by the constable and churchwardens of the parish but now they are constituted by two neighbouring justices out of such inhabitants or others as are described in statute    geo iii c    and may have salaries allotted them for their trouble their office and duty consists in putting in execution a variety of laws for the repairs of the public highways that is of ways leading from one town to another all which are now reduced into one act by statute    geo iii c    which enacts   that they may remove all annoyances in the highways or give notice to the owner to remove them who is liable to penalties for noncompliance   they are to call together all the inhabitants and occupiers of lands tenements and hereditaments within the parish six days in every year to labour in fetching materials or repairing the highways all persons keeping draughts of three horses c or occupying lands being obliged to send a team for every draught and for every  0l a year which they keep or occupy persons keeping less than a draught or occupying less than  0l a year to contribute in a less proportion and all other persons chargeable between the ages of eighteen and sixtyfive to work or find a labourer but they may compound     with the surveyors at certain easy rates established by the act and every cartway leading to any markettown must be made twenty feet wide at the least if the fences will permit and may be increased by two justices at the expense of the parish to the breadth of thirty feet   the surveyors may lay out their own money in purchasing materials for repairs in erecting guideposts and making drains and shall be reimbursed by a rate to be allowed at a special sessions        in case the personal labour of the parish be not sufficient the surveyors with the consent of the quarter sessions may levy a rate on the parish in aid of the personal duty not exceeding in any one year together with the other highway rates the sum of  d in the pound for the due application of which they are to account upon oath as for turnpikes which are now pretty generally introduced in aid of such rates and the law relating to them these depend principally on the particular powers granted in the several road acts and upon some general provisions which are extended to all turnpike roads in the kingdom by statute    geo iii c    amended by many subsequent actsk vi i proceed therefore lastly to consider the overseers of the poor their original appointment and duty the poor of england till the time of henry viii subsisted entirely upon private benevolence and the charity of welldisposed christians   for though it appears by the mirrorl that by the common law the poor were to be sustained by parsons rectors of the church and the parishioners so that none of them die for default of sustenance and though by the statutes    ric ii c   and    hen vii c    the poor are directed to abide in the cities or towns wherein they were born or such wherein they had dwelt for three years which seem to be the first rudiments of parish settlements yet till the statute    hen viii c    i find no compulsory method chalked out for this purpose but the poor seem to have been left to such relief as the humanity of their neighbours would afford them the monasteries were in particular their principal resource and among other bad effects which attended the monastic institutions it was not perhaps one of the least though frequently esteemed quite otherwise that they supported and fed a very numerous and very idle poor whose sustenance depended upon what was daily distributed in alms at the gates    0 of the religious houses but upon the total dissolution of these the inconvenience of thus encouraging the poor in habits of indolence and beggary was quickly felt throughout the kingdom and abundance of statutes were made in the reign of king henry the eighth and his children for providing for the poor and impotent which the preambles to some of them recite had of late years greatly increased these poor were principally of two sorts sick and impotent and therefore unable to work idle and sturdy and therefore able but not willing to exercise any honest employment to provide in some measure for both of these in and about the metropolis edward the sixth founded three royal hospitals christs and st thomass for the relief of the impotent through infancy or sickness and bridewell for the punishment and employment of the vigorous and idle but these were far from being sufficient for the care of the poor throughout the kingdom at large and therefore after many other fruitless experiments by statute    eliz c   overseers of the poor were appointed in every parish by virtue of the statute last mentioned these overseers are to be nominated yearly in easterweek or within one month after though a subsequent nomination will be validm by two justices dwelling near the parish they must be substantial householders and so expressed to be in the appointment of the justicesn   0 their office and duty according to the same statute are principally these first to raise competent sums for the necessary relief of the poor impotent old blind and such other being poor and not able to work and secondly to provide work for such as are able and cannot otherwise get employment but this latter part of their duty which according to the wise regulations of that salutary statute should go hand in hand with the other is now most shamefully neglected however for these joint purposes they are empowered to      make and levy rates upon the several inhabitants of the parish by the same act of parliament which has been further explained and enforced by several subsequent statutes the two great objects of this statute seem to have been   to relieve the impotent poor and them only   to find employment for such as are able to work and this principally by providing stocks of raw materials to be worked up at their separate homes instead of accumulating all the poor in one common workhouse a practice which puts the sober and diligent upon a level in point of their earnings with those who are dissolute and idle depresses the laudable emulation of domestic industry and neatness and destroys all endearing family connections the only felicity of the indigent whereas if none were relieved but those who are incapable to get their livings and that in proportion to their incapacity if no children were removed from their parents but such as are brought up in rags and idleness and if every poor man and his family were regularly furnished with employment and allowed the whole profits of their labour—a spirit of busy cheerfulness would soon diffuse itself through every cottage work would become easy and habitual when absolutely necessary for daily subsistence and the peasant would go through his task without a murmur if assured that he and his children when incapable of work through infancy age or infirmity would then and then only be entitled to support from his opulent neighbours this appears to have been the plan of the statute of queen elizabeth in which the only defect was confining the management of the poor to small parochial districts which are frequently incapable of furnishing proper work or providing an able director however the laborious poor were then at liberty to seek employment wherever it was to be had none being obliged to reside in the places of their settlement but such as were unable or unwilling to work and those places of settlement being only such where they      were born or had made their abode originally for three yearso and afterwards in the case of vagabonds for one year onlyp after the restoration a very different plan was adopted which has rendered the employment of the poor more difficult by authorizing the subdivisions of parishes has greatly increased their number by confining them all to their respective districts has given birth to the intricacy of our poorlaws by multiplying and rendering more easy the methods of gaining settlements and in consequence has created an infinity of expensive lawsuits between contending neighbourhoods concerning those settlements and removals by the statute        car ii c    a legal settlement was declared to be gained by birth or by inhabitancy apprenticeship or service for forty days within which period all intruders were made removable from any parish by two justices of the peace unless they settled in a tenement of the annual value of  0l the frauds naturally consequent upon this provision which gave a settlement by so short a residence produced a statute   jac ii c    which directed notice in writing to be delivered to the parish officers before a settlement could be gained by such residence subsequent provisions allowed other circumstances of notoriety to be equivalent to such notice given and those circumstances have from time to time been altered enlarged or restrained whenever the experience of new inconveniences arising daily from new regulations suggested the necessity of a remedy and the doctrine of certificates was invented by way of counterpoise to restrain a man and his family from acquiring a new     settlement by any length of residence whatever unless in two particular excepted cases which makes parishes very cautious of giving such certificates and of course confines the poor at home where frequently no adequate employment can be had the law of settlements may be therefore now reduced to the following general heads or a settlement in a parish may be acquired   by birth for wherever a child is first known      to be that is always prima facie the place of settlement until some other can be shownq this is also generally the place of settlement of a bastard childr for a bastard having in the eye of the law no father cannot be referred to his settlement as other children mays but in legitimate children though the place of birth be prima facie the settlement yet it is not conclusively so for there are   settlements by parentage being the settlement of ones father or mother all legitimate children being really settled in the parish where their parents are settled until they get a new settlement for themselvest a new settlement may be acquired several ways as   by marriage for a woman marrying a man that is settled in another parish changes her own settlement the law not permitting the separation of husband and wifeu but if the man has no settlement hers is suspended during his life if he remains in england and is able to maintain her but in his absence or after his death or during perhaps his inability she may be removed to her old settlementv the other methods of acquiring settlements in any parish are all reducible to this one of forty days residence therein but this forty days residence which is to be construed to be lodging or lying there must not be by fraud or stealth or in any clandestine manner but made notorious by one or other of the following concomitant circumstances the next method therefore of gaining a settlement is   by forty days residence and notice for if a stranger comes into a parish and delivers notice in writing of his place of abode and number of his family to one of the overseers which must be read in the church and registered and resides there unmolested for forty days after such notice he is legally settled therebyw for the law presumes that such a one at the time of notice is not likely to become chargeable else he would not venture to give it or that in such case the parish would take care to remove him but there are also other circumstances equivalent to such notice therefore   renting for a year      a tenement of the yearly value of ten pounds and residing forty days in the parish gains a settlement without noticex upon the principle of having substance enough to gain credit for such a house   being charged to and paying the public taxes and levies of the parish excepting those for scavengers highwaysy and the duties on houses and windowsz and   executing when legally appointed any public parochial office for a whole year in the parish as churchwarden c are both of them equivalent to notice and gain a settlementa if coupled with a residence of forty days   being hired for a year when unmarried and childless and serving a year in the same service and   being bound an apprentice gives the servant and apprentice a settlement without noticeb in that place wherein they serve the last forty days this is meant to encourage application to trades and going out to reputable services  0 lastly the having an estate of ones own and residing thereon forty days however small the value may be in case it be acquired by act of law or of a third person as by descent gift devise c is a sufficient settlementc but if a man acquire it by his own act as by purchase in its popular sense in consideration of money paid then unless the consideration advanced bona fide be editor illegible character0l it is no settlement for any longer time than the person shall inhabit thereond he is in no case removable from his own property but he shall not     by any trifling or fraudulent purchase of his own acquire a permanent and lasting settlement all persons not so settled may be removed to their own parishes on complaint of the overseers by two justices of the peace if they shall adjudge them likely to become chargeable to the parish into which they have intruded unless they are in a way of getting a legal settlement as by having hired a house of  0l per annum or living in an      annual service for then they are not removablee and in all other cases if the parish to which they belong will grant them a certificate acknowledging them to be their parishioners they cannot be removed merely because likely to become chargeable but only when they become actually chargeablef but such certificated person can gain no settlement by any of the means above mentioned unless by renting a tenement of  0l per annum or by serving an annual office in the parish being legally placed therein neither can an apprentice or servant to such certificated person gain a settlement by such their serviceg these are the general heads of the laws relating to the poor which by the resolutions of the courts of justice thereon within a century past are branched into a great variety   and yet notwithstanding the pains that have been taken about them they still remain very imperfect and inadequate to the purposes they are designed for a fate that has generally attended most of our statute laws where they have not the foundation of the common law to build on when the shires the hundreds and the tithings were kept in the same admirable order in which they were disposed by the great alfred there were no persons idle consequently none but the impotent that needed relief and the statute of    eliz seems entirely founded on the same principle but when this excellent scheme was neglected and departed from we cannot but observe with concern what miserable shifts and lame expedients have from time to time been adopted in order to patch up the flaws occasioned by this neglect there is not a more necessary or more certain maxim in the frame and constitution of society than that every individual must contribute his share in order to the wellbeing of the community and surely they must be very deficient in sound policy who suffer one half of a parish to continue idle dissolute and unemployed and at length are amazed to find that the industry of the other half is not able to maintain the whole chapter x of the people whether aliens denizens or natives having in the eight preceding chapters treated of persons as they stand in the public relations of magistrates i now proceed to consider such persons as fall under the denomination of the people and herein all the inferior and subordinate magistrates treated of in the last chapter are included the first and most obvious division of the people is into aliens and naturalborn subjects  naturalborn subjects are such as are born within the dominions     of the crown of england that is within the ligeance or as it is generally called the allegiance of the king and aliens such as are born out of it allegiance is the tie or ligamen which binds the subject to the king in return for that protection which the king affords the subject the thing itself or substantial part of it is founded in reason and the nature of government the name and the form are derived to us from our gothic ancestors under the feodal system every owner of lands held them in subjection to some superior or lord from whom or whose ancestors the tenant or vassal had received them and there was a mutual trust or confidence subsisting between the lord and vassal that the lord should protect the vassal in the enjoyment of the territory he had granted him and on the      other hand that the vassal should be faithful to the lord and defend him against all his enemies this obligation on the part of the vassal was called fidelitas or fealty and an oath of fealty was required by the feodal law to be taken by all tenants to their landlord which is couched in almost the same terms as our ancient oath of allegiancea except that in the usual oath of fealty there was frequently a saving or exception of the faith due to a superior lord by name under whom the landlord himself was perhaps only a tenant or vassal but when the acknowledgment was made to the absolute superior himself who was vassal to no man it was no longer called the oath of fealty but the oath of allegiance and therein the tenant swore to bear faith to his sovereign lord in opposition to all men without any saving or exception—contra omnes homines fidelitatem fecitb land held by this exalted species of fealty was called feudum ligium a liege fee the vassals homines ligii or liege men and the sovereign their dominus ligius or liege lord and when sovereign princes did homage to each other for lands held under their respective sovereignties a distinction was always made between simple homage which was only an acknowledgment of tenurec and liege homage which included the fealty before mentioned and the services consequent upon it thus when our edward iii in      did homage to philip vi of france for his ducal dominions on that continent it was warmly disputed of what species the homage was to be whether liege or simple homaged but with us in england it becoming a settled principle of tenure that all lands in the kingdom are holden of the king as their sovereign and lord paramount no oath but that of fealty could ever be taken to inferior lords and the oath of allegiance was necessarily confined to the person of the king alone by an easy analogy the term of allegiance was soon brought to signify all other engagements which are due from subjects to their prince as well as those duties which were simply and merely territorial and the oath of allegiance as administered for      upwards of six hundred yearse contained a promise to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene honour and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him     without defending him therefrom upon which sir matthew halef makes this remark that it was short and plain not entangled with long or intricate clauses or declarations and yet is comprehensive of the whole duty from the subject to his sovereign but at the revolution the terms of this oath being thought perhaps to favour too much the notion of nonresistance the present form was introduced by the convention parliament which is more general and indeterminate than the former the subject only promising that he will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the king without mentioning his heirs or specifying in the least wherein that allegiance consists the oath of supremacy is principally calculated as a renunciation of the popes pretended authority and the oath of abjuration introduced in the reign of king williamg very amply supplies the loose and general texture of the oath of allegiance it recognising the right of his majesty derived under the act of settlement engaging to support him to the utmost of the jurors power promising to disclose all traitorous conspiracies against him and expressly renouncing any claim of the descendants of the late pretender in as clear and explicit terms as the english language can furnish this oath must be taken by all persons in any office trust or employment and may be tendered by two justices of the peace to any person whom they shall suspect of disaffectionh and the oath of allegiance may be tenderedi to all persons above the age of twelve years whether natives denizens or aliens either in the courtleet of the manor or in the sheriffs tourn which is the courtleet of the county but besides these express engagements the law also holds that there is an implied original and virtual allegiance      owing from every subject to his sovereign antecedently to any express promise and although the subject never swore any faith or allegiance in form for as the king by the descent of the crown is fully invested with all the rights and bound to all the duties of sovereignty before his coronation so the subject is bound to his prince by an intrinsic allegiance before the superinduction of those outward bonds of oath homage and fealty which were only instituted to remind the subject of this his previous duty and for the better securing its performancek the formal profession therefore or oath of subjection is nothing more than a declaration in words of what was before implied in law which occasions sir edward coke very justly to observel that all subjects are equally bounden to their allegiance as if they had taken the oath because it is written by the finger of the law in their hearts and the taking of the corporal oath is but an outward declaration of the same the sanction of an oath it is true in case of violation of duty makes the guilt still more accumulated by superadding perjury to treason but it does not increase the civil obligation to loyalty it only strengthens the social tie by uniting it with that of religion allegiance both express and implied is however distinguished by the law into two sorts or species the one natural the other local the former being also perpetual the latter temporary natural allegiance is such as is due from all men born within the kings dominions immediately upon their birthm for immediately upon their birth they are under the kings protection at a time too when during their infancy they are incapable of protecting themselves natural allegiance is therefore a debt of gratitude which cannot be forfeited cancelled or altered by any change of time place or circumstance nor by any thing but the united concurrence of the legislaturen an englishman who removes to france or to china owes the same allegiance    0 to the king of england there as at home and twenty years hence as well as now for it is a principle of universal lawo that the naturalborn subject of one prince cannot by any act of his own no not by swearing allegiance to another put off or discharge his natural allegiance to the former for this natural allegiance was intrinsic and primitive and antecedent to the other and cannot be   0 devested without the concurrent act of that prince to whom it was first due  indeed the naturalborn subject of one prince to whom he owes allegiance may be entangled by subjecting himself absolutely to another but it is his own act that brings him into these straits and difficulties of owing service to two masters and it is unreasonable that by such voluntary act of his own he should be able at pleasure to unloose those bands by which he is connected to his natural prince    0 local allegiance is such as is due from an alien or stranger born for so long time as he continues within the kings dominion and protectionp and it ceases the instant such stranger transfers himself from this kingdom to another  natural allegiance is therefore perpetual and local temporary only and that for this reason evidently founded upon the nature of government that allegiance is a debt due from the subject upon an implied contract with the prince that so long as the one affords protection so long the other will demean himself faithfully as therefore the prince is always under a constant tie to protect his naturalborn subjects at all times and in all countries for this reason their allegiance due to him is equally universal and permanent but on the other hand as the prince affords his protection to an alien only during his residence in this realm the allegiance of an alien is confined in point of time to the duration of such his residence and in point of locality to the dominions of the british empire from which considerations sir matthew haleq deduces this consequence that though there be a usurper of the crown yet it is treason for any subject while the usurper is in full possession of the sovereignty to      practise any thing against his crown and dignity wherefore although the true prince regain the sovereignty yet such attempts against the usurper unless in defence or aid of the rightful king have been afterwards punished with death because of the breach of that temporary allegiance which was due to him as king de facto and upon this footing after edward iv recovered the crown which had been long detained from his house by the line of lancaster treasons committed against henry vi were capitally punished though henry had been declared a usurper by parliament this oath of allegiance or rather the allegiance itself is held to be applicable not only to the political capacity of the king or regal office but to his natural person and bloodroyal and for the misapplication of their allegiance viz to the regal capacity or crown exclusive of the person of the king were the spencers banished in the reign of edward iir and from hence arose that principle of personal attachment and affectionate loyalty which induced our forefathers and if occasion required would doubtless induce their sons to hazard all that was dear to them life fortune and family in defence and support of their liege lord and sovereign      this allegiance then both express and implied is the duty of all the kings subjects under the distinctions here laid down of local and temporary or universal and perpetual their rights are also distinguishable by the same criterions of time and locality naturalborn subjects having a great variety of rights which they acquire by being born within the kings ligeance and ear never forfeit by any distance of place or time but only by their own misbehaviour the explanation of which rights is the principal subject of the two first books of these commentaries the same is also in some degree the case of aliens though their rights are much more circumscribed being acquired only by residence here and lost whenever they remove i shall however here endeavour to chalk out some of the principal lines whereby      they are distinguished from natives descending to further particulars when they come in course an alien born may purchase lands or other estates but not for his own use for the king is thereupon entitled to thems  if an alien could acquire a permanent property in lands he must owe an allegiance equally permanent with that property to the king of england which would probably be inconsistent with that which he owes to his own natural liege lord besides that thereby the nation might in time be subject to foreign influence and feel many other inconveniences  wherefore by the civil law such contracts were also made voidt     but the prince had no such advantage of forfeiture thereby as with us in england among other reasons which might be given for our constitution it seems to be intended by way of punishment for the aliens presumption in attempting to acquire any landed property for the vendor is not affected by it he having resigned his right and received an equivalent in exchange yet an alien may acquire a property in goods money and other personal estate or may hire a house for his habitationu  for personal estate is of a transitory and movable nature and besides this indulgence to strangers is necessary for the advancement of trade aliens also may trade as freely as other people only they are subject to certain higher duties at the customhouse  and there are also some obsolete statutes of hen viii prohibiting alien artificers to work for themselves in this kingdom but it is generally held that they were virtually repealed by statute   eliz c   0 also an alien may bring an action concerning personal property and may make a will and dispose of his personal estatew not as it is in france where the king at the death of an alien is entitled to all he is worth by the droit daubaine or jus albinatusx unless he has a peculiar exemption   when i mention these rights of an alien i must be understood of alien friends only or such whose countries are in peace with ours for alien enemies have no      rights no privileges unless by the kings special favour during the time of war   when i say that an alien is one who is born out of the kings dominions or allegiance this also must be understood with some restrictions the common law indeed stood absolutely so with only a very few exceptions so that a particular act of parliament became necessary after the restorationy for the naturalization of the children of his majestys english subjects born in foreign countries during the late troubles and this maxim of the law proceeded upon a general principle that every man owes natural allegiance where he is born and cannot owe two such allegiances or serve two masters at once yet the children of the kings ambassadors born abroad were always held to be natural subjectsz for as the father though in a foreign country owes not even a local allegiance to the prince to whom he is sent so with regard to the son also he was held by a kind of postliminium to be born under the king of englands allegiance represented by his father the ambassador to encourage also foreign commerce it was enacted by statute    edw iii st   that all children born abroad provided both their parents were at the time of the birth in allegiance     to the king and the mother had passed the seas by her husbands consent might inherit as if born in england and accordingly it hath been so adjudged in behalf of merchantsa but by several more modern statutesb these restrictions are still further taken off so that all children born out of the kings ligeance whose fathers or grandfathers by the fathers side were naturalborn subjects are now deemed to be naturalborn subjects themselves to all intents and purposes unless their said ancestors were attainted or banished beyond sea for high treason or were at the birth of such children in the service of a prince at enmity with great britain   yet the grandchildren of such ancestors shall not be privileged in respect of the aliens duty except they be protestants and actually reside within the realm nor shall be enabled to claim any estate or interest unless the claim be made within five years after the same shall accrue   the children of aliens born here in england are generally speaking naturalborn subjects   and entitled to all the      privileges of such in which the constitution of france differs from ours for there by their jus albinatus if a child be born of foreign parents it is an alienc   a denizen is an alien born but who has obtained ex donatione regis letters patent to make him an english subject a high and incommunicable branch of the royal prerogatived a denizen is in a kind of middle state between an alien and naturalborn subject and partakes of both of them he may take lands by purchase or devise which an alien may not but cannot take by inheritancee for his parent through whom he must claim being an alien had no inheritable blood and therefore could convey none to the son   and upon a     like defect of hereditary blood the issue of a denizen born before denization cannot inherit to him but his issue born after mayf a denizen is not excusedg from paying the aliens duty and some other mercantile burdens and no denizen can be of the privy council or either house of parliament or have any office of trust civil or military or be capable of any grant of lands c from the crownh   naturalization cannot be performed but by act of parliament for by this an alien is put in exactly the same state as if he had been born in the kings ligeance except only that he is incapable as well as a denizen of being a member of the privy council or parliament holding offices grants ci   no     bill for naturalization can be received in either house of parliament without such disabling clause in itj nor without a clause disabling the person from obtaining any immunity in trade thereby in any foreign country unless he shall have resided in britain for seven years next after the commencement of the session in which he is naturalizedk neither can any person be naturalized or restored in blood unless he hath received the sacrament of the lords supper within one month before the bringing in of the bill and unless he also takes the oaths of allegiance and supremacy in the presence of the parliamentl but these provisions have been usually dispensed with by special acts of parliament previous to bills of naturalization of any foreign princes or princessesm      these are the principal distinctions between aliens denizens and natives distinctions which it hath been frequently endeavoured since the commencement of this century to lay almost totally aside by one general naturalizationact for all foreign protestants an attempt which was once carried into execution by the statute   anne c   but this after three years experience of it was repealed by the statute  0 anne c   except one clause which was just now mentioned for naturalizing the children of english parents born abroad however every foreign seaman who in time of war serves two years on board an english ship by virtue of the kings proclamation is ipso facto naturalized under the like restrictions as in statute    w iii c  n and all foreign protestants and jews upon their residing seven years in any of the american colonies without being absent above two months at a time and all foreign protestants serving two years in a military capacity there or being three years employed in the whale fishery without afterwards absenting themselves from the kings dominions for more than one year and none of them falling within the incapacities declared by statute   geo ii c    shall be upon taking the oaths of allegiance and abjuration or in some cases an affirmation to the same effect naturalized to all intents and purposes as if they had been born in this kingdom except as to sitting in parliament or in the privy council and holding offices or grants of lands c from the crown within the kingdoms of great britain or irelando they therefore are admissible to all other privileges which protestants or jews born in this kingdom are entitled to what those privileges are with respect to jewsp in particular was the subject of very high debates about the time of the famous jewbillq which enables all fews to prefer bills of naturalization in parliament without receiving the sacrament as ordained by statute   jac i it is not my intention to revive this controversy again for the act lived only a few months and was then repealedr therefore peace be now to its manes 0     chapter xi of the clergy the people whether aliens denizens or naturalborn subjects are divisible into two kinds the clergy and laity the clergy comprehending all persons in holy orders and in ecclesiastical offices will be the subject of the following chapter this venerable body of men being separate and set apart from the rest of     the people in order to attend the more closely to the service of almighty god have thereupon large privileges allowed them by our municipal laws and had formerly much greater which were abridged at the time of the reformation on account of the ill use which the popish clergy had endeavoured to make of them for the laws having exempted them from almost every personal duty     they attempted a total exemption from every secular tie but it is observed by sir edward cokea that as the overflowing of waters doth many times make the river to lose its proper channel so in times past ecclesiastical persons seeking to extend their liberties beyond their true bounds either lost or enjoyed not those which of right belonged to them the personal exemptions do indeed for the most part continue a clergyman cannot be compelled to serve on a jury nor to appear at a courtleet or view of frankpledge which almost every other person is obliged to dob but if a layman is      summoned on a jury and before the trial takes orders he shall notwithstanding appear and be swornc neither can he be chosen to any temporal office as bailiff reeve constable or the like in regard of his own continual attendance on the sacred functiond  during his attendance on divine service he is privileged from arrests in civil suitse  in cases also of felony a clerk in orders shall have the benefit of his clergy without being branded in the hand and may likewise have it more than once  in both which particulars he is distinguished     from a laymanf but as they have their privileges so also they have their disabilities on account of their spiritual avocations clergymen we have seeng are incapable of sitting in the house of commons and by statute    hen viii c    are not in general allowed to take any lands or tenements to farm upon pain of  0l per month and total avoidance of the lease  nor upon like pain to keep any tanhouse or brewhouse nor shall engage in any manner of trade nor sell any merchandise under forfeiture of the treble value which prohibition is consonant to the canon law in the frame and constitution of ecclesiastical polity there are divers ranks and degrees which i shall consider in their respective order merely as they are taken notice of by the secular laws of england without intermeddling with the canons and constitutions by which the clergy have bound themselves and under each division i shall consider   the method of their appointment   their rights and duties and   the manner wherein their character or office may cease i an archbishop or bishop is elected by the chapter of his cathedral church by virtue of a license from the crown election was in very early times the usual mode of elevation to the episcopal chair throughout all christendom and this was promiscuously performed by the laity as well as the clergyh till at length it becoming tumultuous the      emperors and other sovereigns of the respective kingdoms of europe took the appointment in some degree into their own hands by reserving to themselves the right of confirming these elections and of granting investiture of the temporalties which now began almost universally to be annexed to this spiritual dignity without which confirmation and investiture the elected bishop could neither be consecrated nor receive any secular profits this right was acknowledged in the emperor charlemagne ad     by pope hadrian i and the council of laterani and universally exercised by other christian princes but the policy of the court of rome at the same time began by degrees to exclude the laity from any share in these elections and to confine them wholly to the clergy which at length was completely effected the mere form of election appearing to the people to be a thing of little consequence while the crown was in possession of an absolute negative which was almost equivalent to a direct right of nomination hence the right of appointing to bishoprics is said to have been in the crown of englandk as well as other kingdoms in europe even in the saxon times because the rights of confirmation and investiture were in effect though not in form a right of complete donationl but when by length of time the custom of making elections by the clergy only was fully established the popes     began to except to the usual method of granting these investitures which was per annulum et baculum by the princes delivering to the prelate a ring and pastoral staff or crosier pretending that this was an encroachment on the churchs authority and an attempt by these symbols to confer a spiritual jurisdiction and pope gregory vii towards the close of the eleventh century published a bull of excommunication against all princes who should dare to confer investitures and all prelates who should venture to receive themm this was a bold step towards effecting the plan then adopted by      the roman see of rendering the clergy entirely independent of the civil authority and long and eager were the contests occasioned by this papal claim but at length when the emperor henry v agreed to remove all suspicion of encroachment on the spiritual character by conferring investitures for the future per sceptrum and not per annulum et baculum and when the kings of england and france consented also to alter the form in their kingdoms and receive only homage from the bishops for their temporalties instead of investing them by the ring and crosier the court of rome found it prudent to suspend for a while its other pretensionsn this concession was obtained from king henry the first in england by means of that obstinate and arrogant prelate archbishop anselmo but king john about a century afterwards in order to obtain the protection of the pope against his discontented barons was also prevailed upon to give up by a charter to all the monasteries and cathedrals in the kingdom the free right of electing their prelates whether abbots or bishops reserving only to the crown the custody of the temporalties during the vacancy the form of granting a license to elect which is the original of our conge deslire on refusal whereof the electors might proceed without it and the right of approbation afterwards which was not to be denied without a reasonable and lawful causep this grant was expressly recognised and confirmed by king johns magna cartaq and was again established by statute    edw iii st   §   but by statute    hen viii c  0 the ancient right of nomination was in effect restored to the crown  it being enacted that at every future avoidance of a bishopric the king may send the dean and chapter his usual license to proceed to election which is always to be accompanied with a letter missive from the king containing the name of the person whom he would have them elect and if the dean and chapter delay their election above twelve days the    0 nomination shall devolve to the king who may be letterspatent appoint such person as he pleases this election or nomination if it be of a bishop must be signified by the kings letterspatent to the archbishop of the province if it be of an archbishop to the other archbishop and two bishops or to four bishops requiring them to confirm invest and consecrate the person so elected which they are bound to perform immediately without any application to the see of rome after which the bishop elect shall sue to the king for his temporalties shall make oath to the king and none other and shall take restitution of his secular possessions out of the kings hands only and if such dean and chapter do not elect in the manner by this act appointed or if such archbishop or bishop do refuse to confirm invest and consecrate such bishop elect they shall incur all the penalties of a præmunire    0 an archbishop is the chief of the clergy in a whole province  and has the inspection of the bishops of that province as well as of the inferior clergy and   0 may deprive them on notorious causer  the archbishop has also his own diocese wherein he exercises episcopal jurisdiction as in his province he exercises archiepiscopal as archbishop he upon receipt of the kings writ calls the bishops and clergy of his province to meet in convocation but without the kings writ he cannot assemble thems to him all appeals are made from inferior jurisdictions within his province and as an appeal lies from the bishops in person to him in person so it also lies from the consistory courts of each diocese to his archiepiscopal court during the vacancy of any see in his province he is guardian of the spiritualities thereof as the king is of the temporalties and he executes all ecclesiastical jurisdiction therein if an archiepiscopal see be vacant the dean and chapter are the spiritual guardians ever since the office of prior of canterbury was abolished at the reformationt the archbishop is entitled to present by lapse to all the ecclesiastical livings in the disposal of his      diocesan bishops if not filled within six months and the archbishop has a customary prerogative when a bishop is consecrated by him to name a clerk or chaplain of his own to be provided for by such suffragan bishop in lieu of which it is now usual for the bishop to make over by deed to the archbishop his executors and assigns the next presentation of such dignity or benefice in the bishops disposal within that see as the archbishop himself shall choose which is therefore called his optionu which options are only binding on the bishop himself who grants them and not on his successors  the prerogative itself seems to be derived from the legatine power formerly annexed by the popes to the metropolitan of canterburyw and we may add that the papal claim itself like most others of that encroaching see was probably set up in imitation of the imperial prerogative called primæ or primariæ preces whereby the emperor exercises and hath immemorially exercisedx a right of naming to the first prebend that becomes vacant after his accession in every church of the empirey a right that was also exercised by the crown of england in the reign of edward iz and which probably gave rise to the royal corodies which were mentioned in a former chaptera it is likewise the privilege by custom of the archbishop of canterbury to crown the kings and queens of this kingdom 0 and he hath also by the statute    hen viii c    the power of granting dispensations in any case not contrary to the holy scriptures and the law of god where the pope used formerly to grant them which is the foundation of his granting special licenses to marry at any     place or time to hold two livings and the like   and on this also is founded the right he exercises of conferring degrees   in prejudice of the two universitiesb      the power and authority of a bishop besides the administration of certain holy ordinances peculiar to that sacred order consist principally in inspecting the manners of the people and clergy and punishing them in order to reformation by ecclesiastical censures   to this purpose he has several courts under him and may visit at pleasure every part of his diocese his chancellor is appointed to hold his courts for him and to assist him in matters of ecclesiastical law   who as well as all other ecclesiastical officers if lay or married must be a doctor of the civil law so created in some universityc it is also the business of a bishop to institute and to direct induction to all ecclesiastical livings in his diocese archbishoprics and bishoprics may become void by death deprivation for any gross and notorious crime and also by resignation all resignations must be made to some superiord therefore a bishop must resign to his metropolitan but the archbishop can resign to none but the king himself ii a dean and chapter are the council of the bishop to assist him with their advice in affairs of religion and also in the temporal concerns of his seee when the rest of the clergy were settled in the several parishes of each diocese as hath formerlyf been mentioned these were reserved for the celebration of divine service in the bishops own cathedral and the chief of them who presided over the rest obtained the name of decanus or dean being probably at first appointed to superintend ten canons or prebendaries all ancient deans are elected by the chapter by conge deslire from the king and letters missive of recommendation in the same manner as bishops   but in those chapters that were founded by henry viii out of the spoils of the dissolved monasteries   the deanery is donative and the installation      merely by the kings letterspatentg the chapter consisting of canons or     prebendaries are sometimes appointed by the king sometimes by the bishop and sometimes elected by each other   the dean and chapter are as was before observed the nominal electors of a bishop the bishop is their ordinary   and immediate superior and has generally speaking the power of visiting them and correcting their excesses and enormities they had also a check on the bishop at common law for till the statute    hen viii c    his grant or lease would not have bound his successors unless confirmed by the dean and chapterh deaneries and prebends may become void like a bishopric by death by deprivation or by resignation to either the king or the bishopi also i may here mention once for all that if a dean prebendary or other spiritual person be made a bishop all the preferments of which he was before possessed are void and the king may present to them in right of his prerogative royal but they are not void by the election but only by the consecrationj iii an archdeacon hath an ecclesiastical jurisdiction immediately subordinate to the bishop throughout the whole of his diocese or in some particular part of it   he is usually appointed by the bishop himself and hath a kind of episcopal authority originally derived from the bishop but now independent and distinct from hisk 0 he therefore visits the clergy and has his separate court for punishment of offenders by spiritual censures and for hearing all other causes of ecclesiastical cognizance iv the rural deans are very ancient officers of the churchl but almost grown out of use though their deaneries still subsist as an ecclesiastical division of the diocese or archdeaconry they seem to have been deputies of the      bishop planted all round his diocese the better to inspect the conduct of the parochial clergy to inquire into and report dilapidations and to examine the candidates for confirmation and armed in minuter matters with an inferior degree of judicial and coercive authoritym       v the next and indeed the most numerous order of men in the system of ecclesiastical polity are the parsons and vicars of churches in treating of whom i shall first mark out the distinction between them shall next observe the method by which one may become a parson or vicar shall then briefly touch upon their rights and duties and shall lastly show how one may cease to be either a parson persona ecclesiæ is one that hath full possession of all the rights of a parochial church he is called parson persona because by his person the church which is an invisible body is represented and he is in himself a body corporate in order to protect and defend the rights of the church which he personates by a perpetual successionn he is sometimes called the rector or governor of the church but the appellation of parson however it may be depreciated by familiar clownish and indiscriminate use is the most legal most beneficial and most honourable title that a parish priest can enjoy because such a one sir edward coke observes and he only is said vicem seu personam ecclesiæ gerere a parson has during his life the freehold in himself of the parsonage house the glebe the tithes and other dues but these are sometimes appropriated that is to say the benefice is perpetually annexed to some spiritual corporation either sole or aggregate being the patron of the living which the law esteems equally capable of providing for the service of the church as any single private clergyman this contrivance seems to have sprung from the policy of the monastic orders who have never been deficient in subtle inventions for the increase of their own power and emoluments at the first establishment of parochial clergy the tithes of the parish were distributed in a fourfold division one for the use of the bishop another for maintaining      the fabric of the church a third for the poor and the fourth to provide for the incumbent when the sees of the bishops became otherwise amply endowed they were prohibited from demanding their usual share of these tithes and the division was into three parts only and hence it was inferred by the monasteries that a small part was sufficient for the officiating priest and that the remainder might well be applied to the use of their own fraternities the endowment of which was construed to be a work of the most exalted piety subject to the burden of repairing the church and providing for its constant supply and therefore they begged and bought for masses and obits and sometimes even for money all the advowsons within their reach and then appropriated the benefices to the use of their own corporation but in order to complete such appropriation effectually the kings license and consent of the bishop must first be obtained because both the king and the bishop may some time or other have an interest by lapse in the presentation to the benefice which can never happen if it be appropriated to the use of a corporation which never dies and also because the law reposes a confidence in them that they will not consent to any thing that shall be to the prejudice of the church the consent of the patron also is necessarily implied because as was before observed the appropriation can be originally made to none but to such spiritual corporation as is also the patron of the church the whole being indeed nothing else but an allowance for the patrons to retain the tithes and glebe in their own hands without presenting any clerk they themselves undertaking to provide for the service of the churcho when the appropriation is thus made the appropriators and their successors are perpetual parsons of the church and must sue and be sued in all matters concerning the rights of the church by the name of parsonsp this appropriation may be severed and the church become disappropriate two ways as first if the patron or appropriator presents a clerk who is instituted and inducted      to the parsonage for the incumbent so instituted and inducted is to all intents and purposes complete parson and the appropriation being once severed can never be reunited again unless by a repetition of the same solemnitiesq and when the clerk so presented   is distinct     from the vicar the rectory thus vested in him becomes what is called a sinecure   because he hath no cure of souls having a vicar under him to whom that cure is committedr also if the corporation which has the appropriation is dissolved the parsonage becomes disappropriate at common law because the perpetuity of person is gone which is necessary to support the appropriation in this manner and subject to these conditions may appropriations be made at this day   and thus were most if not all of the appropriations at present existing originally made being annexed to bishoprics prebends religious houses nay even to nunneries and certain military orders all of which were spiritual corporations at the dissolution of monasteries by statutes    hen viii c    and    hen viii c    the appropriations of the several parsonages which belonged to those respective religious houses amounting to more than onethird of all the parishes in englands would have been by the rules of the common law disappropriated had not a clause in those statutes intervened to give them to the king in as ample a manner as the abbots c formerly held the same at the time of their dissolution this though perhaps scarcely defensible was not without example for the same was done in former reigns when the alien priories that is such as were filled by foreigners only were dissolved and given to the crownt and from these two roots have sprung all the lay appropriations or secular parsonages which we now see in the kingdom they having been afterwards granted out from time to time by the crownu      these appropriating corporations or religious houses were wont to depute one of their own body to perform divine service and administer the sacraments in those parishes of which the society was thus the parson this officiating minister was in reality no more than a curate deputy or vicegerent of the appropriator and therefore called vicarius or vicar his stipend was at the discretion of the appropriator who was however bound of common right to find somebody qui illi de temporalibus episcopo de spiritualibus debeat responderew   but this was done in so scandalous a manner and the parishes suffered so much by the neglect of the appropriators that the legislature was     forced to interpose and accordingly it is enacted by statute    ric ii c   that in all appropriations of churches the diocesan bishop shall ordain in propertion to the value of the church a competent sum to be distributed among the poor parishioners annually and that the vicarage shall be sufficiently endowed it seems the parish were frequently sufferers not only by the want of divine service but also by withholding those alms for which among other purposes the payment of tithes was originally imposed and therefore in this act a pension is directed to be distributed among the poor parochians as well as a sufficient stipend to the vicar but he being liable to be removed at the pleasure of the appropriator was not likely to insist too rigidly on the legal sufficiency of the stipend and therefore by statute   hen iv c    it is ordained that the vicar shall be a secular person not a member of any religious house that he shall be vicar perpetual not removable at the caprice of the monastery and that he shall be canonically instituted and inducted and be sufficiently endowed at the discretion of the ordinary for these three express purposes to do divine service to inform the people and to keep hospitality   the endowments in consequence of these statutes have usually been by a portion of the glebe or land belonging to the parsonage and a particular share of the tithes which the appropriators found it most troublesome to collect and which are      therefore generally called privy or small tithes the greater or predial tithes being still reserved to their own use but one and the same rule was not observed in the endowment of all vicarages hence some are more liberally and some more scantily endowed and hence the tithes of many things as wood in particular are in some parishes rectorial and in some vicarial tithes the distinction therefore of a parson and vicar is this the parson has for the most part the whole right to all the ecclesiastical dues in his parish but a vicar has generally an appropriator over him entitled to the best part of the profits to whom he is in effect perpetual curate with a standing salary   though in some places the vicarage has been considerably augmented by a large share of the great tithes which augmentations were greatly assisted by the statute    car ii c   enacted in favour of poor vicars and curates which rendered such temporary augmentations when made by the appropriators perpetual       the method of becoming a parson or vicar is much the same to both there are four requisites necessary holy orders presentation institution and induction the method of conferring holy orders of deacon and priest according to the liturgy and canonsx is foreign to the purpose of these commentaries any further than as they are necessary requisites to make a complete parson or vicar by common law a deacon of any age might be instituted and inducted to a parsonage or vicarage but it was ordained by statute    eliz c    that no person under twentythree years of age and in deacons orders should be presented to any benefice with cure and if he were not ordained priest within one year after his induction he should be ipso facto deprived and now by statute        car ii c   no person is capable to be admitted to any benefice unless he hath been first ordained a priest   and then he is in the language of the law a clerk in orders but if he obtains orders or a license      to preach by money or corrupt practices which seems to be the true though not the common notion of simony the person giving such orders forfeitsy  0l and the person receiving  0l and is incapable of any ecclesiastical preferment for seven years afterwards any clerk may be presentedz to a parsonage or vicarage that is the patron to whom the advowson of the church belongs may offer his clerk to the bishop of the diocese to be instituted of advowsons or the right of presentation being a species of private property we shall find a more convenient place to treat in the second part of these commentaries but when a clerk is presented the bishop may refuse him upon many accounts as   if the patron is excommunicated and remains in contempt forty daysa or   if the clerk be unfitb which unfitness is of several kinds first with regard to his person as if he be a bastard an outlaw an excommunicate an alien under age or the likec next with regard to his faith or morals as for any particular heresy or vice that is malum in se but if the bishop alleges only in generals as that he is schismaticus inveteratus or objects a fault that is malum prohibitum merely as haunting taverns playing at unlawful games or the like it is not good cause of refusald or lastly the clerk may be unfit to discharge the pastoral office for want of learning in any of which cases the bishop may refuse the clerk in case the refusal is for heresy schism inability of learning or other matter of ecclesiastical cognizance there the bishop must give notice to the patron of such his cause of refusal who being usually a layman is not supposed to have knowledge of it else he cannot present by lapse but if the cause be temporal there he is not bound to give noticee    0 if an action at law be brought by the patron against the bishop for refusing his clerk the bishop must assign the cause if the cause be of a temporal nature and the fact admitted as for instance outlawry the judges of the kings courts must determine its validity or whether it be sufficient cause of refusal but if the fact be denied it must be determined by a jury if the cause be of a spiritual nature as heresy particularly alleged the fact if denied shall also be determined by a jury and if the fact be admitted or found the court upon consultation and advice of learned divines shall decide its sufficiencyf if the cause be want of learning the bishop   0 need not specify in what points the clerk is deficient but only allege that he is deficientg for the statute   edw ii st   c    is express that the examination of the fitness of a person presented to a benefice belongs to the ecclesiastical judge but because it would be nugatory in this case to demand the reason of refusal from the ordinary if the patron were bound to abide by his determination who has already pronounced his clerk unfit therefore if the bishop returns the clerk to be minus sufficiens in literatura the court shall write to the metropolitan to reexamine him and certify his qualifications which certificate of the archbishop is finalh if the bishop hath no objections but admits the patrons presentation the clerk so admitted is next to be instituted by him which is a kind of investiture of the spiritual part of the benefice for by institution the care of the souls of the parish is committed to the charge of the clerk when a vicar is instituted he besides the usual forms takes if required by the bishop an oath of perpetual residence for the maxim of law is that vicarius non habet vicarium and as the nonresidence of the appropriators was the cause of the perpotual establishment of vicarages the law judges it very improper for them to defeat the end of their constitution and by absence to create the very mischiefs which they were appointed      to remedy especially as if any profits are to arise from putting in a curate and living at a distance from the parish the appropriator who is the real parson has undoubtedly the elder title to them when the ordinary is also the patron and confers the living the presentation and institution are one and the same act and are called a collation to a benefice by institution or collation the church is full so that there can be no fresh presentation till another vacancy at least in the case of a common patron but the church is not full against the king till induction nay even if a clerk is instituted upon the kings presentation the crown may revoke it before induction and present another clerki upon institution also the clerk may enter on the parsonagehouse and glebe and take the tithes but he cannot grant or let them or bring an action for them till induction induction is performed by a mandate from the bishop to the archdeacon who usually issues out a precept to other clergymen to perform it for him it is done by giving the clerk corporal possession of the church as by holding the ring of the door tolling a bell or the like and is a form required by law with intent to give all the parishioners due notice and sufficient certainty of their new minister to whom their tithes are to be paid this therefore is the investiture of the temporal part of the benefice as institution is of the spiritual and when a clerk is thus presented instituted and inducted into a rectory he is then and not before in full and complete possession and is called in law persona impersonata or parson imparsoneek the rights of a parson or vicar in his tithes and ecclesiastical dues fall more properly under the second book of these commentaries and as to his duties they are principally of ecclesiastical cognizance those only excepted which are laid upon him by statute and those are indeed so numerous that it is impracticable to recite them here with any tolerable conciseness or accuracy some of them we may remark as they      arise in the progress of our inquiries but for the rest i must refer myself to such authors as have compiled treatises expressly upon this subjectl i shall only just mention the article of residence upon the supposition of which the law doth style every parochial minister an incumbent by statute    hen viii c    persons wilfully absenting themselves from their benefices for one month together or two months in the year incur a penalty of  l to the king and  l to any person that will sue for the same except chaplains to the king or others therein mentionedm during their attendance in the household of such as retain them and also exceptn all heads of houses magistrates and professors in the     universities and all students under forty years of age residing there bona fide for study legal residence is not only in the parish but also in the parsonagehouse if there be one for it hath been resolvedo that the statute intended residence not only for serving the cure and for hospitality but also for maintaining the house that the successor also may keep hospitality there and if there be no parsonagehouse it hath been holden that the incumbent is bound to hire one in the same or some neighbouring parish to answer for the purposes of residence for the more effectual promotion of which important duty among the parochial clergy a provision is made by the statute    geo iii c    for raising money upon ecclesiastical benefices to be paid off by annually decreasing instalments and to be expended in rebuilding or repairing the houses belonging to such benefices we have seen that there is but one way whereby one may become a parson or vicar there are many ways by which one may cease to be so   by death   by cession in taking another benefice for by statute    hen viii c    if any one having a benefice of  l per annum or upwards according to the present valuation in the kings booksp accepts any other the first shall be adjudged void unless he obtains a dispensation which no one is entitled to have but the chaplains of the king 0 and others therein mentioned the brethren and the sons of lords and knights and doctors and bachelors of divinity and law   admitted by the universities of this realm and a vacancy thus made for want of a dispensation is called cession     by consecration for as was mentioned before when a clerk is promoted to a bishopric all his other      preferments are void the instant that he is consecrated but there is a method by the favour of the crown of holding such livings in commendam commenda or ecclesia commendata is a living commended by the crown to the care of a clerk to hold till a proper pastor is provided for it this may be temporary for one two or three years or perpetual being a kind of dispensation     to avoid the vacancy of the living and is called a commenda retinere   there is also a commenda recipere which is to take a benefice de novo in the bishops own gift or the gift of some other patron consenting to the same and this is the same to him as institution and induction are to another clerkq   by resignation but this is of no avail till accepted by the ordinary into whose hands the resignation must be mader     by deprivation either  st by sentence declaratory in the ecclesiastical courts for fit and sufficient causes allowed by the common law such as attainder of treason or felonys or conviction of other infamous crime in the kings courts for heresy infidelityt gross immorality and the like or  dly in pursuance of divers penal statutes which declare the benefice void for some nonfeasance or neglect or else some malfeasance or crime as for simonyu for maintaining any doctrine in derogation of the kings supremacy or of the thirtynine articles or of the book of commonprayerv for neglecting after institution to read the liturgy and articles in the church or make the declarations against popery or take the abjurationoathw for using any other form of prayer than the liturgy of the church of englandx or for absenting himself sixty days in one year from a benefice belonging to a popish patron to which the clerk was presented by either of the universitiesy in all which and similar casesz the benefice is ipso facto void without any formal sentence of deprivation vi a curate is the lowest degree in the church being in the same state that a vicar was formerly an officiating temporary minister instead of the proper incumbent though      there are what are called perpetual curacies where all the tithes are appropriated and no vicarage endowed being for some particular reasonsa exempted from the statute of hen iv but instead thereof such perpetual curate is appointed by the appropriator with regard to the other species of curates they are the objects of some particular statutes which ordain that such as serve a church during its vacancy shall be paid such stipend as the ordinary thinks reasonable out of the profits of the vacancy or if that be not sufficient by the successor within fourteen days after he takes possessionb and that if any rector or vicar nominates a curate to the ordinary to be licensed to serve the cure in his absence the ordinary shall settle his stipend under his hand and seal not exceeding  0l per annum nor less than  0l and on failure of payment may sequester the profits of the beneficec       thus much of the clergy properly so called there are also certain inferior ecclesiastical officers of whom the common law takes notice and that principally to assist the ecclesiastical jurisdiction where it is deficient in powers on which officers i shall make a few cursory remarks vii churchwardens are the guardians or keepers of the church and representatives of the body of the parishd they are sometimes appointed by the minister sometimes by the parish sometimes by both together as custom directs they are taken in favour of the church to be for some purposes a kind of corporation at the common law that is they are enabled by that name to have property in goods and chattels and to bring actions for them for the use and profit of the parish yet they may not waste the church goods but may be removed by the parish and then called to account by action at the common law but there is no method of calling them to account but by first removing them for none can legally do it but those who are put in their place      as to lands or other real property as the church churchyard c they have no sort of interest therein but if any damage is done thereto the parson only or vicar shall have the action their office also is to repair the church and make rates and levies for that purpose but these are recoverable only in the ecclesiastical court they are also joined with the overseers in the care and maintenance of the poor they are to levye a shilling forfeiture on all such as do not repair to church on sundays and holidays and are empowered to keep all persons orderly while there to which end it has been held that a churchwarden may justify the pulling off a mans hat without being guilty of either an assault or trespassf there are also a multitude of other petty parochial powers committed to their charge by divers acts of parliamentg viii parish clerks and sextons are also regarded by the common law as persons who have freeholds in their offices and therefore though they may be punished yet they cannot be deprived by ecclesiastical censuresh the parish clerk was formerly very frequently in holy orders and some are so to this day he is generally appointed by the incumbent but by custom may be chosen by the inhabitants and if such custom appears the court of kings bench will grant a mandamus to the archdeacon to swear him in for the establishment of the custom turns it into a temporal or civil righti     chapter xii of the civil state the lay part of his majestys subjects or such of the people as are not comprehended under the denomination of clergy may be divided into three distinct states the civil the military and the maritime that part of the nation which falls under our first and most comprehensive division the civil state includes all orders of men from the highest nobleman to the meanest peasant that are not included under either our former division of clergy or under one of the two latter the military and maritime states and it may sometimes include individuals of the other three orders since a nobleman a knight a gentleman or a peasant may become either a divine a soldier or a seaman the civil state consists of the nobility and the commonalty of the nobility the peerage of great britain or lords temporal as forming together with the bishops one of the supreme branches of the legislature i have before sufficiently spoken we are here to consider them according to their several degrees or titles of honour all degrees of nobility and honour are derived from the king as their fountaina and he may institute what new titles he pleases  hence it is that all degrees of nobility are not of equal antiquity those now in use are dukes marquesses earls viscounts and baronsb         a duke though he be with us in respect of his title of nobility inferior in point of antiquity to many others yet is superior to all of them in rank his being the first title of dignity after the royal familyc among the saxons the latin name of dukes duces is very frequent and signified as among the romans the commanders or leaders of their armies whom in their own language they called d and in the laws of henry i as translated by lambard we find them called heretochii but after the norman conquest which changed the military polity of the nation the kings themselves continuing for many generations dukes of normandy they would not honour any subjects with the title of duke till the time of edward iii who claiming to be king of france and thereby losing the ducal in the royal dignity  in the eleventh year of his reign created his son edward the black prince duke of cornwall and many of the royal family especially were after wards raised to the like honour however in the reign of queen elizabeth ad     e the whole order became utterly extinct but it was revived about fifty years afterwards by her successor who was remarkably prodigal of honours in the person of george villiers duke of buckingham       a marquess marchio is the next degree of nobility his office formerly was for dignity and duty were never separated by our ancestors to guard the frontiers and limits of the kingdom which were called the marches from the teutonic word marche a limit such as in particular were the marches of wales and scotland while each continued to be an enemys country the persons who had command there were called lords marches or marquesses whose authority was abolished by statute    hen viii c    though the title had long before been made a mere ensign of honour robert vere earl of oxford being created marquess of dublin by richard ii in the eighth year of his reignf        an earl is a title of nobility so ancient that its original cannot clearly be traced out thus much seems tolerably certain that among the saxons they were called ealdormen quasi elder men signifying the same as senior or senator among the romans and also schiremen because they had each of them the civil government of a several division or shire on the irruption of the danes they changed the name to eorles which according to camdeng signified the same in their language in latin they are called comites a title first used in the empire from being the kings attendants a societate nomen sumpserunt reges enim tales sibi associanth after the norman conquest they were for some time called counts or countees from the french but they did not long retain that name themselves though their shires are from thence called counties to this day the name of earls or comites is now become a mere title they having nothing to do with the government of the county which as has been more than once observed is now entirely devolved on the sheriff the earls deputy or vicecomes in writs and commissions and other formal instruments the king when he mentions any peer of the degree of an earl usually styles him trusty and wellbeloved cousin an appellation as ancient as the reign of henry iv who being either by his wife his mother or his sisters actually related or allied to every earl then in the kingdom artfully and constantly acknowledged that connection in all his letters and other public acts from whence the usage has descended to his successors though the reason has long ago failed   the name of vicecomes or viscount was afterwards made use of as an arbitrary title of honour without any shadow of office pertaining to it by henry the sixth when in the eighteenth year of his reign he created john beaumont a peer by the name of viscount beaumont which was the first instance of the kindi    a barons is the most general and universal title of nobility for originally every one of the peers of superior rank      had also a barony annexed to his other titlesj  but it hath sometimes happened that when an     ancient baron hath been raised to a new degree of peerage in the course of a few generations the two titles have descended differently one perhaps to the male descendants the other to the heirs general whereby the earldom or other superior title hath subsisted without a barony and there are also modern instances where earls and viscounts have been created without annexing a barony to their other honours so that now the rule doth not hold universally that all peers are barons the original and antiquity of baronies has occasioned great inquiries among our english antiquaries the most probable opinion seems to be that they were the same with our present lords of manors to which the name of court baron which is the lords court and incident to every manor gives some countenance  it may be collected from king johns magna cartak that originally all lords of manors or barons that held of the king in capite had seats in the great council or parliament till about the reign of that prince the conflux of them became so large and troublesome that the king was obliged to divide them and summon only the greater barons in person leaving the small ones to be summoned by the sheriff and as it is said to sit by representation in another house which gave rise to the separation of the two houses of     parliamentl by degrees the title came to be confined to the greater barons or lords of parliament only and there were no other barons among the peerage but such as were summoned by writ in respect of the tenure of their lands or baronies till richard the second first made it a mere title of honour by conferring it on divers persons by his letterspatentm having made this short inquiry into the original of our several degrees of nobility i shall next consider the manner in which they may be created the right of peerage seems to have been originally territorial that is annexed to lands honours castles manors and the like the proprietors and possessors of which were in right of those estates allowed to be   00 peers of the realm and were summoned to parliament to do suit and service to their sovereign and when the land was alienated the dignity passed with it as appendant thus the bishops still sit in the house of lords in right of succession to certain ancient baronies annexed or supposed to be annexed to their episcopal landsn and thus in    hen vi the possession of the castle of arundel was adjudged to confer an earldom on its possessoro but afterwards when alienations grew to be frequent the dignity of peerage was confined to the lineage of the party ennobled and instead of territorial became personal actual proof of a tenure by barony became no longer necessary to constitute a lord of parliament but the record of the writ of summons to him or his ancestors was admitted as a sufficient evidence of the tenure peers are now created either by writ or by patent for those who claim by prescription must suppose either a writ or patent made to their ancestors though by length of time it is lost the creation by writ or the kings letter is a summons to attend the house of peers by the style and title of that barony which the king is pleased to confer that by patent is a royal grant to a subject of any dignity and degree of peerage the creation by writ is the more ancient way but a man is not ennobled thereby unless he actually take his seat in the house of lords and some are of opinion that there must be at least two writs of summons and a sitting in two distinct parliaments to evidence an hereditary baronyp  and therefore the most usual because the surest way is to grant the dignity by patent which enures to a man and his heirs according to the limitations thereof though he never himself makes use of itq yet it is frequent to call up the eldest son of a peer to the house of lords by writ of summons in the name of his fathers barony because in that case there is no danger of his childrens losing the nobility in case he never takes his seat for they will succeed to their grandfather  creation by writ has also one advantage over that by patent for a person created by writ holds the dignity to him and his   0  heirs  without any words to that purport in the writ but in letters  0  patent there must be words to direct the inheritance else the dignity enures only to the grantee for lifer for a man or woman may be created noble for their own lives and the dignity not descend to their heirs at all or descend only to some particular heirs as where a peerage is limited to a man and the heirs male of his body by elizabeth his present lady and not to such heirs by any former or future wife 0 let us next take a view of a few of the principal incidents attending the nobility exclusive of their capacity as members of parliament and as hereditary counsellors of the crown both of which we have before considered and first we must observe that in criminal cases a nobleman shall be tried by his peers    0  the great are always obnoxious to popular envy were they to be judged by the people they might be in danger from the prejudice of their judges and would moreover be deprived of the privilege of the meanest subject that of being tried by their equals which is secured to all the realm by magna carta c    it is said that this does not extend to bishops who though they are lords of parliament and sit there by virtue of their baronies which they hold jure ecclesiæ yet are not ennobled in blood and consequently not peers with the nobilitys   as to peeresses there was no precedent for their trial when accused of treason or felony till after eleanor duchess of gloucester wife to the lord protector was accused of treason and found guilty of witchcraft in an established synod through the intrigues of cardinal beaufort this very extraordinary trial gave occasion to a special statute  0 hen vi c   which declarest the law to be that peeresses either in their own right or by marriage shall be tried before the same judicature as other peers of the realm   if a woman noble in her own right marries a commoner she still remains noble   and shall be tried by her peers but if she be only noble by marriage then by a second marriage with a commoner she loses her dignity for as by marriage it is gained by marriage it is also lostu   yet if a duchess dowager marries a baron she continues a duchess still for all the   0  nobility are pares and therefore it is no degradationv a peer or peeress either in her own right or by marriage cannot be arrested in civil casesw and they have also many peculiar privileges annexed to their peerage in the course of judicial proceedings   a peer sitting  0  in judgment gives not his verdict upon oath like an ordinary juryman but upon his honourx he answers also to bills in chancery upon his honour and not upon his oathy but when he is examined as a witness either in civil or criminal cases he must be swornz   for the respect which the law shows to the honour of a peer does not extend so far as to overturn a settled maxim that in judicio non creditur nisi juratisa the honour of peers is however so highly tendered by the law that it is much more penal to spread false reports of them and certain other great officers of the realm than of other men scandal against them being called by the peculiar name of scandalum magnatnm and subjected to peculiar punishments by divers ancient statutesb a peer cannot lose his nobility but by death or attainder though there was an instance in the reign of edward the fourth of the degradation of george nevile duke of bedford by act of parliamentc on account of his poverty which rendered him unable to support his dignityd but this is a singular instance which serves at the same time by having happened to show the power of parliament and by having happened but once to show how tender the parliament hath been in exerting so high a power it hath been said indeede that if a baron wastes his estates so that he is not able to support the degree the king may degrade him but it is expressly held by later authoritiesf that a peer cannot be degraded but by act of parliament   0  the commonalty like the nobility are divided into several degrees and as the lords though different in rank yet all of them are peers in respect of their nobility so the commoners though some are greatly superior to others yet all are in law peers in respect of their want of nobilityg the first name of dignity next beneath a peer was anciently that of vidames vicedomini or valvasorsh who are mentioned by our ancient lawyersi as viri magnæ dignitatis and sir edward cokej speaks highly of them yet they are now quite out of use and our legal antiquaries are not agreed upon even their original or ancient office now therefore the first personal dignity after the nobility is a knight of the order of st george or of the garter first instituted by edward iii ad     k next but not till after certain official dignities as privycounsellors the chancellors of the exchequer and duchy of lancaster the chief justice of the kings bench the master of the rolls and the other english judges follows a knight banneret who indeed by statutes   ric ii st   c   and    ric ii c    is ranked next after barons and his precedence before the younger sons of viscounts was confirmed to him by order of king james i in the tenth year of his reignl but in order to entitle himself to this rank he must have been created by the king in person in the field under the royal banners in time of open warm else he ranks after baronets who are the next order which title  0  is a dignity of inheritance created by letterspatent and usually descondible to the issue male it was first instituted by king james the first ad      in order to raise a competent sum for the reduction of the province of ulster in ireland   for which reason all baronets have the arms of ulster superadded to their family coat   next follow knights of the bath an order instituted by king henry iv   0  and revived by king george the first they are so called from the ceremony of bathing the night before their creation 0 the last of these inferior nobility are knights bachelors   the most ancient though the lowest order of knighthood amongst us   for we have an instancen of king alfreds conferring this order on his son athelstan the custom of the ancient germans was to give their young men a shield and a lance in the great council this was equivalent to the toga virilis of the romans before this they were not permitted to bear arms but were accounted as part of the fathers household after it as part of the communityo hence some derive the usage of knighting which has prevailed all over the western world since its reduction by colonies from those northern heroes knights are called in latin equites aurati aurati from the gilt spurs they wore and equites because they always served on horseback for it is observablep that almost all nations call their knights by some appellation derived from a horse   they are also called in our law milites because they formed a part of the royal army in virtue of their feodal tenures one condition of which was that every one who held a knights fee immediately under the crown which in edward the seconds timeq amounted to  0l per annum was obliged to be knighted and attend the king in his wars or fine for his noncompliance the exertion of this prerogative as an expedient to raise money in the reign of charles the first gave great offence though warranted by law and the recent example of queen elizabeth   but it was by the statute    car i c    abolished and this kind of knighthood has since that time fallen into great disregard these sir edward coke saysr are all the names of dignity in this kingdom esquires and gentlemen being only names of worship but before these  0  lasts the heralds rank all   0  colonels serjeants at law and doctors in the three learned professions   0  esquires and gentlemen are confounded together by sir edward coke who observest that every esquire is a gentleman and a gentleman is defined to be one qui arma gerit who bears coat armour the grant of which adds gentility to a mans family in like manner as civil nobility among the romans was founded in the jus imaginum or having the image of one ancestor at least who had borne some curule office it is indeed a matter somewhat unsettled what constitutes the distinction or who is a real esquire for it is not an estate however large that confers this rank upon its owner camden who was himself a herald distinguishes them the most accurately and he reckons up four sorts of themu   the eldest sons of knights and their eldest sons in perpetual successionv   the eldest sons of younger sons of peers and their eldest sons in like perpetual succession both which species of esquires sir henry spelman entitles armigeri natalitiiw   esquires created  0  by the kings letterspatent or other investiture   and their eldest sons   esquires by virtue of their offices as justices of the peace and others who bear any office of trust under the crown   to these may be added the esquires of knights of the bath each of whom constitutes three at his installation and all foreign nay irish peers for not only these but the eldest sons of peers of great britain though frequently titular lords are only esquires in the law and must be so named in all legal proceedingsx   as for gentlemen says sir thomas smithy they be made good cheap in this kingdom for whosoever studieth the laws of the realm who studieth in the universities who professeth the liberal sciences and to be short who can live idly and without manual labour and will bear the port charge and countenance of a gentleman he shall be called master and shall be taken for a gentleman 0 a yeoman is he that hath free land of forty shillings by the year who was anciently thereby qualified to serve on juries vote for knights of the   0  shire and do any other act where the law requires one that is probus et legalis homoz the rest of the commonalty are tradesmen artificers and labourers who as well as all others must in pursuance of the statute   hen v c   be styled by the name and addition of their estate degree or mystery and the place to which they belong or where they have been conversant in all original writs of actions personal appeals and indictments upon which process of outlawry may be awarded   in order as it should seem to prevent any clandestine or mistaken outlawry by reducing to a specific certainty the person who is the object of its process    0  chapter xiii of the military and maritime states the military state includes the whole of the soldiery or such persons as are peculiarly appointed among the rest of the people for the safeguard and defence of the realm in a land of liberty it is extremely dangerous to make a distinct order of the profession of arms in absolute monarchies this is necessary for the safety of the prince and arises from the main principle of their constitution which is that of governing by fear but in free states the profession of a soldier taken singly and merely as a profession is justly an object of jealousy in these no man should take up arms but with a view to defend his country and its laws he puts not off the citizen when he enters the camp but it is because he is a citizen and would wish to continue so that he makes himself for a while a soldier the laws therefore and constitution of these kingdoms know no such state as that of a perpetual standing soldier bred up to no other profession than that of war and it was not till the reign of henry vii that the kings of england had so much as a guard about their persons   0  in the time of our saxon ancestors as appears from edward the confessors lawsa the military force of this kingdom was in the hands of the dukes or heretochs who were constituted through every province and county in the kingdom being taken out of the principal nobility and such as were most remarkable for being sapientes fideles et animosi their duty was to lead and regulate the english armies with a very unlimited power prout eis visum fuerit ad honorem   0  coronæ et utilitatem regni and because of this great power they were elected by the people in their full assembly or folkmote in the same manner as sheriffs were elected following still that old fundamental maxim of the saxon constitution that where any officer was intrusted with such power as if abused might tend to the oppression of the people that power was delegated to him by the vote of the people themselvesb so too among the ancient germans the ancestors of our saxon forefathers they had their dukes as well as kings with an independent power over the military as the kings had over the civil state the dukes were elective the kings hereditary for so only can be consistently understood that passage of tacitusc reges ex nobilitate duces ex virtute sumunt in constituting their kings the family or blood royal was regarded in choosing their dukes or leaders warlike merit just as cæsar relates of their ancestors in his time that whenever they went to war by way either of attack or defence they elected leaders to command themd this large share of power thus conferred by the people though intended to preserve the liberty of the subject was perhaps unreasonably detrimental to the prerogative of the crown and accordingly we find ill use made of it by edric duke of mercia in the reign of king edmund ironside who by his office of duke or heretoch was entitled to a large command in the kings army and by his repeated treacheries at last transferred the crown to canute the dane it seems universally agreed by all historians that king alfred first settled a national militia in this kingdom and by his prudent discipline made all the subjects of his dominion soldiers but we are unfortunately left in the dark as to the particulars of this his so celebrated regulation though from what was last observed the dukes seem to have been left in possession of too large and independent a power which    0 enabled duke harold on the death of edward the confessor though a stranger to the royal blood to mount for a short space the throne of this kingdom in prejudice of edgar atheling the rightful heir upon the norman conquest the feodal law was introduced here in all its rigour the whole of which is built on a military plan i shall not now enter into the particulars of that constitution which belongs more properly to the next part of our commentaries but shall only observe that in consequence thereof all the lands in the kingdom were divided into what were called knights fees   0 in number above sixty thousand and for every knights fee a knight or soldier miles was bound to attend the king in his wars for forty days in a year  in which space of time before war was reduced to a science the campaign was generally finished and a kingdom either conquered or victoriouse by this means the king had without any expense an army of sixty thousand men always ready at his command and accordingly we find one among the laws of william the conquerorf which in the kings name commands and firmly enjoins the personal attendance of all knights and others quod habeant et teneant sesemper in armis et equis ut decet et oportet et quod semper sint prompti et parati ad servitium suum integrum nobis explendum et peragendum cum opus adfuerit secundum quod debent feodis et tenementis suis de jure nobis facere this personal service in process of time degenerated into pecuniary commutations or aids and at last the military part  of the feodal system was abolished at the restoration by statute    car ii c    in the mean time we are not to imagine that the kingdom was left wholly without defence in case of domestic insurrections or the prospect of foreign invasions besides those who by their military tenures were bound to perform forty days service in the field first the assize of arms enacted    hen      iih and afterwards the statute of winchesteri under edward i obliged every man according to his estate and degree to provide a determinate quantity of such arms as were then in use in order to keep the peace and constables were appointed in all hundreds by the latter statute to see that such arms were provided these weapons were changed by the statute      ph and m c   into others of more modern service but both this and the former provisions were repealed in the reign of james ik while these continued in force it was usual from time to time for our princes to issue commissions of array and send into every county officers in whom they could confide to muster and array or set in military order the inhabitants of every district and the form of the commission of array was settled in parliament in the   hen iv so as to prevent the insertion therein of any new penal clausesl but it was providedm that no man should be compelled to go out of the kingdom at any rate nor out of his shire but in cases of urgent necessity nor should provide soldiers unless by consent of parliament about the reign of king henry the eighth or his children lieutenants began to be introducedn as standing representatives of the crown to keep the counties in military order for we find them mentioned as known officers in the statute      ph and m c   though they had not been then long in use for camden speaks of themo in the time of queen elizabeth as extraordinary magistrates constituted only in times of difficulty and danger but the introduction of these commissions of lieutenancy which contained in substance the same powers as the old commissions of array caused the latter to fall into disuse in this state things continued till the repeal of the statutes of armour in the reign of king james the first after which when king charles the first had during his northern expedition issued commissions of lieutenancy and exerted some military powers which having been long exercised were thought to belong to the crown it became a question in the long parliament how far the power of the militia did inherently reside in the king being now unsupported     by any statute and founded only upon immemorial usage this question long agitated with great heat and resentment on both      sides became at length the immediate cause of the fatal rupture between the king and his parliament the two houses not only denying this prerogative of the crown the legality of which perhaps might be somewhat doubtful but also seizing into their own hands the entire power of the militia the illegality of which step could never be any doubt at all  soon after the restoration of king charles the second when the military tenures were abolished it was thought proper to ascertain the power of the militia to recognise the sole right of the crown to govern and command them and to put the whole into a more regular method of military subordinationp and the order in which the militia now stands by law is principally built upon the statutes which were then enacted it is true the two last of them are apparently repealed but many of their provisions are reenacted with the addition of some new regulations by the present militia laws the general scheme of which is to discipline a certain number of the inhabitants of every county chosen by lot for three years and officered by the lord lieutenant the deputy lieutenants and other principal landholders under a commission from the crown they are not compellable to march out of their counties unless in case of invasion or actual rebellion within the realm or any of its dominions or territoriesq nor in any case compellable to march out of the kingdom they are to be exercised at stated times and their discipline in general is liberal and easy but when drawn out into actual service they are subject to the rigours of martial law as necessary to keep them in order this is the constitutional security which our lawsr have provided for the public peace and for protecting the realm against foreign or domestic violence when the nation was engaged in war more veteran troops and more regular discipline were esteemed to be necessary than could be expected from a mere militia and therefore at such times more rigorous methods were put in use for the      raising of armies and the due regulation and discipline of the soldiery which are to be looked upon only as temporary excrescences bred out of the distemper of the state and not as any part of the permanent and perpetual laws of the kingdom for martial law which is built upon no settled principles but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions is as sir matthew hale observess in truth and reality no law but something indulged rather than allowed as a law  the necessity of order and discipline in an army is the     only thing which can give it countenance and therefore it ought not to be permitted in time of peace when the kings courts are open for all persons to receive justice according to the laws of the land wherefore thomas earl of lancaster being condemned at pontefract    edw ii by martial law his attainder was reversed   edw iii because it was done in time of peacet and it is laid downu that if a lieutenant or other that hath commission of martial authority doth in time of peace hang or otherwise execute any man by colour of martial law this is murder for it is against magna cartav the petition of rightw moreover enacts that no soldier shall be quartered on the subject without his own consentx and that no commission shall issue to proceed within this land according to martial law and whereas after the restoration king charles the second kept up about five thousand regular troops by his own authority for guards and garrisons which king james the second by degrees increased to no less than thirty thousand all paid from his own civil list it was made one of the articles of the bill of rightsy that the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace unless it be with consent of parliament is against law but as the fashion of keeping standing armies which was first introduced by charles vii in france ad     z has of late years universally prevailed over europe though      some of its potentates being unable themselves to maintain them are obliged to have recourse to richer powers and receive subsidiary pensions for that purpose it has also for many years past been annually judged necessary by our legislature for the safety of the kingdom the defence of the possessions of the crown of great britain and the preservation of the balance of power in europe to maintain even in time of peace a standing body of troops under the command of the crown who are however ipso facto disbanded at the expiration of every year unless continued by parliament and it was enacted by statute  0 w iii c   that not more than twelve thousand regular forces should be kept on foot in ireland though paid at the charge of that kingdom which permission is extended by statute   geo iii c    to       men in time of peace      to prevent the executive power from being able to oppress says baron montesquieua it is requisite that the armies with which it is intrusted should consist of the people and have the same spirit with the people as was the case at rome till marius newmodelled the legions by enlisting the rabble of italy and laid the foundation of all the military tyranny that ensued nothing then according to these principles ought to be more guarded against in a free state than making the military power when such a one is necessary to be kept on foot a body too distinct from the people like ours it should wholly be composed of natural subjects it ought only to be enlisted for a short and limited time the soldiers also should live intermixed with the people no separate camp no barracks no inland fortresses should be allowed and perhaps it might be still better if by dismissing a stated number and enlisting others at every renewal of their term a circulation could be kept up between the army and the people and the citizen and the soldier be more intimately connected together to keep this body of troops in order an annual act of parliament likewise passes to punish mutiny and desertion      and for the better payment of the army and their quarters this regulates the manner in which they are to be dispersed among the several innkeepers and victuallers throughout the kingdom and establishes a law martial for their government by this among other things it is enacted that if any officer or soldier shall excite or join any mutiny or knowing of it shall not give notice to the commanding officer or shall desert or list in any other regiment or sleep upon his post or leave it before he is relieved or hold correspondence with a rebel or enemy or strike or use violence to his superior officer or shall disobey his lawful commands such offender shall suffer such punishment as a court martial shall inflict though it extend to death itself however expedient the most strict regulations may be in time of actual war yet in times of profound peace a little relaxation of military rigour would not one should hope be productive of much inconvenience and upon this principle though by our standing lawsb still remaining in force though not attended to desertion in time of war is made felony without benefit of clergy and the offence is triable by a jury and before justices at the common law yet by our militia laws before mentioned a much lighter punishment is inflicted for desertion in time of peace so by the roman law also desertion in time of war was punished with death but more mildly in time of tranquillityc but our mutiny act makes no such distinction for any of the faults above mentioned are equally at all times punishable with death itself if a court martial shall think proper this discretionary power of the court martial is indeed to be guided by the directions of the crown which with regard to military offences has almost an absolute legislative powerd his majesty says the act may form articles of war and constitute courts martial with power to try any crime by such articles and inflict penalties by sentence or judgment of the same a vast and most important trust an unlimited power to create crimes and annex to them any punishments not extending to life or limb these are indeed forbidden to be inflicted      except for crimes declared to be so punishable by this act which crimes we have just enumerated and among which we may observe that any disobedience to lawful commands is one perhaps in some future revision of this act which is in many respects hastily penned it may be thought worthy the wisdom of parliament to ascertain the limits of military subjection and to enact express articles of war for the government of the army as is done for the government of the navy especially as by our present constitution the nobility and gentry of the kingdom who     serve their country as militia officers are annually subjected to the same arbitrary rule during their time of exercise  one of the greatest advantages of our english law is that not only the crimes themselves which it punishes but also the penalties which it inflicts are ascertained and notorious nothing is left to arbitrary discretion the king by his judges dispenses what the law has previously ordained but is not himself the legislator how much therefore is it to be regretted that a set of men whose bravery has so often preserved the liberties of their country should be reduced to a state of servitude in the midst of a nation of freemen for sir edward coke will inform use that it is one of the genuine marks of servitude to have the law which is our rule of action either concealed or precarious misera est servitus ubi jus est vagum aut incognitum nor is this state of servitude quite consistent with the maxims of sound policy observed by other free nations  for the greater the general liberty is which any state enjoys the more cautious has it usually been in introducing slavery in any particular order or profession these men as baron montesquieu observesf seeing the liberty which others possess and which they themselves are excluded from are apt like eunuchs in the eastern seraglios to live in a state of perpetual envy and hatred towards the rest of the community and indulge a malignant pleasure in contributing to destroy those privileges to which they can never be admitted hence have many free states by departing from this rule been endangered by the revolt of      their slaves while in absolute and despotic governments where no real liberty exists and consequently no invidious comparisons can be formed such incidents are extremely rare two precautions are therefore advised to be observed in all prudent and free governments   to prevent the introduction of slavery at all or   if it be already introduced not to intrust those slaves with arms who will then find themselves an overmatch for the freemen much less ought the soldiery to be an exception to the people in general and the only state of servitude in the nation but as soldiers by this annual act are thus put in a worse condition than any other subjects so by the humanity of our standing laws they are in some cases put in a much better by statute    eliz c   a weekly allowance is to be raised in every county for the relief of soldiers that are sick hurt and maimed not forgetting the royal hospital at chelsea for such as are worn out in their duty officers and soldiers that have been in the kings service are by     several statutes enacted at the close of several wars at liberty to use any trade or occupation they are fit for in any town in the kingdom except the two universities notwithstanding any statute custom or charter to the contrary  and soldiers in actual military service may make nuncupative wills and dispose of their goods wages and other personal chattels without those forms solemnities and expenses which the law requires in other casesg our law does not indeed extend this privilege so far as the civil law which carried it to an extreme that borders upon the ridiculous for if a soldier in the article of death wrote any thing in bloody letters on his shield or in the dust of the field with his sword it was a very good military testamenth and thus much for the military state as acknowledged by the laws of england 0 the maritime state is nearly related to the former though much more agreeable to the principles of our free constitution      the royal navy of england hath ever been its greatest defence and ornament it is its ancient and natural strength the floating bulwark of the island an army from which however strong and powerful no danger can ever be apprehended to liberty and accordingly it has been assiduously cultivated even from the earliest ages to so much perfection was our naval reputation arrived in the twelfth century that the code of maritime laws which are called the laws of oleron and are received by all nations in europe as the ground and substruction of all their maritime constitutions was confessedly compiled by our king richard the first at the isle of oleron on the coast of france then part of the possessions of the crown of englandi   and yet so vastly inferior were our ancestors in this     point to the present age that even in the maritime reign of queen elizabeth sir edward cokek thinks it a matter of boast that the royal navy of england then consisted of three and thirty ships the present condition of our marine is in great measure owing to the salutary provisions of the statutes called the navigation acts whereby the constant increase of english shipping and seamen was not only encouraged but rendered unavoidably necessary by the statute   ric ii c   in order to augment the navy of england then greatly diminished it was ordained that none of the kings liege people should ship any merchandise out of or into the realm but only in ships of the kings ligeance on pain of forfeiture in the next year by statute   ric ii c   this wise provision was enervated by only obliging the merchants to give english ships if able and sufficient the preference but the most beneficial statute for the trade and commerce of these kingdoms is that navigation act the rudiments of which were first framed in    0l with a narrow partial view being intended to mortify our own sugar islands which were disaffected to the parliament and still held out for charles ii by stopping the gainful trade which they then carried on with the dutchm and at the same time to clip the wings of those our opulent and aspiring neighbours this prohibited all ships of foreign nations from trading with any english plantations      without license from the council of state in     n the prohibition was extended also to the mother country and no goods were suffered to be imported into england or any of its dependencies in any other than english bottoms or in the ships of that european nation of which the merchandise imported was the genuine growth or manufacture at the restoration the former provisions were continued by statute    car ii c    with this very material improvement that the master and threefourths of the mariners shall also be english subjects   many laws have been made for the supply of the royal navy with seamen for their regulation when on board and to confer privileges and rewards on them during and after their service   first for their supply the power of impressing seafaring men for the sea service by the kings commission has been a matter of some dispute and submitted to with great reluctance though it hath very clearly and learnedly been shown by sir michael fostero that the practice of impressing and granting powers to the admiralty for that purpose is of very ancient date and hath been uniformly continued by a regular series of precedents to the present time whence he concludes it to be part of the common lawp the difficulty arises from hence that no statute has expressly declared this power to be in the crown though many of them very strongly imply it the statute   ric ii c   speaks of mariners being arrested and detained for the kings service as of a thing well known and practised without dispute and provides a remedy against their running away by a later statuteq if any waterman who uses the river thames shall hide himself during the execution of any commission of pressing for the kings service he is liable to heavy penalties by anotherr no fisherman shall be taken by the queens commission to serve as a mariner but the commission shall be first brought to two justices of the peace inhabiting near the seacoast where the mariners are to be taken to the intent that the     justices may    0 choose out and return such a number of ablebodied men as in the commission are contained to serve her majesty and by otherss special protections are allowed to seamen in particular circumstances to prevent them from being impressed and ferrymen are also said to be privileged from being impressed at common lawt all which do most evidently imply a power of impressing to reside somewhere and if anywhere it must from the spirit of our constitution as well as from the frequent mention of the kings commission reside in the crown alone   but besides this method of impressing which is only defensible from public necessity to which all private considerations must give way there are other ways that tend to the increase of seamen and manning the royal navy parishes may bind out poor boys apprentices to masters of merchantmen who shall be protected from impressing for the first three years and if they are impressed afterwards the masters shall be allowed their wagesu great advantages in point of wages are given to volunteer seamen in order to induce them to enter into his majestys servicev and every foreign seaman who during a war shall serve two years in any manofwar merchantman or privateer is naturalized ipso factow about the middle of king williams reign a scheme was set on footx for a register of seamen to the number of thirty thousand for a constant and regular supply of the kings fleet with great privileges to the registered men and on the other hand heavy penalties in case of their nonappearance when called for but this registry being judged to be ineffectual as well as oppressive was abolished by statute   anne c      the method of ordering seamen in the royal fleet and keeping up a regular discipline there is directed by certain express rules articles and orders first enacted by the authority of parliament soon after the restorationy but since          newmodelled and altered after the peace of aixlachapellez to remedy some defects which were of fatal consequence in conducting the preceding war in these articles of the navy almost every possible offence is set down and the punishment thereof annexed in which respect the seamen have much the advantage over their brethren in the land service whose articles of war are not enacted by parliament but framed from time to time at the pleasure of the crown yet from whence this distinction arose and why the executive power which is limited so properly with regard to the navy should be so extensive with regard to the army it is hard to assign a reason unless it proceeded from the perpetual establishment of the navy which rendered a permanent law for their regulation expedient and the temporary duration of the army which subsisted only from year to year and might therefore with less danger be subjected to discretionary government but whatever was apprehended at the first formation of the mutiny act the regular renewal of our standing force at the entrance of every year has made this distinction idle for if from experience past we may judge of future events the army is now lastingly ingrafted into the british constitution with this singularly fortunate circumstance that any branch of the legislature may annually put an end to its legal existence by refusing to concur in its continuance   with regard to the privileges conferred on sailors they are pretty much the same with those conferred on soldiers with regard to relief when maimed or wounded or superannuated either by county rates or the royal hospital at greenwich with regard also to the exercise of trades and the power of making nuncupative testaments and furthera no seaman aboard his majestys ships can be arrested for any debt unless the same be sworn to amount to at least twenty pounds though by the annual mutiny acts a soldier may be arrested for a debt which extends to half that value but not to a less amount chapter xiv of master and servant having thus commented on the rights and duties of persons as standing in the public relations of magistrates and people the method i have marked out now leads me to consider their rights and duties in private economical relations the three great relations in private life are   that of master and servant which is founded in convenience whereby a man is directed to call in the assistance of others where his own skill and labour will not be sufficient to answer the cares incumbent upon him   that of husband and wife which is founded in nature but modified by civil society the one directing man to continue and multiply his species the other prescribing the manner in which that natural impulse must be confined and regulated   that of parent and child which is consequential to that of marriage being its principal end and design and it is by virtue of this relation that infants are protected maintained and educated but since the parents on whom this care is primarily incumbent may be snatched away by death before they have completed their duty the law has therefore provided a fourth relation   that of guardian and ward which is a kind of artificial parentage in order to supply the deficiency whenever it happens of the natural of all these relations in their order      in discussing the relation of master and servant i shall first consider the several sorts of servants and how this relation is created and destroyed secondly the effect of this relation with regard to the parties themselves and lastly its effect with regard to other persons     i as to the several sorts of servants i have formerly observeda that pure and proper slavery does not nay cannot subsist in england such i mean whereby an absolute and unlimited power is given to the master over the life and fortune of the slave and indeed it is repugnant to reason and the principles of natural law that such a state should subsist anywhere the three origins of the right of slavery assigned by justinianb are all of them built upon false foundationsc as first slavery is held to arise jure gentium from a state of captivity in war whence slaves are called mancipia quasi manu capti the conqueror say the civilians had a right to the life of his captive and having spared that has a right to deal with him as he pleases but it is an untrue position when taken generally that by the law of nature or nations a man may kill his enemy he has only a right to kill him in particular cases in cases of absolute necessity for selfdefence and it is plain this absolute necessity did not subsist since the victor did not actually kill him but made him prisoner war is itself justifiable only on principles of selfpreservation and therefore it gives no other right over prisoners but merely to disable them from doing harm to us by confining their persons much less can it give a right to kill torture abuse plunder or even to enslave an enemy when the war is over since therefore the right of making slaves by captivity depends on a supposed right of slaughter that foundation failing the consequence drawn from it must fail likewise but secondly it is said that slavery may begin jure civili when one man sells himself to another this if only meant of contracts to serve or work for another is very      just but when applied to strict slavery in the sense of the laws of old rome or modern barbary is also impossible every sale implies a price a quid pro quo an equivalent given to the seller in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer but what equivalent can be given for life and liberty both of which in absolute slavery are held to be in the masters disposal his property also the very price he seems to receive devolves ipso facto to his master the instant he becomes his slave in this case therefore the buyer gives nothing and the seller receives nothing of what validity then can a sale be which destroys the very principles upon which all sales are founded lastly we are told that besides these two ways by which slaves fiunt or are acquired they may also be hereditary servi nascuntur the children of acquired slaves are jure naturæ by a negative kind of birthright slaves also but this being built on the two former rights must fall together with them if neither captivity nor the sale of ones self can by the law of nature and reason reduce the parent to slavery much less can they reduce the offspring upon these principles the law of england abhors and will not endure the existence of slavery within this nation so that when an attempt was made to introduce it by statute   edw vi c   which ordained that all idle vagabonds should be made slaves and fed upon bread and water or small drink and refuse meat should wear a ring of iron round their necks arms or legs and should be compelled by beating chaining or otherwise to perform the work assigned them were it never so vile the spirit of the nation could not brook this condition even in the most abandoned rogues and therefore this statute was repealed in two years afterwardsd and now it is laid downe that a slave or negro the instant he lands in england becomes a freeman that is the law will protect him in the enjoyment of his person and his property  yet with regard to any right which the master may have lawfully acquired to the perpetual     service of john or thomas this will remain exactly in the same state as      before for this is no more than the same state of subjection for life which every apprentice submits to for the space of seven years or sometimes for a longer term  hence too it follows that the infamous and unchristian practice of withholding baptism from negro servants lest they should thereby gain their liberty is totally without foundation as well as without excuse the law of england acts upon general and extensive principles it gives liberty rightly understood that is protection to a jew a turk or a heathen as well as to those who profess the true religion of christ and it will not dissolve a civil obligation between master and servant on account of the alteration of faith in either of the parties but the slave is entitled to the same protection it england before as after baptism and whatever service the heathen negro owed of right to his american master by general not by local law the same whatever it be is he bound to render when brought to england and made a christian      i the first sort of servants therefore acknowledged by the laws of england are menial servants so called from being intra mænia or domestics the contract between them and their masters arises upon the hiring if the hiring be general without any particular time limited the law construes it to be a hiring for a yearf upon a principle of natural equity that the servant shall serve     and the master maintain him throughout all the revolutions of the respective seasons as well when there is work to be done as when there is notg  but the contract may be made for any larger or smaller term all single men between twelve years old and sixty and married ones under thirty years of age and all single women between twelve and forty not having any visible livelihood are compellable by two justices to go out to service in husbandry or certain specific trades for the promotion of honest industry and no master can put away his servant or servant leave his master after being so retained either before or at the end of his term without a quarters warning unless upon      reasonable cause to be allowed by a justice of the peaceh  but they may part by consent or make a special bargain    another species of servants are called apprentices from apprendre to learn and are usually bound for a term of years by deed indented or indentures to serve their masters and be maintained and instructed by them this is usually done to persons of trade in order to learn their art and mystery and sometimes very large sums are given with them as a premium for such their instruction but it may be done to husbandmen nay to gentlemen and others andi     children of poor persons may be apprenticed out by the overseers with consent of two justices till twentyone years of age to such persons as are thought fitting who are also compellable to take them and it is held that gentlemen of fortune and clergymen are equally liable with others to such compulsionk  for which purposes our statutes have made the indentures obligatory even though such parishapprentice be a minorl apprentices to trades may be discharged on reasonable cause either at the request of themselves or masters at the quartersessions or by one justice with appeal to the sessionsm who may by the equity of the statute if they think it reasonable direct restitution of a ratable share of the money given with the apprenticen and parishapprentices may be discharged in the same manner by two justiceso but if an apprentice with whom less than ten pounds hath been given runs away from his master he is compellable to serve out his time of absence or make satisfaction for the same at any time within seven years after the expiration of his original contractp    a third species of servants are labourers who are only hired by the day or the week and do not live intra mænia as      part of the family concerning whom the statutes before citedq have made many very good regulations   directing that all persons who have no visible effects may be compelled to work   defining how long they must continue at work in summer and in winter   punishing such as leave or desert their work   empowering the justices at sessions or the sheriff of the county to settle their wages and   inflicting penalties on such as either give or exact more wages than are so settled   there is yet a fourth species of servants if they may be so called being rather in a superior a ministerial capacity such as stewards factors and bailiffs whom however the law considers as servants pro tempore with regard to such of their acts as affect their masters or employers property which leads me to consider— ii the manner in which this relation of service affects either the master or servant and first by hiring and service for a year or apprenticeship under indentures a person gains a settlement in that parish wherein he last served forty daysr in the next place persons serving seven years as apprentices to any trade have an exclusive right to exercise that trade in any part of englands this law with regard to the exclusive part of it has by turns been looked upon as a hard law or as a beneficial one according to the prevailing humour of the times which has occasioned a great variety of resolutions in the courts of law concerning it and attempts have been frequently made for its repeal though hitherto without success at common law every man might use what trade he pleased but this statute restrains that liberty to such as have served as apprentices the adversaries to which provision say that all restrictions which tend to introduce monopolies are pernicious to trade the advocates for it allege that unskilfulness in trade is equally detrimental to the public     as monopolies this reason indeed only extends to such trades      in the exercise whereof skill is required but another of their arguments goes much further viz that apprenticeships are useful to the commonwealth by employing of youth and learning them to be early industrious but that no one would be induced to undergo a seven years servitude if others though equally skilful were allowed the same advantages without having undergone the same discipline and in this there seems to be much reason however the resolutions of the courts have in general rather confined than extended the restriction no trades are held to be within the statute but such as were in being at the making of itt for trading in a country village apprenticeships are not requisiteu and following the trade seven years without any effectual prosecution either as a master or a servant is sufficient without an actual apprenticeshipw a master may by law correct his apprentice for negligence or other misbehaviour so it be done with moderationx though if the master or masters wife beats any other servant of full age it is good cause of departurey  but if any servant workman or labourer assaults his master or dame he shall suffer one years imprisonment and other open corporal punishment not extending to life or limbz 0     by service all servants and labourers except apprentices become entitled to wages according to their agreement if menial servants or according to the appointment of the sheriff or sessions if labourers or servants in husbandry for the statutes for regulation of wages extend to such servants onlya it being impossible for any magistrate to be a judge of the employment of menial servants or of course to assess their wages       iii let us lastly see how strangers may be affected by this relation of master and servant or how a master may      behave towards others on behalf of his servant and what a servant may do on behalf of his master and first the master may maintain that is abet and assist his servant in any action at law against a stranger whereas in general it is an offence against public justice to encourage suits and animosities by helping to bear the expense of them and is called in law maintenanceb a master also may bring an action against any man for beating or maiming his servant but in such case he must assign as a special reason for so doing his own damage by the loss of his service and this loss must be proved upon the trialc   a master likewise may justify an assault in defence of his servant and a servant in defence of his masterd the master because he has an interest in his servant not to be deprived of his service the servant because it is part of his duty for which he receives his wages to stand by and defend his mastere   also if any person do hire or retain my servant being in my service for which the servant departeth from me and goeth to serve the other i may have an action for damages against both the new master and the servant or either of them but if the new master did not know that he is my servant no action lies unless he afterwards refuse to restore him upon information and demandf the reason and foundation upon which all this doctrine is built seem to be the property that every man has in the service of his domestics acquired by the contract of hiring and purchased by giving them wages       as for those things which a servant may do on behalf of his master they seem all to proceed upon this principle that the master is answerable for the act of his servant if done by his command either expressly given or implied nam qui facit per alium facit per seg therefore if the    0 servant commit a trespass by the command or encouragement of his master the master shall be guilty of it though the servant is not thereby excused for he is only to obey his master in matters that are honest and lawful if an innkeepers servants rob his guests the master is bound to restitutionh for as there is a confidence reposed in him that he will take care to provide honest servants his negligence is a kind of implied consent to the robbery nam qui non prohibit cum prohibere possit jubet   so likewise if the drawer at a tavera   0 sells a man bad wine whereby his health is injured he may bring an action against the masteri for although the master did not expressly order the servant to sell it to that person in particular yet his permitting him to draw and sell it at all is impliedly a general command in the same manner whatever a servant is permitted to do in the usual course of his business is equivalent to a general command if i pay money to a bankers servant the banker is answerable for it if i pay it to a clergymans or a physicians servant whose usual business it is not to receive money for his master and he embezzles it i must pay it over again if a steward lets a lease of a farm without the owners knowledge the owner must stand to the bargain for this is the stewards business a wife a friend a relation that use to transact business for a man are quoad hoc his servants and the principal must answer for their conduct for the law implies that they act under a general command and without such a doctrine as this no mutual intercourse between man and man could subsist with any tolerable convenience if i usually deal with a tradesman by myself or constantly pay him ready money i am not answerable for what my servant takes up upon trust for here is no implied order to the tradesman to trust my servant but if i usually send him upon trust or sometimes on trust and sometimes with ready money i am answerable for all he takes up for the tradesman cannot possibly distinguish when he comes by my order and when upon his own authorityk     0      if a servant lastly by his negligence does any damage to a stranger the master shall answer for his neglect if a smiths servant lames a horse while he is shoeing him an action lies against the master and not     against the servant   but in these cases the damage must be done while he is actually employed in the masters service otherwise the servant shall answer for his own misbehaviour upon this principle by the common lawl if a servant kept his masters fire negligently so that his neighbours house was burned down thereby an action lay against the master because his negligence happened in his service otherwise if the servant going along the street with a torch by negligence sets fire to a house for there he is not in his masters immediate service and must himself answer the damage personally but now the common law is in the former case altered by statute   anne c   which ordains that no action shall be maintained against any in whose house or chamber any fire shall accidentally begin for their own loss is sufficient punishment for their own or their servants carelessness but if such fire happens through negligence of any servant whose loss is commonly very little such servant shall forfeit  00l to be distributed among the sufferers and in default of payment shall be committed to some workhouse and there kept to hard labour for eighteen monthsm   a master is lastly chargeable if any of his family layeth or casteth any thing out of his house into the street or common highway to the damage of any individual or the common nuisance of his majestys liege peoplen for the master hath the superintendence and charge of all his household and this also agrees with the civil lawo which holds that the pater familias in this and similar cases ob alterius culpam tenetur sive servi sive liberi            we may observe that in all the cases here put the master may be frequently a loser by the trust reposed in his servant but never can be a gainer he may frequently be answerable for his servants misbehaviour but never can shelter himself from punishment by laying the blame on his agent     the reason of this is still uniform and the same that the wrong done by the sorvant is looked upon in law as the wrong of the master himself and it is a standing maxim that no man shall be allowed to make any advantage of his own wrong chapter xv of husband and wife the second private relation of persons is that of marriage which includes the reciprocal rights and duties of husband and wife or as most of our elder lawbooks call them of baron and feme in the consideration of which i shall in the first place inquire how marriages may be contracted or made shall next point out the manner in which they may be dissolved and shall lastly take a view of the legal effects and consequence of marriage i our law considers marriage in no other light than as a civil contract      the holiness of the matrimonial state is left entirely to the ecclesiastical law the temporal courts not having jurisdiction to consider unlawful marriage as a sin but merely as a civil inconvenience the punishment therefore or annulling of incestuous or other unscriptural marriage is the province of the spiritual courts which act pro salute animæa and taking it in this civil light the law treats it as it does all other contracts allowing it to be good and valid in all cases where the parties at the time of making it were in the first place willing to contract secondly able to contract and lastly actually did contract in the proper forms and solemnities required by law      first they must be willing to contract consensus non concubitus facit nuptias is the maxim of the civil law in this caseb and it is adopted by the common lawyersc who indeed have borrowed especially in ancient times almost all their notions of the legitimacy of marriage from the canon and civil laws  secondly they must be able to contract in general all persons are able to contract themselves in marriage unless they labour under some particular disabilities and incapacities what those are it will be here our business to inquire now these disabilities are of two sorts first such as are canonical and therefore sufficient by the ecclesiastical laws to avoid the marriage in the spiritual court but these in our law only make the marriage voidable and not ipso facto void until sentence of nullity be obtained of this nature are precontract consanguinity or relation by blood and affinity or relation by marriage and some particular corporal infirmities and these canonical disabilities are either grounded upon the express words of the divine law or are consequences plainly deducible from thence it therefore being sinful in the persons who labour under them to attempt to contract matrimony together they are properly the object of the ecclesiastical magistrates coercion in order to separate the offenders and inflict penance for the offence pro salute animarum     but such marriages not being void ab initio but voidable only by sentence of separation they are esteemed valid to all civil purposes unless such separation is actually made during the life of the parties  for after the death of either of them the courts of common law will not suffer the spiritual courts to declare such marriages to have been void because such declaration cannot now tend to the reformation of the partiesd and therefore when a man had married his first wifes sister and after her death the bishops court was      proceeding to annul the marriage and bastardize the issue the court of kings bench granted a prohibition quoad hoc but permitted them to proceed to punish the husband for inceste these canonical disabilities being entirely the province of the ecclesiastical courts our books are perfectly silent concerning them but there are a few statutes which serve as directories to those courts of which it will be proper to take notice by statute    hen viii c    it is declared that all persons may lawfully marry but such as are prohibited by gods law  and that all marriages contracted by lawful persons in the face of the church and consummated with bodily knowledge and fruit of children shall be indissoluble and because in the times of popery a great variety of degrees of kindred were made impediments to marriage which impediments might however be bought off for money it is declared by the same statute that nothing gods law except shall impeach any marriage but within the levitical degrees  the furthest of which is that between uncle and niecef by the same statute all impediments arising from precontracts to other persons were abolished and declared of none effect unless they had been consummated with bodily knowledge in which case the canon law holds such contract to be a marriage de facto but this branch of the statute was repealed     by statute      edw vi c    how far the act of    geo ii c     which prohibits all suits in ecclesiastical courts to compel a marriage in consequence of any contract may collaterally extend to revive this clause of henry viiis statute and abolish the impediment of precontract i leave to be considered by the canonists  the other sort of disabilities are those which are created or at least enforced by the municipal laws and though some of them may be grounded on natural law yet they are regarded by the laws of the land not so much in the light of any moral offence as on account of the civil inconveniences they draw after them these civil disabilities make the contract void ab initio and not merely voidable not that they      dissolve a contract already formed but they render the parties incapable of forming any contract at all they do not put asunder those who are joined together but they previously hinder the junction and if any persons under these legal incapacities come together it is a meretricious and not a matrimonial union    the first of these legal disabilities is a prior marriage or having another husband or wife living in which case besides the penalties consequent upon it as a felony the second marriage is to all intents and purposes voidg polygamy being condemned both by the law of the new testament and the policy of all prudent states especially in these northern climates and justinian even in the climate of modern turkey is expressh that duas uxores eodem tempore habere non licet   the next legal disability is want of age this is sufficient to avoid all other contracts on account of the imbecility of judgment in the parties contracting a fortiori therefore it ought to avoid this the most important contract of any therefore if a boy under fourteen or a girl under twelve years of age marries this marriage is only inchoate and imperfect  and when either of them comes to the age of consent aforesaid they may disagree and declare the marriage void without any divorce or sentence in the spiritual court this is founded on the civil lawi but the canon law pays a greater regard to the constitution than the age of the partiesj for if they are habiles ad matrimonium it is a good marriage whatever their age may be and in our law it is so far a marriage that if at the age of consent they agree to continue together they need not be married againk if the husband be of years of discretion and the wife     under twelve when she comes to years of discretion he may disagree as well as she may for in contracts the obligation must be mutual both must be bound or neither 0 and so it is vice versâ when the wife is of years of discretion and the husband underl        another incapacity arises from want of consent of parents or guardians by the common law if the parties themselves were of the age of consent there wanted no other concurrence to make the marriage valid and this was agreeable to the canon law but by several statutesm penalties of  00l are laid on every clergyman who marries a couple either without publication of banns which may give notice to parents or guardians or without a license to obtain which the consent of parents or guardians must be sworn to and by the statute      ph and m c   whosoever marries any woman child under the age of sixteen years without consent of parents or guardians shall be subject to fine or five years imprisonment and her estate during the husbands life shall go to and be enjoyed by the next heir   the civil law indeed required the consent of the parent or tutor at all ages unless the children were emancipated or out of the parents powern and if such consent from the father was wanting the marriage was null and the children illegitimateo but the consent of the mother or guardians if unreasonably withheld might be redressed and supplied by the judge or the president of the provincep and if the father was non compos a similar remedy was givenq these provisions are adopted and imitated by the french and hollanders with this difference that in france the sons cannot marry without consent of parents till thirty years of age nor the daughters till twentyfiver   and in holland the sons are at their own disposal at twentyfive and the daughters at twentys   thus hath stood and thus at present stands the law in other neighbouring countries and it has lately been thought proper to introduce somewhat of the same policy into our laws by statute    geo ii c      whereby it is enacted that all marriages     celebrated by license for banns suppose notice where either of the parties is under twentyone not being      a widow or widower who are supposed emancipated without the consent of the father or if he be not living of the mother or guardians shall be absolutely void   a like provision is made as in the civil law where the mother or guardian is non compos beyond sea or unreasonably froward to dispense with such consent at the discretion of the lord chancellor but no provision is made in case the father should labour under any mental or other incapacity   much may be and much has been said both for and against this innovation upon our ancient laws and constitution on the one hand it prevents the clandestine marriages of minors which are often a terrible inconvenience to those private families wherein they happen on the other hand restraints upon marriages especially among the lower class are evidently detrimental to the public by hindering the increase of the people and to religion and morality by encouraging licentiousness and debauchery among the single of both sexes and thereby destroying one end of society and government which is concubitu prohibere vago and of this last inconvenience the roman laws were so sensible that at the same time that they forbade marriage without the consent of parents or guardians they were less rigorous upon that very account with regard to other restraints for if a parent did not provide a husband for his daughter by the time she arrived at the age of twentyfive and she afterwards made a slip in her conduct he was not allowed to disinherit her upon that account quia non sua culpa sed parentum id commisisse cognosciturt         a fourth incapacity is want of reason without a competent share of which as no other so neither can the matrimonial contract be validu it was formerly adjudged that the issue of an idiot was legitimate and consequently that his marriage was valid a strange determination since consent is absolutely requisite to matrimony and neither idiots nor lunatics are capable of consenting to any thing and therefore the civil law judged much more sensibly when it made such deprivations of reason a previous impediment      though not a cause of divorce if they happened after marriagev and modern resolutions have adhered to the reason of the civil law by determiningw that the marriage of a lunatic not being in a lucid interval was absolutely void but as it might be difficult to prove the exact state of the partys mind at the actual celebration of the nuptials upon this account concurring with some private familyx reasons the statute    geo ii c  0 has provided that the marriage of lunatics and persons under phrenzies if found lunatics under a commission or committed to the care of trustees by any act of parliament before they are declared of sound mind by the lord chancellor or the majority of such trustees shall be totally void   lastly the parties must not only be willing and able to contract but actually must contract themselves in due form of law to make it a good civil marriage   any contract made per verba de presenti or in words of the present tense and in case of cohabitation per verba de futuro also between persons able to contract     was before the late act deemed a valid marriage to many purposes and the parties might be compelled in the spiritual courts to celebrate it in facie ecclesiæ but these verbal contracts are now of no force to compel a future marriagey neither is any marriage at present valid that is not celebrated in some parishchurch or public chapel 0 unless by dispensation from the archbishop of canterbury it must also be preceded by publication of banns or by license from the spiritual judge many other formalities are likewise prescribed by the act the neglect of which though penal does not invalidate the marriage it is held to be also essential to a marriage that it be performed by a person in ordersz though the intervention of a priest to solemnize this contract is merely juris positivi and not juris naturalis aut divini it being said that pope innocent the third was the first who ordained the celebration of marriage in the churcha before    0 which it was totally a civil contract and in the times of the grand rebellion all marriages were performed by the justices of the peace and these marriages were declared valid without any fresh solemnization by stat    car ii c    but as the law now stands we may upon the whole collect that no marriage by the temporal law is ipso facto void that is celebrated by a person in orders—in a parishchurch or public chapel or elsewhere by special dispensation—in pursuance of banns or a license—between single persons—consenting—of sound mind—and of the age of twentyone years—or of the age of fourteen in males and twelve in females with consent of parents or guardians or without it in case of widowhood and no marriage is voidable by the ecclesiastical law after the death of either of the parties nor during their lives unless for the canonical impediments of precontract if that indeed still exists of consanguinity and of affinity or corporal imbecility subsisting previous to their marriage ii i am next to consider the manner in which marriages may be dissolved and this is either by death or divorce there are two kinds of divorce the one total the other partial the one a vinculo matrimoniib the other merely a mensa et thoro the total divorce a vinculo matrimonii must be for some of the canonical causes of impediment before mentioned and those existing before the marriage as is always the case in consanguinity not supervenient or arising afterwards as may be the case in affinity or corporal imbecility   for in cases of total divorce the marriage is declared null as having been absolutely unlawful ab initio and the parties are therefore separated pro salute animarum for which reason as was before observed no divorce can be obtained but during the life of the parties the issue of such marriage as is thus entirely dissolved are bastardsc     0 divorce a mensa et thoro is when the marriage is just and lawful ab initio and therefore the law is tender of dissolving      it but for some supervenient cause it becomes improper or impossible for the parties to live together as in the case of intolerable ill temper   or adultery in either of the parties for the canon law which the common law follows in this case deems so highly and with such mysterious reverence of the nuptial tie that it will not allow it to be unloosed for any cause whatsoever that arises after the union is made   and this is said to be built on the divine revealed law though that expressly assigns incontinence as a cause and indeed the only cause why a man may put away his wife and marry anotherd the civil law which is partly of pagan original allows many causes of absolute divorce and some of them pretty severe ones as if a wife goes to the theatre or the public games without the knowledge and consent of the husbande but among them adultery is the principal and with reason named the firstf but with us in england adultery is only a cause of separation from bed and boardg for which the best reason that can be given is that if divorces were allowed to depend upon a matter     within the power of either of the parties they would probably be extremely frequent as was the case when divorces were allowed for canonical disabilities on the mere confession of the partiesh which is now prohibited by the canonsi   however divorces a vinculo matrimonii for adultery have of late years been frequently granted by act of parliament   in case of divorce a mensa et thoro the law allows alimony to the wife which is that allowance which is made to a woman for her support out of the husbands estate being settled at the discretion of the ecclesiastical judge on consideration of all the circumstances of the case this is sometimes called her estovers   for which if he refuses payment there is besides the ordinary process of excommunication a writ at common law de estoveriis habendis in order to recover itj it is generally proportioned to the rank and quality of      the parties but in case of elopement and living with an adulterer the law allows her no alimonyk iii having thus shown how marriages may be made or dissolved i come now lastly to speak of the legal consequences of such making or dissolution by marriage the husband and wife are one person in lawl that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband under whose wing protection and cover she performs every thing and is therefore called in our lawfrench a femecovert fœmina viro cooperta is said to be covertbaron or under the protection and influence of her husband her baron or lord and her condition during her marriage is called her coverture   upon this principle of     a union of person in husband and wife depend almost all the legal rights duties and disabilities that either of them acquire by the marriage i speak not at present of the rights of property but of such as are merely personal for this reason a man cannot grant any thing to his wife or enter into covenant with herm for the grant would be to suppose her separate existence and to covenant with her would be only to covenant with himself and therefore it is also generally true that all compacts made between husband and wife when single are voided by the intermarriagen   a woman indeed may be attorney for her     husbando for that implies no separation from but is rather a representation of her lord and a husband may also bequeath any thing to his wife by will for that cannot take effect till the coverture is determined by his deathp 0 the husband is bound to provide his wife with necessaries by law as much as himself and if she contracts debts for them he is obliged to pay themq but for any thing besides necessaries he is not chargeabler also if a wife elopes and lives with another man the husband is      not chargeable even for necessariess at least if the person who furnishes them is sufficiently apprized of her elopementt   if the wife be indebted before marriage the     husband is bound afterwards to pay the debt for he has adopted her and her circumstances togetheru   if the wife be injured in her person or her property she can bring no action for redress without her husbands concurrence and in his name as well as her ownv neither can she be sued without making the husband a defendantw there is indeed one case where the wife shall sue and be sued as a feme sole viz where the husband has abjured the realm or is banishedx for then he is dead in law and the husband being thus disabled to sue for or defend the wife it would be most unreasonable if she had no remedy or could make no defence at all   in criminal prosecutions it is true the wife may be indicted and punished separatelyy for the union is only a civil union   but in trials of any sort they are not allowed to be witnesses for or against each otherz partly because it is impossible their testimony should be indifferent but principally because of the union of person and therefore if they were admitted to be witnesses for each other they would contradict one maxim of law nemo in propria causa testis esse debeta and if against each other they would contradict another maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusareb   but where the     offence is directly against the person of the wife this rule has been usually dispensed withc and therefore by statute   hen vii c   in case a woman be forcibly taken away and married she may be a witness against such her husband in order to convict him of felony for in this case she can with no propriety be reckoned his wife because a main ingredient her consent was wanting to the contract and also there is another maxim of law that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong which the      ravisher here would do if by forcibly marrying a woman he could prevent her from being a witness who is perhaps the only witness to that very fact in the civil law the husband and the wife are considered as two distinct persons and may have separate estates contracts debts and injuriesd and therefore in our ecclesiastical courts a woman may sue and be sued without her husbande but though our law in general considers man and wife as one person yet there are some instances in which she is separately considered as inferior to him and acting by his compulsion and therefore all deeds executed and acts done by her during her coverture are void except it be a fine or the like matter of record in which case she must be solely and secretly examined to learn if her act be voluntaryf she cannot by will devise lands to her husband unless under special circumstances for at the time of making it she is supposed to be under his coerciong   and in some felonies and other inferior crimes committed by her through constraint of her husband the law excuses herh but this extends not to treason or murder   the husband also by the old law might give his wife moderate correctioni for as he is to answer for her misbehaviour the law thought it reasonable to intrust him with this power of restraining her by domestic chastisement in the same moderation that a man is allowed to correct his apprentices or children for whom the master or parent is also liable in some cases to answer but this     power of correction was confined within reasonable boundsj and the husband was prohibited from using any violence to his wife aliter quam ad virum ex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris suæ licite et rationabiliter pertinet the civil law gave the husband the      same or a larger authority over his wife allowing him for some misdemeanours flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem for others only modicam castigationem adhiberek but with us in the politer reign of charles the second this power of correction began to be doubtedl and a wife may now have security of the peace against her husbandm or in return a husband against his wifen yet the lower rank of people who were always fond of the old common law still claim and exert their ancient privilege and the courts of law will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty in case of any gross misbehaviouro these are the chief legal effects of marriage during the coverture upon which we may observe that even the disabilities which the wife lies under are for the most part intended for her protection and benefit so great a favourite is the female sex of the laws of england       chapter xvi of parent and child the next and the most universal relation in nature is immediately derived from the preceding being that between parent and child children are of two sorts legitimate and spurious or bastards each of which we shall consider in their order and first of legitimate children i a legitimate child is he that is born in lawful wedlock or within a competent time afterwards pater est quem nuptiæ demonstrant is the rule of the civil lawa and this holds with the civilians whether the nuptials happen before or after the birth of the child with us in england the rule is narrowed for the nuptials must be precedent to the birth of which more will be said when we come to consider the case of bastardy at present let us inquire into   the legal duties of parents to their legitimate children   their power over them   the duties of such children to their parents   and first the duties of parents to legitimate children which principally consist in three particulars their maintenance their protection and their education      the duty of parents to provide for the maintenance of their children is a principle of natural law an obligation says puffendorfb laid on them not only by nature herself but by their own proper act in bringing them into the world for they would be in the highest manner injurious to their issue if they only gave their children life that they might afterwards see them perish by begetting them therefore they have entered into a voluntary obligation to endeavour as far as in them lies that the life which they have bestowed shall be supported and preserved and thus the children will have the perfect right of receiving maintenance from their parents and the president montesquieuc has a very just observation upon this head that the establishment of marriage in all civilized states is built on this natural obligation of the father to provide for his children for that ascertains and makes known the person who is bound to fulfil this obligation whereas in promiscuous and illicit conjunctions the father is unknown and the mother finds a thousand obstacles in her way shame remorse the constraint of her sex and the rigour of laws that stifle her inclinations to perform this duty and besides she generally wants ability the municipal laws of all wellregulated states have taken care to enforce this duty though providence has done it more effectually than any laws by implanting in the breast of every parent that natural στοργη or insuperable degree of affection which not even the deformity of person or mind not even the wickedness ingratitude and rebellion of children can totally suppress or extinguish the civil lawd obliges the parent to provide maintenance for his child     and if he refuses judex de ea re cognoscet nay it carries this matter so far that it will not suffer a parent at his death totally to disinherit his child without expressly giving      his reason for so doing and there are fourteen such reasons reckoned upe which may justify such disinherison if the parent alleged no reason or a bad or a false one the child might set the will aside tanquam testamentum inofficiosum a testament contrary to the natural duty of the parent and it is remarkable under what colour the children were to move for relief in such a case by suggesting that the parent had lost the use of his reason when he made the inofficious testament and this as puffendorf observesf was not to bring into dispute the testators power of disinheriting his own offspring but to examine the motives upon which he did it and if they were found defective in reason then to set them aside but perhaps this is going rather too far every man has or ought to have by the laws of society a power over his own property and as grotius very well distinguishesg natural right obliges to give a necessary maintenance to children but what is more than that they have no other right to than as it is given them by the favour of their parents or the positive constitutions of the municipal law let us next see what provision our own laws have made for this natural duty it is a principle of lawh that there is an obligation on every man to provide for those descended from his loins and the manner in which this obligation shall be performed is thus pointed outi  the father and mother     grandfather and grandmother of poor impotent persons shall maintain them at their own charges if of sufficient ability according as the quartersession shall direct andk if a parent runs away and leaves his children the churchwardens and overseers of the parish shall seize his rents goods and chattels and dispose of them toward their relief by the interpretations which the courts of law have made upon these statutes if a mother or grandmother marries again and was before such second marriage of sufficient ability to keep the child the husband shall be charged to      maintain itl for this being a debt of hers when single shall like others extend to charge the husband      but at her death the relation being dissolved the husband is under no further obligation  no person is bound to provide a maintenance for his issue unless where the children are impotent and unable to work either through infancy disease or accident and then is only obliged to find them with necessaries the penalty on refusal being no more than  0s a month  for the policy of our laws which are ever watchful to promote industry did not mean to compel a father to maintain his idle and lazy children in ease and indolence but thought it unjust to oblige the parent against his will to provide them with superfluities and other indulgences of fortune imagining they might trust to the impulse of nature if the children were deserving of such favours yet as nothing is so apt to stifle the calls of nature as religious bigotry it is enactedm that if any popish parent shall refuse to allow his protestant child a fitting maintenance with a view to compel him to change his religion the lord chancellor shall by order of court constrain him to do what is just and reasonable but this did not extend to persons of another religion of no less bitterness and bigotry than the popish and therefore in the very next year we find an instance of a jew of immense riches whose only daughter having embraced christianity he turned her out of doors and on her application for relief it was held she was entitled to nonen  but this gave occasiono to another statutep which ordains that if jewish parents refuse to allow their protestant children a fitting maintenance suitable to the fortune of the parent the lord chancellor on complaint may make such order therein as he shall see proper  our law has made no provision to prevent the disinheriting of children by will leaving every mans property in his    0 own disposal upon a principle of liberty in this as well as every other action though perhaps it had not been amiss if the parent had been bound to leave them at least a necessary subsistence indeed among persons of any rank or fortune a competence is generally provided for younger children and the bulk of the estate settled upon the eldest by the marriagearticles heirs also and children are favourites of our courts of justice and cannot be disinherited by any dubious or   0 ambiguous words there being required the utmost certainty of the testators intentions to take away the right of an heirq  from the duty of maintenance we may easily pass to that of protection which is also a natural duty but rather permitted than enjoined by any municipal laws nature in this respect working so strongly as to need rather a check than a spur a parent may by our laws maintain and uphold his children in their lawsuits without being guilty of the legal crime of maintaining quarrelsr a parent may also justify an assault and battery in defence of the persons of his childrens nay where a mans son was beaten by another boy and the father went near a mile to find him and there revenged the sons quarrel by beating the other boy of which beating he afterwards unfortunately died it was not held to be murder but manslaughter merelyt  such indulgence does the law show to the frailty of human nature and the workings of parental affection the last duty of parents to their children is that of giving them an education suitable to their station in life a duty pointed out by reason and of far the greatest importance of any for as puffendorf very well observesu it is not      easy to imagine or allow that a parent has conferred any considerable benefit upon his child by bringing him into the world if he afterwards entirely neglects his culture and education and suffers him to grow up like a mere beast to lead a life useless to others and shameful to himself yet the municipal laws of most countries seem to be defective in this point by not constraining the parent to bestow a proper education upon his children perhaps they thought it punishment enough to leave the parent who neglects the instruction of his family to labour under those griefs and inconveniences which his family so uninstructed will be sure to bring upon him our laws though their defects in this particular cannot be denied have in one instance made a wise provision for breeding up the rising generation since the poor and laborious part of the community when past the age of nurture are taken out of the hands of their parents by the statutes for apprenticing poor childrenw     and are placed out by the public in such a manner as may render their abilities in their several stations of the greatest advantage to the commonwealth the rich indeed are left at their own option whether they will breed up their children to be ornaments or disgraces to their family yet in one case that of religion they are under peculiar restrictions forx it is provided that if any person sends any child under his government beyond the seas either to prevent its good education in england or in order to enter into or reside in any popish college or to be instructed persuaded or strengthened in the popish religion in such case besides the disabilities incurred by the child so sent the parent or person sending shall forfeit  00l whichy shall go to the sole use and benefit of him that shall discover the offence andz if any parent or other shall send or convey any person beyond sea to enter into or be resident in or trained up in any priory abbey nunnery popish university college or school or house of jesuits or priests or in any private popish family in order to be instructed persuaded or confirmed in the      popish religion or shall contribute any thing towards their maintenance when abroad by any pretext whatever the person both sending and sent shall be disabled to sue in law or equity or to be executor or administrator to any person or to enjoy any legacy or deed of gift or to bear any office in the realm and shall forfeit all his goods and chattels and likewise all his real estate for life    the power of parents over their children is derived from the former consideration their duty this authority being given them partly to enable the parent more effectually to perform his duty and partly as a recompense for his care and trouble in the faithful discharge of it and upon this score the municipal laws of some nations have given a much larger authority to the parents than others the ancient roman laws gave the father a power of life and death over his children upon this principle that he who gave had also the power of taking awaya but the rigour of these laws was softened by subsequent constitutions so thatb we find a father banished by the emperor hadrian for killing his son though he had committed a very heinous crime upon this maxim that patria potestas in pietate debet non in atrocitate consistere but still they maintained to the last a very large and absolute authority for a son could not acquire any property of his own during the life of his father but all his acquisitions belonged to the father or at least the profits of them for his lifec the power of a parent by our english laws is much more moderate but still sufficient to keep the child in order and obedience 0 he may lawfully correct his child being under age in a reasonable mannerd for this is for the benefit of his education   the consent or concurrence of the parent to the marriage     of his child under age was also directed by our ancient law to be obtained but now it is absolutely necessary for without it the contract is voide and this also is another means which the law has put into the parents hands in      order the better to discharge his duty first of protecting his children from the snares of artful and designing persons and next of settling them properly in life by preventing the ill consequences of too early and precipitate marriages a father has no other power over his sons estate than as his trustee or guardian for though he may receive the profits during the childs minority yet he must account for them when he comes of age   he may indeed have the benefit of his childrens labour while they live with him and are maintained by him but this is no more than he is entitled to from his apprentices or servants   the legal power of a father—for a mother as such is entitled to no power but only to reverence and respect   the power of a father i say over the persons of his children ceases at the age of twentyone for they are then enfranchised by arriving at years of discretion or that point which the law has established as some must necessarily be established when the empire of the father or other guardian gives place to the empire of reason yet till that age arrives this empire of the father continues even after his death for he may by his will appoint a guardian to his children he may also delegate part of his     parental authority during his life to the tutor or schoolmaster of his child who is then in loco parentis and has such a portion of the power of the parent committed to his charge viz that of restraint and correction as may be necessary to answer the purposes for which he is employed     the duties of children to their parents arise from a principle of natural justice and retribution for to those who gave us existence we naturally owe subjection and obedience during our minority and honour and reverence ever after they who protected the weakness of our infancy are entitled to our protection in the infirmity of their age they who by sustenance and education have enabled their offspring to prosper ought in return to be supported by that offspring in case they stand in need of assistance upon this principle proceed all the duties of children to their parents which are enjoined by positive laws and the athenian lawsf carried      this principle into practice with a scrupulous kind of nicety obliging all children to provide for their father when fallen into poverty with an exception to spurious children to those whose chastity had been prostituted by consent of the father and to those whom he had not put in any way of gaining a livelihood the legislature says baron montesquieug considered that in the first case the father being uncertain bad rendered the natural obligation precarious that in the second case he had sullied the life he had given and done his children the greatest of injuries in depriving them of their reputation and that in the third case he had rendered their life so far as in him lay an insupportable burden by furnishing them with no means of subsistence our laws agree with those of athens with regard to the first only of these particulars the case of spurious issue in the other cases the law does not hold the tie of nature to be dissolved by any misbehaviour of the parent and therefore a child is equally justifiable in defending the person or maintaining the cause or suit of a bad parent as a good one and is equally compellableh if of sufficient ability to maintain and provide for a wicked and unnatural progenitor as for one who has shown the greatest tenderness and parental piety   ii we are next to consider the case of illegitimate children or bastards with regard to whom let us inquire   who are bastards   the legal duties of the parents towards a bastard child   the rights and incapacities attending such bastard children   who are bastards a bastard by our english laws is one that is not only begotten but born out of lawful matrimony the civil and canon laws do not allow a child to remain a bastard if the parents afterwards intermarryi and herein they differ most materially from our law which though not so strict as to require that the child shall be begotten      yet makes it an indispensable condition to make it legitimate that it shall be born after lawful wedlock and the reason of our english law is surely much superior to that of the     roman if we consider the principal end and design of establishing the contract of marriage taken in a civil light abstractly from any religious view which has nothing to do with the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the children the main end and design of marriage therefore being to ascertain and fix upon some certain person to whom the care the protection the maintenance and the education of the children should belong this end is undoubtedly better answered by legitimating all issue born after wedlock than by legitimating all issue of the same parties even born before wedlock so as wedlock afterwards ensues   because of the very great uncertainty there will generally be in the proof that the issue was really begotten by the same man whereas by confining the proof to the birth and not to the begetting our law has rendered it perfectly certain what child is legitimate and who is to take care of the child   because by the roman law a child may be continued a bastard or made legitimate at the option of the father and mother by a marriage ex post facto thereby opening a door to many frauds and partialities which by our law are prevented   because by those laws a man may remain a bastard till forty years of age and then become legitimate by the subsequent marriage of his parents whereby the main end of marriage the protection of infants is totally frustrated   because this rule of the roman law admits of no limitations as to the time or number of bastards so to be legitimated but a dozen of them may twenty years after their birth by the subsequent marriage of their parents be admitted to all the privileges of legitimate children this is plainly a great discouragement to the matrimonial state to which one main inducement is usually not only the desire of having children but also the desire of procreating lawful heirs whereas our constitutions guard against this indecency and at the same time give sufficient allowance to the frailties of human nature for if a child be begotten while the parents are single and they will endeavour to make an early reparation for the offence by      marrying within a few months after our law is so indulgent as not to bastardize the child if it be born though not begotten in lawful wedlock for this is an incident that can happen but once since all future children will be begotten as well as born within the rules of honour and civil society upon reasons like these we may suppose the peers to have acted at the parliament of merton when they refused to enact that children born before marriage should be esteemed legitimatek   from what has been said it appears that all children born before matrimony are bastards by our law and so it is of all children born so long after the death of the husband that by the usual course of gestation they could not be begotten by him but this being a matter of some uncertainty the law is not exact as to a few daysl   and this gives occasion to a proceeding at common     law where a widow is suspected to feign herself with child in order to produce a supposititious heir to the estate an attempt which the rigour of the gothic constitutions esteemed equivalent to the most atrocious theft and therefore punished with deathm in this case with us the heirpresumptive may have a writ de ventre inspiciendo to examine whether she be with child or notn   and if she be to keep her under proper restraint till delivered which is entirely conformable to the practice of the civil lawo but if the widow be upon due examination found not pregnant the presumptive heir shall be admitted to the inheritance though liable to lose it again on the birth of a child within forty weeks from the death of a husbandp but if a man dies and his widow soon after marries again and a child is born within such a time as that by the course of nature it might have been the child of either      husband in this case he is said to be more than ordinarily legitimate for he may when he arrives to years of discretion choose which of the fathers he pleasesq 0 to prevent this among other inconveniences the civil law ordained that no widow should marry infra annum luctusr a rule which obtained so early as the reign of augustuss if not of romulus and the same constitution was probably handed down to our early ancestors from the romans during their stay in this island for we find it established under the saxon and danish governmentst as bastards may be born before the coverture or marriage state is begun or after it is determined so also children born during wedlock may in some circumstances be bastards as if the husband be out of the kingdom of england or as the law somewhat loosely phrases it extra quatuor mariau for above nine months so that no access to his wife can be presumed her issue during that period shall be bastardsv but generally during the coverture access of the husband shall be presumed unless the contrary can be shownw which is such a negative as can only be proved by showing him to be elsewhere for the general rule is præsumitur pro legitimationex   in a divorce a mensa et thoroy if the     wife breeds children they are bastards for the law will presume the husband and wife conformable to the sentence of separation unless access be proved but in a voluntary separation by agreement the law will suppose access unless the negative be shownz so also if there is an apparent impossibility of procreation on the part of the husband as if he be only eight years old or the like there the issue of the wife shall be bastardsa likewise in case of divorce in the spiritual court a vinculo matrimoniib all the issue born during the coverture are bastardsc because such divorce is always upon      some cause that rendered the marriage unlawful and null from the beginning   let us next see the duty of parents to their bastard children by our law which is principally that of maintenance for though bastards are not looked upon as children to any civil purposes yet the ties of nature of which maintenance is one are not so easily dissolved and they hold indeed as to many other intentions as particularly that a man shall not marry his bastard sister or daughterd the civil law therefore when it denied maintenance to bastards begotten under certain atrocious circumstancese was neither consonant to nature nor reason however profligate and wicked the parents might justly be esteemed the method in which the english law provides maintenance for them is as followsf when a woman is delivered or declares herself with child of a bastard and will by oath before a justice of peace charge any person as having got her with child the justice shall cause such person to be apprehended and commit him till he gives security either to maintain the child or appear at the next quartersessions to dispute and try the fact but if the woman dies or is married before delivery or miscarries or proves not to have been with child the person shall be discharged otherwise the sessions or two justices out of sessions upon original application to them may take order for the keeping of the bastard by charging the mother or the reputed father with the payment of money or other sustentation for that purpose and if such putative father or lewd mother run away from the parish the overseers by direction of two justices may seize their rents goods and chattels in order to bring up the said bastard child yet such is the humanity of our laws that no woman can be compulsively questioned concerning the father of her child till one month after her delivery which indulgence is however very frequently a hardship upon parishes by giving the parents opportunity to escape              i proceed next to the rights and incapacities which appertain to a bastard the rights are very few being only such as he can acquire for he can inherit nothing being looked upon as the son of nobody and sometimes called filius nullius sometimes filius populig yet he may gain a sirname by reputationh though he has none by inheritance   all other children have their primary settlement in their fathers parish but a bastard in the parish where born for he hath no fatheri however in case of fraud as if a woman be sent either by order of justices or comes to beg as a vagrant to a parish where she does not belong to and drops her bastard there the bastard shall in the first case be settled in the parish from whence she was illegally removedj or in the latter case in the mothers own parish if the mother be apprehended for her vagrancyk bastards also born in any licensed hospital     for pregnant women are settled in the parishes to which the mothers belongl the incapacity of a bastard consists principally in this that he cannot be heir to any one neither can he have heirs but of his own body for being nullius filius he is therefore of kin to nobody and has no ancestor from whom any inheritable blood can be derived a bastard was also in strictness incapable of holy orders and though that were dispensed with yet he was utterly disqualified from holding any dignity in the churchm but this doctrine seems now obsolete and in all other respects there is no distinction between a bastard and another man and really any other distinction but that of not inheriting which civil policy renders necessary would with regard to the innocent offspring of his parents crimes be odious unjust and cruel to the last degree and yet the civil law so boasted of for its equitable decisions made bastards in some cases incapable even of a gift from their parentsn a bastard may lastly be made legitimate and capable of inheriting by the transcendent power of an act of parliament and not otherwiseo as was done in the case of john of gaunts bastard children by a statute of richard the second chapter xvii of guardian and ward the only general private relation now remaining to be discussed is that of guardian and ward  which bears a very near resemblance to the last and is plainly derived out of it the guardian being only a temporary parent that is for so long time as the ward is an infant or under age in examining this species of relationship i shall first consider the different kinds of guardians how they are appointed and their power and duty next the different ages of persons as defined by the law and lastly the privileges and disabilities of an infant or one under age and subject to guardianship   the guardian with us performs the office both of the tutor and curator of the roman laws the former of which had the charge of the maintenance and education of the minor the latter the care of his fortune or according to the language of the court of chancery the tutor was the committee of the person the curator the committee of the estate but this office was frequently united in the civil lawa as it is always in our law with regard to minors though as to lunatics and idiots it is commonly kept distinct      of the several species of guardians the first are guardians by nature viz the father and in some cases the mother of the child for if an estate be left to an infant the father is by common law the guardian and must account to his child for the profitsb  and with regard to daughters it seems     by construction of statute      ph and mar c   that the father might by deed or will assign a guardian to any womanchild under the age of sixteen and if none be so assigned the mother shall in this case be guardianc  there are also guardians for nurtured which are of course the father or mother till the infant attains the age of fourteen yearse and in default of father or mother the ordinary usually assigns some discreet persons to take care of the infants personal estate and to provide for his maintenance and educationf  next are guardians in socage  an appellation which will be fully explained in the second book of these commentaries who are also called guardians by the common law these take place only when the minor is entitled to some estate in lands and then by the common law the guardianship devolves upon his next of kin to whom the inheritance cannot possibly descend as where the estate descended from his father in this case his uncle by the mothers side cannot possibly inherit this estate and therefore shall be the guardiang for the law judges it improper to trust the person of an infant in his hands who may by possibility become heir to him that there may be no temptation nor even suspicion of temptation for him to abuse his trusth the roman laws proceed on a quite contrary principle committing the care of the minor to him who is the next to succeed to the inheritance presuming that the next heir would take the best care of an estate to which he has a prospect of succeeding and this they boast to be summa providentiai but in the mean time they seem to have forgotten how much it is the      guardians interest to remove the encumbrance of his pupils life from that estate for which he     is supposed to have so great a regardk and this affords fortescuel and sir edward cokem an ample opportunity for triumph they affirming that to commit the custody of an infant to him that is next in succession is quasi agnum committere lupo ad devorandumn  these guardians in socage like those for nurture continue only till the minor is fourteen years of age for then in both cases he is presumed to have discretion so far as to choose his own guardian this he may do unless one be appointed by the father by virtue of the statute    car ii c    which considering the imbecility of judgment in children of the age of fourteen and the abolition of guardianship in chivalry which lasted till the age of twentyone and of which we shall speak hereafter enacts that any father under age or of full age may by deed or will dispose of the custody of his child either born or unborn to any person except a popish recusant either in possession or reversion till such child attains the age of oneandtwenty years  these are called guardians by statute or testamentary guardians there are also special guardians by custom of london and other placeso but they are particular exceptions and do not fall under the general law      the power and reciprocal duty of a guardian and ward are the same pro     tempore as that of a father and child and therefore i shall not repeat them but shall only add that the guardian when the ward comes of age is bound to give          him an account of all that he has transacted on his behalf and must answer for all losses by his wilful default or negligence  in order therefore to prevent disagreeable contests with young gentlemen it has become a practice of many guardians of large estates especially to indemnify themselves by applying to the court of chancery acting under its direction and accounting annually before the officers of that court for the lord chancellor is by right derived from the crown the general and supreme guardian of all infants as well as idiots and lunatics that is of all such persons as have not discretion enough to manage their own concerns in case therefore any guardian abuses     his trust the court will check and punish him nay sometimes will proceed to the removal of him and appoint another in his steadp 0       let us next consider the ward or person within age for whose assistance and support these guardians are constituted by law or who it is that is said to be within age the ages of male and female are different for different purposes a male at twelve years old may take the oath of allegiance at fourteen is at years of discretion and therefore may consent or disagree to marriage may choose his guardian and if his discretion be actually proved may make his testament of his personal estate at seventeen may be an executor and at twentyone is at his own disposal and may aliene his lands goods and chattels a female also at seven years of age may be betrothed or given in marriage at nine is entitled to dower at twelve is at years of maturity and therefore may consent or disagree to marriage and if proved to have sufficient discretion may bequeath her personal estate at fourteen is at years of legal discretion and may choose a guardian at seventeen may be executrix and at twentyone may dispose of herself and her lands so that full age in male or female is twentyone years which age is completed on the day preceding the anniversary of a persons birthq   who till that time is an infant and so styled in law among the ancient greeks and romans women were never      of age but subject to perpetual guardianshipr unless when married nisi convenissent in manum viris and when that perpetual tutelage wore away in process of time we find that in females as well as males full age was not till twentyfive yearst thus by the constitution of different kingdoms this period which is merely arbitrary and juris positivi is fixed at different times scotland agrees with england in this point both probably copying from the old saxon constitutions on the continent which extended the age of minority ad annum vigesimum primum et eo usque juvenes sub tutelam reponuntuv but in naples they are of full age at eighteen in france with regard to marriage not till thirty and in holland at twentyfive   infants have various privileges and various disabilities but their very disabilities are privileges in order to secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts an infant cannot be sued but under the protection and joining the name of his guardian for he is to defend him against all attacks as well by law as otherwisew   but he may sue either by his guardian or prochein amy his next friend who is not his guardian this prochein amy may be any person who will undertake the infants cause and it frequently happens that an infant by his prochein amy institutes a suit in equity against a fraudulent guardian in criminal cases an infant of the age of fourteen years     may be capitally punished for any capital offencex but under the age of seven he cannot the period between seven and fourteen is subject to much uncertainty for the infant shall generally speaking be judged prima facie innocent yet if he was doli capax and could discern between good and evil at the time of the offence committed he may be convicted and undergo judgment and execution of death though he hath not attained to years of puberty or      discretiony and sir matthew hale gives us two instances one of a girl of thirteen who was burned for killing her mistress another of a boy still younger that had killed his companion and hid himself who was hanged for it appeared by his hiding that he knew he had done wrong and could discern between good and evil and in such cases the maxim of law is that malitia supplet ætatem so also in much more modern times a boy of ten years old who was guilty of a heinous murder was held a proper subject for capital punishment by the opinion of all the judgesz with regard to estates and civil property an infant hath many privileges which will be better understood when we come to treat more particularly of those matters but this may be said in general that an infant shall lose nothing by nonclaim or neglect of demanding his right nor shall any other laches or negligence be imputed to an infant except in some very particular cases it is generally true that an infant can neither aliene his lands nor do any legal act nor make a deed nor indeed any manner of contract that will bind him but still to all these rules there are some exceptions part of which were just now mentioned in reckoning up the different capacities which they assume at different ages and there are others a few of which it may not be improper to recite as a general specimen of the whole and first it is true that infants cannot aliene their estates but infant trustees or mortgagees are enabled to convey under the direction of the court of chancery or exchequer or other courts of equity the estates they hold in trust or mortgage to such person as the court shall appointa also it is generally true that an infant can do no legal act yet an infant who has an advowson may present to the benefice when it becomes voidb for the law in this case dispenses with one rule in order to maintain others of far      greater consequence it permits an infant to present a clerk who if unfit may be rejected by the bishop rather than either suffer the church to be unserved till he comes of age or permit the infant to be debarred of his right by lapse to the bishop an infant may also purchase lands but his purchase is incomplete for when he comes to age he may either agree or disagree to it as he thinks prudent or proper without alleging any reason and so may his heirs after him if he dies without having completed his agreementc it is further generally true that an infant under twentyone can make no deed but what is afterwards voidable yet in some casesd he may bind himself apprentice by deed indented or indentures for seven years ande he may by deed or will appoint a guardian to his children if he has any lastly it is generally true that an infant can make no other contract that will bind him   yet he may bind himself to pay for his necessary meat drink apparel physic and such other necessaries   and likewise     for his good teaching and instruction whereby he may profit himself afterwardsf and thus much at present for the privileges and disabilities of infants       chapter xviii of corporations we have hitherto considered persons in their natural capacities and have treated of their rights and duties but as all personal rights die with the person and as the necessary forms of investing a series of individuals one after another with the same identical rights would be very inconvenient if not impracticable it has been found necessary when it is for the advantage of the public to have any particular rights kept on foot and continued to constitute artificial persons who may maintain a perpetual succession and enjoy a kind of legal immortality these artificial persons are called bodies politic bodies corporate corpora corporata or corporations of which there is a great variety subsisting for the advancement of religion of learning and of commerce in order to preserve entire and forever those rights and immunities which if they were granted only to those individuals of which the body corporate is composed would upon their death be utterly lost and extinct to show the advantages of these incorporations let us consider the case of a college in either of our universities founded ad studendum et orandum for the encouragement and support of religion and learning if this were a mere voluntary assembly the individuals which compose it might indeed read pray study and perform scholastic exercises together so long as they could agree to do so but they      could neither frame nor receive any laws or rules of their conduct none at least which would have any binding force for want of a coercive power to create a sufficient obligation neither could they be capable of retaining any privileges or immunities for if such privileges be attacked which of all this unconnected assembly has the right or ability to defend them and when they are dispersed by death or otherwise how shall they transfer these advantages to another set of students equally unconnected as themselves so also with regard to holding estates or other property if land be granted for the purposes of religion or learning to twenty individuals not incorporated there is no legal way of continuing the property to any other persons for the same purposes but by endless conveyances from one to the other as often as the hands are changed but when they are consolidated and united into a corporation they and their successors are then considered as one person in law as one person they have one will which is collected from the sense of the majority of the individuals this     one will may establish rules and orders for the regulation of the whole which are a sort of municipal laws of this little republic or rules and statutes may be prescribed to it at its creation which are then in the place of natural laws the privileges and immunities the estates and possessions of the corporation when once vested in them will be forever vested without any new conveyance to new successions for all the individual members that have existed from the foundation to the present time or that shall ever hereafter exist are but one person in law a person that never dies in like manner as the river thames is still the same river though the parts which compose it are changing every instant the honour of originally inventing these political constitutions entirely belongs to the romans they were introduced as plutarch says by numa who finding upon his accession the city torn to pieces by the two rival factions of sabines and romans thought it a prudent and politic measure to subdivide these two into many smaller ones by      instituting separate societies of every manual trade and profession they were afterwards much considered by the civil lawa in which they were called universitates as forming one whole out of many individuals or collegia from being gathered together they were adopted also by the canon law for the maintenance of ecclesiastical discipline and from them our spiritual corporations are derived but our laws have considerably refined and improved upon the invention according to the usual genius of the english nation particularly with regard to sole corporations consisting of one person only of which the roman lawyers had no notion their maxim being that tres faciunt collegiumb though they held that if a corporation originally consisting of three persons be reduced to one si universitas ad unum redit it may still subsist as a corporation et stet nomen universitatisc before we proceed to treat of the several incidents of corporations as regarded by the laws of england let us first take a view of the several sorts of them and then we shall be better enabled to apprehend their respective qualities  the first division of corporations is into aggregate and sole corporations aggregate consist of many persons united together into one society and are     kept up by a perpetual succession of members so as to continue forever of which kind are the mayor and commonalty of a city the head and fellows of a college the dean and chapter of a cathedral church corporations sole consist of one person only and his successors in some particular station who are incorporated by law in order to give them some legal capacities and advantages particularly that of perpetuity which in their natural persons they could not have had in this sense the king is a sole corporationd so is a bishop so are some deans and prebendaries distinct from their several chapters and so is every parson and vicar and the necessity or at least use of this institution will be very apparent if we consider the case of    0 a parson of a church at the original endowment of parish churches the freehold of the church the churchyard the parsonage house the glebe and the tithes of the parish were vested in the then parson by the bounty of the donor as a temporal recompense to him for his spiritual care of the inhabitants and with intent that the same emoluments should ever afterwards continue as a recompense for the same care but how was this to be effected the freehold was vested in the parson and if we suppose it vested in his natural capacity on his death it might descend to his heir and would be liable to his debts and encumbrances or at best the heir might be compellable at some trouble and expense to convey these rights to the succeeding incumbent the law therefore has wisely ordained that the parson quatenus parson shall never die any more than the king by making him and his successors a corporation by which means all the original rights of the parsonage are preserved entire to the successor for the present incumbent and his predecessor who lived seven centuries ago are in law one and the same person and what was given to the one was given to the other also another division of incorporations either sole or aggregate is into ecclesiastical and lay ecclesiastical corporations are where the members that compose it are entirely spiritual persons such as bishops certain deans and prebendaries all archdeacons parsons and vicars which are sole corporations deans and chapters at present and formerly prior and convent abbot and monks and the like bodies aggregate these are erected for the furtherance of religion and perpetuating the rights of the church lay corporations are of two sorts civil and eleemosynary the civil are such as are erected for a variety of temporal purposes the king for instance is made a corporation to prevent in general the possibility of an interregnum or vacancy of the throne and to preserve the possessions of the crown entire for immediately upon the demise of one king his successor is as we have formerly seen in full possession of the regal rights and dignity other lay corporations are erected for the good government of      a town or particular district as a mayor and commonalty bailiff and burgesses or the like some for the advancement and regulation of manufactures and commerce as the trading companies of london and other towns and some for the better carrying on of divers special purposes as churchwardens for conservation of the goods of the parish the college of physicians and company of surgeons in london for the improvement of the medical science the royal society for the advancement of natural knowledge and the society of antiquaries for promoting the study of antiquities and among these i am inclined to think the general corporate bodies of the universities of oxford and cambridge must be ranked for it is clear they are not spiritual or ecclesiastical corporations being composed of more laymen than clergy neither are they eleemosynary foundations though stipends are annexed to particular magistrates and professors any more than other corporations where the acting officers have standing salaries for these are rewards pro opera et labore not charitable donations only since every stipend is preceded by service and duty they seem therefore to be merely civil corporations the eleemosynary sort are such as are constituted for the perpetual distribution of the free alms or bounty of the founder of them to such persons as he has directed of this kind are all hospitals for the maintenance of the poor sick and impotent and all colleges both in our universities and oute of them which colleges are founded for two purposes       for the promotion of piety and learning by proper regulations and ordinances   for imparting assistance to the members of those bodies in order to enable them to prosecute their devotion and studies with greater ease and assiduity and all these eleemosynary corporations are strictly speaking lay and not ecclesiastical even though composed of ecclesiastical personsf and although they in some things partake of the nature privileges and restrictions of ecclesiastical bodies       having thus marshalled the several species of corporations let us next proceed to consider   how corporations in general may be created   what are their powers capacities and incapacities   how corporations are visited and   how they may be dissolved i corporations by the civil law seem to have been created by the mere act and voluntary association of their members provided such convention was not contrary to law for then it was illicitum collegiumg it does not appear that the princes consent was necessary to be actually given to the foundation of them but merely that the original founders of these voluntary and friendly societies for they were little more than such should not establish any meetings in opposition to the laws of the state but with us in england the kings consent is absolutely necessary to the erection of any corporation either impliedly or expressly givenh the kings implied consent is to be found in corporations which exist by force of the common law to which our former kings are supposed to have given their concurrence common law being nothing else but custom arising from the universal agreement of the whole community of this sort are the king himself all bishops parsons vicars churchwardens and some others who by common law have ever been held as far as our books can show us to have been corporations virtute officii and this incorporation is so inseparately annexed to their offices that we cannot frame a complete legal idea of any of these persons but we must also have an idea of a corporation capable to transmit      his rights to his successors at the same time another method of implication whereby the kings consent is presumed is as to all corporations by prescription such as the city of london and many othersi which have existed as corporations time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary and therefore are looked upon in law to be well created for though the members thereof can show no legal charter of incorporation yet in cases of such high antiquity the law presumes there once was one and that by the variety of accidents which a length of time may produce the charter is lost or destroyed the methods by which the kings consent is expressly given are either by act of parliament or charter by act of parliament of which the royal assent is a necessary ingredient corporations may undoubtedly be createdj but it is observable that till of late years most of those statutes which are usually cited as having created corporations do either confirm such as have been before created by the king as in the case of the college of physicians erected by charter  0 hen viiik which charter was afterwards confirmed in parliamentl or they permit the king to erect a corporation in futuro with such and such powers as is the case of the bank of englandm and the society of the british fisheryn so that the immediate creative act was usually performed by the king alone in virtue of his royal prerogativeo      all the other methods therefore whereby corporations exist by common law by prescription and by act of parliament are of the most part reducible to this of the kings letterspatent or charter of incorporation the kings creation may be performed by the words creamus erigimus fundamus incorporamus or the like nay it is held that if the king grants to a set of men to have gildam mercatoriam a      mercantile meeting or assemblyp this is alone sufficient to incorporate and establish them foreverq the parliament we observed by its absolute and transcendent authority may perform this or any other act whatsoever and actually did perform it to a great extent by statute    eliz c   which incorporated all hospitals and houses of correction founded by charitable persons without further trouble and the same has been done in other cases of charitable foundations but otherwise it has not formerly been usual thus to intrench upon the prerogative of the crown and the king may prevent it when he pleases and in the particular instances before mentioned it was done as sir edward coke observesr to avoid the charges of incorporation and licenses of mortmain in small benefactions which in his days were grown so great that they discouraged many men from undertaking these pious and charitable works the king it is said may grant to a subject the power of erecting corporationss though the contrary was formerly heldt that is he may permit the subject to name the persons and powers of the corporation at his pleasure but it is really the king that erects and the subject is but the instrument for though none but the king can make a corporation yet qui facit per alium facit per seu in this manner the chancellor of the university of oxford has power by charter to erect corporations and has actually often exerted it in the erection of several matriculated companies new subsisting of tradesmen subservient to the students when a corporation is erected a name must be given to it and by that name alone it must sue and be sued and do all      legal acts though a very minute variation therein is not materialv such name is the very being of its constitution and though it is the will of the king that erects the corporation yet the name is the knot of its combination without which it could not perform its corporate functionsw the name of incorporation says sir edward coke is as a proper name or name of baptism and therefore when a private founder gives his college or hospital a name he does it only as a godfather and by that same name the king baptizes the incorporationx      ii after a corporation is so formed and named it acquires many powers rights capacities and incapacities which we are next to consider some of these are necessarily and inseparably incident to every corporation which incidents as soon as a corporation is duly erected are tacitly annexed of coursey  as   to have perpetual succession this is the very end of its incorporation for there cannot be a succession forever without an incorporationz and therefore all aggregate corporations have a power necessarily implied of electing members in the room of such as go offa   to sue or be sued implead or be impleaded grant or receive by its corporate name and do all other acts as natural persons may   to purchase lands and hold them for the benefit of themselves and their successors which two are consequential to the former    to have a common seal for a corporation being an invisible body cannot manifest its intentions by any personal act or oral discourse it therefore acts and speaks only by its common seal for though the particular members may express their private consent to any acts by words or signing their names yet this does not bind the corporation it is the fixing of the seal and that only which unites the several assents of the individuals who compose the community     and makes one joint assent of the wholeb    to make bylaws or private statutes for the better      government of the corporation which are binding upon themselves unless contrary to the laws of the land and then they are void  this is also included by law in the very act of incorporationc for as natural reason is given to the natural body for the governing it so bylaws or statutes are a sort of political reason to govern the body politic and this right of making bylaws for their own government not contrary to the law of the land was allowed by the law of the twelve tables at romed but no trading company is with us allowed to make bylaws which may affect the kings prerogative or the common profit of the people under penalty of  0l unless they be approved by the chancellor treasurer and chief justices or the judges of assize in their circuits and even though they be so approved still if contrary to law they are voide these five powers are inseparably incident to every corporation at least to every corporation aggregate for two of them though they may be practised yet are very unnecessary to a corporation sole viz to have a corporate seal to testify his sole assent and to make statutes for the regulation of his own conduct there are also certain privileges and disabilities that attend an aggregate corporation and are not applicable to such as are sole the reason of them ceasing and of course the law it must always appear by attorney  for it cannot appear     in person being as sir edward coke saysf invisible and existing only in intendment and consideration of law 0 it can neither maintain nor be made defendant to an action of battery or such like personal injuries for a corporation can neither beat nor be beaten in its body politicg a corporation cannot commit treason or felony or other crime in its corporate capacityh though its members may in their distinct individual capacitiesi   neither is it capable of suffering a      traitors or felons punishment for it is not liable to corporal penalties nor to attainder forfeiture or corruption of blood it cannot be executor or administrator or perform any personal duties for it cannot take an oath for the due execution of the office it cannot be seized of lands to the use of anotherj for such kind of confidence is foreign to the end of its institution   neither can it be committed to prisonk for its existence being ideal no man can apprehend or arrest it and therefore also it cannot be outlawed for outlawry always supposes a precedent right of arresting which has been defeated by the parties absconding and that also a corporation cannot do for which reasons the proceedings to compel a corporation to appear to any suit by attorney are always by distress on their lands and goodsl neither can a corporation be excommunicated for it has no soul as is gravely observed by sir edward cokem and therefore also it is not liable to be summoned into the ecclesiastical courts upon any account for those courts act only pro salute animæ and their sentences can only be enforced by spiritual censures a consideration which carried to its full extent would alone demonstrate the impropriety of these courts interfering in any temporal rights whatsoever there are also other incidents and powers which belong to some sort of corporations and not to others an aggregate corporation may take goods and chattels for the benefit of themselves and their successors but a sole corporation cannotn for such movable property is liable to be lost or embezzled and would     raise a multitude of disputes between the successor and executor which the law is careful to avoid   in ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations the king or the founder may give them rules laws statutes and ordinances which they are bound to observe but corporations merely      lay constituted for civil purposes are subject to no particular statutes   but to the common law and to their own bylaws not contrary to the laws of the realmo aggregate corporations also that have by their constitutions a head as a dean warden master or the like cannot do any acts during the vacancy of the headship except only appointing another neither are they then capable of receiving a grant for such corporation is incomplete without a headp but there may be a corporation aggregate constituted without a headq as the collegiate church of southwell in nottinghamshire which consists only of prebendaries and the governors of the charterhouse london who have no president or superior but are all of equal authority in aggregate corporations also the act of the major part is esteemed the act of the wholer by the civil law this major part must have consisted of twothirds of the whole else no act could be performeds which perhaps may be one reason why they required three at least to make a corporation but with us any majority is sufficient to determine the act of the whole body and whereas notwithstanding the law stood thus some founders of corporations had made statutes in derogation of the common law making very frequently the unanimous assent of the society to be necessary to any corporate act which king henry viii found to be a great obstruction to his projected scheme of obtaining a surrender of the lands of ecclesiastical corporations it was therefore enacted by statute    hen viii c    that all private statutes shall be utterly void whereby any grant or election made by the head with the concurrence of the major part of the body is liable to be obstructed by any one or more being the minority but this statute extends not to any negative or necessary voice given by the founder to the head of any such society       we before observed that it was incident to every corporation to have a capacity to purchase lands for themselves and      successors and this is regularly true at the common lawt but they are excepted out of the statute of willsu so that no devise of lands to a corporation by will is good except for charitable uses by statute    eliz c  w which exception is again greatly narrowed by the statute   geo ii c    and also by a great variety of statutesx their privilege even of purchasing from any living grantor is much abridged so that now a corporation either ecclesiastical or lay must have a license from the king to purchasey before they can exert that capacity which is vested in them by the common law nor is even this in all cases sufficient these statutes are generally called the statutes of mortmain all purchases made by corporate bodies being said to be purchases in mortmain in mortua manu for the reason of which appellation sir edward cokez offers many conjectures but there is one which seems more probable than any that he has given us viz that these purchases being usually made by ecclesiastical bodies the members of which being professed were reckoned dead persons in law land therefore holden by them might with great propriety be said to be held in mortua manu i shall defer the more particular exposition of these statutes of mortmain till the next book of these commentaries when we shall consider the nature and tenures of estates and also the exposition of those disabling statutes of queen elizabeth which restrain spiritual and eleemosynary corporations from aliening such lands as they are at present in legal possession of only mentioning them in this place for the sake of regularity as statutable incapacities incident and relative to corporations the general duties of all bodies politic considered in their corporate capacity may like those of natural persons be    0 reduced to this single one that of acting up to the end or design whatever it be for which they were created by their founder iii i proceed therefore next to inquire how these corporations may be visited for corporations being composed of individuals subject to human frailties are liable as well as private persons to deviate from the end of their institution and for that reason the law has provided proper persons to visit inquire into and correct all irregularities that arise in such corporations either sole or aggregate and whether ecclesiastical civil or eleemosynary with regard to all ecclesiastical corporations the ordinary is their visitor so constituted by the canon law and from thence derived to us the pope formerly and now the king as supreme ordinary is the visitor of the archbishop or metropolitan the metropolitan has the charge and coercion of all his suffragan bishops and the bishops in their several dioceses are in ecclesiastical matters the visitors of all deans and chapters of all parsons and vicars and of all other spiritual corporations with respect to all lay corporations the founder his heirs or assigns are the visitors whether the foundation be civil or eleemosynary for in a lay incorporation the ordinary neither can nor ought to visita i know it is generally said that civil corporations are subject to no visitation but merely to the common law of the land and this shall be presently explained but first as i have laid it down as a rule that the founder his heirs or assigns are the visitors of all lay corporations let us inquire what is meant by the founder the founder of all corporations in the strictest and original sense is the king alone for he only can incorporate a society and in civil incorporations such as a mayor and commonalty c where there are no possessions or endowments given to the body there is no other founder but   0 the king but in eleemosynary foundations such as colleges and hospitals where there is an endowment of lands the law distinguishes and makes two species of      foundation the one fundatio incipiens or the incorporation in which sense the king is the general founder of all colleges and hospitals the other fundatio perficiens or the dotation of it in which sense the first gift of the revenues is the foundation and he who gives them is in law the founder and it is in this last sense that we generally call a man the founder of a college or hospitalb but here the king has his prerogative for if the king and a private man join in endowing an eleemosynary foundation the king alone shall be the founder of it and in general the king being the sole founder of all civil corporations and the endower the perficient founder of all eleemosynary ones the right of visitation of the former results according to the rule laid down to the king and of the latter to the patron or endower the king being thus constituted by law visitor of all civil corporations the law has also appointed the place wherein he shall exercise this jurisdiction which is the court of kings bench where and where only all misbehaviours of this kind of corporations are inquired into and redressed and all their controversies decided and this is what i understand to be the meaning of our lawyers when they say that these civil corporations are liable to no visitation that is that the law having by immemorial usage appointed them to be visited and inspected by the king their founder in his majestys court of kings bench according to the rules of the common law they ought not to be visited elsewhere or by any other authorityc and this is so strictly true that though the king by his letterspatent had subjected the college of physicians to the visitation of four very respectable persons the lord chancellor the two chief justices and the chief baron though the college had accepted this charter with all possible marks of acquiescence and had acted under it for near a century yet in      the authority of this provision coming in dispute on an appeal preferred to these supposed      visitors they directed the legality of their own appointment to be argued and as this college was merely a civil and not an eleemosynary foundation they at length determined upon several days solemn debate that they had no jurisdiction as visitors and remitted the appellant if aggrieved to his regular remedy in his majestys court of kings bench as to eleemosynary corporations by the dotation the founder and his heirs are of common right the legal visitors to see that such property is rightly employed as might otherwise have descended to the visitor himself but if the founder has appointed and assigned any other person to be visitor then his assignee so appointed is invested with all the founders power in exclusion of his heir eleemosynary corporations are chiefly hospitals or colleges in the universities these were all of them considered by the popish clergy as of mere ecclesiastical jurisdiction however the law of the land judged otherwise and with regard to hospitals it has long been heldd that if the hospital be spiritual the bishop shall visit but if lay the patron this right of lay patrons was indeed abridged by statute   hen v c   which ordained that the ordinary should visit all hospitals founded by subjects though the kings right was reserved to visit by his commissioners such as were of royal foundation but the subjects right was in part restored by statute    eliz c   which directs the bishop to visit such hospitals only where no visitor is appointed by the founders thereof and all the hospitals founded by virtue of the     statute    eliz c   are to be visited by such persons as shall be nominated by the respective founders but still if the founder appoints nobody the bishop of the diocese must visite colleges in the universities whatever the common law may now or might formerly judge were certainly considered by the popish clergy under whose direction they were as ecclesiastical or at least as clerical corporations and therefore the right of visitation was claimed by the ordinary of the      diocese this is evident because in many of our most ancient colleges where the founder had a mind to subject them to a visitor of his own nomination he obtained for that purpose a papal bull to exempt them from the jurisdiction of the ordinary several of which are still preserved in the archives of the respective societies and in some of our colleges where no special visitor is appointed the bishop of that diocese in which oxford was formerly comprised has immemorially exercised visitatorial authority   which can be ascribed to nothing else but his supposed title as ordinary to visit this among other ecclesiastical foundations and it is not impossible that the number of colleges in cambridge which are visited by the bishop of ely may in part be derived from the same original   but whatever might be formerly the opinion of the clergy it is now held as established common law that colleges are lay corporations though sometimes totally composed of ecclesiastical persons and that the right of visitation does not arise from any principles of the canon law but of necessity was created by the common lawf and yet the power and jurisdiction of visitors in colleges was left so much in the dark at common law that the whole doctrine was very unsettled till the famous case of phillips and buryg in this the main question was whether the sentence of the bishop of exeter who as visitor had deprived doctor bury the rector of exeter college could be examined and redressed by the court of kings bench and the three puisne judges were of opinion that it might be reviewed for that the visitors jurisdiction could not exclude the common law and accordingly judgment was given in that court but the lord chief justice holt was of a contrary opinion and held that by the common law the office of visitor is to judge according to the statutes of the college and to expel and deprive upon just occasions and to hear all appeals of course and that from him and him only the party grieved ought to have redress the founder having reposed in him so entire a confidence that he      will administer justice impartially that his determinations are final and examinable in no other court whatsoever and upon this a writ of error being brought into the house of lords they concurred in sir john holts opinion and reversed the judgment of the court of kings bench to which leading case all subsequent determinations have been conformable but where the visitor is under a temporary disability there the court of kings bench will interpose to prevent a defect of justiceh also it is saidi that if a founder of an eleemosynary foundation appoints a visitor and limits his jurisdiction by rules and statutes if the visitor in his sentence exceeds those rules an action lies against him but it is otherwise where he mistakes in a thing within his power       iv we come now in the last place to consider how corporations may be dissolved any particular member may be disfranchised or lose his place in the corporation by acting contrary to the laws of the society or the laws of the land or he may resign it by his own voluntary actk 0 but the body politic     may also itself be dissolved in several ways which dissolution is the civil death of the corporation and in this case their lands and tenements shall revert to the person or his heirs who granted them to the corporation for the law doth annex a condition to every such grant that if the corporation be dissolved the grantor shall have the lands again because the cause of the grant failethl   the grant is indeed only during the life of the corporation which may endure forever but when that life is determined by the dissolution of the body politic the grantor takes it back by reversion as in the case of every     other grant for life   the debts of a corporation either to or from it are totally extinguished by its dissolution so that the members thereof cannot recover or be charged with them in their natural capacitiesm   agreeable to that maxim of the civil law si quid universitati debetur singulis non debetur nec quod debet universitas singuli debentn      a corporation may be dissolved   by act of parliament which is boundless in its operations     by the natural death of all its members in case of an aggregate corporation     by surrender of its franchises into the hands of the king which is a kind of suicide   by forfeiture of its charter through negligence or abuse of its franchises in which case the law judges that the body politic has broken the condition upon which it was incorporated and thereupon the incorporation is void   and the regular course is to bring an information in nature of a writ of quo warranto to inquire by what warrant the members now exercise their corporate power having forfeited it by such and such proceedings the exertion of this act of law for the purposes of the state in the reigns of king charles and king james the second particularly by seizing the charter of the city of london gave great and just offence though perhaps in strictness of law the proceedings in most of them were sufficiently regular but the judgment against that of london was reversed by act of parliamento after the revolution and by the same statute it is enacted that the franchises of the city of london shall never more be forfeited for any cause whatsoever and because by the common law corporations were dissolved in case the mayor or head officer was not duly elected on the day appointed in the charter or established by prescription it is now providedp that for the future no corporation shall be dissolved upon that account and ample directions are given for appointing a new officer in case there be no election or a void one made upon the prescriptive or charter day       the end of the first book       book the second of the rights of things chapter i of property in general the former book of these commentaries having treated at large of the jura personarum or such rights and duties as are annexed to the persons of men the objects of our inquiry in this second book will be the jura rerum or those rights which a man may acquire in and to such external things as are unconnected with his person these are what the writers in natural law style the rights of dominion or property concerning the nature and original of which i shall first premise a few observations before i proceed to distribute and consider its several objects    there is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination and engages the affections of mankind as the right of property or that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe and yet there are very few that will give themselves the trouble to consider the original and foundation of this right pleased as we are with the possession we seem afraid to look back to the means by which it was acquired as if fearful of some defect in our title or at best we rest satisfied with the decision of the laws in our favour without examining the reason or authority upon which those laws have been built we think it enough that our title is derived by the grant of the former proprietor by descent from our ancestors or by the last will and testament of the dying owner not caring to reflect that accurately and strictly speaking there is no foundation in nature or in natural law why a set of words upon parchment should convey the dominion of land why the son should have a right to exclude his fellowcreatures from a determinate spot of ground because his father had done so before him or why the occupier of a particular field or of a jewel when lying on his deathbed and no longer able to maintain possession should be entitled to tell the rest of the world which of them should enjoy it after him these inquiries it must be owned would be useless and even troublesome in common life it is well if the mass of mankind will obey the laws when made without scrutinizing too nicely into the reason for making them but when law is to be considered not only as a matter of practice but also as a rational science it cannot be improper of useless to examine more deeply the rudiments and grounds of these positive constitutions of society in the beginning of the world we are informed by holy writ the allbountiful creator gave to man dominion over all the earth and over the fish of the sea   and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth    upon the eartha this is the only true and solid foundation of mans dominion over external things whatever airy metaphysical notions may have been started by fanciful writers upon this subject the earth therefore and all things therein are the general property of all mankind exclusive of other beings from the immediate gift of the creator and while the earth continued bare of inhabitants it is reasonable to suppose that all was in common among them and that every one took from the public stock to his own use such things as his immediate necessities required these general notions of property were then sufficient to answer all the purposes of human life and might perhaps still have answered them had it been possible for mankind to have remained in a state of primeval simplicity as may be collected from the manners of many american nations when first discovered by the europeans and from the ancient method of living among the first europeans themselves if we may credit either the memorials of them preserved in the golden age of the poets or the uniform accounts given by historians of those times wherein erant omnia communia et indivisa omnibus veluti unum cunctis patrimonium essetb not that this communion of goods seems ever to have been applicable even in the earliest stages to aught but the substance of the thing nor could it be extended to the use of it for by the law of nature and reason he who first began to use it acquired therein a kind of transient property that lasted so long as he was using it and no longerc or to speak with greater precision the right of possession continued for the same time only that the act of possession lasted thus the ground was in common and no part of it was the permanent property of any man in particular yet whoever was in the occupation of any determined spot of it for rest for shade or the like acquired for the time a sort of ownership from which it would have been unjust and contrary to the law of nature to have driven him by force but the instant that he    quitted the use or occupation of it another might seize it without injustice thus also a vine or other tree might be said to be in common as all men were equally entitled to its produce and yet any private individual might gain the sole property of the fruit which he had gathered for his own repast a doctrine well illustrated by cicero who compares the world to a great theatre which is common to the public and yet the place which any man has taken is for the time his ownd but when mankind increased in number craft and ambition it became necessary to entertain conceptions of more permanent dominion and to appropriate to individuals not the immediate use only but the very substance of the thing to be used otherwise innumerable tumults must have arisen and the good order of the world be continually broken and disturbed while a variety of persons were striving who should get the first occupation of the same thing or disputing which of them had actually gained it as human life also grew more and more refined abundance of conveniences were devised to render it more easy commodious and agreeable as habitations for shelter and safety and raiment for warmth and decency but no man would be at the trouble to provide either so long as he had only an usufructuary property in them which was to cease the instant that be quitted possession if as soon as he walked out of his tent or pulled off his garment the next stranger who came by would have a right to inhabit the one and to wear the other in the case of habitations in particular it was natural to observe that even the brute creation to whom every thing else was in common maintained a kind of permanent property in their dwellings especially for the protection of their young that the birds of the air had nests and the beasts of the field had caverns the invasion of which they esteemed a very flagrant injustice and would sacrifice their lives to preserve them hence a property was soon established in every mans house and homestall which seem to have been originally mere    temporary huts or movable cabins suited to the design of providence for more speedily peopling the earth   and suited to the wandering life of their owners before any extensive property in the soil or ground was established and there can be no doubt but that movables of every kind became sooner appropriated than the permanent substantial soil partly because they were more susceptible of a long occupancy which might be continued for months together without any sensible interruption and at length by usage ripen into an established right but principally because few of them could be fit for use till improved and ameliorated by the bodily labour of the occupant which bodily labour bestowed upon any subject which before lay in common to all men is universally allowed to give the fairest and most reasonable title to an exclusive property therein the article of food was a more immediate call and therefore a more early consideration such as were not contented with the spontaneous product of the earth sought for a more solid refreshment in the flesh of beasts which they obtained by hunting but the frequent disappointments incident to that method of provision induced them to gather together such animals as were of a more tame and sequacious nature and to establish a permanent property in their flocks and herds in order to sustain themselves in a less precarious manner partly by the milk of the dams and partly by the flesh of the young the support of these their cattle made the article of water also a very important point and therefore the book of genesis the most venerable monument of antiquity considered merely with a view to history will furnish us with frequent instances of violent contentions concerning wells the exclusive property of which appears to have been established in the first digger or occupant even in such places where the ground and herbage remained yet in common thus we find abraham who was but a sojourner asserting his right to a well in the country of abimelech and exacting an oath for his security because he had digged that welle and isaac    about ninety years afterwards reclaimed that as his fathers property and after much contention with the philistines was suffered to enjoy it in peacef all this while the soil and pasture of the earth remained still in common as before and open to every occupant except perhaps in the neighbourhood of towns where the necessity of a sole and exclusive property in lands for the sake of agriculture was earlier felt and therefore more readily complied with otherwise when the multitude of men and cattle had consumed every convenience on one spot of ground it was deemed a natural right to seize upon and occupy such other lands as would more easily supply their necessities this practice is still retained among the wild and uncultivated nations that have never been formed into civil states like the tartars and others in the east where the climate itself and the boundless extent of their territory conspire to retain them still in the same savage state of vagrant liberty which was universal in the earliest ages and which tacitus informs us continued among the germans till the decline of the roman empireg we have also a striking example of the same kind in the history of abraham and his nephew loth when their joint substance became so great that pasture and other conveniences grew scarce the natural consequence was that a strife arose between their servants so that it was no longer practicable to dwell together this contention abraham thus endeavoured to compose—let there be no strife i pray thee between thee and me is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left this plainly implies an acknowledged right in either to occupy whatever ground he pleased that was not preoccupied by other tribes and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered everywhere even as the garden of the lord then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and journeyed east and abraham dwelt in the land of canaan    upon the same principle was founded the right of migration or sending colonies to find out new habitations when the mothercountry was overcharged   with inhabitants which was practised as well by the phœnicians and greeks as the germans scythians and other northern people and so long as it was confined to the stocking and cultivation of desert uninhabited countries it kept strictly within the limits of the law of nature but how far the seizing on countries already peopled and driving out or massacring the innocent and defenceless natives merely because they differed from their invaders in language in religion in customs in government or in colour how far such a conduct was consonant to nature to reason or to christianity deserved well to be considered by those who have rendered their names immortal by thus civilizing mankind as the world by degrees grew more populous it daily became more difficult to find out new spots to inhabit without encroaching upon former occupants and by constantly occupying the same individual spot the fruits of the earth were consumed and its spontaneous produce destroyed without any provision for future supply or succession it therefore became necessary to pursue some regular method of providing a constant subsistence and this necessity produced or at least promoted and encouraged the art of agriculture and the art of agriculture by a regular connection and consequence introduced and established the idea of a more permanent property in the soil than had hitherto been received and adopted it was clear that the earth would not produce her fruits in sufficient quantities without the assistance of tillage but who would be at the pains of tilling it if another might watch an opportunity to seize upon and enjoy the product of his industry art and labour had not therefore a separate property in lands as well as movables been vested in some individuals the world must have continued a forest and men have been mere animals of prey which according to some philosophers is the genuine state of nature    whereas now so graciously has providence interwoven our duty and our happiness together the result of this very necessity has been the ennobling of the human species by giving it opportunities of improving its rational faculties as well as of exerting its natural necessity begat property and in order to insure that property recourse was had to civil society which brought along with it a long train of inseparable concomitants—states government laws punishments and the public exercise of religious duties thus connected together it was found that a part only of society was sufficient to provide by their manual labour for the necessary subsistence of all and leisure was given to others to cultivate the human mind to invent useful arts and to lay the foundations of science the only question remaining is how this property became actually invested or that it is that gave a man an exclusive right to retain in a permanent manner that specific land which before belonged generally to everybody but particularly to nobody and as we before observed that occupancy gave the right to the temporary use of the soil so it is agreed upon all hands that occupancy gave also the original right to the permanent property in the substance of the earth itself which excludes every one else but the owner from the use of it there is indeed some difference among the writers on natural law concerning the reason why occupancy should convey this right and invest one with this absolute property grotius and puffendorf insisting that this right of occupancy is founded on a tacit and implied assent of all mankind that the first occupant should become the owner and barbeyrac titius mr locke and others holding that there is no such implied assent neither is it necessary that there should be for that the very act of occupancy alone being a degree of bodily labour is from a principle of natural justice without any consent or compact sufficient of itself to gain a title—a dispute that savours too much of nice and scholastic refinement  however both sides agree in this that occupancy is the   thing by which the title was in fact originally gained every man seizing to his own continued    use such spots of ground as he found most agreeable to his own convenience provided he found them unoccupied by any one else  property both in lands and movables being thus originally acquired by the first taker which taking amounts to a declaration that he intends to appropriate the thing to his own use it remains in him by the principles of universal law till such time as he does some other act which shows an intention to abandon it for then it becomes naturally speaking publici juris once more and is liable to be again appropriated by the next occupant so if one is possessed of a jewel and casts it into the sea or a public highway this is such an express dereliction that a property will be vested in the first fortunate finder that will seize it to his own use but if he hides it privately in the earth or other secret place and it is discovered the finder acquires no property therein for the owner hath not by this act declared any intention to abandon it but rather the contrary and if he loses or drops it by accident it cannot be collected from thence that he designed to quit the possession and therefore in such a case the property still remains in the loser who may claim it again of the finder and this we may remember is the doctrine of the law of england with relation to treasure trovei but this method of one mans abandoning his property and another seizing the vacant possession however well founded in theory could not long subsist in   fact it was calculated merely for the rudiments of civil society and necessarily ceased among the complicated interests and artificial refinements of polite and established governments in these it was found that what became inconvenient or useless to one man was highly convenient and useful to another who was ready to give in exchange for it some equivalent that was equally desirable to the former proprietor thus mutual convenience introduced commercial traffic and the reciprocal transfer of property by sale grant or conveyance which   0 may be considered either as a continuance of the original possession which the first occupant had or as an abandoning of the thing by the present owner and an immediate successive occupancy of the same by the new proprietor the voluntary dereliction of the owner and delivering the possession to another individual amount to a transfer of the property the proprietor declaring his intention no longer to occupy the thing himself but that his own right of occupancy shall be vested in the new acquirer or taken in the other light if i agree to part with an acre of my land to titius the deed of conveyance is an evidence of my intending to abandon the property and titius being the only or first man acquainted with such my intention immediately steps in and seizes the vacant possession thus the consent expressed by the conveyance gives titius a good right against me and possession or occupancy confirms that right against all the world besides  the most universal and effectual way of abandoning property is by the death of the occupant when both the actual possession and intention of keeping possession ceasing the property which is founded upon such possession and intention ought also to cease of course for naturally speaking the instant a man ceases to be he ceases to have any dominion else if he had a right to dispose of his acquisitions one moment beyond his life he would also have a right to direct their disposal for a million of ages after him which would be highly absurd and inconvenient all property must therefore cease upon death considering men as absolute individuals and unconnected with civil society for then by the principles before established the next immediate occupant would acquire a right in all that the deceased possessed but as under civilized governments which are calculated for the peace of mankind such a constitution would be productive of endless disturbances the universal law of almost every nation which is a kind of secondary law of nature has either given the dying person a power of continuing his property by disposing of his possessions by will or in case he neglects to dispose of it or is not permitted to make any disposition     at all the municipal law of the country then steps in and declares who shall be the successor representative or heir of the deceased that is who alone shall have a right to enter upon this vacant possession in order to avoid that confusion which its becoming again common wouldk occasion and further in case no testament be permitted by the law or none be made and no heir can be found so qualified as the law requires still to prevent the robust title of occupancy from again taking place the doctrine of escheats is adopted in almost every country whereby the sovereign of the state and those who claim under his authority are the ultimate heirs and succeed to those inheritances to which no other title can be formed the right of inheritance or descent to the children and relations of the deceased seems to have been allowed much earlier than the right of devising by testament we are apt to conceive at first view that it has nature on its side yet we often mistake for nature what we find established by long and inveterate    custom it is certainly a wise and effectual but clearly a political establishment since the permanent right of property vested in the ancestor himself was no natural but merely a civil right  it is true that the transmission of ones possessions to posterity has an evident tendency to make a man a good citizen and a useful member of society it sets the passions on the side of duty and prompts a man to deserve well of the public when he is sure that the reward of his services will not die with himself but be transmitted to those with whom he is connected by the dearest and most tender affections yet reasonable as this foundation of the right of inheritance may seem it is probable that its immediate original arose not from speculations altogether so delicate and refined and if not from fortuitous circumstances at least from a plainer and more simple principle a mans children or nearest relations are usually about him on his     deathbed and are the earliest witnesses of his decease they become therefore generally the next immediate occupants till at length in process of time this frequent usage ripened into general law and therefore also in the earliest ages on failure of children a mans servants born under his roof were allowed to be his heirs being immediately on the spot when he died for we find the old patriarch abraham expressly declaring that since god had given him no seed his steward eliezer one born in his house was his heirl while property continued only for life testaments were useless and unknown and when it became inheritable the inheritance was long indefeasible and the children or heirs at law were incapable of exclusion by will till at length it was found that so strict a rule of inheritance made heirs disobedient and headstrong defrauded creditors of their just debts and prevented many provident fathers from dividing or charging their estates as the exigence of their families required this introduced pretty generally the right of disposing of ones property or a part of it by testament that is by written or oral instructions properly witnessed and authenticated according to the pleasure of the deceased which we therefore emphatically style his will this was established in some countries much later than in others with us in england till modern times a man could only dispose of onethird of his movables from his wife and children and in general no will was permitted of lands till the reign of henry the eighth    and then only of a certain portion for it was not till after the restoration that the power of devising real property became so universal as at present  wills therefore and testaments rights of inheritance and successions are all of them creatures of the civil or municipal laws and accordingly are in all respects regulated by them every distinct country having different ceremonies and requisites to make a testament completely valid neither does any thing vary more than the right of inheritance under different     national establishments in england particularly this diversity is carried to such a length as if it had been meant to point out the power of the laws in regulating the succession to property and how futile every claim must be that has not its foundation in the positive rules of the state in personal estates the father may succeed to his children in landed property he never can be their immediate heir by any the remotest possibility  in general only the eldest son in some places only the youngest in others all the sons together have a right to succeed to the inheritance in real estates males are preferred to females and the eldest male will usually exclude the rest in the division of personal estates the females of equal degree are admitted together with the males and no right of primogeniture is allowed this one consideration may help to remove the scruples of many wellmeaning persons who set up a mistaken conscience in opposition to the rules of law if a man disinherits his son by a will duly executed and leaves his estate to a stranger there are many who consider this proceeding as contrary to natural justice while others so scrupulously adhere to the supposed intention of the dead that if a will of lands be attested by only two witnesses instead of three which the law requires they are apt to imagine that the heir is bound in conscience to relinquish his title to the devisee but both of them certainly proceed upon very erroneous principles as if on the one hand the son had by nature a right to succeed to his fathers lands or as if on the other hand the owner was by nature entitled to direct the succession of his property after his own decease whereas the law of nature suggests that on the death of the possessor the estate should again become common and be open to the next occupant unless otherwise ordered for the sake of civil peace by the positive law of society the positive law of society which is with us the municipal law of england directs it to vest in such person as the last proprietor shall by will attended with certain requisites appoint and in defect of such appointment to go to some particular person who from the result     of certain local constitutions appears to be the heir at law hence it follows that where the appointment is regularly made there cannot be a shadow of right in    any one but the person appointed and where the necessary requisites are omitted the right of the heir is equally strong and built upon as solid a foundation as the right of the devisee would have been supposing such requisites were observed but after all there are some few things which notwithstanding the general introduction and continuance of property must still unavoidably remain in common being such wherein nothing but an usufructuary property is capable of being had and therefore they still belong to the first occupant during the time he holds possession of them and no longer such among others are the elements of light air and water which a man may occupy by means of his windows his gardens his mills and other conveniences such also are the generality of those animals which are said to be feræ naturæ or of a wild and untamable disposition which any man may seize upon and keep for his own use and pleasure all these things so long as they remain in possession every man has a right to enjoy without disturbance but if once they escape from his custody or he voluntarily abandons the use of them they return to the common stock and any man else has an equal right to seize and enjoy them afterwards again there are other things in which a permanent property may subsist not only as to the temporary use but also the solid substance and which yet would be frequently found without a proprietor had not the wisdom of the law provided a remedy to obviate this inconvenience such are forests and other waste grounds which were omitted to be appropriated in the general distribution of lands such also are wrecks estrays and that species of wild animals which the arbitrary constitutions of positive law have distinguished from the rest by the wellknown appellation of game with regard to these and some others as disturbances and quarrels     would frequently arise among individuals contending about the acquisition of this species of property by first occupancy the law has therefore wisely cut up the root of dissension by vesting the things themselves in the sovereign of the state or else in his representatives appointed and authorized by him being usually the lords of manors and thus the legislature of england has universally promoted the grand ends of civil society the peace and security of individuals by steadily pursuing that wise and orderly maxim of assigning to every thing capable of ownership a legal and determinate owner chapter ii of real property and first of corporeal hereditaments the objects of dominion or property are things as contradistinguished from persons and things are by the law of england distributed into two kinds things real and things personal things real are such as are permanent fixed and immovable which cannot be carried out of their place as lands and tenements things personal are goods money and all other movables which may attend the owners person wherever he thinks proper to go     in treating of things real let us consider first their several sorts or kinds secondly the tenures by which they may be holden thirdly the estates which may be had in them and fourthly the title to them and the manner of acquiring and losing it first with regard to their several sorts or kinds things real are usually said to consist in lands tenements or hereditaments  land comprehends all things of a permanent substantial nature being a word of a very extensive signification as will presently appear more at large tenement is a word of still greater extent and though in its vulgar accep    tation it is only applied to houses and other buildings yet in its original proper and legal sense it signifies every thing that may be holden provided it be of a permanent nature whether it be of a substantial and sensible or of an unsubstantial ideal kind  thus liberum tenementum frank tenement or freehold is applicable not    only to lands and other solid objects but also to offices rents commons and the likea and as lands and houses are tenements so is an advowson a tenement and a franchise an office a right of common a peerage or other property of the like unsubstantial kind are all of them legally speaking tenementsb but an hereditament says sir edward cokec is by much the largest and most comprehensive expression for it includes not only lands and tenements but whatsoever may be inherited be it corporeal or incorporeal real personal or mixed thus an heirloom or implement of furniture which by custom descends to the heir together with a house is neither land nor tenement but a mere movable yet being inheritable is comprised under the general word hereditament and so a condition the benefit of which may descend to a man from his ancestor is also an hereditamentd  hereditaments then to use the largest expression are of two kinds corporeal and incorporeal corporeal consist of such as affect the senses such as may be seen and handled by the body incorporeal are not the object of sensation can neither be seen nor handled are creatures of the mind and exist only in contemplation corporeal hereditaments consist wholly of substantial and permanent objects all which may be comprehended under the general denomination of land only for land says sir edward cokee comprehendeth in its legal signification any ground soil or earth whatsoever as arable meadows pastures woods moors waters marshes furzes and heath     it legally includeth also all castles houses and other buildings for they consist said he of two things land which is the foundation and structure thereupon so that if i convey the land or ground the structure or building passeth therewith it is observable that water is here mentioned as a species of land which may seem a kind of solecism but such is the language of the law and therefore i cannot bring an action to recover possession of a pool or other piece of water by the name of water only either by calculating its capacity as for so many cubical yards or by superficial measure for twenty acres of water or by general description as for a pond a watercourse or a rivulet but i must bring my action for the land that lies at the bottom and must call it twenty acres of land covered with waterf for water is a movable wandering thing and must of necessity continue common by the law of nature so that i can only have a temporary transient usufructuary property therein wherefore if a body of water runs out of my pond into another mans i have no right to reclaim it but the land which that water covers is permanent fixed and immovable and therefore in this i may have a certain substantial property of which the law will take notice and not of the other     land hath also in its legal signification an indefinite extent upwards as well as downwards cujus est solum ejus est usque ad cœlum is the maxim of the law upwards therefore no man may erect any building or the like to overhang anothers land and downwards whatever is in a direct line between the surface of any land and the centre of the earth belongs to the owner of the surface  as is every days experience in the mining countries so that the word land includes not only the face of the earth but every thing under it    or over it  and therefore if a man grants all his lands he grants thereby all his mines of metal and other fossils his woods his waters and his houses as well as his fields and meadows not but the particular names of the things are     equally sufficient to pass them except in the instance of water by a grant of which nothing passes but a right of fishingg  but the capital distinction is this that by the name of a castle  messuage 0 toft   croft   or the like nothing else will pass except what falls with the utmost propriety under the term made use of but by the name of land which is nomen generalissimum every thing terrestrial will passh  0 chapter iii of incorporeal hereditaments an incorporeal hereditament is a right issuing out of a thing corporate whether real or personal or concerning or annexed to or exercisable within the samea it is not the thing corporate itself which may consist in lands houses jewels or the like but something collateral thereto as a rent issuing out of those lands or houses or an office relating to those jewels in short as the logicians speak corporeal hereditaments are the substance which may be always seen always handled incorporeal hereditaments are but a sort of accidents which inhere in and are supported by that substance and may belong or not belong to it without any visible alteration therein their existence is merely in idea and abstracted contemplation though their effects and profits may be frequently objects of our bodily senses and indeed if we would fix a clear notion of an incorporeal hereditament we must be careful not to confound together the profits produced and the thing or hereditament which produces them an annuity for instance is an incorporeal hereditament  for though the money which is the fruit or product of this annuity is doubtless of a corporeal nature yet the annuity itself which produces that money is a thing invisible has only a mental existence and cannot be delivered over from hand to hand so tithes if we consider the pro    duce of them as the tenth sheaf or tenth lamb seem to be completely corporeal yet they are indeed incorporeal hereditaments for they being merely a contingent springing right collateral to or issuing out of lands can never be the object of sense that casual share of the annual increase is not till severed capable of being shown to the eye nor of being delivered into bodily possession incorporeal hereditaments are principally of ten sorts advowsons tithes commons ways offices dignities franchises corodies or pensions annuities and rents i advowson is the right of presentation to a church or ecclesiastical benefice advowson advocatio signifies in clientelam recipere the taking into protection and therefore is synonymous with patronage patronatus and he who has the right of advowson is called the patron of the church for when lords of manors first built churches on their own demesnes and appointed the tithes of those manors to be paid to the officiating ministers which before were given to the clergy in common from whence as was formerly mentionedb arose the division of parishes the lord who thus built a church and endowed it with glebe or land had of common right a power annexed of nominating such minister as he pleased provided he were canonically qualified to officiate in that church of which he was the founder endower maintainer or in one word the patronc this instance of an advowson will completely illustrate the nature of an incorporeal hereditament it is not itself the bodily possession of the church and its appendages but it is a right to give some other man a title to such bodily possession the advowson is the object of neither the sight nor the touch and yet it perpetually exists in the minds eye and in contemplation of law it cannot be delivered from man to man by any visible bodily transfer    nor can corporeal possession be     had of it if the patron takes corporeal possession of the church the churchyard the glebe or the like he intrudes on another mans property for to these the parson has an exclusive right the patronage can therefore be only conveyed by operation of law by verbal grant  either oral or written which is a kind of invisible mental transfer and being so vested it lies dormant and unnoticed till occasion calls it forth when it produces a visible corporeal fruit by entitling some clerk whom the patron shall please to nominate to enter and receive bodily possession of the lands and tenements of the church advowsons are either advowsons appendant or advowsons in gross lords of manors being originally the only founders and of course the only patrons of churchesd the right of patronage or presentation so long as it continues annexed to the possession of the manor as some have done from the foundation of the church to this day is called an advowson appendante and it will pass or be conveyed together with the manor as incident and appendant thereto by a grant of the manor only without adding any other wordsf but where the property of the advowson has been once separated from the property of the manor by legal conveyance  it is called an advowson in gross or at large and never can be appendant any more but it is for the future annexed to the person of its owner and not to his manor or landsg advowsons are also either presentative collative or donativeh an advowson presentative is where the patron hath a right of presentation to the bishop or ordinary and moreover to demand of him to institute his clerk if he finds him canonically qualified and this is the most usual advowson  an advowson collative    is where the bishop and patron are one and the same person in which case the bishop cannot present to himself but he does by the one act of collation or con    ferring the benefice the whole that is done in common cases by both presentation and institution an advowson donative is when the king or any subject by his license doth found a church or chapel and ordains that it shall be merely in the gift or disposal of the patron subject to his visitation only and not to that of the ordinary and vested absolutely in the clerk by the patrons deed of donation without presentation institution or inductioni this is said to have been anciently the only way of conferring ecclesiastical benefices in england the method of institution by the bishop not being established more early than the time of archbishop becket in the reign of henry iik and therefore though pope alexander iiil in a letter to becket severely inveighs against a prava consuetudo as he calls it of investiture conferred by the patron only this however shows what was then the common usage others contend that the claim of the bishops to institution is as old as the first planting of christianity in this island and in proof of it they allege a letter from the english nobility to the pope in the reign of henry the third recorded by matthew parism which speaks of presentation to the bishop as a thing immemorial the truth seems to be that where the benefice was to be conferred on a mere layman he was first presented to the bishop in order to receive ordination who was at liberty to examine and refuse him but where    the clerk was already in orders the living was usually vested in him by the sole donation of the patron till about the middle of the twelfth century when the pope and his bishops endeavoured to introduce a kind of feodal dominion over ecclesiastical benefices and in consequence of that began to claim and exercise the right of institution universally as a species of spiritual investiture however this may be if as the law now stands the true patron once waives this privilege of donation and presents to the bishop and his clerk is admitted and instituted the ad    vowson is now become forever presentative and shall never be donative any moren for these exceptions to general rules and common right are ever looked upon by the law in an unfavourable view and construed as strictly as possible if therefore the patron in whom such peculiar right resides does once give up that right the law which loves uniformity will interpret it to be done with an intention of giving it up forever and will therefore reduce it to the standard of other ecclesiastical livings  ii a second species of incorporeal hereditaments is that of tithes which are defined to be the tenth part of the increase yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands the stock upon lands and the personal industry of the inhabitants  the first species being usually called predial as of corn grass hops and woodo the second mixed as of wool milk pigs cp consisting of natural products but nurtured and preserved in part by the care of man and of these the tenth must be paid in gross the third personal as of manual occupations trades fisheries and the like and of these only the tenth part of the clear gains and profits is dueq  it is not to be expected from the nature of these general commentaries that i should particularly specify what things are tithable and what not the time    when or the manner and proportion in which tithes are usually due for this i must refer to such authors as have treated the matter in detail and shall only observe that in general tithes are to be paid for every thing that yields an annual increase as corn hay fruit cattle poultry and the like but not for any thing that is of the substance of the earth or is not of annual increase as stone lime chalk and the like nor for creatures that are of a wild nature or feræ naturæ as deer hawks c whose increase so as to profit the owner is not annual but casualr it will rather be our business to consider   the original of the right     of tithes   in whom that right at present subsists   who may be discharged either totally or in part from paying them   as to their original i will not put the title of the clergy to tithes upon any divine right though such a right certainly commenced and i believe as certainly ceased with the jewish theocracy yet an honourable and competent maintenance for the ministers of the gospel is undoubtedly jure divino whatever the particular mode of that maintenance may be for besides the positive precepts of the new testament natural reason will tell us that an order of men who are separated from the world and excluded from other lucrative professions for the sake of the rest of mankind have a right to be furnished with the necessaries conveniences and moderate enjoyments of life at their expense for whose benefit they forego the usual means of providing them accordingly all municipal laws have provided a liberal and decent maintenance for their national priests or clergy ours in particular have established this of tithes probably in imitation of the jewish law and perhaps considering the degenerate state of the world in general it may be more beneficial to the english clergy to found their title on the law of the land than upon any divine right whatsoever unacknowledged and unsupported by temporal sanctions  we cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country possibly they were contemporary with the planting of christianity among the saxons by augustin the monk about the end of the sixth century but the first mention of them which i have met with in any written english law is in a constitutional decree made in a synod held ad    s wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined this canon or decree which at first bound not the laity was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy in their parliamentary conventions of estates respectively consisting of the kings of mercia     and northumberland the bishops dukes senators and people which was a very few years later than the time that charlemagne established the payment of them int france and made that famous division of them into four parts one to maintain the edifice of the church the second to support the poor the third the bishop and the fourth the parochial clergyu     the next authentic mention of them is in the fœdus edwardi et guthruni or the laws agreed upon between king guthrun the dane and alfred and his son edward the elder successive kings of england about the year  00 this was a kind of treaty between those monarchs which may be found at large in the anglosaxon lawsw wherein it was necessary as guthrun was a pagan to provide for the subsistence of the christian clergy under his dominion and accordingly we findx the payment of tithes not only enjoined but a penalty added upon nonobservance which law is seconded by the laws of athelstany about the year   0 and this is as much as can certainly be traced out with regard to their legal original   we are next to consider the persons to whom they are due 0 and upon their first introduction as hath formerly been observedz though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general yet he might give them to what priests he pleaseda which were called arbitrary consecrations of tithes or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church which were then in commonb but when dioceses were divided into parishes the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister first by common consent or the appointment of lords of manors and afterwards by the written law of the landc     however arbitrary consecrations of tithes took place again afterwards and became in general use till the time of king johnd which was probably owing to the intrigues of the regular clergy or monks of the benedictine and other rules under archbishop dunstan and his successors who endeavoured to wean the people from paying their dues to the secular or parochial clergy a much more valuable set of men than themselves and were then in hopes to have drawn by sanctimonious pretences to extraordinary purity of life all ecclesiastical profits to the coffers of their own societies and this will naturally enough account for the number and riches of the monasteries and religious houses which were founded in those days and which were frequently endowed with tithes for a layman who was obliged to pay his tithes somewhere might think it good policy to erect an abbey and there pay them to his own monks or grant them to some abbey already erected since for this dotation which really cost the patron little or nothing he might according to the superstition of the times have masses forever sung for his soul but in process of years the income of the poor laborious parish priests being scandalously reduced by these arbitrary consecrations of tithes it was remedied by popo    innocente the third about the year   00 in a decretal epistle sent to the archbishop of canterbury and dated from the palace of lateran which has occasioned sir henry hobart and others to mistake it for a decree of the council of lateran held ad      which only prohibited what was called the infeodation of tithes or their being granted to mere laymenf whereas this letter of pope innocent to the archbishop enjoined the payment of tithes to the parsons of the respective parishes where every man inhabited agreeable to what was afterwards directed by the same pope in other countriesg this epistle says sir edward cokeh bound not the lay subjects of this realm but being reasonable and just and he might have     added being correspondent to the ancient law it was allowed of and so became lex terræ this put an effectual stop to all the arbitrary consecrations of tithes except some footsteps which still continue in those portions of tithes which the parson of one parish hath though rarely a right to claim in another for it is now universally heldi that tithes are due of common right to the parson of the parish unless there be a special exemption this parson of the parish we have formerly seenk may be either the actual incumbent or else the appropriator of the benefice appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithesl   we observed that tithes are due to the parson of common right unless by special exemption let us therefore see thirdly who may be exempted from the payment of tithes and how lands and their occupiers may be exempted or discharged from the payment of tithes either in part or totally first by a real composition or secondly by custom or prescription first a real composition is   when an agreement is made between the owner    of the lands and the parson or vicar with the consent of the ordinary and the patron that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes by reason of some land or other real recompense given to the parson in lieu and satisfaction thereofm this was permitted by law because it was supposed that the clergy would be no losers by such composition since the consent of the ordinary whose duty it is to take care of the church in general and of the patron whose interest it is to protect that particular church were both made necessary to render the composition effectual and hence have arisen all such compositions as exist at this day by force of the common law but experience showing that even this caution was ineffectual and     the possessions of the church being by this and other means every day diminished the disabling statute    eliz c  0 was made which prevents among other spiritual persons all parsons and vicars from making any conveyances of the estates of their churches other than for three lives or twentyone years so that now by virtue of this statute no real composition made since the    eliz is good for any longer term than three lives or twentyone years though made by consent of the patron and ordinary which has indeed effectually demolished this kind of traffic such compositions being now rarely heard of unless by authority of parliament secondly a discharge by custom or prescription is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been either partially or totally discharged from the payment of tithes and this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made this custom or prescription is either de modo decimandi or de non decimando a modus decimandi commonly called by the simple name of a modus only is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed different from the general law of taking tithes in kind which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase this is sometimes a pecuniary compensation as twopence an acre for the tithe of land sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay and not the tenth in consideration of the owners making it for him sometimes in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe the parson shall have a less quantity when arrived to greater maturity as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs and the like any means in short whereby the general law of tithing is altered and a new method of taking them is introduced is called a modus decimandi or special manner of tithing   0 to make a good and sufficient modus the following rules must be observed   it must be certain and invariablen for payment of different sums will prove it to be no modus that is no original real composition because that must have been one and the same from its first original to the present time   the thing given in lieu of tithes must be beneficial to the parson and not for the emolument of third persons onlyo thus a modus to repair the church in lieu of tithes is not good because that is an advantage to the parish only but to repair the chancel is a good modus for that is an advantage to the parson   it must be something different from the thing compounded forp one load of hay in lieu of all tithe hay is no good modus for no parson would bona fide make a composition to receive less than his due in the same species of tithe and therefore the law will not suppose it possible for such composition to have existed   one cannot be discharged from payment of one species of tithe by paying a modus for anotherq thus a modus of  d for every milch cow will discharge the tithe of milch kine but not of barren cattle for tithe is of common right due for both and therefore a modus  0 for one shall never be a discharge for the other   the recompense must be in its nature as durable as the tithes discharged by it that is an inheritance certainr and therefore a modus that every inhabitant of a house shall pay  d a year in lieu of the owners tithes is no good modus for possibly the house may not be inhabited and then the recompense will be lost   the modus must not be too large which is called a rank modus as if the real value of the tithes be  0l per annum and a modus is suggested of  0l this modus will not be established though one of  0s might have been valids indeed properly speaking the doctrine of rankness in a modus is a mere rule of evidence drawn from the improbability of the fact and not a rule of lawt for in these cases of prescriptive or customary moduses it is supposed that an original real composition was anciently made which being lost by length of time the immemorial usage is admitted as evidence to show that it once did exist and that from thence     such usage was derived now time of memory hath been long ago ascertained by the law to commence from the beginning of the reign of richard the firstu   and any custom may be destroyed by evidence of nonexistence in any part of the long period from that time to the present   wherefore as this real composition is supposed to have been an equitable contract or the full value of the tithes at the time of making it if the modus set up is so rank and large as that it beyond dispute exceeds the value of the tithes in the time of richard the first this modus is in point of evidence felo de se and destroys itself for as it would be destroyed by any direct evidence to prove its nonexistence at any time since that era so also it is destroyed by carrying in itself this internal evidence of a much later original   a prescription de non decimando is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes and to pay no compensation in lieu of them thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithesv so a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector nor the rector to the vicar for ecclesia decimas non solvit ecclesiæw   but these per sonal privileges not arising from or being annexed to the land are personally confined to both the king and the clergy for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes though in their own occupation their lands are not generally tithablex and generally speaking it is an established rule that in lay hands modus de    non decimando non valety   but spiritual persons or corporations as monasteries abbots bishops and the like were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes by various waysz as   by real composition   by the popes bull of exemption   by unity of possession as when the rectory of a parish and lands in the same parish both belonged to a religious     house those lands were discharged of tithes by this unity of possession   by prescription having never been liable to tithes by being always in spiritual hands   by virtue of their order as the knightstemplars cistercians and others whose lands were privileged by the pope with a discharge of tithesa though upon the dissolution of abbeys by hen viii most of those exemptions from tithes would have fallen with them and the lands become tithable again had they not been supported and upheld by the statute    hen viii c    which enacts that all persons who should come to the possession of the lands of any abbey then dissolved should hold them free and discharged of tithes in as large and ample a manner as the abbeys themselves formerly held them   and from this original have sprung all the lands which being in lay hands do at present claim to be tithefree for if a man can show his lands to have been such abbeylands and also immemorially discharged of tithes by any of the means before mentioned this is now a good prescription de non decimando   but he must show both these requisites for abbeylands without a special ground of discharge are not discharged of course neither will any prescription de non decimando avail in total discharge of tithes unless it relates to such abbeylands   iii common or right of common appears from its very definition to be an    incorporeal hereditament being a profit which a man hath in the land of another as to feed his beasts to catch fish to dig turf to cut wood or the likeb and hence common is chiefly of four sorts common of pasture of piscary of turbary and of estovers 0   common of pasture is a right of feeding ones beasts on anothers land for in those waste grounds which are usually called commons the property of the soil is generally in the lord of the manor as in common fields it is in the particular tenants this kind of common is either appendant appurtenant because of vicinage or in grossc     common appendant is a right belonging to the owners or occupiers of arable land to put commonable beasts upon the lords waste and upon the lands of other persons within the same manor commonable beasts are either beasts of the plough or such as manure the ground this is a matter of most universal right and it was originally permittedd not only for the encouragement of agriculture but for the necessity of the thing for when lords of manors granted out parcels of land to tenants for services either done or to be done these tenants could not plough or manure the land without beasts these beasts could not be sustained without pasture and pasture could not be had but in the lords wastes and on the unenclosed fallow grounds of themselves and the other tenants the law therefore annexed this right of common as inseparably incident to the grant of the lands and this was the original of common appendant which obtains in sweden and the other northern kingdoms much in the same manner as in englande common appurtenant ariseth from no connection of tenure nor from any absolute necessity but may be annexed to lands in other lordshipsf or extend to other beasts besides such as are generally commonable as hogs goats or the like which neither plough nor manure the ground this not arising from any natural propriety or necessity like common appendant is therefore not of general right but can only be claimed by immemorial usage and prescriptiong which the law esteems sufficient proof of a special grant or agreement for this purpose common because of vicinage or neighbourhood is where the inhabitants of two townships which lie contiguous to each other have usually intercommoned with one another the beasts of the one straying mutually into the others fields without any molestation from either   this is indeed only a permissive right intended to excuse what in strictness is a trespass in both and to prevent a multiplicity of suits and therefore either township may enclose and bar out the other though they have intercommoned time out of mind neither hath any person of one town    a right to put his beasts originally     into the others common but if they escape and stray thither of themselves the law winks at the trespassh common in gross or at large is such as is neither appendant nor appurtenant to land but is annexed to a mans person being granted to him and his heirs by deed or it may be claimed by prescriptive right as by a parson of a church or the like corporation sole   this is a separate inheritance entirely distinct from any landed property and may be vested in one who has not a foot of ground in the manor   all these species of pasturable common may be and usually are limited as to number and time but there are also commons without stint and which last all the year   by the statute of merton however and other subsequent statutesi the lord of the manor may enclose so much of the waste as he pleases for tillage or woodground provided he leaves common sufficient for such as are entitled thereto this enclosure when justifiable is called in law approving an ancient expression signifying the same as improvingj   the lord hath the    sole interest in the soil but the interest of the lord and commoner in the common are looked upon in law as mutual they may both bring actions for damage done either against strangers or each other the lord for the public injury and each commoner for his private damagek       common of piscary is a liberty of fishing in another mans water as common of turbary is a liberty of digging turf upon anothers groundl   there is also a common of digging for coals minerals stones and the like all these bear a resemblance to common of pasture in many respects though in one point they go much further common of pasture being only a right of feeding on the herbage and vesture of the soil which renews annually but common of turbary and those aforementioned are a right of carrying away the very soil itself       common of estovers or estouviers   that is necessaries from estoffer to furnish is a liberty of taking necessary wood for the use or furniture    of a house or farm from off anothers estate the saxon word bote is used by us as synonymous to the french estovers and therefore housebote is a sufficient allowance of wood to repair or to burn in the house which latter is sometimes called firebote ploughbote and cartbote are wood to be employed in making and repairing all instruments of husbandry and haybote or hedgebote is wood for repairing of hay hedges or fences these botes or estovers must be reasonable ones and such any tenant or lessee may take off the land let or demised to him without waiting for any leave assignment or appointment of the lessor unless he be restrained by special covenant to the contrarym   these several species of commons do all originally result from the same necessity as common of pasture viz for the maintenance and carrying on of husbandry common of piscary being given for the sustenance of the tenants family common of turbary and firebote for his fuel and housebote ploughbote cartbote and hedgebote for repairing his house his instruments of tillage and the necessary fences of his grounds iv a fourth species of incorporeal hereditaments is that of ways or the right of going over another mans ground 0 i speak not here of the kings highways which lead from town to town nor yet of common ways leading from a village into the fields but of private ways in which a particular man may have an interest and a right though another be owner of the soil this may be granted on a special permission as when the owner of the land grants to another the liberty of passing over his grounds to go to church to market or the like in which case the gift or grant is particular and confined to the grantee alone it dies with the person and if the grantee leaves the country he cannot assign over his right to any other nor can he justify taking another     person in his companyn   a way may be also by prescription as if all the inhabitants of such a hamlet or all the owners and occupiers of    such a farm have immemorially used to cross such a ground for such a particular purpose for this immemorial usage supposes an original grant whereby a right of way thus appurtenant to land or houses may clearly be created   a right of way may also arise by act and operation of law for if a man grants me a piece of ground in the middle of his field he at the same time tacitly and impliedly gives me a way to come to it and i may cross his land for that purpose without trespasso for when the law doth give any thing to one it giveth impliedly whatsoever is necessary for enjoying the samep   by the law of the twelve tables at rome where a man had the right of way over anothers land and the road was out of repair he who had the right of way might go over any part of the land he pleased which was the established rule in public as well as private ways and the law of england in both cases seems to correspond with the romanq   v offices which are a right to exercise a public or private employment and to take the fees and emoluments thereunto belonging are also incorporeal    hereditaments whether public as those of magistrates or private as of bailiffs receivers and the like for a man may have an estate in them either to him and his heirs or for life or for a term of years or during pleasure only save only that offices of public trust cannot be granted for a term of years especially if they concern the administration of justice for then they might perhaps vest in executors or administratorsr neither can any judicial office be granted in reversion because though the grantee may be able to perform it at the time of the grant yet before the office falls he may become unable and insufficient but ministerial offices may be so granteds for those may be executed by deputy   also by statute      edw vi c    no public office a few only excepted shall be sold under pain of disability to dispose of or hold it for the law presumes that     he who buys an office will by bribery extortion or other unlawful means make his purchase good to the manifest detriment of the public   vi dignities bear a near relation to offices of the nature of these we treated at large in the former bookt it will therefore be here sufficient to mention them as a species of incorporeal hereditaments wherein a man may have a property or estate   vii franchises are a seventh species franchise and liberty are used as synonymous terms and their definition isu a royal privilege or branch of the kings prerogative subsisting in the hands of a subject being therefore derived from the crown they must arise from the kings grant or in some cases may be held by prescription which as has been frequently said presupposes a grant the kinds of them are various and almost infinite i will here briefly touch upon some of the principal premising only that they may be vested in either natural persons or bodies politic in one man or in many but the same identical franchise that has before been granted to one cannot be bestowed on another for that would prejudice the former grantw to be a county palatine is a franchise vested in a number of persons it is likewise a franchise for a number of persons to be incorporated and subsist as a body politic with a power to maintain perpetual succession and do other corporate acts and each individual member of such corporation is also said to have a franchise or freedom other franchises are to hold a courtleet to have a manor or lordship or at least to have a lordship paramount to have waifs wrecks estrays treasuretrove royal fish forfeitures and deodands to have a court of ones own or liberty of holding pleas and trying causes to have the cognizance of pleas which is a still greater liberty being an exclusive right so that no other court shall try causes arising within that jurisdiction    to have a bailiwick or liberty exempt from the sheriff of the county     wherein the grantee only and his officers are to execuse all process to have a fair or market with the right of taking toll either there or at any other public places as at bridges wharfs or the like which tolls must have a reasonable cause of commencement as in consideration of repairs or the like else the franchise is illegal and voidx or lastly to have a forest chase park warren or fishery endowed with privileges of royalty which species of franchise may require a more minute discussion as to a forest this in the hands of a subject is properly the same thing with a chase being subject to the common law and not to the forest lawsy but a chase differs from a park in that it is not enclosed and also in that a man may have a chase in another mans ground as well as in his own being indeed the liberty of keeping beasts of chase or royal game therein protected even from the owner of the land with a power of hunting them thereon a park is an enclosed chase extending only over a mans own grounds the word park indeed properly signifies an enclosure but yet it is not every field or common which a gentleman pleases to surround with a wall or paling and to stock with a herd of deer that is thereby constituted a legal park for the kings grant or at least immemorial prescription is necessary to make it soz though now the difference between a real park and such enclosed grounds is in many respects not very material only that it is unlawful at common law for any person to kill any beasts of park or chasea except such as possess these franchises of forest chase or park free warren is a similar franchise erected for preservation or custody which the word signifies of beasts and fowls of warrenb which being feræ naturæ every one had a right to kill as he could but upon     the introduction of the forest laws at the norman conquest as will be shown hereafter these animals being looked upon as royal game and the sole property of our savage monarchs this franchise of free warren was invented to protect them by giving the grantee a sole and exclusive power of killing such game so far as his warren extended on condition of his preventing other persons a man therefore that has the franchise of warren is in reality no more than a royal gamekeeper but no man not even a lord of a manor could by common law justify sporting on anothers soil or even on his own unless he had the liberty of free warrenc this franchise is almost fallen into disregard since the new statutes for preserving the game the name being now chiefly preserved in grounds that are set apart for breeding hares and rabbits there are many instances of keen sportsmen in ancient times who have sold their estates and reserved the free warren or right of killing game to themselves by which means it comes to pass that a man and his heirs have sometimes free warren over anothers groundd   a free fishery or exclusive right of fishing in a public river is also a royal franchise and is considered as such in all countries where the feodal polity has prevailede though the making such grants and by that means appropriating what seems to be unnatural to restrain the use of running water was prohibited for the future by king johns great charter and the rivers that were fenced in his time were directed to be laid open as well as the forests to be disafforestedf this opening was extended by the secondg and thirdh charters of henry iii to    those also that were fenced under richard i so that a franchise of free fishery ought now to be at least as old as the reign of henry ii this differs from a several fishery because he that has a several fishery must also be or at least derive his right from the owner of the soili which in a free fishery is not requisite it differs also from a common of piscary before mentioned in that the free fishery is an exclu  0 sive right the common of piscary is not so and therefore in a free fishery a man has a property in the fish before they are caught in a common of piscary not till afterwardsk some indeed have considered a free fishery not as a royal franchise but merely as a private grant of a liberty to fish in the several fishery of the grantorl but to consider such right as originally a flower of the prerogative till restrained by magna charta and derived by royal grant previous to the reign of richard i to such as now claim it by prescription and to distinguish it as we have done from a several and a common of fishery may remove some difficulties in respect to this matter with which our books are embarrassed for it must be acknowledged that the right and distinctions of the three species of fishery are very much confounded in our lawbooks and that there are not wanting respectable authoritiesm which maintain that a several fishery may exist distinct from the property of the soil and that a free fishery implies no exclusive right but is synonymous with common of piscary   viii corodies are a right of sustenance or to receive certain allotments of victual and provision for ones maintenancen in lieu of which especially when due from ecclesiastical persons a pension or sum of money is sometimes substitutedo and these may be reckoned another species of incorporeal hereditaments though not chargeable on or issuing from any corporeal inheritance but only charged on the person of the owner in respect of such his inheritance to these may be added ix annuities which are much of the same nature only that these arise from temporal as the former from spiritual persons an annuity is a thing very distinct from a rentcharge with which it is frequently confounded a rentcharge being a burden imposed upon and issuing out of lands whereas an annuity is a yearly sum chargeable only upon the person of the grantorp therefore if a man by deed grant to another the sum of  0l per annum without expressing out of what lands it shall issue no land at all shall be charged  0 with it but it is a mere personal annuity which is of so little account in the law that if granted to an eleemosynary corporation it is not within the statutes of mortmainq and yet a man may have a real estate in it though his security is merely personal 0        x rents are the last species of incorporeal hereditaments the word rent or render reditus signifies a compensation or return it being in the nature of an acknowledgment given for the possession of some corporeal inheritancer it is defined to be a certain profit issuing yearly out of lands and tenements corporeal it must be a profit yet there is no occasion for it to be as it usually is a sum of money for spurs capons horses corn and other matters may be rendered and frequently are rendered by way of rents it may also consist in services or manual operations as to plough so many acres of ground to attend the king or the lord to the wars and the like which services in the eye of the law are profits this profit must also be certain or that which may be reduced to a certainty by either party it must also issue yearly though there is no occasion for it to issue every successive year but it may be reserved every second third or fourth yeart yet as it is to be produced out of the profits of lands and tenements as a recompense for being permitted to hold or enjoy them it ought to be reserved yearly because those profits do annually arise and are annually renewed it must issue out of the thing granted and not be part of the land or thing itself wherein it differs from an exception in the grant which is always of part of the thing grantedu it must lastly issue out of lands and tenements corporeal that is from some inheritance whereunto the owner or grantee of the rent may have recourse to distrein therefore a rent cannot be reserved out of an advowson a common an office a franchise or the likew but a grant of such annuity or sum may operate as a personal contract and oblige the grantor to pay the money reserved or subject him to an action of debtx though it doth not affect the inheritance and is no legal rent in contemplation of law   there are at common lawy three manner of rents rentservice rentcharge and rentseck rentservice is so called     because it hath some corporeal service incident to it as at the least fealty or the feodal oath of fidelityz for if a tenant holds his land by fealty and ten shillings rent or by the service of ploughing the lords land and five shillings rent these pecuniary rents being connected with personal services are therefore called rentservice and for these in case they be behind or arrere at the day appointed the lord may distrein of common right without reserving any special power of distress provided he hath in himself the reversion or future estate of the lands and tenements after the lease or particular estate of the lessee or grantee is expireda a rentcharge is where the owner of the rent hath no future interest or reversion expectant in the land as where a man by deed maketh over to others his whole estate in feesimple with a certain rent payable thereout and adds to the deed a covenant or clause of distress that if the rent be arrere or behind it shall be lawful to distrein for the same in this case the land is liable to the distress not of common right but by virtue of the clause in the deed and therefore it is called a rentcharge because in this manner the land is charged with a distress for the payment of itb   rentseck reditus siccus or barrenrent    is in effect nothing more than a rent reserved by deed but without any clause of distress   there are also other species of rents which are reducible to these three rents of assize are the certain established rents of the freeholders and ancient copyholders of a manorc which cannot be departed from or varied those of the freeholders are frequently called chiefrents reditus capitales and both sorts are indifferently denominated quitrents quieti reditus because thereby the tenant goes quit and free of all other services when these payments were reserved in silver or white money they were anciently called whiterents blanchfarms reditus albid in contradistinction to rents reserved in work grain or baser money which were called     reditus nigri or blackmaile rackrent is only a rent of the full value of the tenement or near it a feefarm rent is a rentcharge issuing out of an estate in fee of at least onefourth of the value of the lands at the time of its reservationf for a grant of lands reserving so considerable a rent is indeed only letting lands to farm in feesimple instead of the usual methods for life or years   these are the general divisions of rents but the difference between them in respect to the remedy for recovering them is now totally abolished and all persons may have the like remedy by distress for rentsseck rents of assize and chiefrents as in case of rents reserved upon leaseg   rent is regularly due and payable upon the land from whence it issues if no particular place is mentioned in the reservationh but in case of the king the payment must be either to his officers at the exchequer or to his receiver in the countryi and strictly the rent is demandable and payable before the time of sunset of the day whereon it is reservedk though perhaps not absolutely due till midnightl      with regard to the original of rents something with be said in the next chapter and as to distresses and other remedies for their recovery the doctrine relating thereto and the several proceedings thereon these belong properly to the third part of our commentaries which will treat of civil injuries and the means whereby they are redressed chapter iv of the feodal system it is impossible to understand with any degree of accuracy either the civil constitution of this kingdom or the laws which regulate its landed property without some general acquaintance with the nature and doctrine of feuds or the feodal law a system so universally received throughout europe upwards of twelve centuries ago that sir henry spelmana does not scruple to call it the law of nations in our western world  this chapter will be therefore dedicated to this inquiry and though in the course of our observations in this and many other parts of the present book we may have occasion to search pretty highly into the antiquities of our english jurisprudence yet surely no industrious student will imagine his time misemployed when he is led to consider that the obsolete doctrines of our laws are frequently the foundation upon which what remains is erected and that it is impracticable to comprehend many rules of the modern law in a scholarlike scientifical manner without having recourse to the ancient nor will these researches be altogether void of rational entertainment as well as use as in viewing the majestic ruins of rome or athens of balbec or palmyra it administers both pleasure and instruction to compare them with the draughts of the same edifices in their pristine proportion and splendour     the constitution of feudsb had its original from the military policy of the northern or celtic nations the goths the huns the franks the vandals and the lombards who all migrating from the same officina gentium as crag very justly entitles itc poured themselves in vast quantities into all the regions of europe at the declension of the roman empire it was brought by them from their own countries and continued in their respective colonies as the most likely means to secure their new acquisitions and to that end large districts or parcels of land were allotted by the conquering general to the superior officers of the army and by them dealt out again in smaller parcels or allotments to the inferior officers and most deserving soldiersd these allotments were called feoda feuds fiefs or fees which last appellation in the    northern languagee signifies a conditional stipend or rewardf rewards or stipends they evidently were and the condition annexed to them was that the possessor should do service faithfully both at home and in the wars to him by whom they were given for which purpose he took the juramentum fidelitatis or oath of fealtyg  and in case of the breach of this condition and oath by not performing the stipulated service or by deserting the lord in battle the lands were again to revert to him who granted themh allotments thus acquired mutually engaged such as accepted them to defend them and as they all sprang from     the same right of conquest no part could subsist independent of the whole wherefore all givers as well as receivers were mutually bound to defend each others possessions but as that could not effectually be done in a tumultuous irregular way government and to that purpose subordination was necessary every receiver of lands or feudatory was therefore bound when called upon by his benefactor or immediate lord of his feud or fee to do all in his power to defend him such benefactor or lord was likewise subordinate to and under the command of his immediate benefactor or superior and so upwards to the prince or general himself and the several lords were also reciprocally bound in their respective gradations to protect the possessions they had given thus the feodal connection was established    a proper military subjection was naturally introduced and an army of feudatories was always ready enlisted and mutually prepared to muster not only in defence of each mans own several property but also defence of the whole and of every part of this their newlyacquired countryj the produce of which constitution was soon sufficiently visible in the strength and spirit with which they maintained their conquests  the universality and early use of this feodal plan among all those nations which in complaisance to the romans we still call barbarous may appear from what is recordedk of the cimbri and teutones nations of the same northern original as those whom we have been describing at their first irruption into italy about a century before the christian era they demanded of the romans ut martius populus aliquid sibi terrae daret quasi stipendium cæterum ut vellet manibus atque armis suis uteretur the sense of which may be thus rendered they desired stipendiary lands that is feuds to be allowed them to be held by military and other personal services whenever their lord should call upon them this was evidently the same constitution that displayed itself more fully about seven hundred years afterwards when the salii burgundians and franks broke in upon gaul the visigoths on     spain and the lombards upon italy and introduced with themselves this northern plan of polity serving at once to distribute and to protect the territories they had newly gained and from hence too it is probable that the emperor alexander severusl took the hint of dividing lands conquered from the enemy among his generals and victorious soldiery duly stocked with cattle and bondmen on condition of receiving military service from them and their heirs forever scarce had these northern conquerors established themselves in their new dominions when the wisdom of their constitutions as well as their personal valour alarmed all the princes of europe that is of those countries which had formerly been roman provinces but had revolted or were deserted by their old masters in the general wreck of the empire wherefore most if not all of them thought it necessary to enter into the same or a similar plan of policy for whereas before the possessions of their subjects were perfectly allodial that is wholly independent and held of no superior at all now they parcelled out their royal territories or persuaded their subjects to surrender up and retake their own landed property under the like feodal obligations of military fealtym    and thus in the compass of a very few years the feodal constitution or the doctrine of tenure extended itself over all the western world  which alteration of landed property in so very material a point necessarily drew after it an alteration of laws and customs so that the feodal laws soon drove out the roman which had hitherto so universally obtained but now became for many centuries lost and forgotten and italy itself as some of the civilians with more spleen than judgment have expressed it belluinas atque ferinas immanesque longobardorum leges accepitn     but this feodal polity which was thus by degrees established over all the continent of europe seems not to have been received in this part of our island at least not universally and as a part of the national constitution till the reign of william the normano not but that it is reasonable to believe from abundant traces in our history and laws that even in the times of the saxons who were a swarm from what sir william temple calls the same northern hive something similar to this was in use yet not so extensively nor attended with all the rigour that was afterwards imported by the normans for the saxons were firmly settled in this island at least as early as the year  00 and it was not till two centuries after that feuds arrived at their full vigour and maturity even on the continent of europep this introduction however of the feudal tenures into england by king william does not seem to have been effected immediately after the conquest nor by the mere arbitrary will and power of the conqueror but to have been gradually established by the norman barons and others in such forfeited lands as they received from the gift of the conqueror and afterwards universally consented to by the great council of the nation long after his title was established indeed from the prodigious slaughter of the english nobility at the battle of hastings and the fruitless insurrections of those who survived such numerous forfeitures had accrued that he was able to reward his norman followers with very large and extensive possessions which gave a handle to the monkish historians and such as have implicitly followed them to represent him as having by right of the sword seized on all the lands of england and dealt them out again to his own favourites a supposition grounded upon a mistaken sense of the word conquest which in its feodal acceptation signifies no more than acquisition  and this has led many hasty writers into a strange historical mistake    and one which upon the slightest examination will     be found to be most untrue however certain it is that the normans now began to gain very large possessions in england and their regard for the feodal law under which they had long lived together with the kings recommendation of this policy to the english as the best way to put themselves on a military footing and thereby to prevent any future attempts from the continent were probably the reasons that prevailed to effect its establishment here by law and though the time of this great revolution in our landed property cannot be ascertained with exactness yet there are some circumstances that may lead us to a probable conjecture concerning it for we learn from the saxon chronicleq that in the nineteenth year of king williams reign an invasion was apprehended from denmark and the military constitution of the saxons being then laid aside and no other introduced in its stead the kingdom was wholly defenceless which occasioned the king to bring over a large army of normans and bretons who were quartered upon every landholder and greatly oppressed the people this apparent weakness together with the grievances occasioned by a foreign force might cooperate with the kings remonstrances and the better incline the nobility to listen to his proposals for putting them in a posture of defence for as soon as the danger was over the king held a great council to inquire into the state of the nationr the immediate consequence of which was the compiling of the great survey called domesdaybook which was finished in the next year and in the latter end of that very year the king was attended by all his nobility at sarum where all the principal landholders submitted their lands to the yoke of military tenure became the kings vassals and did homage and fealty to his persons this may possibly have been the era of formally introducing the feodal tenures by law and perhaps the very law thus made at the council of sarum is that which is still extantt   0 and couched in these remarkable words—statuimus ut omnes liberi homines fœdere et sacramento affirment quod intra et extra universum regnum angliæ wilhelmo regi domino suo fideles esse volunt terras et honores illius omni fidelitate ubique servare cum eo et contra inimicos et alienigenas defendere the terms of this law as sir martin wright has observedu are plainly feodal for first it requires the oath of fealty which made in the sense of the feudists every man that took it a tenant or vassal and secondly the tenants obliged themselves to defend their lords territories and titles against all enemies foreign and domestic but what clearly evinces the legal establishment of this system is another law of the same collectionw which exacts the performance of the military feodal services as ordained by the general council—omnes comites et barones et milites et servientes et universi liberi homines totius regni nostri prædicti habeant et teneant se semper bene in armis et in equis ut decet et oportet et sint semper prompti et bene parati ad servitium suum integrum nobis explendum et peragendum cum opus fuerit secundum quod nobis debent de feodis et tenementis suis de jure facere et sicut illis statuimus per commune concilium totius regni nostri prædicti this new polity therefore seems not to have been imposed by the conqueror but nationally and freely adopted by the general assembly of the whole realm in the same manner as other nations of europe had before adopted it upon the same principle of selfsecurity and in particular they had the recent example of the french nation before their eyes which had gradually surrendered up all its allodial or free lands into the kings hands who restored them to the owners as a beneficium or feud to be held to them and such of their heirs as they previously  0 nominated to the king and thus by degrees all the allodial estates in france were converted into feuds and the freemen became the vassals of the crownx  the only difference between this change of tenures in france and that in england was that the former was effected gradually     by the consent of private persons the latter was done at once all over england by the common consent of the nationy in consequence of this change it became a fundamental maxim and necessary principle though in reality a mere fiction of our english tenures that the king is the universal lord and original proprietor of all the lands in his kingdomz and that no man doth or can possess any part of it but what has mediately or immediately been derived as a gift from him to be held upon feodal services for this being the real case in pure original proper feuds other nations who adopted this system were obliged to act upon the same supposition as a substruction and foundation of their new polity though the fact was indeed far otherwise and indeed by thus consenting to the introduction of feodal tenures our english ancestors probably meant no more than to put the kingdom in a state of defence by establishing a military system and to oblige themselves in respect of their lands to maintain the kings title and territories with equal vigour and fealty as if they had received their lands from his bounty upon these express conditions as pure proper beneficiary feudatories but whatever their meaning was the norman interpreters skilled in all the niceties of the feodal constitutions and well understanding the import and extent of the feodal terms gave a very different construction to this proceeding and thereupon took a handle to introduce not only the rigorous doctrines which prevailed in the duchy of normandy but also such fruits and dependencies such hardships and services as were never known to other nationsa as if the english had in fact as well as theory owed every thing they had to the bounty of their sovereign lord our ancestors therefore who were by no means beneficiaries but had barely consented to this fiction of tenure from     the crown as the basis of a military discipline with reason looked upon these deductions as grievous impositions and arbitrary conclusions from principles that as to them had no foundation in truthb however this king and his son william rufus kept up with a high hand all the rigours of the feodal doctrines but their successor henry i found it expedient when he set up his pretensions to the crown to promise a restitution of the laws of king edward the confessor or ancient saxon system and accordingly in the first year of his reign granted a charterc whereby he gave up the greater grievances but still reserved the fiction of feodal tenure for the same military purposes which engaged his father to introduce it but this charter was gradually broken through and the former grievances were revived and aggravated by himself and succeeding princes till in the reign of king john they became so intolerable that they occasioned his barons or principal feudatories to rise up in arms against him which at length produced the famous great charter at runingmead which with some alterations was confirmed by his son henry iii and though its immunities especially as altered on its last edition by his sond are very greatly short of those granted by henry i it was justly esteemed at the time a vast acquisition to english liberty indeed by the further alteration of tenures that has since happened many of these immunities may now appear to a common observer of much less consequence than they really were when    granted but this properly considered will show not that the acquisitions under john were small but that those under charles were greater and from hence also arises another inference that the liberties of englishmen are not as some arbitrary writers would represent them mere infringements of the kings prerogative extorted from our princes by taking advantage of their weakness but a restoration of that ancient constitution of which our ancestors had been defrauded by the art and finesse of the norman lawyers rather than deprived by the force of the norman arms     having given this short history of their rise and progress we will next consider the nature doctrine and principal laws of feuds wherein we shall evidently trace the groundwork of many parts of our public polity and also the original of such of our own tenures as were either abolished in the last century or still remain in force the grand and fundamental maxim of all feodal tenure is this that all lands were originally granted out by the sovereign and are therefore holden either mediately or immediately of the crown the grantor was called the proprietor or lord being he who retained the dominion or ultimate property of the feud or fee and the grantee who had only the use and possession according to the terms of the grant was styled the feudatory or vassal which was only another name for the tenant or holder of the lands though on account of the prejudices which we have justly conceived against the doctrines that were afterwards grafted on this system we now use the word vassal opprobriously as synonymous to slave or bondman  the manner of the grant was by words of gratuitous and pure donation dedi et concessi which are still the operative words in our modern infeodations or deeds of feoffment this was perfected by the ceremony of corporal investiture or open and notorious delivery of possession in the presence of the other vassals which perpetuated among them the era of the new acquisition at a time when the art of writing was very little known and therefore the evidence of property was reposed in the memory of the neighbourhood who in case of a disputed title were afterwards called upon to decide the difference not only according to external proofs adduced by the parties litigant but also by the internal testimony of their own private knowledge besides an oath of fealty  or profession of faith to the lord which was the    parent of our oath of allegiance the vassal or tenant upon investiture did usually homage to his lord openly and humbly kneeling being ungirt uncovered     and holding up his hands both together between those of the lord who sate before him and there professing that he did become his man from that day forth of life and limb and earthly honour and then he received a kiss from his lorde which ceremony was denominated homagium or manhood by the feudists from the stated form of words devenio vester homof when the tenant had thus professed himself to be the man of his superior or lord the next consideration was concerning the service which as such he was bound to render in recompense for the land that he held this in pure proper and original feuds was only twofold to follow or do suit to the lord in his courts in time of peace and in his armies or warlike retinue when necessity called him to the field the lord was in early times the legislator and judge over all his feudatories and therefore the vassals of the inferior lords were bound by their fealty to attend their domestic court baronsg which were instituted in every manor or barony for doing speedy and effectual justice to all the tenants in order as well to answer such complaints as might be alleged against themselves as to form a jury or homage for the trial of their fellowtenants and upon this account in all the feodal institutions both here and on the continent they are distinguished by the appellation of the peers of the court pares curtis or pares curiæ in like manner the barons themselves or lords of inferior districts were denominated peers of the kings court and were bound to attend him upon summons to hear causes of greater consequence in the kings presence and under the direction of his grand justiciary till in many countries the power of that officer was broken and distributed into other courts of judicature the peers of the kings court still reserving to themselves in     almost every feodal government the right of appeal from those subordinate courts in the last resort the military branch of service consisted in attending the lord to the wars if called upon with such a retinue and for such a number of days as were stipulated at the first donation in proportion to the quantity of the land at the first introduction of feuds as they were gratuitous so also they were precarious and held at the will of the lordh who was then the sole judge whether his vassal performed his services faithfully then they became certain for one or more years among the ancient germans they continued only from year to year an annual distribution of lands being made by their leaders in their general councils or assemblesi this was professedly done lest their thoughts should be diverted from war to agriculture lest the strong should encroach upon the possessions of the weak and lest luxury and avarice should be encouraged by the erection of permanent houses and too curious an attention to convenience and the elegant superfluities of life but when the general migration was pretty well over and a peaceable possession of the newacquired settlements had introduced new customs and manners when the fertility of the soil had encouraged the study of husbandry and an affection for the spots they had cultivated began naturally to arise in the tillers a more permanent degree of property was introduced and feuds began now to be granted for the life of the feudatoryk but still feuds were not yet hereditary though frequently    granted by the favour of the lord to the children of the former possessor till in process of time it became unusual and was therefore thought hard to reject the heir if he were capable to perform the servicesl and therefore infants women and professed monks who were incapable of     bearing arms were also incapable of succeeding to a genuine feud but the heir when admitted to the feud which his ancestor possessed used generally to pay a fine or acknowledgment to the lord in horses arms money and the like for such renewal of the feud which was called a relief because it raised up and reestablished the inheritance or in the words of the feodal writers incertam et caducam hereditatem relevabat this relief was afterwards when feuds became absolutely hereditary continued on the death of the tenant though the original foundation of it had ceased for in process of time feuds came by degrees to be universally extended beyond the life of the first vassal to his sons or perhaps to such one of them as the lord should name and in this case the form of the donation was strictly observed for if a feud was given to a man and his sons all his sons succeeded him in equal portions and as they died off their shares reverted to their lord and did not descend to their children or even to their surviving brothers as not being specified in the donationm but when such a feud was given to a man and his heirs in general terms then a more extended rule of succession took place and when the feudatory died his male descendants in infinitum were admitted to the succession when any such descendant who thus had succeeded died his male descendants were also admitted in the first place and in defect of them such of his male collateral kindred as were of the blood or lineage of the first feudatory but no others for this was an unalterable maxim in feodal succession that none was capable of inheriting a feud but such as was of the blood of that is lineally descended from the first feudatoryn and the descent being thus confined to males originally extended to all the males alike all the sons without any distinction of primogeniture succeeding to equal portions of the fathers feud but this being found upon many accounts inconvenient particularly by dividing the services and thereby weakening the strength of the feodal union and honorary feuds or titles of nobility being now introduced which were not of     a divisible nature but could only be inherited by the eldest sono in imitation of these military feuds or those we are now describing began also in most countries to descend according to the same rule of primogeniture to the eldest son in exclusion of all the restp other qualities of feuds were that the feudatory could not aliene or dispose of his feud neither could he exchange nor yet mortgage nor even devise it by will without the consent of the lordq for the reason of conferring the feud being the personal abilities of the feudatory to serve in war it was not fit he should be at liberty to transfer this gift either from himself or from his posterity who were presumed to inherit his valour to others who might prove less able and as the feodal obligation was looked upon as reciprocal the feudatory being entitled to the lords protection in return for his own fealty and service therefore the lord could no more transfer his seignory or protection without consent of his vassal than the vassal could his feud without consent of his lordr it being equally unreasonable that the lord should extend his protection to a person to whom he had exceptions and that the vassal should owe subjection to a superior not of his own choosing these were the principal and very simple qualities of the genuine or original feuds which were all of a military nature and in the hands of military persons though the feudatories being under frequent incapacities of cultivating and manuring their own lands soon found it necessary to commit part of them to inferior tenants obliging them to such returns in service corn cattle or money as might enable the chief feudatories to attend their military duties without    distraction which returns or reditus were the original of rents and by these means the feodal polity was greatly extended these inferior feudatories who held what are called in the scots law rerefiefs being under similar obligations of fealty to do suit of court to answer the stipulated renders or rentservice and to promote the welfare of their immediate superiors or lordss     but this at the same time demolished the ancient simplicity of feuds and an inroad being once made upon their constitution it subjected them in a course of time to great varieties and innovations feuds began to be bought and sold and deviations were made from the old fundamental rules of tenure and succession which were held no longer sacred when the feuds themselves no longer continued to be purely military hence these tenures began now to be divided into feoda propria et impropria proper and improper feuds under the former of which divisions were comprehended such and such only of which we have before spoken and under that of improper or derivative feuds were comprised all such as do not fall within the other descriptions such for instance as were originally bartered and sold to the feudatory for a price such as were held upon base or less honourable services or upon a rent in lieu of military service such as were in themselves alienable without mutual license and such as might descend indifferently either to males or females but where a difference was not expressed in the creation such newcreated feuds did in all respects follow the nature of an original genuine and proper feudt but as soon as the feodal system came to be considered in the light of a civil establishment rather than as a military plan the ingenuity of the same ages which perplexed all theology with the subtilty of scholastic disquisitions and bewildered philosophy in the mazes of metaphysical jargon began also to exert its influence on this copious and fruitful subject in pursuance of which the most refined and oppressive consequences were drawn from what originally was a plan of simplicity and liberty equally beneficial to both lord and tenant and prudently calculated for their mutual protection and defence from this one foundation in different countries of europe very different superstructures have been raised what effect it has produced on the landed property of england will appear in the following chapters 0    chapter v of the ancient english tenures in this chapter we shall take a short view of the ancient tenures of our english estates or the manner in which lands tenements and hereditaments might have been holden as the same stood in force till the middle of the last century in which we shall easily perceive that all the particularities all the seeming and real hardships that attended those tenures were to be accounted for upon feodal principles and no other being fruits of and deduced from the feodal policy almost all the real property of this kingdom is by the policy of our laws supposed to be granted by dependent upon and holden of some superior lord by and in consideration of certain services to be rendered to the lord by the tenant or possessor of this property the thing holden is therefore styled a tenement the possessors thereof tenants and the manner of their possession a tenure thus all the land in the kingdom is supposed to be holden mediately or immediately of the king who is styled the lord paramount or above all such tenants as held under the king immediately when they granted out portions of their lands to inferior persons became also lords with respect to those inferior persons as they were still tenants with respect to the king  and thus partaking of a middle nature were called mesne or middle lords so that if the king granted a manor to a and he granted a portion of the land to b now b was said to hold   0 of a and a of the king or in other words b held his lands immediately of a but mediately of the king the king therefore was styled lord paramount a was both tenant and lord or was a mesne lord and b was called tenant paravail or the lowest tenant being he who was supposed to make avail or profit of the landa in this manner are all the lands of the kingdom holden which are in the hands of subjects for according to sir edward cokeb in the law of england we have not properly allodium which we have seenc is the name by which the feudists abroad distinguish such estates of the subject as are not holden of any superior so that at the first glance we may observe that our lands are either plainly feuds or partake very strongly of the feodal nature all tenures being thus derived or supposed to be derived from the king those that held immediately under him in right of his crown and dignity were called his tenants in capite or in chief which was the most honourable species of tenure but at the same time subjected the tenants to greater and more burthensome services than inferior tenures didd this distinction ran through all the different sorts of tenure of which i now proceed to give an account i there seems to have subsisted among our ancestors four principal species of lay tenures to which all others may be reduced the grand criteria of which were the nature of the several services or renders that were due to the lords from their tenants the services in respect of their quality were either free or base services in respect of their quantity and the time of exacting them were either certain or uncertain free services were such as were not unbecoming the character of a soldier or a freeman to perform     as to serve under his lord in the wars to pay a sum of money and the like base services    were such as were only fit for peasants or persons of a servile rank as to plough the lords land to make his hedges to carry out his dung or other mean employments the certain services whether free or base were such as were stinted in quantity and could not be exceeded on any pretence as to pay a stated annual rent or to plough such a field for three days the uncertain depended upon unknown contingencies as to do military service in person or pay an assessment in lieu of it when called upon or to wind a horn whenever the scots invaded the realm which are free services or to do whatever the lord should command which is a base or villein service from the various combinations of these services have arisen the four kinds of lay tenure which subsisted in england till the middle of the last century and three of which subsist to this day of these bracton who wrote under henry the third seems to give the clearest and most compendious account of any author ancient or moderne of which the following is the outline or abstractf tenements are of two kinds franktenement and villenage and of franktenements some are held freely in consideration of homage and knightservice others in freesocage with the service of fealty only and againg of villenages some are pure and others privileged he that holds in pure villenage shall do whatever is commanded him and always be bound to an uncertain service the other kind of villenage is called villeinsocage and these villeinsocmen do villein services but such as are certain and determined of which the sense seems to be as follows first where the service was free but uncertain as military service with homage that tenure was called the tenure in     chivalry per servitium militare or by knightservice secondly where the service was not only free but also certain as by fealty only by rent and fealty c that tenure was called liberum socagium or freesocage these were the only free holdings or tenements the others were villenous or servile as thirdly where the service was base in its nature and uncertain as to time and quantity the tenure was purum villenagium absolute or pure villenage lastly where the service was base in its nature but reduced to a certainty this was still villenage but distinguished from the other by the name of privileged villenage villenagium privilegiatum or it might be still called socage from the certainty of its services but degraded by their baseness into the inferior title of villanum socagium villeinsocage i the first most universal and esteemed the most honourable species of tenure was that by knightservice called in latin servitium militare and in lawfrench chivalry or service de chivaler answering to the fief dhaubert of the normansh which name is expressly given it by the mirrouri this differed in very few points as we shall presently see from a pure and proper feud being entirely military and the general effect of the feodal establishment in england to make a tenure by knightservice a determinate quantity of land was necessary which was called a knights fee feodum militare the measure of which in   edw i was estimated at twelve ploughlandsk and its value though it varied with the timesl in the reigns of edward i and edward iim was stated at  0l per annum  and he who held this proportion of land or a whole fee by    knightservice was bound to attend his lord to the wars for forty days in every year if called uponn which attendance was his reditus or return his rent or service for the land he claimed to hold if he held only half a knights fee he was only bound to attend twenty days and so in proportiono and there is reason to     apprehend that this service was the whole that our ancestors meant to subject themselves to the other fruits and consequences of this tenure being fraudulently superinduced as the regular though unforeseen appendages of the feodal system this tenure of knightservice had all the marks of a strict and regular feud it was granted by words of pure donation dedi et concessip was transferred by investiture or delivering corporal possession of the land usually called livery of seisin and was perfected by homage and fealty it also drew after it these seven fruits and consequences as inseparably incident to the tenure in chivalry viz aids relief primer seisin wardship marriage fines for alienation and escheat all which i shall endeavour to explain and to show to be of feodal original    aids were originally mere benevolences granted by the tenant to his lord in times of difficulty and distressq but in process of time they grew to be considered as a matter of right and not of discretion these aids were principally three first to ransom the lords person if taken prisoner a necessary consequence of the feodal attachment and fidelity insomuch that the neglect of doing it whenever it was in the vassals power was by the strict rigour of the feodal law an absolute forfeiture of his estater secondly to make the lords eldest son a knight a matter that was formerly attended with great ceremony pomp and expense this aid could not be demanded till the heir was fifteen years old or capable of bearing armss the intention of it being to breed up the eldest son and heirapparent of the seignory to deeds of arms and chivalry for the better defence of the nation thirdly to marry the lords eldest daughter by giving her a suitable portion for daughters portions were in those days extremely slender few lords being able to save much out of     their income for this purpose nor could they acquire money by other means being wholly conversant in matters of arms nor by the nature of their tenure could they charge their lands with this or any other encumbrances  from bearing their proportion to these aids no rank or profession was exempted and therefore even the monasteries till the time of their dissolution contributed to the knighting of their founders male heir of whom their lands were holden and the marriage of his female descendantst and one cannot but observe in this    particular the great resemblance which the lord and vassal of the feodal law bore to the patron and client of the roman republic between whom also there subsisted a mutual fealty or engagement of defence and protection for with regard to the matter of aids there were three which were usually raised by the client viz to marry the patrons daughter to pay his debts and to redeem his person from captivityu but besides these ancient feodal aids the tyranny of lords by degrees exacted more and more as aids to pay the lords debts probably in imitation of the romans and aids to enable him to pay aids or reliefs to his superior lord from which last indeed the kings tenants in capite were from the nature of their tenure excused as they held immediately of the king who had no superior to prevent this abuse king johns magna chartav ordained that no aids be taken by the king without consent of parliament nor in any wise by inferior lords save only the three ancient ones above mentioned but this provision was omitted in henry iiis charter and the same oppressions were continued till the    edward i when the statute called confirmatio chartarum was enacted which in this respect revived king johns charter by ordaining that none but the ancient aids should be taken but though the species of aids was thus restrain    ed yet the quantity of each aid remained arbitrary and uncertain king johns charter indeed ordered that all aids taken by inferior lords should be reasonablew and that the aids taken by the king of his tenants in capite should be settled by parliamentx but they were never completely ascertained and adjusted till the statute westm     edw i c    which fixed the aids of inferior lords at twenty shillings or the supposed twentieth part of the annual value of every knights fee for making the eldest son a knight or marrying the eldest daughter and the same was done with regard to the kings tenants in capite by statute    edw iii c    the other aid for ransom of the lords person being not in its nature capable of any certainty was therefore never ascertained   relief relevium was before mentioned as incident to every feodal tenure by way of fine or composition with the lord for taking up the estate which was lapsed or fallen in by the death of the last tenant but though reliefs had their original while feuds were only lifeestates yet they continued after feuds became hereditary and were therefore looked upon very justly as one of the greatest grievances of tenure especially when at the first they were merely arbitrary and at the will of the lord so that if he pleased to demand an exorbitant relief it was in effect to disinherit the heiry the english ill brooked this consequence of their newadopted policy and therefore william the conqueror by his lawz ascertained the relief by directing in imitation of the danish heriots that a certain quantity of arms and habiliments of war should be paid by the earls barons and vavasours respectively and if the latter had no arms they should pay  00s william rufus broke through this composition and again demanded arbitrary uncertain reliefs as due by the feodal laws thereby in effect obliging every heir to newpurchase or redeem his landa but his brother henry i by the charter before mentioned restored his fathers law     and ordained that the relief to be paid should be according to the law so established and not an arbitrary redemptionb but afterwards when by an ordinance in    hen ii called the assize of arms it was provided that every mans armour should descend to his heir for defence of the realm and it thereby became impracticable to pay these acknowledgments in arms according to the laws of the conqueror the composition was universally accepted of  00s for every knights fee as we find it ever after establishedc but it must be remembered that this relief was only then payable if the heir at the death of his ancestor had attained his full age of oneandtwenty years      primer seisin was a feodal burthen only incident to the kings tenants in capite and not to those who held of inferior or mesne lords it was a right which the king had when any of his tenants in capite died seised of a knights fee to receive of the heir provided he were of full age one whole years profits of the lands if they were in immediate possession and half a years profits if the lands were in reversion expectant on an estate for lifed this seems to be little more than an additional relief but grounded upon this feodal reason that by the ancient law of feuds immediately upon the death of a vassal the superior was entitled to enter and take seisin or possession of the land by way of protection against intruders till the heir appeared to claim it and receive investiture during which interval the lord was entitled to take the profits and unless the heir claimed within a year and a day it was by the strict law a for feituree this practice however seems not to have long obtained in england if ever with regard to tenure under inferior lords but as to the kings tenures in capite the prima seisina was expressly declared under henry iii and edward ii to belong to the king by prerogative in contradistinction to other lordsf the king was entitled to enter and receive the     whole profits of the land till livery was sued which suit being commonly made within a year and day next after the death of the tenant in pursuance of the strict feodal rule therefore the king used to take as an average the firstfruits that is to say one years profits of the landg and this afterwards gave a handle to the popes who claimed to be feodal lords of the church to claim in like manner from every clergyman in england the first years profits of his benefice by way of primitiæ or firstfruits   these payments were only due if the heir was of full age but if he was under the age of twentyone being a male or fourteen being a femaleh the lord was entitled to the wardship of the heir and was called the guardian in chivalry this wardship consisted in having the custody of the body and lands of such heir without any account of the profits till the age of twentyone in males and sixteen in females for the law supposed the heirmale unable to perform knightservice till twentyone but as for the female she was supposed capable at fourteen to marry and then her husband might perform the service the lord therefore had no wardship if at the death of the ancestor the heirmale was of the full age of twentyone or the heirfemale of fourteen yet if she was then under fourteen and the lord once had her in ward he might keep her so till sixteen by virtue of the statute of westm     edw i c    the two additional years being given by the legislature for no other reason but merely to benefit the lordi  this wardship so far as it related to land though it was not nor could be part of the law of feuds so long as they were arbitrary temporary or for life    only yet when they became hereditary and did consequently often descend upon infants who by reason of their age could neither perform nor stipulate for the services of the feud does not seem upon feodal principles to have been unreasonable for the wardship of the land or custody of the feud was retained by the lord that he might out of the profits thereof provide a fit person     to supply the infants services till he should be of age to perform them himself  and if we consider the feud in its original import as a stipend fee or reward for actual service it could not be thought hard that the lord should withhold the stipend so long as the service was suspended though undoubtedly to our english ancestors where such a stipendiary donation was a mere supposition or figment it carried abundance of hardship and accordingly it was relieved by the charter of henry i before mentioned which took this custody from the lord and ordained that the custody both of the land and the children should belong to the widow or next of kin but this noble immunity did not continue many years the wardship of the body was a consequence of the wardship of the land for he who enjoyed the infants estate was the properest person to educate and maintain him in his infancy and also in a political view the lord was most concerned to give his tenant suitable education in order to qualify him the better to perform those services which in his maturity he was bound to render when the male heir arrived to the age of twentyone or the heirfemale to that of sixteen they might sue out their livery or ousterlemaink that is the delivery of their lands out of their guardians hands for this they were obliged to pay a fine namely half a years profit of the land though this seems expressly contrary to magna cartal however in consideration of their lands having been so long in ward they were excused all reliefs and the kings tenants also all primer seisinsm in order to ascertain the profit that arose to the crown by these firstfruits of tenure and to grant the heir his livery the itinerant justices or justices in eyre had it formerly in charge to make inquisition concerning them by a jury of the countyn commonly called an inquisitio post mortem which was instituted to inquire at the death of any man of fortune the value of his estate the tenure by which it was     holden and who and of what age his heir was thereby to ascertain the relief and value of the primer seisin or the wardship and livery accruing to the king thereupon a manner of proceeding that came in process of time to be greatly abused and at length an intolerable grievance it being one of the principal accusations against empson and dudley the wicked engines of henry vii that by colour of false inquisitions they compelled many persons to sue out livery from the crown who by no means were tenants thereuntoo and afterwards a court of wards and liveries was erectedp for conducting the same inquiries in a more solemn and legal manner when the heir thus came of full age provided he held a knights fee in capite under the crown he was to receive the order of knighthood and was compellable to take it upon him or else pay a fine to the king for in those heroical times no person was qualified for deeds of arms and chivalry who had not received this order which was conferred with much preparation and solemnity we may plainly discover the footsteps of a similar custom in what tacitus    relates of the germans who in order to qualify their young men to bear arms presented them in a full assembly with a shield and lance which ceremony as was formerly hintedq is supposed to have been the original of the feodal knighthoodr this prerogative of compelling the kings vassals  to be knighted or to pay a fine was expressly recognised in parliament by the statute de militibus   edw ii was exerted as an expedient for raising money by many of our best princes particularly by edward vi and queen elizabeth but yet was the occasion of heavy murmurs when exerted by charles i among whose many misfortunes it was that neither himself nor his people seemed able to distinguish between the arbitrary stretch and the legal exertion of prerogative however among the other concessions made by   0 that unhappy prince before the fatal recourse to arms he agreed to divest himself of this undoubted power of the crown and it was accordingly abolished by statute    car i c  0   but before they came of age there was still another piece of authority which the guardian was at liberty to exercise over his infant wards i mean the right of marriage maritagium as contradistinguished from matrimony which in its feodal sense signifies the power which the lord or guardian in chivalry had of disposing of his infant ward in matrimony for while the infant was in ward the guardian had the power of tendering him or her a suitable match without disparagement or inequality which if the infants refused they forfeited the value of the marriage valorem maritagii to their guardians that is so much as a jury would assess or any one would bona fide give to the guardian for such an alliancet and if the infants married themselves without the guardians consent they forfeited double the value duplicem valorem maritagiiu  this seems to have been one of the greatest hardships of our ancient tenures there were indeed substantial reasons why the lord should have the restraint and control of the wards marriage especially of his female ward because of their tender years and the danger of such female wards intermarrying with the lords enemyw but no tolerable pretence could be assigned why the lord should have the sale or value of the marriage nor indeed is this claim of strictly feodal original the most probable account of it seeming to be this that by the custom of normandy the lords consent was necessary to the marriage of his female wardsx which was introduced into england together with the rest of the norman doctrine of feuds and it is likely that the lords usually took money for such their consent since in the oftencited charter of henry the first he engages for the future to take nothing for his consent which also he promises in general to give provided such female ward were not     married to his enemy but this among other beneficial parts of that charter being disregarded and guardians still continuing to dispose of their wards in a very arbitrary unequal manner it was provided by king johns great charter that heirs should be married without disparagement the next of kin having previous notice of the contracty or as it was expressed in the first draught of that charter ita maritentur ne disparagentur et per consilium propinquorum de consanguinitate suaz but these provisions in behalf of the relations were omitted in the charter of henry iii whereina the clause stands merely thus hæredes maritentur absque disparagatione meaning certainly by    hæredes heirs female as there are no traces before this to be found of the lords claiming the marriageb of heirsmale and as glanvillec expressly confines it to heirsfemale but the king and his great lords thenceforward took a handle from the ambiguity of this expression to claim them both sive sit masculus sive fœmina as bracton more than once expresses itd and also as nothing but disparagement was restrained by magna carta they thought themselves at liberty to make all other advantages that they coulde and afterwards this right of selling the ward in marriage or else receiving the price or value of it was expressly declared by the statute of mertonf which is the first direct mention of it that i have met with in our own or any other law    another attendant or consequence of tenure by knightservice was that of fines due to the lord for every alienation whenever the tenant had occasion to make over his land to another this depended on the nature of the feodal connection it not being reasonable or allowed as we have before seen that a feudatory should transfer his lords gift to another and substitute a new tenant to do the service in his own stead without the consent of the lord and as the feo    dal obligation was considered as reciprocal the lord also could not alienate his seignory without the consent of his tenant which consent of his was called an attornment this restraint upon the lords soon wore away that upon the tenants continued longer for when every thing came in process of time to be bought and sold the lords would not grant a license to their tenant to aliene without a fine being paid apprehending that if it was reasonable for the heir to pay a fine or relief on the renovation of his paternal estate it was much more reasonable that a stranger should make the same acknowledgment on his admission to a newlypurchased feud with us in england these fines seem only to have been exacted from the kings tenants in capite who were never able to aliene without a license but as to common persons they were at liberty by magna cartag 0 and the statute of quia emptoresh if not    earlier to aliene the whole of their estate to be holden of the same lord as they themselves held it of before but the kings tenants in capite not being included under the general words of these statutes could not aliene without a license for if they did it was in ancient strictness an absolute forfeiture of the landi though some have imagined otherwise but this severity was mitigated by the statute   edw iii c    which ordained that in such case the lands should not be forfeited but a reasonable fine be paid to the king upon which statute it was settled that onethird of the yearly value should be paid for a license of alienation but if the tenant presumed to aliene without a license a full years value should be paidk     the last consequence of tenure in chivalry was escheat which is the determination of the tenure or dissolution of the mutual bond between the lord and tenant from the extinction of the blood of the latter by either natural or civil means if he died without heirs of his blood or if his blood was corrupted and stained by commission of treason or felony   whereby every inheritable quality    was entirely blotted out     and abolished in such cases the lands escheated or fell back to the lord of the feel that is the tenure was determined by breach of the original condition expressed or implied in the feodal donation in the one case there were no heirs subsisting of the blood of the first feudatory or purchaser to which heirs alone the grant of the feud extended in the other the tenant by perpetrating an atrocious crime showed that he was no longer to be trusted as a vassal having forgotten his duty as a subject and therefore forfeited his feud which he held under the implied condition that he should not be a traitor or a felon the consequence of which in both cases was that the gift being determined resulted back to the lord who gave itm these were the principal qualities fruits and consequences of tenure by knightservice a tenure by which the greatest part of the lands in this kingdom were holden and that principally of the king in capite till the middle of the last century and which was created as sir edward coke expressly testifiesn for a military purpose viz for defence of the realm by the kings own principal subjects which was judged to be much better than to trust to hirelings or foreigners the description here given is that of a knights service proper which was to attend the king in his wars there were also some other species of knights service so called though improperly because the service or render was of a free and honourable nature and equally uncertain as to the time of rendering as that of knights service proper and because they were attended with similar fruits and consequences such was the tenure by grand serjeanty   per magnum servitium whereby the tenant was bound instead of serving the king generally in his wars to do some special honorary service to the king in person   as to carry his banner his sword or the like or to be his butler champion or other officer at his coronationo it was in most other respects like knightservicep only he was not bound to pay aidq or escuager     and when tenant by knightservice paid five pounds for a relief on every knights fee tenant by grand serjeanty paid one years value of his land were it much or littles tenure by cornage   which was to wind a horn when the scots or other enemies entered the land in order to warn    the kings subjects was like other services of the same nature a species of grand serjeantyt these services both of chivalry and grand serjeanty were all personal and uncertain as to their quantity or duration but the personal attendance in knightservice growing troublesome and inconvenient in many respects the tenants found means of compounding for it by first sending others in their stead and in process of time making a pecuniary satisfaction to the lords in lieu of it this pecuniary satisfaction at last came to be levied by assessments at so much for every knights fee and therefore this kind of tenure was called scutagium in latin or servitium scuti scutum being then a wellknown denomination for money and in like manner it was called in our norman french escuage being indeed a pecuniary instead of a military service   the first time this appears to have been taken was in the   hen ii on account of his expedition to toulouse but it soon came to be so universal that personal attendance fell quite into disuse hence we find in our ancient histories that from this period when our kings went to war they levied scutages on their tenants that is on all the landholders of the kingdom to defray their expenses and to hire troops and these assessments in the time of henry ii seem to have been made arbitrarily and at the kings pleasure which prerogative being greatly abused by his successors it became matter of national clamour and king john was obliged to consent by his magna carta that no scutage should be imposed without consent of parliamentu but this clause was omitted in his son henry iiis charter where we only findw that scutages     or escuage should be taken as they were used to be taken in the time of henry ii that is in a reasonable and moderate manner yet afterwards by statute    edw i c     and many subsequent statutesx it was again provided that the king should take no aids or tasks but by the common assent of the realm hence it was held in our old books that escuage or scutage could not be levied but by consent of parliamenty such scutages being indeed the groundwork of all succeeding subsidies and the landtax of later times since therefore escuage differed from knightservice in nothing but as a compensation differs from actual service knightservice is frequently confounded with it and thus littletonz must be understood when he tells us that tenant by homage fealty and escuage was tenant by knightservice that is that this tenure being subservient to the military policy of the nation was respecteda as a tenure in chivalryb but as the actual service was uncertain and depended upon emergencies so it was necessary that this pecuniary compensation should be equally uncertain and depend on the assessments of the legislature suited to those emergencies for had the escuage been a settled invariable sum payable at certain times it had been neither more nor less than a mere pecuniary rent and the tenure instead of knightservice would have then been of another kind called socagec of which we shall speak in the next chapter for the present i have only to observe that by the degenerating of knightservice or personal military duty into escuage or pecuniary assessments all the advantages either promised or real of the feodal constitution were destroyed    and nothing but the hardships remained instead of forming a national militia composed of barons knights and gentlemen bound by their interest their honour and their oaths to defend their king and country the whole of this system of     tenures now tended to nothing else but a wretched means of raising money to pay an army of occasional mercenaries in the mean time the families of all our nobility and gentry groaned under the intolerable burthens which in consequence of the fiction adopted after the conquest were introduced and laid upon them by the subtlety and finesse of the norman lawyers for besides the scutages to which they were liable in defect of personal attendance which however were assessed by themselves in parliament they might be called upon by the king or lord paramount for aids whenever his eldest son was to be knighted or his eldest daughter married not to forget the ransom of his own person the heir on the death of his ancestor if of full age was plundered of the first emoluments arising from his inheritance by way of relief and primer seisin and if under age of the whole of his estate during infancy and then as sir thomas smithd very feelingly complains when he came to his own after he was out of wardship his woods decayed houses fallen down stock wasted and gone lands let forth and ploughed to be barren to reduce him still further he was yet to pay half a years profits as a fine for suing out his livery and also the price or value of his marriage if he refused such wife as his lord and guardian had bartered for and imposed upon him or twice that value if he married another woman add to this the untimely and expensive honour of knighthood to make his poverty more completely splendid and when by these deductions his fortune was so shattered and ruined that perhaps he was obliged to sell his patrimony he had not even that poor privilege allowed him without paying an exorbitant fine for a license of alienation a slavery so complicated and so extensive as this called aloud for a remedy in a nation that boasted of its freedom palliatives were from time to time applied by successive acts of parliament which assuaged some temporary grievances till at length the humanity of king james i consentede in consideration of a proper equivalent to abolish them all though the plan     proceeded not to effect in like manner as he had formed a scheme and begun to put it in execution for removing the feodal grievance of heritable jurisdiction in scotlandf which has since been pursued and effected by the statute geo ii c   g king jamess plan for exchanging our military tenures seems to have been nearly the same as that which has been since pursued only with this difference that by way of compensation for the loss which the crown and other lords would sustain an annual feefarm rent was to have been settled and inseparably annexed to the crown and assured to the inferior lords payable out of every knights fee within their respective seignories an expedient seemingly much better than the hereditary excise which was afterwards made the principal equivalent for these concessions for at length the military tenures with all their heavy appendages having during the usurpation been discontinued were destroyed at one blow by the statute    car ii c    which enacts that the court of wards and liveries and all wardships liveries primer seisins and ousterlemains values and forfeitures of marriage by reason of any tenure of the king or others be totally taken away and that all fines for alienation tenures by homage knightservice and escuage and also aids for marrying the daughter or knighting the son and all tenures of the king in capite be likewise taken away   and that all sorts of tenures held of the king or    others be turned into free and common socage save only tenures in frankalmoign copyhold and the honorary services without the slavish part of grand serjeanty a statute which was a greater acquisition to the civil property of this kingdom than even magna carta itself since that only pruned the luxuriances that had grown out of the military tenures and thereby preserved them in vigour but the statute of king charles extirpated the whole and demolished both root and branches chapter vi of the modern english tenures although by the means that were mentioned in the preceding chapter the oppressive or military part of the feodal constitution itself was happily done away yet we are not to imagine that the constitution itself was utterly laid aside and a new one introduced in its room since by the statute    car ii the tenures of socage and frankalmoign the honorary services of grand serjeanty and the tenure by copy of courtroll were reserved nay all tenures in general except frankalmoign grand serjeanty and copyhold were reduced to one general species of tenure then well known and subsisting called free and common socage and this being sprung from the same feodal original as the rest demonstrates the necessity of fully contemplating that ancient system since it is that alone to which we can recur to explain any seeming or real difficulties that may arise in our present mode of tenure     the military tenure or that by knightservice consisted of what were reputed the most free and honourable services but which in their nature were unavoidably uncertain in respect to the time of their performance the second species of tenure or free socage consisted also of free and honourable services but such as were liquidated and reduced to an absolute certainty and this tenure not only subsists to     this day but has in a manner absorbed and swallowed up since the statute of charles the second almost every other species of tenure and to this we are next to proceed ii socage in its most general and extensive signification seems to denote a tenure by any certain and determinate service and in this sense it is by our ancient writers constantly put in opposition to chivalry or knightservice where the render was precarious and uncertain thus bractona if a man holds by rent in money without any escuage or serjeantry id tenementum dici potest socagium but if you add thereto any royal service or escuage to any the smallest amount illud dici poterit feodum militare so too the author of fletab ex donationibus servitia militaria vel magnæ serjantiæ non continentibus oritur nobis quoddam nomen generale quod est socagium littleton also cdefines it to be where the tenant holds his tenement of the lord by any certain service in lieu of all other services so that they be not services of chivalry or knightservice and therefore afterwardsd he tells us that whatsoever is not tenure in chivalry is tenure in socage in like manner as it is defined by finche a tenure to be done out of war the service must therefore be certain in order to denominate it socage as to hold by fealty and  0s rent or by homage fealty and  0s rent or by homage and fealty without rent or by fealty and certain corporal service as ploughing the lords land for three days or by fealty only without any other service for all these are tenures in socagef but socage as was hinted in the last chapter is of two sorts freesocage where the services are not only certain but honourable and villeinsocage where the services though certain are of a baser nature such as hold by the former tenure are called in glanvilg and other subsequent authors by the name of liberi sokemanni or tenants in freesocage of this tenure we are first to speak and this both in the   0 nature of its service and the fruits and consequences appertaining thereto was always by much the most free and independent species of any and therefore i cannot but assent to mr somners etymology of the wordh who derives it from the saxon appellation soc which signifies liberty or privilege and being joined to a usual termination is called socage in latin socagium signifying thereby a free or privileged tenurei this etymology seems to be much more just than that of our common lawyers in general who derive it from soca an old latin word denoting as they tell us a plough for that in ancient time this socage tenure consisted in nothing else but services of husbandry which the tenant was bound to do to his lord as to plough sow or reap for him but that in process of time this service was changed into an annual rent by consent of all parties and that in memory of its original it still retains the name of socage or ploughservicek but this by no means agrees with what littleton himself tells usl that to hold  0 by fealty only without paying any rent is tenure in socage for here is plainly no commutation for ploughservice besides even services confessedly of a military nature and original as escuage which while it remained uncertain was equivalent to knightservice the instant they were reduced to a certainty changed both their name and nature and were called socagem it was the certainty therefore that denominated it a socage tenure and nothing sure could be a greater liberty or privilege than to have the service ascertained and not left to the arbitrary calls of the lord as the tenures of chivalry wherefore also britton who describes lands in socage tenure under the name of fraunke fermen tells us that they are lands and tenements whereof the nature of the fee is changed by feoffment out of chivalry for certain yearly services and in respect whereof neither homage ward marriage nor relief can be demanded which leads us also to another observation that if socage tenures were of such base and servile     original it is hard to account for the very great immunities which the tenants of them always enjoyed so highly superior to those of the tenants by chivalry that it was thought in the reigns of both edward i and charles ii a point of the utmost importance and value to the tenants to reduce the tenure by knightservice to fraunke ferme or tenure by socage we may therefore i think fairly conclude in favour of somners etymology and the liberal extraction of the tenure in freesocage against the authority even of littleton himself     taking this then to be the meaning of the word it seems probable that the socage tenures were the relics of saxon liberty retained by such persons as had neither forfeited them to the king nor been obliged to exchange their tenure for the more honourable as it was called but at the same time more burthensome tenure of knightservice this is peculiarly remarkable in the tenure which prevails in kent called gavelkind which is generally acknowledged to be a species of socage tenureo the preservation whereof inviolate from the innovations of the norman conqueror is a fact universally known and those who thus preserved their liberties were said to hold in free and common socage as therefore the grand criterion and distinguishing mark of this species of tenure are the having its renders or services ascertained it will include under it all other methods of holding free lands by certain and invariable rents and duties and in particular petit serjeanty tenure in burgage and gavelkind we may remember that by the statute    car ii grand serjeanty is not itself totally abolished but only the slavish appendages belonging to it for the honorary services such as carrying the kings sword or banner officiating as his butler carver c at the coronation are still reserved now petit serjeanty bears a great resemblance to grand serjeanty for as the one is a personal service so the other is a rent or render both tending to some purpose relative to the kings per    son petit serjeanty as defined by littletonp consists in holding lands of the king by the service of rendering to him annually some small implement of war as a bow a sword a lance an arrow or the like this he saysq is but socage in effect for it is no personal service but a certain rent and we may add it is clearly no predial service or service of the plough but in all respects liberum et commune socagium only being held of the king it is by way of eminence dignified with the title of parvum servitium regis or petit serjeanty and magna carta respected it in this light when it enactedr that no wardship of the lands or body should be claimed by the king in virtue of a tenure by petit serjeanty  tenure in burgage is described by glanvils and is expressly said by littletont to be but tenure in socage and it is where the king or other person is lord of an ancient borough in which the tenements are held by a rent certainu it is indeed only a kind of town socage as common socage by which other lands are holden is usually of a rural nature a borough as we have formerly seen is usually distinguished from other towns by the right of sending members to parliament and where the right of election is by burgage tenure that alone is a proof of the antiquity of the borough tenure in burgage therefore or burgage tenure is where houses or lands which were formerly the site of houses in an ancient borough are held of some lord in common socage by a certain established rent and these seem to have withstood the shock of the norman encroachments principally on account of their insignificancy which made it not worth while to compel them to an alteration of tenure as    an hundred of them put together would scarce have amounted to a knights fee besides the owners of them being chiefly artificers and persons engaged in trade could not with any tolerable propriety be put on such a military establishment as the tenure in chivalry was and here also we have again an instance where a tenure is confessedly in socage and yet could not possibly ever have been held by ploughservice since the te    nants must have been citizens or burghers the situation frequently a walled town the tenements a single house so that none of the owners was probably master of a plough or was able to use one if he had it the free socage therefore in which these tenements are held seems to be plainly a remnant of saxon liberty which may also account for the great variety of customs affecting many of these tenements so held in ancient burgage the principal and most remarkable of which is that called borough english  so named in contradistinction as it were to the norman customs and which is taken notice of by glanvilw and by littletonx viz that the youngest son and not the eldest succeeds to the burgage tenement on the death of his father for which littletony gives this reason because the younger son by reason of his tender age is not so capable as the rest of his brethren to help himself other authorsz have indeed given a much stranger reason for this custom as if the lord of the fee had antiently a right of concubinage with his tenants wife on her weddingnight and that therefore the tenement descended not to the eldest but the youngest son who was more certainly the offspring of the tenant but i cannot learn that ever this custom prevailed in england though it certainly did in scotland under the name of mercheta or marcheta till abolished by malcolm iiia and perhaps a more rational account than either may be fetched though at a sufficient distance from the practice of the tartars among whom according to father duhalde this custom of descent to the youngest son also prevails that nation is composed totally of shepherds and herdsmen and the elder sons as soon as they are capable of leading a pastoral life migrate from their father with a certain allotment of cattle and go to seek a new habitation the youngest son therefore who continues latest with his father is naturally the heir of his house the rest being already provided for and thus we find that among many other northern nations it was the custom for all the sons but one to migrate from the father which one be    came his heirb so that possibly this custom wherever it prevails may be the remnant of that pastoral state of our british and german ancestors which cæsar and tacitus describe other special customs there are in different burgage tenures as that in some the wife shall be endowed of all her husbands tenementsc and not of the third part only as at the common law and that in others a man might dispose of his tenements by willd which in general was not permitted after the conquest till the reign of henry the eighth though in the saxon times it was allowablee a pregnant proof that these liberties of socage tenure were fragments of saxon liberty     the nature of the tenure in gavelkind  affords us a still stronger argument it is universally known what struggles the kentish men made to preserve their ancient liberties and with how much success those struggles were attended  and as it is principally here that we meet with the custom of gavelkind though it was and is to be found in some other parts of the kingdomf we may fairly conclude that this was a part of those liberties agreeably to mr seldens opinion that gavelkind before the norman conquest was the general custom of the realmg the distinguishing properties of this tenure are various some of the principal are these   the tenant is of age sufficient to aliene his estate by feoffment at the age of fifteenh   the estate does not escheat in case of an attainder and execution for felony their maxim being the father to the bough the son to the ploughi    in most places he had a power of devising lands by will before the statute for that purpose was madek   the lands descend not to the eldest youngest or any one son only but to all the sons togetherl which was indeed anciently the most usual     course of descent all over englandm though in particular places particular customs prevailed  these among other properties distinguished this tenure in a    most remarkable manner and yet it is said to be only a species of a socage tenure modified by the custom of the country the lands being holden by suit of court and fealty which is a service in its nature certainn wherefore by a charter of king johno hubert archbishop of canterbury was authorized to exchange the gavelkind tenures holden of the see of canterbury into tenures by knights service and by statute    hen viii c   for disgavelling the lands of divers lords and gentlemen in the county of kent they are directed to be descendible for the future like other lands which were never holden by service of socage now the immunities which the tenants in gavelkind enjoyed were such as we cannot conceive should be conferred upon mere ploughmen and peasants from all which i think it sufficiently clear that tenures in free socage are in general of a nobler original than is assigned by littleton and after him by the bulk of our common lawyers having thus distributed and distinguished the several species of tenure in free socage i proceed next to show that this also partakes very strongly of the feodal nature which may probably arise from its ancient saxon original since as was before observedp feuds were not unknown among the saxons though they did not form a part of their military policy nor were drawn out into such arbitrary consequences as among the normans it seems therefore reasonable to imagine that socage tenure existed in much the same state before the conquest as after that in kent it was preserved with a high hand as our histories inform us it was and that the rest of the socage tenures dispersed through england escaped the general fate of other property partly out of favour and affection to their particular owners and partly from their own insignificancy since i do not apprehend the number of socage tenures soon after the conquest to have been very considerable nor their value by any means large till by successive     charters of enfranchisement granted to the tenants which are particularly mentioned by brittonq their number and value began to swell so far as to make a distinct and justly envied part of our english tenures however this may be the tokens of their feodal original will evidently appear from a short comparison of the incidents and consequences of socage tenure with those of tenure in chivalry remarking their agreement or difference as we go along   in the first place then both were held of superior lords one of the king either immediately or as lord paramount and in the latter case of a subject or mesne lord between the king and his tenant   both were subject to the feodal return render rent or service of some sort or other which arose from a supposition of an original grant from the lord to the tenant in the military tenure or more proper feud this was from its nature uncertain in socage which was a feud of the improper kind it was certain fixed and determinate though perhaps nothing more than bare fealty and so continues to this day   both were from their constitution universally subject over and above all other renders to the oath of fealty or mutual bond of obligation between the lord and tenantr which oath of fealty usually draws after it suit to the lords court and this oath every lord of whom tenements are holden at this day may and ought to call upon his tenants to take in his courtbaron if it be    only for the reason given by littletons that if it be neglected it will by long continuance of time grow out of memory as doubtless it frequently hath done whether the land be holden of the lord or not and so he may lose his seignory and the profit which may accrue to him by escheats and other contingenciest   the tenure in socage was subject of common right to aids for knighting the son and marrying the eldest daugh    teru which were fixed by the statute of westm   c    at  0s for every  0l per annum so held as in knightservice these aids as in tenure by chivalry were originally mere benevolences though afterwards claimed as matter of right but were all abolished by the statute    car ii   relief is due upon socage tenure as well as upon tenure in chivalry but the manner of taking it is very different the relief on a knights fee was  l or one quarter of the supposed value of the land but a socage relief is one years rent or render payable by the tenant to the lord be the same either great or smallw and therefore bractonx will not allow this to be properly a relief but quædam præstatio loco relevii in recognitionem domini so too the statute    edw i c   declares that a free sokeman shall give no relief but shall double his rent after the death of his ancestor according to that which he hath used to pay his lord and shall not be grieved about measure reliefs in knightservice were only payable if the heir at the death of his ancestor was of full age but in socage they were due even though the heir was under age because the lord has no wardship over himy the statute of charles ii reserves the reliefs incident to socage tenures and therefore wherever lands in feesimple are holden by a rent relief is still due of common right upon the death of a tenantz   primer seisin was incident to the kings socage tenants in capite as well as to those by knightservicea but tenancy in capite as well as primer seisins are among the other feodal burthens entirely abolished by the statute   wardship is also incident to tenure in socage but of a nature very different from that incident to knightservice for if the inheritance descend to an infant under fourteen the wardship of him does not nor ever did belong to the lord of the fee because in this tenure no military or     other personal service being required there was no occasion for the lord to take the profits in order to provide a proper substitute for his infant tenant but his nearest relation to whom the inheritance cannot descend shall be his guardian in socage and have the custody of his land and body till he arrives at the age of fourteen the guardian must be such a one to whom the inheritance by no possibility can descend 0 as was fully explained together with the reasons for    it in the former book of these commentariesb at fourteen this wardship in socage ceases and the heir may oust the guardian and call him to account for the rents and profitsc for at this age the law supposes him capable of choosing a guardian for himself it was in this particular of wardship as also in that of marriage and in the certainty of the render of service that the socage tenures had so much the advantage of the military ones but as the wardship ceased at fourteen there was this disadvantage attending it—that young heirs being left at so tender an age to choose their own guardians till twentyone might make an improvident choice therefore when almost all the lands in the kingdom were turned into socage tenures the same statute    car ii c    enacted that it should be in the power of any father by will to appoint a guardian till his child should attain the age of twentyone and if no such appointment be made the court of chancery will frequently interpose and name a guardian to prevent an infant heir from improvidently exposing himself to ruin   marriage or the valor maritagii was not in socage tenure any perquisite or advantage to the guardian but rather the reverse for if the guardian married his ward under the age of fourteen he was bound to account to the ward for the value of the marriage even though he took nothing for it unless he married him to advantaged for the law in favour of infants is always jealous of guardians and therefore in this case it made them account not only for what they did but also for what they might receive on the infants behalf     lest by some collusion the guardian should have received the value and not brought it to account but the statute having destroyed all values of marriages this doctrine of course hath ceased with them at fourteen years of age the ward might have disposed of himself in marriage without any consent of his guardian till the late act for preventing clandestine marriages these doctrines of wardship and marriage in socage tenure were so diametrically opposite to those in knightservice and so entirely agree with those parts of king edwards laws that were restored by henry the firsts charter as might alone convince us that socage was of a higher original than the norman conquest   fines for alienation were i apprehend due for lands holden of the king in capite by socage tenure as well as in case of tenure by knightservice for the statutes that relate to this point and sir edward cokes comment on theme speak generally of all tenants in capite without making any distinction    but now all fines for alienation are demolished by the statute of charles the second  0 escheats are equally incident to tenure in socage as they were to tenure by knightservice except only in gavelkind lands which are as is before mentioned subject to no escheats for felony though they are to escheats for want of heirsf thus much for the two grand species of tenure under which almost all the free lands of the kingdom were holden till the restoration in    0 when the former was abolished and sunk into the latter so that the lands of both sorts are now holden by one universal tenure of free and common socage the other grand division of tenure mentioned by bracton as cited in the preceding chapter is that of villenage as contradistinguished from liberum tenementum or frank tenure and this we may remember he subdivided into two classes pure and privileged villenage from whence have arisen two other species of our modern tenures   0 iii from the tenure of pure villenage have sprung our present copyhold tenures or tenure by copy of courtroll at the will of the lord in order to obtain a clear idea of which it will be previously necessary to take a short view of the original and nature of manors manors are in substance as ancient as the saxon constitution though perhaps different a little in some immaterial circumstances from those that exist at this dayg just as we observed of feuds that they were partly known to our ancestors even before the norman conquest a manor manerium a manendo   because the usual residence of the owner seems to have been a district of ground held by lords or great personages who kept in their own hands so much land as was necessary for the use of their families which were called terræ dominicales or demesne lands being occupied by the lord or dominus manerii and his servants the other or tenemental lands they distributed among their tenants which from the different modes of tenure were distinguished by two different names first bookland or charterland which was held by deed under certain rents and free services and in effect differed nothing from the freesocage landsh and from hence have arisen most of the freehold tenants who hold of particular manors and owe suit and service to the same the other species was called folkland which was held by no assurance in writing but distributed among the common folk or people at the pleasure of the lord and resumed at his discretion being indeed land held in villenage which we shall presently describe more at large the residue of the manor being uncultivated was termed the lords waste and served for public roads and for common or pasture to the lord and his tenants manors were formerly called baronies as they are still lordships and each lord or baron was empowered to hold a domestic court called the courtbaron for redressing misdemesnors and nuisances within the manor and for settling disputes of property among the tenants this court is an inseparable ingredient of every manor and if the number     of suitors should so fail as not to leave sufficient to make a jury or homage that is two tenants at least the manor itself is lost      in the early times of our legal constitution the kings greater barons who had a large extent of territory held under the crown granted out frequently smaller manors to inferior persons to be holden of themselves which do therefore now continue to be held under a superior lord who is called in such cases the lord paramount over all these manors and his seignory is frequently termed an honour not a manor especially if it hath belonged to an ancient feodal baron or hath been at any time in the hands of the crown in imitation whereof these inferior lords began to carve out and grant to others still more minute estates to be held as of themselves and were so proceeding downwards in infinitum till the superior lords observed that by this method of subinfeudation they lost all their feodal profits of wardships marriages and escheats which fell into the hands of these mesne or middle lords who were the immediate superiors of the terretenant or him who occupied the land and also that the mesne lords themselves were so impoverished thereby that they were disabled from performing their services to their own superiors this occasioned first that provision in the thirtysecond chapter of magna carta   hen iii which is not to be found in the first charter granted by that prince nor in the great charter of king johni that no man should either give or sell his land without reserving sufficient to answer the demand of his lord and afterwards the statute of westm   or quia emptores    edw i c   which directs that upon all sales or feoffments of land the feoffee shall hold the same not of his immediate feoffor but of the chief lord of the fee of whom such feoffor himself held it   but these provisions not extending to the kings own tenants in capite the like law concerning them is declared by the statutes of prerogativa regis    edw ii c   and of    edw iii c    by which last all subinfeudations previous to the reign of king     edward i were confirmed but all subsequent to that period were left open to the kings prerogative and from hence it is clear that all manors existing at this day must have existed as early as king edward the first for it is essential to a manor that there be tenants who hold of the lord and by the operation of these statutes no tenant in capite since the accession of that prince and no tenant of a common lord since the statute of quia emptores could create any new tenants to hold of himself now with regard to the folkland or estates held in villenage this was a species of tenure neither strictly feodal norman or saxon but mixed and compounded of them allk and which also on account of the heriots that usually attend it may seem to have somewhat danish in its composition under the saxon government there were as sir william temple speaksl a sort of people in a condition of downright servitude used and employed in the most servile works and belonging both they their children and effects to the lord of the soil like the rest of the cattle or stock upon it these seem to have been those who held what was called the folkland from which they were removable at the lords pleasure on the arrival of the normans here it seems not improbable that they who were strangers to any other than a feodal state might give some sparks of enfranchisement to such wretched persons as fell to their share by admitting them as well as others to the oath of fealty which conferred a right of protection and raised the tenant to a kind of estate superior to downright slavery but inferior to every other conditionm this they called villenage and the tenants villeins either from the word vilis or else as sir edward coke tells usn a villa because they lived chiefly in villages and were employed in rustic works of the most sordid kind resembling the spartan helotes to whom alone the culture of the lands were consigned their rugged    masters like our northern ancestors esteeming war the only honourable employment of mankind     these villeins belonging principally to lords of manors were either villeins regardant that is annexed to the manor or land or else they were in gross or at large that is annexed to the person of the lord and transferable by deed from one owner to anothero they could not leave their lord without his permission but if they ran away or were purloined from him might be claimed and recovered by action like beasts or other chattels they held indeed small portions of land by way of sustaining themselves and families but it was at the mere will of the lord who might dispossess them whenever he pleased and it was upon villein services that is to carry out dung to hedge and ditch the lords demesnes and any other the meanest officesp and their services were not only base but uncertain both as to their time and quantityq a villein in short was in much the same state with us as lord molesworthr describes to be that of the boors in denmark and which stiernhooks attributes also to the traals or slaves in sweden which confirms the probability of their being in some degree monuments of the danish tyranny a villein could acquire no property either in lands or goods but if he purchased either the lord might enter upon them oust the villein and seize them to his own use unless he contrived to dispose of them again before the lord had seized them for the lord had then lost his opportunityt in many places also a fine was payable to the lord if the villein presumed to marry his daughter to any one without leave from the lordu and by the common law the lord might also bring an action against the husband for damages in thus purloining his propertyw for the children of villeins were also in the same state of bondage with their pa    rents whence they were called in latin nativi which gave rise to the female appellation of a villein who was called a neifex in case of a marriage between a freeman and a neife or a villein and a freewoman the issue followed the condition of the father being free if he was free and villein if he was villein contrary to the maxim of the civil law that partus sequitur ventrem but no bastard could be born a villein because by another maxim in our law he is nullius filius and as he can gain nothing by inheritance it were hard that he should lose his natural freedom by ity the law however protected the persons of villeins as the kings subjects against atrocious injuries of the lord for he might not kill or maim his villeinz though he might beat him with impunity since the villein had no action or remedy at law against his lord but in case of the murder of his ancestor or the maim of his own person   neifes indeed had also an appeal of rape in case the lord violated them by forcea villeins might be enfranchised by manumission which is either express or implied express as where a man granted to the villein a deed of manumissionb implied as where a man bound himself in a bond to his villein for a sum of money granted him an annuity by deed or gave him an estate in fee for life or yearsc for this was dealing with his villein on the footing of a freeman it was in some of the instances giving him an action against his lord and in others    vesting in him an ownership entirely inconsistent with his former state of bondage so also if the lord brought an action against his villein this enfranchised himd for as the lord might have a short remedy against his villein by seizing his goods which was more than equivalent to any damages he could recover the law which is always ready to catch at any thing in favour of liberty presumed that by bringing this action he meant to set his villein on the same footing with himself and therefore held it an implied     manumission but in case the lord indicted him for felony it was otherwise for the lord could not inflict a capital punishment on his villein without calling in the assistance of the law villeins by these and many other means in process of time gained considerable ground on their lords and in particular strengthened the tenure of their estates to that degree that they came to have in them an interest in many places full as good in others better than their lords for the good nature and benevolence of many lords of manors having time out of mind permitted their villeins and their children to enjoy their possessions without interruption in a regular course of descent the common law of which custom is the life now gave them title to prescribe against their lords and on performance of the same services to hold their lands in spite of any determination of the lords will for though in general they are still said to hold their estates at the will of the lord yet it is such a will as is agreeable to the custom of the manor which customs are preserved and evidenced by the rolls of the several courtsbaron in which they are entered or kept on foot by the constant immemorial usage of the several manors in which the lands lie and as such tenants had nothing to show for their estates but these customs and admissions in pursuance of them entered on those rolls or the copies of such entries witnessed by the steward they now began to be called tenants by copy of courtroll and their tenure itself a copyholde thus copyhold tenures as sir edward coke observesf although very meanly descended yet come of an ancient house for from what has been premised it appears that copyholders are in truth no other but villeins who by a long series of immemorial encroachments on the lord have at last established a customary right to those estates which before were held absolutely at the lords will   which     affords a very substantial reason for the great variety of customs that prevail in different manors with regard both to the descent of the estates and the privileges belonging to the tenants and these encroachments grew to be so universal that when tenure in villenage was virtually abolished though copyholds were reserved by the statute of charles ii there was hardly a pure villein left in the nation for sir thomas smithg testifies that in all his time and he was secretary to edward vi he never knew any villein in gross throughout the realm and the few villeins regardant that were then remaining were such only as had belonged to bishops monasteries    or other ecclesiastical corporations in the preceding times of popery for he tells us that the holy fathers monks and friars had in their confessions and especially in their extreme and deadly sickness convinced the laity how dangerous a practice it was for one christian man to hold another in bondage so that temporal men by little and little by reason of that terror in their consciences were glad to manumit all their villeins but the said holy fathers with the abbots and priors did not in like sort by theirs for they also had a scruple in conscience to impoverish and despoil the church so much as to manumit such as were bond to their churches or to the manors which the church had gotten and so kept their villeins still   by these several means the generality of villeins in the kingdom have long ago sprouted up into copyholders their persons being enfranchised by manumission or long acquiescence but their estates in strictness remaining subject to the same servile conditions and forfeitures as before though in general the villein services are usually commuted for a small pecuniary quitrenth     as a further consequence of what has been premised we may collect these two main principles which are heldi to be the supporters of the copyhold tenure and without which it cannot exist   that the lands be parcel of and situate within that manor under which it is held   that they have been demised or demisable by copy of courtroll immemorially for immemorial custom is the life of all tenures by copy so that no new copyhold can strictly speaking be granted at this day   in some manors where the custom hath been to permit the heir to succeed the ancestor in his tenure the estates are styled copyholds of inheritance in others where the lords have been more vigilant to maintain their rights they remain copyholds for life only for the custom of the manor has in both cases so far superseded the will of the lord that provided the services be performed or stipulated for by fealty he cannot in the first instance refuse to admit the heir of his tenant upon his death nor in the second can he remove his present tenant so long as he lives though he holds nominally by the precarious tenure of his lords will      the fruits and appendages of a copyhold tenure that it hath in common with free tenures are fealty services as well in rents as otherwise reliefs and escheats the two latter belong only to copyholds of inheritance the former to those for life also but besides these copyholds have also heriots wardship and fines heriots which i think are agreed to be a danish custom and of which we shall say more hereafterj are a render of the best beast or other good as the custom may be to the lord on the death of the tenant this is plainly a relic of villein tenure there being originally less hardship in it when all the goods and chattels belonged to the lord and he might have seized them even in the villeins lifetime these are incident to both species of copyhold but wardship and fines to those of inheritance only wardship in copyhold estates par    takes both of that in chivalry and that in socage like that in chivalry the lord is the legal guardian 0 who usually assigns some relation of the infant tenant to act in his stead and he like the guardian in socage is accountable to his ward for the profits   of fines some are in the    nature of primer seisins due on the death of each tenant others are mere fines for the alienation of the lands in some manors only one of these sorts can be demanded in some both and in others neither they are sometimes arbitrary and at the will of the lord sometimes fixed by custom but even when arbitrary the courts of law in favour of the liberty of copyholds have tied them down to be reasonable in their extent otherwise they might amount to a disherison of the estate   no fine therefore is allowed to be taken upon descents and alienations unless in particular circumstances of more than two years improved value of the estatek from this instance we may judge of the favourable disposition that the law of england which is a law of liberty hath always shown to this species of tenants by removing as far as possible every real badge of slavery from them however some nominal ones may continue it suffered custom very early to get the better of the express terms upon which they held their lands by declaring that the will of the lord was to be interpreted by the custom of the manor and where no custom has been suffered to grow up to the prejudice of the lord as in this case of arbitrary fines the law itself interposes with an equitable moderation and will not suffer the lord to extend his power so far as to disinherit the tenant thus much for the ancient tenure of pure villenage and the modern one of copyhold at the will of the lord which is lineally descended from it iv there is yet a fourth species of tenure described by bracton under the name sometimes of privileged villenage and sometimes of villeinsocage this he tells usl is such as has been held of the kings of england from the conquest     downwards that the tenants herein villana faciunt servitia sed certa et determinata that they cannot aliene or transfer their tenements by grant or feoffment any more than pure villeins can but must surrender them to the lord or his steward to be again granted out and held in villenage and from these circumstances we may collect that what he here describes is no other than an exalted species of copyhold subsisting at this day viz the tenure in antient demesne to which as partaking of the baseness of villenage in the nature of its services and the freedom of socage in their certainty he has therefore given a name compounded out of both and calls it villanum socagium antient demesne consists of those lands or manors which though now perhaps granted out to private subjects were actually in the hands of the crown in the time of edward the confessor or william the conqueror and so appear to have been by the great survey in the exchequer called domesdaybookm the tenants of these lands under the crown were not all of the same order or degree some of them as britton testifiesn continued for a long time pure and absolute villeins dependent on the will of the lord and those who have succeeded them in their tenures now differ from common copyholders in only a few pointso others were in a great measure enfranchised by the royal favour being only bound in respect of their lands to perform some of the better sort of villein services but those determinate and certain as to plough the kings land    for so many days to supply his court with such a quantity of provisions or other stated services all of which are now changed into pecuniary rents and in consideration hereof they had many immunities and privileges granted to themp as to try the right of their property in a peculiar court of their own called a court of antient demesne by a peculiar process denominated a writ of right closeq   not to pay toll or taxes not to contribute to the expenses of knights of the shire not to be put on juries and the liker   00 these tenants therefore though their tenure be absolutely copyhold yet have an interest equivalent to a freehold for notwithstanding their services were of a base and villenous originals yet the tenants were esteemed in all other respects to be highly privileged villeins and especially for that their services were fixed and determinate and that they could not be compelled like pure villeins to relinquish these tenements at the lords will or to hold them against their own et ideo says bracton dicuntur liberi britton also from such their freedom calls them absolutely sokemans and their tenure sokemanries which he describest to be lands and tenements which are not held by knightservice nor by grand serjeanty nor by petit but by simple services being as it were lands enfranchised by the king or his predecessors from their antient demesne and the same name is also given them in fletau hence fitzherbert observesw that no lands are antient demesne but lands holden in socage that is not in free and common socage but in this amphibious subordinate class of villeinsocage and it is possible that as this species of socage tenure is plainly founded upon predial services or services of the plough it may have given cause to imagine that all socage tenures arose from the same original for want of distinguishing with bracton between free socage or socage of franktenure and villeinsocage or socage of antient demesne lands holden by this tenure are therefore a species of copyhold and as such preserved and exempted from the operation of the statute of charles ii yet they differ from common copyholds principally in the privileges before mentioned as also they differ from freeholders by one special mark and tincture of villenage noted by bracton and remaining to this day viz that they cannot be conveyed from man to man by the general commonlaw conveyances of feoffment and the rest but must pass by surrender to the lord or his steward in the manner of common copyholds   0  yet with this distinctionx that in the surrender of these lands in antient demesne it is not used to say to hold at the will of the lord in their copies but only to hold according to the custom of the manor    0  thus have we taken a compendious view of the principal and fundamental points of the doctrine of tenures both antient and modern in which we cannot but remark the mutual connection and dependence that all of them have upon each other and upon the whole it appears that whatever changes and alterations these tenures have in process of time undergone from the saxon era to    car ii all lay tenures are now in effect reduced to two species free tenure in common socage and base tenure by copy of courtroll i mentioned lay tenures only because there is still behind one other species of tenure reserved by the statute of charles ii which is of a spiritual nature and called the tenure in frankalmoign v tenure in frankalmoign in libera eleemosyna or free alms is that whereby a religious corporation aggregate or sole holdeth lands of the donor to them and their successors forevery the service which they were bound to render for these lands was not certainly defined but only in general to pray for the soul of the donor and his heirs dead or alive and therefore they did no fealty which is incident to all other services but thisz because this divine service was of a higher and more exalted naturea this is the tenure by which almost all the antient monasteries and religious houses held their lands and by which the parochial clergy and very many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations hold them at this dayb the nature of the service being upon the reformation altered and made conformable to the purer doctrines   0  of the church of england it was an old saxon tenure and continued under the norman revolution through the great respect that was shown to religion and religious men in antient times which is also the reason that tenants in frankalmoign were discharged of all other services except the trinoda necessitas of repairing the highways building castles and repelling invasionsc just as the druids among the antient britons had omnium rerum immunitatemd and even at present this is a tenure of a nature very distinct from all others being not in the least feodal but merely spiritual for if the service be neglected the law gives no remedy by distress or otherwise to the lord of whom the lands are holden but merely a complaint to the ordinary or visitor to correct ite wherein it materially differs from what was called tenure by divine service in which the tenants were obliged to do some special divine services in certain as to sing so many masses to distribute such a sum in alms and the like which being expressly defined and prescribed could with no kind of propriety be called free alms especially as for this if unperformed the lord might distrein without any complaint to the visitorf all such donations are indeed now out of use for since the statute of quia emptores    edw i none but the king can give lands to be holden by this tenureg so that i only mention them because frankalmoign is excepted by name in the statute of charles ii  0  and therefore subsists in many instances at this day which is all that shall be remarked concerning it herewith concluding our observations on the nature of tenures chapter vii of freehold estates of inheritance the next objects of our disquisitions are the nature and properties of estates an estate in lands tenements and hereditaments signifies such interest as the tenant has therein so that if a man grants all his estate in dale to a and his heirs every thing that he can possibly grant shall pass therebya it is called in latin status it signifying the condition or circumstance in which the owner stands with regard to his property and to ascertain this with proper precision and accuracy estates may be considered in a threefold view—first with regard to the quantity of interest which the tenant has in the tenement secondly with regard to the time at which that quantity of interest is to be enjoyed and thirdly with regard to the number and connections of the tenants first with regard to the quantity of interest which the tenant has in the tenement this is measured by its duration and extent thus either his right of possession is to subsist for an uncertain period during his own life or the life of another man to determine at his own decease or to remain to his descendants after him or it is circumscribed within a certain number of years months or days or lastly it is infinite and unlimited being vested in him and his representatives forever and this occasions the primary division of   0  estates into such as are freehold and such as are less than freehold an estate of freehold liberum tenementum or franktenement is defined by brittonb to be the possession of the soil by a freeman and st germync tells us that the possession of the land is called in the law of england the franktenement or freehold such estate therefore and no other as requires actual possession of the land is legally speaking freehold which actual possession can by the course of the common law be only given by the ceremony called livery of seisin which is the same as the feodal investiture and from these principles we may extract this description of a freehold that it is such an estate in lands as is conveyed by livery of seisin or in tenements of any incorporeal nature by what is equivalent thereto and accordingly it is laid down by littletond that where a freehold shall pass it behooveth to have livery of seisin as therefore estates of inheritance and estates for life could not by common law be conveyed without livery of seisin these are properly estates of freehold and as no other estates are conveyed with the same solemnity therefore no others are properly freehold estates  estates of freehold thus understood are either estates of inheritance or estates not of inheritance the former are again divided into inheritances absolute  0  or feesimple and inheritances limited one species of which we usually call feetail i tenant in feesimple or as he is frequently styled tenant in fee is be that hath lands tenements or hereditaments to hold to him and his heirs forevere generally absolutely and simply without mentioning what heirs but referring that to his own pleasure or to the disposition of the law the true meaning of the word fee feodum is the same with that of feud or fief and in its original sense it is   0  taken in contradistinction to allodiumf which latter the writers on this subject define to be every mans own land which he possesseth merely in his own right without owing any rent or service to any superior this is property in its highest degree and the owner thereof hath absolutum et directum dominium and therefore is said to be seised thereof absolutely in dominico suo in his own demesne but feodum or fee is that which is held of some superior on condition of rendering him service in which superior the ultimate property of the land resides and therefore sir henry spelmang defines a feud or fee to be the right which the vassal or tenant hath in lands to use the same and take the profits thereof to him and his heirs rendering to the lord his due services the mere allodial property of the soil always remaining in the lord this allodial property no subject in england hash it being a received and now undeniable principle in the law that all the lands in england are holden mediately or immediately of the king the king therefore only hath absolutum et directum dominiumi but all subjects lands are in the nature of feodum or fee whether derived to them by descent from their ancestors or purchased for a valuable consideration for they cannot come to any man by either of those ways unless accompanied with those feudal clogs which were laid upon the first feudatory when it was originally granted a subject therefore hath only the usufruct and not the absolute property of the soil or as sir edward coke expresses itk he hath dominium utile but not dominium directum and hence it is that in the most solemn acts of law we express the strongest and highest estate that any subject can have by these words—he is seised thereof in his demesne as of fee it is a mans demesne dominicum or property since it belongs to him and his heirs forever yet this dominicum property or demesne is strictly not absolute or allodial but qualified or feodal it is his demesne as of fee that is it is not purely and simply his own since it is held of a superior lord in whom the ultimate property resides   0  this is the primary sense and acceptation of the word fee but as sir martin wright very justly observesl the doctrine that all lands are holden having been for so many ages a fixed and undeniable axiom our english lawyers do very rarely of late years especially use the word fee in this its primary original sense in contradistinction to allodium or absolute property with which they have no concern but generally use it to express the continuance or quantity of estate a fee therefore in general signifies an estate of inheritance being the highest and most extensive interest that a man can have in a feud and when the term is used simply without any other adjunct or has the adjunct of simple annexed to it as a fee or a feesimple it is used in contradistinction to a feeconditional at the common law or a feetail by the statute importing an absolute inheritance clear of any condition limitation or restrictions to particular heirs but descendible to the heirs general whether male or female lineal or collateral and in no other sense than this is the king said to be seised in fee he being the feudatory of no manm taking therefore fee for the future unless where otherwise explained in this its secondary sense as a state of inheritance it is applicable to and may be had in any kind of hereditaments either corporeal or incorporealn but there is this distinction between the two species of hereditaments that of a corporeal  0  inheritance a man shall be said to be seised in his demesne as of fee of an incorporeal one he shall only be said to be seised as of fee and not in his demesneo for as incorporeal hereditaments are in their nature collateral to and issue out of lands and housesp their owner hath no property dominicum or demesne in the thing itself but hath only something derived out of it resembling the servitutes or services of the civil lawq the dominicum or property is frequently   0  in one man while the appendage or service is in another thus caius may be seised as of fee of a way leading over the land of which titius is seised in his demesne as of fee the feesimple or inheritance of lands and tenements is generally vested and resides in some person or other though divers inferior estates may be carved out of it as if one grants a lease for twentyone years or for one or two lives the feesimple remains vested in him and his heirs and after the determination of those years or lives the land reverts to the grantor or his heirs who shall hold it again in feesimple yet sometimes the fee may be in abeyance that is as the word signifies in expectation remembrance and contemplation in law there being no person in esse in whom it can vest and abide though the law considers it as always potentially existing and ready to vest whenever a proper owner appears  thus in a grant to john for life and afterwards to the heirs of richard the inheritance is plainly neither granted to john nor richard nor can it vest in the heirs of richard till his death nam nemo est hæres viventis it remains therefore in waiting or abeyance during the life of richardr  this is likewise always the case of a parson of a church who hath only an estate therein for the term of his life and the inheritance remains in abeyances and not only the fee but the freehold also may be in abeyance as when a parson dies the freehold of his glebe is in abeyance until a successor be named and then it vests in the successort   0  the word heirs is necessary in the grant or donation in order to make a fee or inheritance for if land be given to a man forever or to him and his assigns forever this vests in him but an estate for lifeu this very great nicety about the insertion of the word heirs in all feoffments and grants in order to vest a fee is plainly a relic of the feodal strictness by which we may rememberw it was required   0  that the form of the donation should be punctually pursued or that as craggx expresses it in the words of baldus donationes sint stricti juris ne quis plus donasse præsumatur quam in donatione expresserit and therefore as the personal abilities of the donee were originally supposed to be the only inducements to the gift the donees estate in the land extended only to his own person and subsisted no longer than his life unless the donor by an express provision in the grant gave it a longer continuance and extended it also to his heirs but this rule is now softened by many exceptionsy for   it does not extend to devises by will  in which as they were introduced  0  at the time when the feodal rigour was apace wearing out a more liberal construction is allowed and therefore by a devise to a man forever or to one and his assigns forever or to one in feesimple the devisee hath an estate of inheritance for the intention of the devisor is sufficiently plain from the words  0  of perpetuity annexed though he hath omitted the legal words of inheritance but if the devise be to a man and his assigns without annexing words of perpetuity there the devisee shall take only an estate for life for it does not appear that the devisor intended any more   neither does this rule extend to fines or recoveries considered as a species of conveyance for thereby an estate in fee passes by act and operation of law without the word heirs as it does also for particular reasons by certain other methods of conveyance which have relation to a former grant or estate wherein the word heirs was expressedz   in creations of nobility by writ the peer so created hath an inheritance in his title without expressing the word heirs for heirship is implied in the creation unless it be otherwise specially provided but in creations by patent which are stricti juris the word heirs must be inserted otherwise there is no inheritance   in grants of lands to sole corporations and their successors the word successors supplies the place of heirs for as heirs take from the ancestor so doth the successor from the predecessor  nay in   0  a grant to a bishop or other sole spiritual corporation in frankalmoign the word  0  frankalmoign supplies the place of successors as the word successors supplies the place of heirs ex vi termini and in all these cases a feesimple vests in such sole corporation but in a grant of lands to a corporation aggregate the word successors is not necessary though usually inserted for albeit such simple grant be strictly only an estate for life yet as that corporation never dies such estate for life is perpetual or equivalent to a feesimple and therefore the law allows it to be onea   lastly in the case of the king a feesimple will vest in him without the word heirs or successors in the grant partly from prerogative royal and partly from a reason similar to the last because the king in judgment of law never diesb but the general rule is that the word heirs is necessary to create an estate of inheritance  ii we are next to consider limited fees or such estates of inheritance as are clogged and confined with conditions or qualifications of any sort and these we may divide into two sorts   qualified or base fees and   fees conditional so called at the common law and afterwards feestail in consequence of the statute de donis   a base or qualified fee is such a one as hath a qualification subjoined thereto and which must be determined whenever the qualification annexed to it is at an end as in the case of a grant to a and his heirs tenants of the manor of dale in this instance whenever the heirs of a cease to be tenants of that manor  the grant is entirely defeated so when henry vi granted to john talbot lord of the manor of kingstonlisle in berks that he and his heirs lords of the said manor should be peers of the realm by the title of barons of lisle here john talbot had a base or qualified fee in that dignityc and the instant he or his heirs quitted the seignory of this manor the dignity was at an end this    0 estate  is a fee because by possibility it may endure forever in a man and his heirs yet as that duration depends upon the concurrence of collateral circumstances which qualify and debase the purity of the donation it is therefore a qualified or base fee   a conditional fee at the common law was a fee restrained to some particular   0 heirs exclusive of others donatio stricta et coarctatad sicut certis hæredibus quibusdam a successione exclusis as to the heirs of a mans body by which only his lineal descendants were admitted in exclusion of collateral heirs or to the heirsmale of his body in exclusion both of collaterals and lineal females also 0 it was called a conditional fee by reason of the condition expressed or implied in the donation of it that if the donee died without such particular heirs the land should revert to the donor for this was a condition annexed by law to all grants whatsoever that on failure of the heirs specified in the grant the grant should be at an end and the land return to its ancient proprietore such conditional fees were strictly agreeable to the nature of feuds when they first ceased to be mere estates for life and were not yet arrived to be absolute estates in feesimple and we find strong traces of these limited conditional fees which could not be alienated from the lineage of the first purchaser in our earliest saxon lawsf now with regard to the condition annexed to these fees by the common law our ancestors held that such a gift to a man and the heirs of his body was a gift upon condition that it should revert to the donor if the donee had no heirs of his body but if he had it should then remain to the donee they therefore called it a feesimple on condition that he had issue   now we must observe that when any condition is performed it is thenceforth entirely gone and the thing to which it was before annexed becomes absolute      and wholly unconditional   so that as soon as the grantee had any issue born his estate was supposed to become absolute by the performance of the condition at least for these three purposes   to enable the tenant to aliene the land and thereby to bar not only his own issue but also the donor of his interest in the reversiong   to subject him to forfeit it for treason which he could not do till issue born longer than for his own life lest thereby the inheritance of the issue and reversion of the donor might have been defeatedh   to empower him to charge the land with rents commons and certain other encumbrances so as to bind his issuei and this was thought     the more reasonable because by the birth of issue the possibility of the donors reversion was rendered more distant and precarious and his interest seems to have been the only one which the law as it then stood was solicitous to protect without much regard to the right of succession intended to be vested in the issue however if the tenant did not in fact aliene the land the course of descent was not altered by this performance of the condition for if the issue had afterwards died and then the tenanth or original grantee had died without making any alienation the land by the terms of the donation could descend to none but the heirs of his body and therefore in default of them must have reverted to the donor for which reason in order to subject the lands to the ordinary course of descent the donees of these conditional feesimples took care to aliene as soon as they had performed the condition by having issue and afterwards repurchased the lands which gave them a feesimple absolute that would descend to the heirs in general according to the course of the common law and thus stood the old law with regard to conditional fees which things says sir edward cokek though they seem antient are yet necessary to be known as well for the declaring how the common law stood in such cases as for the sake of annuities and such like inheritances as are not within the statutes of entail and therefore remain as at the common law      the inconveniences which attended these limited and fettered inheritances were probably what induced the judges to give way to this subtle finesse of construction for such it undoubtedly was in order to shorton the duration of these conditional estates but on the other hand the nobility who were willing to perpetuate their possessions in their own families to put a stop to this practice procured the statute of westminster the secondl commonly called the statute de donis conditionalibus to be made which paid a greater regard to the private will and intentions of the donor than to the propriety of such intentions or any public considerations whatsoever this statute revived in some sort the antient feodal restraints which were originally laid or alienations by enacting that from thenceforth the will of the donor be observed and that the tenements so given to a man and the heirs of his body should at all events go to the issue if there were any or if none should revert to the donor upon the construction of this act of parliament the judges determined that the donee had no longer a conditional feesimple which became absolute and at his own disposal the instant any issue was born but they divided the estate into two parts leaving in the donee a new kind of particular estate which they denominated a feetailm and investing in the donor the ultimate feesimple of the land expectant on the failure of issue which expectant estate is what we now call a reversionn   and hence it is that littleton tells uso that tenant in feetail is by virtue of the statute of westminster the second having thus shown the original of estatestail i now proceed to consider what things may or may not be entailed      under the statute de donis tenements is the only word used in the statute and this sir edward cokep expounds to comprehend all corporeal hereditaments whatsoever and also all incorporeal hereditaments which savour of the realty that is which issue out of corporeal ones or which concern or are annexed to or may be     exercised within the same as rents estovers commons and the like also offices and dignities which concern lands or have relation to fixed and certain places may be entailedq but mere personal chattels which savour not at all of the realty cannot be entailed neither can an office which merely relates to such personal chattels nor an annuity which charges only the person and not the lands of the grantor but in these last if granted to a man and the heirs of his body the grantee hath still a feeconditional at common law as before the statute and by his alienation after issue born may bar the heir or reversionerr   an estate to a man and his heirs for anothers life cannot be entaileds for this is strictly no estate of inheritance as will appear hereafter and therefore not within the statute de donis neither can a copyhold estate be entailed by virtue of the statute for that would tend to encroach upon and restrain the will of the lord but by the special custom of the manor a copyhold may be limited to the heirs of the bodyt for here the custom ascertains and interprets the lords will next as to the several species of estatestail and how they are respectively created estatestail are either general or special tailgeneral is where lands and tenements are given to one and the heirs of his body begotten which is called tailgeneral because how often soever such donee in tail be married his issue in general by all and every such marriage is in successive order capable of inheriting the estatetail per formam doniu   tenant in tail special is where     the gift is restrained to certain heirs of the donees body and does not go to all of them in general and this may      happen several waysw i shall instance in only one as where lands and tenements are given to a man and the heirs of his body on mary his now wife to be begotten here no issue can inherit but such special issue as is engendered between them two not such as the husband may have by another wife and therefore it is called special tail and here we may observe that the words of inheritance to him and his heirs give him an estate in fee but they being heirs to be by him begotten this makes it a feetail and the person being also limited on whom such heirs shall be begotten viz mary his present wife this makes it a feetail special estates in general and special tail are further diversified by the distinction of sexes in such entails for both of them may either be in tail male or tail female as if lands be given to a man and his heirsmale of his body begotten this is an estate in tail male general but if to a man and the heirsfemale of his body on his present wife begotten this is an estate tail female special and in case of an entail male the heirsfemale shall never inherit nor any derived from them nor è converso the heirsmale in case of a gift in tail femalex thus if the donee in tail male hath a daughter who dies leaving a son such grandson in this case cannot inherit the estatetail for he cannot deduce his descent wholly by heirsmaley and as the heirmale must convey his descent wholly by males so must the heirfemale wholly by females and therefore if a man hath two estatestail the one in tail male the other in tail female and he hath issue a daughter which daughter hath issue a son this grandson can succeed to neither of the estates for he cannot convey his descent wholly either in the male or female linez as the word heirs is necessary to create a fee so in further limitation of the strictness of the feodal donation the word body or some other words of procreation are necessary to make it a feetail and ascertain to what heirs in particular      the fee is limited if therefore either the words of inheritance or words of procreation be omitted albeit the others are inserted in the grant this will not make an estatetail as if the grant be to a man and his issue of his body to a man and his seed to a man and his children or offspring all these are only estates for life there wanting the words of inheritance his heirsa so on the other hand a gift to a man and his heirs male or female is an estate in feesimple and not in feetail for there are no words to ascertain the body out of which they shall issueb indeed in last wills and testaments wherein greater indulgence is allowed an estatetail may be created by a devise to a man and his seed or to a man and his heirsmale or by other irregular modes of expressionc   there is still another species of entailed estates now indeed grown out of use yet still capable of subsisting in law which are estates in libero maritagio or frankmarriage these are definedd to be where tenements are given by one man to another together with a wife who is the daughter or cousin of the donor to hold in frankmarriage now by such gift though nothing but the word frankmarriage is expressed the donees shall have the tenements to them and the heirs of their two bodies begotten that is they are tenants in special tail for this one word frankmarriage does ex vi termini not only create an inheritance like the word frankalmoign but likewise limits that inheritance supplying not only words of descent but of procreation also such donees in frankmarriage     are liable to no service but fealty for a rent reserved thereon is void until the fourth degree of consanguinity be past between the issues of the donor and doneee the incidents to a tenancy in tail under the statute westm   are chiefly thesef   that a tenant in tail may commit waste on the estatetail by felling timber pulling down houses or the like without being impeached or called to account for the same        that the wife of the tenant in tail shall have her dower or thirds of the estatetail   that the husband of a female tenant in tail may be tenant by the curtesy of the estatetail   that an estatetail may be barred or destroyed by a fine by a common recovery or by lineal warranty descending with assets to the heir all which will hereafter be explained at large thus much for the nature of estatestail the establishment of which family law as it is properly styled by pigottg occasioned infinite difficulties and disputesh children grew disobedient when they knew they could not be set aside farmers were ousted of their leases made by tenants in tail for if such leases had been valid then under colour of long leases the issue might have been virtually disinherited creditors were defrauded of their debts for if a tenant in tail could have charged his estate with their payment he might also have defeated his issue by mortgaging it for as much as it was worth innumerable latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of the lands they had fairly bought of suits in consequence of which our ancient books are full and treasons were encouraged as estatestail were not liable to forfeiture longer than for the tenants life so that they were justly branded as the source of new contentions and mischiefs unknown to the common law and almost universally considered as the common grievance of the realmi but as the nobility were always fond of this statute because it preserved their family estates from forfeiture there was little hope of procuring a repeal by the legislature and therefore by the contrivance of an active and politic prince a method was devised to evade it about two hundred years intervened between the making of the statute de donis and the application of common recoveries to this intent in the twelfth year of edward iv which were then openly declared by the judges to be a      sufficient bar of an estatetailk for though the courts had so long before as the reign of edward iii very frequently hinted their opinion that a bar might be effected upon these principlesl yet it was never carried into execution till edward iv observingm in the disputes between the houses of york and lancaster how little effect attainders for treason had on families whose estates were protected by the sanctuary of entails gave his countenance to this proceeding and suffered taltarums case to be brought before the courtn wherein in consequence of the principles then laid down it was in effect determined that a common recovery suffered by tenant in tail should be an effectual destruction thereof what common recoveries are both in their nature and consequences and why they are allowed to be a bar to the estatetail must be reserved to a subsequent inquiry at present i shall only say that they are fictitious proceedings introduced by a kind of pia fraus to elude the statute de donis which was found so intolerably mischievous and which yet one branch of the legislature would not then consent to repeal and that these recoveries however clandestinely introduced are now become by long use and acquiescence a most common assurance of lands and are looked upon as the legal mode of conveyance by which tenant in tail may dispose of his lands and tenements so that no court will suffer them to be shaken or reflected on and even acts of parliamento have by a sidewind countenanced and established them this expedient having greatly abridged estatestail with regard to their duration     others were soon invented to strip them of other privileges the next that was attacked was their freedom from forfeitures for treason for notwithstanding the large advances made by recoveries in the compass of about threescore years towards unfettering these inheritances and thereby subjecting the lands to forfeiture the rapacious prince then reigning finding them frequently      resettled in a similar manner to suit the convenience of families had address enough to procure a statutep whereby all estates of inheritance under which general words estatestail were covertly included are declared to be forfeited to the king upon any conviction of high treason the next attack which they suffered in order of time was by the statute    hen viii c    whereby certain leases made by tenants in tail which do not tend to the prejudice of the issue were allowed to be good in law and to bind the issue in tail but they received a more violent blow in the same session of parliament by the construction put upon the statute of finesq by the statute    hen viii c    which declares a fine duly levied by tenant in tail to be a complete bar to him and his heirs and all other persons claiming under such entail this was evidently agreeable to the intention of henry vii whose policy it was before common recoveries had obtained their full strength and authority to lay the road as open as possible to the alienation of landed property in order to weaken the overgrown power of his nobles but as they from the opposite reasons were not easily brought to consent to such a provision it was therefore couched in his act under covert and obscure expressions and the judges though willing to construe that statute as favourably as possible for the defeating of entailed estates yet hesitated at giving fines so extensive a power by mere implication when the statute de donis had expressly declared that they would not be a bar to estatestail but the statute of hen viii when the doctrine of alienation was better received and the will of the prince more implicitly obeyed than before avowed and established that intention yet in order to preserve the property of the crown from any danger of infringement all estatestail created by the crown and of which the crown has the reversion are excepted out of this statute and the same was done with regard to common recoveries by the statute        hen viii c  0 which enacts that no feigned recovery had against tenants in tail where the estate was created by the      crownr and the remainder or reversion continues still in the crown shall be of any force and effect which is allowing indirectly and collaterally their full force and effect with respect to ordinary estatestail where the royal prerogative is not concerned lastly by a statute of the succeeding years all estatestail are rendered liable to be charged for payment of debts due to the king by record or special contract as since by the bankrupt lawt they are also subjected to be sold for the debts contracted by a bankrupt and by the construction put on the statute    eliz c   an appointmentu by tenant in tail of the lands entailed to a charitable use is good without fine or recovery       estatestail being thus by degrees unfettered are now reduced again to almost the same state even before issue born as conditional fees were in at common law after the condition was performed by the birth of issue for first the tenant in tail is now enabled to aliene his lands and tenements by fine by recovery or by certain other means and thereby to defeat the interest as well of his own issue though unborn as also of the reversioner except in the case of the crown secondly he is now liable to forfeit them for high treason and lastly he may charge them with reasonable leases and also with such of his debts as are due to the crown on specialties or have been contracted with his fellowsubjects in a course of extensive commerce   chapter viii of freeholds not of inheritance we are next to discourse of such estates of freehold as are not of inheritance but for life only and of these estates for life some are conventional or expressly created by the act of the parties others merely legal or created by construction and operation of lawa we will consider them both in their order   estates for life expressly created by deed or grant which alone are properly conventional are where a lease is made of lands or tenements to a man to hold for the term of his own life or for that of any other person or for more lives than one in any of which cases he is styled tenant for life only when he   0 holds the estate by the life of another he is usually called tenant pur auter vieb these estates for life are like inheritances of feodal nature and were for some time the highest estate that any man could have in a feud which as we have before seenc was not in its original hereditary they are given or conferred by the same feodal rights and solemnities the same investiture or livery of seisin as fees themselves are and they are held by fealty if demanded and such conventional rents and services as the lord or lessor and his tenant or lessee have agreed on      estates for life may be created not only by the express words before mentioned but also by a general grant without defining or limiting any specific estate as if one grants to a b the manor of dale this makes him tenant for lifed for though as there are no words of inheritance or heirs mentioned in the grant it cannot be construed to be a fee it shall however be construed to be as large an estate as the words of the donation will bear and therefore an estate for life also such a grant at large or a grant for a term of life generally shall be construed to be an estate for the life of the granteee in case the grantor hath authority to make such grant for an estate for a mans own life is more beneficial and of a higher nature than for any other life and the rule of law is that all grants are to be taken most strongly against the grantorf unless in the case of the king such estates for life will generally speaking endure as long as the life for which they are granted but there are some estates for life which may determine upon future contingencies before the life for which they are created expires as if an estate be granted to a woman during her widowhood or to a man until he be promoted to a benefice in these and similar cases whenever the contingency happens when the widow marries or when the grantee obtains a benefice the respective estates are absolutely determined and goneg yet while they subsist they are reckoned estates for life because the time for which they will endure being uncertain they may by possibility last for life if the contingencies upon which they are to determine do not sooner happen and moreover in case an estate be granted to a man for his life generally it may also determine by his civil death as if he enters into a monastery whereby he is dead in lawh for which reason in conveyances the grant is usually made for the term of a mans natural life which can only determine by his natural deathi       the incidents to an estate for life are principally the following which are applicable not only to that species of tenants for life which are expressly created by deed but also to those which are created by act and operation of law   every tenant for life unless restrained by covenant or agreement may of common right take upon the land demised to him reasonable estoversk or botesl for he hath a right to the full enjoyment and use of the land and all its profits during his estate therein but he is not permitted to cut down     timber or to do other waste upon the premisesm for the destruction of such things as are not the temporary profits of the tenement is not necessary for the tenants complete enjoyment of his estate but tends to the permanent and lasting loss of the person entitled to the inheritance ½   tenant for life or his representatives shall not be prejudiced by any sudden determination of his estate because such a determination is contingent and uncertainn therefore if a tenant for his own life sows the lands and dies before harvest his executors shall have the emblements or profits of the crop for the estate was determined by the act of god and it is a maxim in the law that actus dei nemini facit injuriam  the representatives therefore of the tenant for life shall have the emblements to compensate for the labour and expense of tilling manuring and sowing the lands and also for the encouragement     of husbandry which being a public benefit tending to the increase and plenty of provisions ought to have the utmost security and privilege that the law can give it wherefore by the feodal law if a tenant for life died between the beginning of september and the end of february the lord who was entitled to the reversion was also entitled to the profits of the whole year but if he died between the beginning of march and the end      of august the heirs of the tenant received the wholeo from hence our law of emblements seems to have been derived but with very considerable improvements so it is also if a man be tenant for the life of another and cestuy que vie or he on whose life the land is held dies after the corn sown the tenant pur auter vie shall have the emblements the same is also the rule if a lifeestate be determined by the act of law therefore if a lease be made to husband and wife during coverture which gives them a determinable estate for life and the husband sows the land and afterwards they are divorced a vinculo matrimonii the husband shall have the emblements in this case for the sentence of divorce is the act of lawp but if an estate for life be determined by the tenants own act as by forfeiture for waste committed or if a tenant during widowhood thinks proper to marry in these and similar cases the tenants having thus determined the estate by their own acts shall not be entitled to take the emblementsq the doctrine of emblements extends not only to corn sown but to roots planted or other annual artificial profit but it is otherwise of fruittrees grass and the like which are not planted annually at the expense and labour of the tenant but are either a permanent or natural profit of the earthr  for when a man plants a tree he cannot be presumed to plant     it in contemplation of any present profit but merely with a prospect of its being useful to himself in future and to future successions of tenants the advantages also of emblements are particularly extended to the parochial clergy by the statute    hen viii c    for all persons who are presented to any ecclesiastical benefice or to any civil office are considered as tenants for their own lives unless the contrary be expressed in the form of donation   a third incident to estates for life relates to the undertenants or lessees for they have the same nay greater indulgences than the lessors the original tenants for life the same for the law of estovers and emblements      with regard to the tenant for life is also law with regard to his undertenant who represents him and stands in his places and greater for in those cases where tenant for life shall not have the emblements because the estate determines by his own act the exception shall not reach his lessee who is a third person as in the case of a woman who holds durante viduitate her taking husband is her own act and therefore deprives her of the emblements but if she leases her estate to an undertenant who sows the land and she then marries this her act shall not deprive the tenant of his emblements who is a stranger and could not prevent hert  the lessees of tenants for life had also at the common law another most unreasonable advantage for at the death of their lessors the tenants for life these undertenants might if they pleased quit the premises and pay no rent to anybody for the occupation of the land since the last quarterday or other day assigned for payment of rentu to remedy which it is now enactedv that the executors or administrators of tenant for life on whose death any lease determined shall recover of the lessee a ratable proportion of rent from the last day of payment to the death of such lessor      ii the next estate for life is of the legal kind as contradistinguished from conventional viz that of tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct this happens where one is tenant in special tail and a person from whose body the issue was to spring dies without issue or having left issue that issue becomes extinct in either of these cases the surviving tenant in special tail becomes tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct as where one has an estate to him and his heirs on the body of his present wife to be begotten and the wife dies without issuew in this case the man has an estate tail which cannot possibly descend to any one and therefore the law makes use of this long periphrasis as absolutely necessary to give an adequate idea of his estate for if it had called him barely tenant in feetail special that      would not have distinguished him from others and besides he has no longer an estate of inheritance or feex for he can have no heirs capable of taking per formam doni had it called him tenant in tail without issue this had only related to the present fact and would not have excluded the possibility of future issue had he been styled tenant in tail without possibility of issue this would exclude time past as well as present and he might under this description never have had any possibility of issue no definition therefore could so exactly mark him out as this of tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct which with a precision peculiar to our own law not only takes in the possibility of issue in tail which he once had but also states that this possibility is now extinguished and gone this estate must be created by the act of god that is by the death of that person out of whose body the issue was to spring for no limitation conveyance or other human act can make it for if land be given to a man and his wife and the heirs of their two bodies begotten and they are divorced a vinculo matrimonii they shall neither of them have this estate but be barely tenants for life notwithstanding the inheritance once vested in themy a possibility of issue is always supposed to exist in law unless extinguished by the death of the parties even though the donees be each of them an hundred years oldz this estate is of an amphibious nature partaking partly of an estatetail and partly of an estate for life the tenant is in truth only tenant for life but with many of the privileges of a tenant in tail as not to be punishable for waste ca  or he is tenant in tail with many of the restrictions of a tenant     for life as to forfeit his estate if he alienes it in feesimpleb whereas such alienation by tenant in tail though voidable by the issue is no forfeiture of the estate to the reversioner who is not concerned in interest      till all possibility of issue be extinct but in general the law looks upon this estate     as equivalent to an estate for life only and as such will permit this tenant to exchange his estate with a tenant for life which exchange can only be made as we shall see hereafter of estates that are equal in their nature iii tenant by the curtesy of england is where a man marries a woman seised of an estate of inheritance that is of lands and tenements in feesimple or feetail and has by her issue born alive which was capable of inheriting her estate in this case he shall on the death of his wife hold the lands for his life as tenant by the curtesy of englandc this estate according to littleton has its denomination because it is used within the realm of england only and it is said in the mirrourd to have been introduced by king henry the first but it appears also to have been the established law of scotland wherein it was called curialitase so that probably our word curtesy was understood to signify rather an attendance upon the lords court or curtis that is being his vassal or tenant than to denote any peculiar favour belonging to this island  and therefore it is laid downf that by having issue the husband shall be entitled to do homage to the lord for the wifes lands alone whereas before issue had they must both have done it together it is likewise used in ireland by virtue of an ordinance of king henry iiig it also appearsh to have obtained in normandy and was likewise used among the ancient almains or germansi and yet it is not generally apprehended to have been a consequence of feodal tenurek though i think some substantial feodal reasons may be given for its introduction for if a woman seised of lands hath issue by her husband and dies the husband is the natural guardian of the child and as such is in reason entitled to      the profits of the lands in order to maintain it for which reason the heirapparent of a tenant by the curtesy could not be in ward to the lord of the fee during the life of such tenantl as soon therefore as any child was born the father began to have a permanent interest in the lands he became one of the pares curtis did homage to the lord and was called tenant by the curtesy initiate and this estate being once vested in him by the birth of the child was not suffered to determine by the subsequent death or coming of age of the infant there are four requisites necessary to make a tenancy by the curtesy marriage seisin of the wife issue and death of the wifem   the marriage must be canonical and legal   the seisin of the wife must be an actual seisin or possession of the lands not a bare right to possess which is a seisin in law  but an actual possession which is a seisin in deed  and therefore a man shall not be tenant by the curtesy of a remainder or reversion 0 but of some incorporeal     hereditaments a man may be tenant by the curtesy though there have been no actual seisin of the wife as in case of an advowson where the church has not become void in the lifetime of the wife which a man may hold by the curtesy because it is impossible ever to have actual seisin of it and impotentia excusat legemn if the wife be an idiot the husband shall not be tenant by the curtesy of her lands for the king by prerogative is entitled to them the instant she herself has any title and since she could never be rightfully seised of the lands and the husbands title depends entirely upon her seisin the husband can have no title as tenant by the curtesyo     the issue must be born alive     some have had a notion that it must be heard to cry but that is a mistake crying indeed is the strongest evidence of its being born alive but it is not the only evidencep the issue also must be born during the life of the mother for if the mother dies in labour and the cæsarean operation is performed the husband in this case shall not be tenant by the      curtesy because at the instant of the mothers death he was clearly not entitled as having had no issue born but the land descended to the child while he was yet in his mothers womb and the estate being once so vested shall not afterwards be taken from himq in gavelkind lands a husband may be tenant by the curtesy without having any issuer but in general there must be issue born and such issue as is also capable of inheriting the mothers estates therefore if a woman be tenant in tail male and hath only a daughter born the husband is not thereby entitled to be tenant by the curtesy because such issue female can never inherit the estate in tail malet and this seems to be the principal reason why the husband cannot be tenant by the curtesy of any lands of which the wife was not actually seised because in order to entitle himself to such estate he must have begotten issue that may be heir to the wife but no one by the standing rule of law can be heir to the ancestor of any land whereof the ancestor was not actually seised and therefore as the husband hath never begotten any issue that can be heir to those lands   he shall not be tenant of them by the curtesyu and hence we may observe with how much nicety and consideration the old rules of law were framed and how closely they are connected and interwoven together supporting illustrating and demonstrating one another the time when the issue was born is immaterial provided it were during the coverture for whether it were before or after the wifes seisin of the lands whether it be living or dead at the time of the seisin or at the time of the wifes decease the husband shall be tenant by the curtesyw the husband by the birth of the child becomes as was before observed tenant by the curtesy initiatex and may do many acts to charge the lands but his estate is not consummate till the death of the wife which is the fourth and last requisite to make a complete tenant by the curtesyy            iv tenant in dower is where the husband of a woman is seised of an estate of inheritance and dies in this case the wife shall have the third   part of all the lands and tenements whereof he was seised at any time during the coverture to hold to herself for the term of her natural lifez dower is called in latin by the foreign jurists doarium but by bracton and our english writers dos which among the romans signified the marriage portion which the wife brought to her husband but with us is applied to signify this kind of estate to which the civil law in its original state had nothing that bore a resemblance nor indeed is there any thing in general more different than the regulations of landed property according to the english and roman laws dower out of the lands seems also to have been unknown in the early part of our saxon constitution for in the laws of king edmonda the wife is directed to be supported wholly out of the personal estate afterwards as may be seen in gavelkind tenure the widow became entitled to a conditional estate in one half of the lands with a proviso that she remained chaste and unmarriedb as is usual also in copyhold dowers or free bench   yet somec have ascribed the introduction of dower to the normans as a branch of their local tenures though we cannot expect any feodal reason for its invention since it was not a part of the pure primitive simple law of feuds but was first of all introduced into that system wherein it was called triens tertiad and dotalitium by the emperor frederick the seconde who was contemporary with our king henry iii it is possible therefore that it might be with us the relic of a danish custom since according to the historians of that country dower was introduced into denmark by swein the father of our canute the great out of gratitude to the danish ladies who sold all their    0 jewels to ransom him when taken prisoner by the vandalsf however this be the reason which our law gives for adopting it is a very plain and sensible one for the sustenance of the wife and the nurture and education of the younger childreng in treating of this estate let us first consider who may be endowed secondly of what she may be endowed thirdly the manner how she shall be endowed and fourthly how dower may be barred or prevented   who may be endowed she must be the actual wife   of the party at the   0 time of his decease if she be divorced a vinculo matrimonii she shall not be endowed for ubi nullum matrimonium ibi nulla dosh but a divorce a mensa et thoro only doth not destroy the doweri no not even for adultery itself by the common lawk yet now by the statute west  l if a woman voluntarily leaves which the law calls eloping from her husband and lives with an adulterer she shall lose her dower unless her husband be voluntarily reconciled to her   it was formerly held that the wife of an idiot might be endowed though the husband of an idiot could not be tenant by the curtesym but as it seems to be at present agreed upon principles of sound sense and reason that an idiot cannot marry being incapable of consenting to any contract this doctrine cannot now take place by the antient law the wife of a person attainted of treason or felony could not be endowed to the intent says staunforden that if the love of a mans own life cannot restrain him from such atrocious acts the love of his wife and children may though brittono gives it another turn viz that it is presumed the wife was privy to her husbands crime however the statute   edw vi c    abated the rigour of the common law in this particular and allowed      the wife her dower but a subsequent statutep revived this severity against the widows of traitors who are now barred of their dower except in the case of certain modern treasons relating to the coinq but not the widows of felons an alien also cannot be endowed   unless she be queenconsort for no alien is capable of holding landsr the wife must be above nine years old at her husbands death otherwise she shall not be endoweds though in bractons time the age was indefinite and dower was then only due si uxor possit dotem promereri et virum sustineret   we are next to inquire of what a wife may be endowed and she is now by law entitled to be endowed of all lands and tenements of which her husband was seised in feesimple or feetail at any time during the coverture and of which any issue which she might have had might by possibility have been heiru   therefore if a man seised in feesimple hath a son by his first wife     and after marries a second wife she shall be endowed of his lands for her issue might by possibility have been heir on the death of the son by the former wife but if there be a donee in special tail who holds lands to him and the heirs of his body begotten on jane his wife though jane may be endowed of these lands yet if jane dies and he marries a second wife that second wife shall never be endowed of the lands entailed for no issue that she could have could by any possibility inherit themv a seisin in law of the husband will be as effectual as a seisin in deed in order to render the wife dowable for it is not in the wifes power to bring the husbands title to an actual seisin as it is in the husbands power to do with regard to the wifes lands which is one reason why he shall not be tenant by the curtesy but of such lands whereof the wife or he himself in her right was actually seised in deedw the seisin of the husband for a transitory instant      only when the same act which gives him the estate conveys it also out of him again as where by a fine land is granted to a man and he immediately renders it back by the same fine such a seisin will not entitle the wife to dowerx for the land was merely in transitu and never rested in the husband the grant and render being one continued act but if the land abides in him for the interval of but a single moment it seems that the wife shall be endowed thereofy 0 and in short a     widow may be endowed of all her husbands lands tenements and hereditaments corporeal or incorporeal   under the restrictions before mentioned unless there be some special reason to the contrary thus a woman shall not be endowed of a castle built for defence of the realmz nor of a common without stint for as the heir would then have one portion of this common and the widow another and both without stint the common would be doubly stockeda copyhold estates are also not liable to dower being only estates at the lords will unless by the special custom of the manor in which case it is usually called the widows free benchb but where dower is allowable it matters not though the husband aliene the lands during the coverture for he alienes them liable to dowerc     next as to the manner in which a woman is to be endowed there are now subsisting four species of dower the fifth mentioned by littletond de la plus belle having been abolished together with the military tenures of which it was a consequence     dower by the common law or that which is before described       dower by particular custome as that the wife should have half the husbands lands or in some places the whole and in some only a quarter   dower ad ostium ecclesiæf which is where tenant in fee     simple of full age openly at the church door where all marriages were formerly celebrated after affiance made and sir edward coke in his translation of littleton adds troth plighted between them doth endow the wife with the whole or such quantity as he shall please of his lands at the same time specifying and ascertaining the same on which the wife after her husbands death may enter without further ceremony   dower ex assensu patrisg which is only a species of dower ad ostium ecclesiæ made when the husbands father is alive and the son by his consent expressly given endows his wife with parcel of his fathers lands in either of these cases they must to prevent frauds be madeh in facie ecclesiæ et ad ostium ecclesiæ non enim valent facta in lecto mortali nec in camera aut alibi ubi clandestina fuerint conjugia it is curious to observe the several revolutions which the doctrine of dower has undergone since its introduction into england it seems first to have been of the nature of the dower in gavelkind before mentioned viz a moiety of the husbands lands but forfeitable by incontinency or a second marriage by the famous charter of henry i this condition of widowhood and chastity was only required in case the husband left any issuei and afterwards we hear no more of it under henry the second according to glanvilk the dower ad ostium ecclesiæ was the most usual species of dower and here as well as in normandyl it was binding upon the wife if by her consented to at the time of marriage neither in those days of feodal rigour was the husband allowed to endow her ad ostium ecclesiæ with more than the third part of the lands whereof he then was seised though he might endow her with less lest by such liberal endowments the lord should be defrauded of his wardships and other feodal profitsm but if no specific dotation was made at the      church porch then she was endowed by the common law of the third part which was called her dos rationabilis of such lands and tenements as the husband was seised of at the time of the espousals and no other unless he specially engaged before the priest to endow her of his future acquisitionsn and if the husband had no lands an endowment in goods chattels or money at the time of espousals was a bar of any dowero in lands which he afterwards acquiredp in king johns magna carta and the first chapter of henry iiiq no mention is made of any alteration of the common law in respect of the lands subject to dower but in those of      and      it is particularly provided that a widow shall be entitled for her dower to the third part of all such lands as the husband had     held in his lifetimer yet in case of a specific endowment of less ad ostium ecclesiæ the widow had still no power to waive it after her husbands death and this continued to be law during the reigns of henry iii and edward is in henry ivs time it was denied to be law that a woman can be endowed of her husbands goods and chattelst and under edward iv littleton lays it down      expressly that a woman may be endowed ad ostium ecclesiæ with more than a third partu and shall have her election after her husbands death to accept such dower or refuse it and betake herself to her dower at common laww which state of uncertainty was probably the reason that these specific dowers ad ostium ecclesiæ and ex assensu patris have since fallen into total disuse   i proceed therefore to consider the method of endowment or assigning dower by the common law which is now the only usual species by the old law grounded on the feodal exactions a woman could not be endowed without a fine paid to the lord neither could she marry again without his license lest she should contract herself and so convey part of the feud to the lords enemyx this license the lords took care to be well paid for and as it seems would sometimes force the dowager to a second marriage in order to gain the fine but to remedy these oppressions it was provided first by the charter of henry iy and afterwards by magna cartaz that the widow shall pay nothing for her marriage nor shall be distreined to marry afresh if she chooses to live without a husband but shall not however marry against the consent of the lord and further that nothing shall be taken for assignment of the widows dower but that she shall remain in her husbands capital mansionhouse for forty days after his death during which time her dower shall be assigned these forty days are called the widows quarantine a term made use of in law to signify the number of forty days whether applied to this occasion or any othera the particular lands to be held in dower must be assignedb by the heir of the husband or his guardian not only for the sake of notoriety but also to entitle the lord of the fee to demand his services of the heir in respect of the lands so holden for the heir by this entry becomes tenant      thereof to the lord and the widow is immediate tenant to the heir by a kind of subinfeudation or undertenancy completed by this investiture or assignment which tenure may still be created notwithstanding the statute of quia emptores because the heir parts not with the feesimple but only with an estate for life if the heir or his guardian do not assign her dower within the term of quarantine or do assign it unfairly she has her remedy at law and the sheriff is appointed to assign itc or if the heir being under age or his guardian assign more than she ought to have it may be afterwards remedied by writ of admeasurement of dowerd if the thing of which she is endowed be divisible her dower must be set out by metes and bounds but if it be indivisible she must be endowed specially as of the third presentation to a church the third tolldish of a mill the third part of the profits of an office the third sheaf of tithe and the likee upon preconcerted marriages and in estates of considerable consequence tenancy in dower happens very seldom for the claim of the wife to her dower at the common law diffusing itself so extensively it became a great clog to alienations and was otherwise inconvenient to families wherefore since the alteration of the ancient law respecting dower ad ostium ecclesiæ which hath     occasioned the entire disuse of that species of dower jointures have been introduced in their stead as a bar to the claim at common law which leads me to inquire lastly   how dower may be barred or prevented a widow may be barred of her dower not only by elopement divorce being an alien the treason of her husband   and other disabilities before mentioned but also by detaining the titledeeds or evidences of the estate from the heir until she restores themf and by the statute of gloucesterg if a dowager alienes the land assigned her for dower she forfeits it ipso      facto and the heir may recover it by action   a woman also may be barred of her dower by levying a fine or suffering a recovery of the lands during her covertureh   but the most usual method of barring dowers is by jointures as regulated by the statute    hen viii c  0 a jointure which strictly speaking signifies a joint estate limited to both husband and wife but in common acceptation extends also to a sole estate limited to the wife only is thus defined by sir edward cokei a competent livelihood of freehold for the wife of lands and tenements to take effect in profit or possession presently after the death of the husband for the life of the wife at least this description is framed from the purview of the statute    henry viii c  0 before mentioned commonly called the statute of uses of which we shall speak fully hereafter at present i have only to observe that before the making of that statute the greatest part of the land of england was conveyed to uses the property or possession of the soil being vested in one man and the use or the profits thereof in another whose directions with regard to the disposition thereof the former was in conscience obliged to follow and might be compelled by a court of equity to observe now though a husband had the use of lands in absolute feesimple yet the wife was not entitled to any dower therein he not being seised thereof wherefore it became usual on marriage to settle by express deed some special estate to the use of the husband and his wife for their lives in jointtenancy or jointure which settlement     would be a provision for the wife in case she survived her husband at length the statute of uses ordained that such as had the use of lands should to all intents and purposes be reputed and taken to be absolutely seised and possessed of the soil itself in consequence of which legal seisin   all wives would have become dowable of such lands as were held to the use of their husbands and also entitled at the same time to any special lands that might be settled in jointure had not the same statute provided that      upon making such an estate in jointure to the wife before marriage she shall be forever precluded from the dowerk but then these four requisites must be punctually observed   the jointure must take effect immediately on the death of the husband   it must be for her own life at least and not pur auter vie or for any term of years or other smaller estate     it must be made to herself and no other in trust for her   it must be made and so in the deed particularly expressed to be 0 in satisfaction of her whole dower and not of any     particular part of it if the jointure be made to her after marriage she has her election after her husbands death as in dower ad ostium ecclesiæ and may either accept it or refuse it and betake herself to her dower at common law for she was not capable of consenting to it during coverture and if by any fraud or accident a jointure made before marriage proves to be on a bad title and the jointress is evicted or turned out of possession she shall then by the provisions of the same statute have her dower pro tanto at the common lawl   there are some advantages attending tenants in dower that do not extend to jointresses and so vice versa jointresses are in some respects more privileged than tenants in dower tenant in dower by the old common law is subject to no tolls or taxes and hers is almost the only estate on which when derived from the kings debtor the king cannot distrein for his debt if contracted during the coverturem but on the other      hand a widow may enter at once without any formal process on her jointure land as she also might have done on dower ad ostium ecclesiæ which a jointure in many points resembles and the resemblance was still greater while that species of dower continued in its primitive state whereas no small trouble and a very tedious method of proceeding is necessary to compel a legal assignment of dowern and what is more though dower be forfeited by the treason of the husband yet lands settled in jointure remain unimpeached to the widowo wherefore sir edward coke very justly gives it the preference as being more sure and safe to the widow than even dower ad ostium ecclesiæ the most eligible species of any     0 chapter ix of estates less than freehold of estates that are less than freehold there are three sorts   estates for years   estates at will   estates by sufferance i an estate for years is a contract for the possession of lands or tenements for some determinate period and it takes place where a man letteth them to another for the term of a certain number of years agreed upon between the lessor and the lesseea and the lessee enters thereonb  if the lease be but for half a year or a quarter or any less time this lessee is respected as a tenant for years and is styled so in some legal proceedings a year being the shortest term which the law in this case takes notice ofc and this may not improperly lead us into a short digression concerning the division and calculation of time by the english law    0 the space of a year  is a determinate and wellknown period consisting commonly   0 of     days for though in bis     sextile or leap years it consists properly of     yet by the statute    hen iii the increasing day in the     leap year together with the preceding day shall be accounted for one day only that of a month is more ambiguous there being in common use two ways of calculating months either as lunar consisting of twentyeight days the supposed revolution of the moon thirteen of which make a year or as calendar months of unequal lengths according to the julian division in our common almanacs commencing at the calends of each month whereof in a year there are only twelve  a month in law is a lunar month or twentyeight days unless otherwise expressed not only because it is always one uniform period but because it falls naturally into a quarterly division by weeks therefore a lease for twelve months is only for fortyeight weeks but if it be for a twelvemonth in the singular number it is good for the whole yeard for herein the law recedes from its usual calculation because the ambiguity between the two methods of computation ceases it being generally understood that by the space of time called thus in the singular number a twelvemonth is meant the whole year consisting of one solar revolution in the space of a day all the twentyfour hours are usually reckoned the law generally rejecting all fractions of a day in order to avoid disputese therefore if i am bound to pay money on any certain day i discharge the obligation if i pay it before twelve oclock at night after which the following day commences but to return to estates for years these estates were originally granted to mere farmers or husbandmen who every year rendered some equivalent in money provisions or other rent to the lessors or landlords but in order to encourage them to manure and cultivate the ground they had a permanent interest granted them not determinable at the will of the lord and yet their possession was esteemed of so little consequence that they were rather considered as the bailiffs or servants of the lord who were to      receive and account for the profits at a settled price than as having any property of their own and therefore they were not allowed to have a freehold estate but their interest such as it was vested after their deaths in their executors who were to make up the accounts of their testator with the lord and his other creditors and were entitled to the stock upon the farm the lessees estate might also by the antient law be at any time defeated by a common recovery suffered by the tenant of the freeholdf which annihilated all leases for years then subsisting unless afterwards renewed by the recoveror whose title was supposed superior to his by whom those leases were granted while estates for years were thus precarious it is no wonder that they were usually very short like our modern leases upon rackrent and indeed we are toldg that by the antient law no leases for more than forty years were allowable because any longer possession especially when given without any livery declaring the nature and duration of the estate might tend to defeat the inheritance yet this law if ever it existed was soon antiquated for we may     observe in madoxs collection of antient instruments some leases for years of a pretty early date which considerably exceed that periodh and long terms for three hundred years or a thousand were certainly in use in the time of edward iiii and probably of edward ik but certainly when by the statute    hen viii c    the termor that is he who is entitled to the term of years was protected against these fictitious recoveries and his interest rendered secure and permanent long terms began to be more frequent than before and were afterwards extensively introduced being found extremely convenient for family settlements and mortgages continuing subject however to the same rules of succession      and with the same inferiority to freeholds as when they were little better than tenancies at the will of the landlord  every estate which must expire at a period certain and prefixed by whatever words created is an estate for years and therefore this estate is frequently called a term terminus because its duration or continuance is bounded limited and determined for every such estate must have a certain beginning and certain endl but id certum est quod certum reddi potest therefore if a man make a lease to another for so many years as j s shall name it is a good lease for yearsm for though it is at present uncertain yet when j s hath named the years it is then reduced to a certainty if no day of commencement is named in the creation of this estate it begins from the making or delivery of the leasen a lease for so many years as j s shall live is void from the beginningo for it is neither certain nor can ever be reduced to a certainty during the continuance of the lease and the same doctrine holds if a parson make a lease of his glebe for so many years as he shall continue parson of dale for this is still more uncertain but a lease for twenty or more years if j s shall     so long live or if he should so long continue parson is goodp for there is a certain period fixed beyond which it cannot last though it may determine sooner on the death of j s or his ceasing to be parson there we have before remarked and endeavoured to assign the reason of the inferiority in which the law places an estate for years when compared with an estate for life or an inheritance observing that an estate for life even if it be pur auter vie is a freehold but that an estate for a thousand years is only a chattel and reckoned part of the personal estateq hence it follows that a lease for years may be made to commence in futuro though a lease for life cannot as if i grant lands to titius to hold from michaelmas next for      twenty years this is good but to hold from michaelmas next for the term of his natural life is void for no estate or freehold can commence in futuro  because it cannot be created at common law without livery of seisin or corporal possession of the land and corporal possession cannot be given of an estate now which is not to commence now but hereafterr and because no livery of seisin is necessary to a lease for years such lessee is not said to be seised or to have true legal seisin of the lands nor indeed does the bare lease vest any estate in the lessee but only gives him a right of entry on the tenement which right is called his interest in the term or interesse termini but when he has actually so entered and thereby accepted the grant the estate is then and not before vested in him and he is possessed not properly of the land but of the term of yearss the possession or seisin of the land remaining still in him who hath the freehold  thus the word term does not merely signify the time specified in the lease but the estate also and interest that passes by that lease and therefore the term may expire during the continuance of the time as by surrender forfeiture and the like for which reason if i grant a lease to a for the term of three years and after the expiration of the said term to b for six years and a surrenders or forfeits his lease at the end of one year bs interest shall immediately take effect but if the remainder had been to b from and after the expiration of the said three years or from and after the expiration of the said time in this case bs interest will not commence till the time is fully elapsed whatever may become of as termt      tenant for term of years hath incident to and inseparable from his estate unless by special agreement the same estovers which we formerly observedu that tenant for life was entitled to that is to say housebote firebote ploughbote and haybotew terms which have been already explainedx       with regard to emblements or the profits of lands sowed by tenant for years there is this difference between him and tenant for life that where the term of tenant for years depends upon a certainty as if he holds from midsummer for ten years and in the last year he sows a crop of corn and it is not ripe and cut before midsummer the end of his term the landlord shall have it for the tenant knew the expiration of his term and therefore it was his own folly to sow what he could never reap the profits ofy but where the lease for years depends upon an uncertainty as upon the death of a lessor being himself only tenant for life or being a husband seised in right of his wife or if the term of years be determinable upon a life or lives in all these cases the estate for years not being certainly to expire at a time foreknown but merely by the act of god the tenant or his executors shall have the emblements in the same manner that a tenant for life or his executors shall be entitled theretoz not so if it determine by the act of the party himself as if tenant for years does any thing that amounts to a forfeiture in which case the emblements shall go to the lessor and not to the lessee who hath determined his estate by his own defaulta 0 ii the second species of estates not freehold are estates at will an estate at will is where lands and tenements are let by one man to another to have and to hold at the will of the lessor and the tenant by force of this lease obtains     possessionb such tenant hath no certain indefeasible estate nothing that can be assigned by him to any other because the lessor may determine his will and put him out whenever he pleases but every estate at will is at the will of both parties landlord and tenant so that either of them may determine his will and quit his connection with the other at his own pleasurec yet this must be understood with some restriction      for if the tenant at will sows his land and the landlord before the corn is ripe or before it is reaped puts him out yet the tenant shall have the emblements and free ingress egress and regress to cut and carry away the profitsd and this for the same reason upon which all the cases of emblements turn viz the point of uncertainty since the tenant could not possibly know when his landlord would determine his will and therefore could make no provision against it and having sown the land which is for the good of the public upon a reasonable presumption the law will not suffer him to be a loser by it but it is otherwise and upon reason equally good where the tenant himself determines the will for in this case the landlord shall have the profits of the lande what act does or does not amount to a determination of the will on either side has formerly been matter of great debate in our courts but it is now i think settled that besides the express determination of the lessors will by declaring that the lessee shall hold no longer which must either be made upon the landf or notice must be given to the lesseeg the exertion of any act of ownership by the lessor as entering upon the premises and cutting timberh taking a distress for rent and impounding it thereoni or making a feoffment or lease for years of the land to commence immediatelyk any act of desertion by the lessee as assigning his estate to another or committing waste which is an act inconsistent with such a tenurel or which is instar omnium the death or outlawry of either lessor or lesseem puts an end to or determines the estate at will the law is however careful that no sudden determination of the will by one party shall tend to the manifest and unforeseen prejudice of the other this appears in the case of      emblements before mentioned and by a parity of reason the lessee after the determination of the lessors will shall have reasonable ingress and egress to fetch away his goods and utensilsn and if rent be payable quarterly or halfyearly and the lessee determines the will the rent shall be paid to the end of the current quarter or half yearo and upon the same principle courts of law have of late years leaned as much as possible against construing demises where no certain term is mentioned to be tenancies at will but have rather held them to be tenancies from year to year so long as both parties please especially where an annual rent is reserved       in which case they will not suffer either party to determine the tenancy even at the end of the year without reasonable notice to the other which is generally understood to be six monthsp   there is one species of estates at will that deserves a more particular regard than any other and that is an estate held by copy of courtroll or as we usually call it a copyhold estate this as was before observedq was in its original and foundation nothing better than a mere estate at will but the kindness and indulgence of successive lords of manors having permitted these estates to be enjoyed by the tenants and their heirs according to particular     customs established in their respective districts therefore though they still are held at the will of the lord and so are in general expressed in the courtrolls to be yet that will is qualified restrained and limited to be exerted according to the custom of the manor this custom being suffered to grow up by the lord is looked upon as the evidence and interpreter of his will his will is no longer arbitrary and precarious but fixed and ascertained by the custom to be the same and no other that has time out of mind been exercised and declared by his ancestors a copyhold tenant is therefore now full as properly a tenant by the custom as a tenant at will the custom      having arisen from a series of uniform wills and therefore it is rightly observed by calthorper that copyholders and customary tenants differ not so much in nature as in name for although some be called copyholders some customary some tenants by the virge some base tenants some bond tenants and some by one name and some by another yet do they all agree in substance and kind of tenure all the said lands are holden in one general kind that is by custom and continuance of time and the diversity of their names doth not alter the nature of their tenure almost every copyhold tenant being therefore thus tenant at the will of the lord according to the custom of the manor which customs differ as much as the humour and temper of the respective antient lords from whence we may account for their great variety such tenant i say may have so far as the custom warrants any other of the estates or quantities of interest which we have hitherto considered or may hereafter consider and hold them united with this customary estate at will a copyholder may in many manors be tenant in feesimple in feetail for life by the curtesy in dower for years at sufferance or on condition subject however to be deprived of these estates upon the concurrence of those circumstances which the will of the lord promulgated by immemorial custom has declared to be a forfeiture or absolute determination of those interests as in some manors the want of issuemale in others the cutting down timber the nonpayment of a fine and the like yet none of these interests amount to a freehold for the freehold of the whole manor abides always in the lord onlys who hath granted out the use and occupation but not the corporal seisin or true legal possession of certain parcels thereof to these his customary tenants at will the reason of originally granting out this complicated kind of interest so that the same man shall with regard to the same land be at one and the same time tenant in fee     simple and also tenant at the lords will seems to have arisen from the nature of villenage tenure in which a grant of any estate of freehold or even for years absolutely was an immediate enfranchisement of the villeint the lords therefore though they were willing to enlarge the interest of their villeins by granting them estates which might endure for their lives or sometimes be descendible to their issue yet not caring to manumit them entirely might probably scruple to grant them any absolute freehold and for that reason it seems to have been contrived that a power of resumption at the will of the lord should be annexed to these grants whereby the tenants were still kept in a state of villenage and no freehold at all was conveyed to them in their respective lands and of course as the freehold of all lands must necessarily rest and abide somewhere the law supposed it still to continue and remain in the lord afterwards when these villeins became modern copyholders and had acquired by custom a sure and indefeasible estate in their lands on performing their usual services but yet continued to be styled in their admissions tenants at the will of the lord—the law still supposed it an absurdity to allow that such as were thus nominally tenants at will could have any freehold interest and therefore continued and now continues to determine that the freehold of lands so holden abides in the lord of the manor and not in the tenant for though he really holds to him and his heirs forever yet he is also said to hold at anothers will but with regard to certain other copyholders     of free or privileged tenure which are derived from the ancient tenants in villeinsocageu and are not said to hold at the will of the lord but only according to the custom of the manor there is no such absurdity in allowing them to be capable of enjoying a freehold interest and therefore the law doth not suppose the freehold of such lands to rest in the lord to whom they are holden but in the tenants themselvesv who are sometimes called customary freeholders being allowed to have a freehold interest though not a freehold tenure    0 however in common cases copyhold estates are still ranked for the reasons above mentioned among tenancies at will though custom which is the life of the common law has established a permanent property in the copyholders who were formerly nothing better than bondmen equal to that of the lord himself in the tenements holden of the manor nay sometimes even superior for we may now look upon a copyholder of inheritance with a fine certain to be little inferior to an absolute freeholder in point of interest and in other respects particularly in the clearness and security of his title to be frequently in a better situation   iii an estate at sufferance is where one comes into possession of land by lawful title but keeps it afterwards without any title at all as if a man takes a lease for a year and after a year is expired continues to hold the premises without any fresh leave from the owner of the estate or if a man maketh a lease at will and dies the estate at will is thereby determined but if the tenant continueth possession he is tenant at sufferancew   but no man can be tenant at sufferance against the king to whom no laches or neglect in not entering and ousting the tenant is ever imputed by law but his tenant so holding over is considered as an absolute intruderx but in the case of a subject this estate may be destroyed whenever the true owner shall make an actual entry on the   0 lands and oust the tenant for before entry he cannot maintain an action of trespass against the tenant by sufferance as he might against a strangery and the reason is because the tenant being once in by a lawful title the law which presumes no wrong in any man will suppose him to continue upon a title equally lawful unless the owner of the land by some public and avowed act such as entry is will declare his continuance to be tortious or in common language wrongful      thus stands the law with regard to tenants by sufferance and landlords are obliged in these cases to make formal entries upon their landsz and recover possession by the legal process of ejectment   and at the utmost by the common law the tenant was bound to account for the profits of the land so by him detained but now by the statute   geo ii c    in case any tenant for life or years or other person claiming under or by collusion with such tenant shall wilfully hold over after the determination of the term and demand made and notice in writing given by him to whom the remainder or reversion of the premises shall belong for delivering the possession thereof such person so holding over or keeping the other out of possession shall pay for the time he detains the lands at the rate of double their yearly value and by statute    geo ii c    in case any tenant having power to determine his lease shall give notice of his intention to quit the premises and shall not deliver up the possession at the time contained in such notice he shall thenceforth pay double the former rent for such time as he continues in possession these statutes have almost put an end to the practice of tenancy by sufferance unless with the tacit consent of the owner of the tenement   chapter x of estates upon condition besides the several divisions of estates in point of interest which we have considered in the three preceding chapters there is also another species still remaining which is called an estate upon condition  being such whose existence depends upon the happening or not happening of some uncertain event whereby     the estate may be either originally created or enlarged  or finally defeateda      and these conditional estates i have chosen to reserve till last because they are indeed more properly qualifications of other estates than a distinct species of themselves seeing that any quantity of interest a fee a freehold or a term of years may depend upon these provisional restrictions estates then upon condition thus understood are of two sorts   estates upon condition implied   estates upon condition expressed under which last may be included   estates held in vadio gage or pledge   estates by statute merchant or statute staple   estates held by elegit i estates upon condition implied in law are where a grant of an estate has a condition annexed to it inseparably from its essence and constitution although no condition be expressed in words as if a grant be made to a man of an office generally without adding other words the law tacitly annexes hereto a secret condition that the grantee shall duly execute his officeb on breach of which condition      it is lawful for the grantor or his heirs to oust him and grant it to another personc for an office either public or private may be forfeited by misuser or nonuser both of which are breaches of this implied condition   by misuser or abuse as if a judge takes a bribe or a parkkeeper kills deer without authority   by nonuser or neglect which in public offices that concern the administration of justice or the commonwealth is of itself a direct and immediate cause of forfeiture but nonuser of a private office is no cause of forfeiture unless some special damage is proved to be occasioned therebyd for in the one case delay must necessarily be occasioned in the affairs of the public which require a constant attention but private offices not requiring so regular and unremitted a service the temporary neglect of them is not necessarily productive of mischief upon which account some special loss must be proved in order to vacate these franchises also being regal privileges in the hands of a subject are held to be granted on the same condition of making a proper use of them and therefore they may be lost and forfeited like offices either by abuse or by neglecte upon the same principle proceed all the forfeitures which are given by law of lifeestates and others for any acts done by the tenant himself that are incompatible with the estate which he holds as if tenants for life or years enfeoff a stranger in feesimple this is by the common law a forfeiture of their several estates being a breach of the condition which the law annexes thereto viz that they shall not attempt to create a greater estate than they themselves are entitled tof  so if any tenants for years for life or in fee commit a felony the king or other lord of the fee is entitled to have their tenements because their estate is determined by the breach of the condition that they shall not commit felony which the law tacitly annexes to every feodal donation      ii an estate on condition expressed in the grant itself is where an estate is granted either in feesimple or otherwise with an express qualification annexed whereby the estate granted shall either commence be enlarged or be defeated upon performance or breach of such qualification or conditiong      these conditions are therefore either precedent or subsequent  precedent are such as must happen or be performed before the estate can vest or be enlarged subsequent are such by the failure or nonperformance of which an estate already vested may be defeated thus if an estate for life be limited to a upon his marriage with b the marriage is a precedent condition and till that happens no estateh is vested in a or if a man grant to his lessee for years that upon payment of a hundred marks within the term he shall have the fee this also is a condition precedent and the feesimple passeth not till the hundred marks be paidi but if a man grants an estate in feesimple reserving to himself and his heirs a certain rent and that if such rent be not paid at the time limited it shall be lawful for him and his heirs to reenter and avoid the estate in this case the grantee and his heirs have an estate upon condition subsequent which is defeasible if the condition be not strictly performedk to this class may also be referred all base fees and feesimples conditional at the common lawl thus an estate to a man and his heirs tenants of the manor of dale is an estate on condition that he and his heirs continue tenants of that manor and so if a personal annuity be granted at this day to a man and the heirs of his body as this is no tenement within the statute of westminster the second it remains as at common law a feesimple on condition that the grantee has heirs of his body upon the same principle depend all the determinable estates of freehold which we mentioned in the eighth chapter as durante viduitate c these are estates upon condition that the grantees do not marry and the like and on the breach of any of these      subsequent conditions by the failure of these contingencies by the grantees not continuing tenant of the manor of dale by not having heirs of his body or by not continuing sole the estates which were respectively vested in each grantee are wholly determinable and void a distinction is however made between a condition in deed and a limitation which littletonm denominates also a condition in law for when an estate is so expressly confined and limited by the words of its creation that it cannot endure for any longer time than till the contingency happens upon which the estate is to fail this is denominated a limitation as when land is granted to a     man so long as he is parson of dale or while he continues unmarried or until out of the rents and profits he shall have made  00l and the liken in such case the estate determines as soon as the contingency happens when he ceases to be parson marries a wife or has received the  00l and the next subsequent estate which depends upon such determination becomes immediately vested without any act to be done by him who is next in expectancy but when an estate is strictly speaking upon condition in deed as if granted expressly upon condition to be void upon the payment of  0l by the grantor or so that the grantee continues unmarried or provided he goes to york co the law permits it to endure beyond the time when such contingency happens unless the grantor or his heirs or assigns take advantage of the breach of the condition and make either an entry or a claim in order to avoid the estatep yet though strict words of condition be used in the creation of the estate if on breach of the condition the estate be limited over to a third person and does not immediately revert to the grantor or his representatives as if an estate be granted by a to b on condition that within two years b intermarry with c and on failure thereof then to d and his heirs this the law construes to be a limitation and not a      conditionq because if it were a condition then upon the breach thereof only a or his representatives could avoid the estate by entry and so ds remainder might be defeated by their neglecting to enter but when it is a limitation the estate of b determines and that of d commences and he may enter on the lands the instant that the failure happens so also if a man by his will devises land to his heir at law on condition that he pays a sum of money and for nonpayment devises it over this shall be considered as a limitation otherwise no advantage could be taken of the nonpayment for none but the heir himself could have entered for a breach of conditionr in all these instances of limitations or conditions subsequent it is to be observed that so long as the condition either express or implied either in deed or in law remains unbroken the grantee may have an estate of freehold provided the estate upon which such condition is annexed be in itself of a freehold nature as if the original grant express either an estate of inheritance or for life or no estate at all which is constructively an estate for life for the breach of these conditions being contingent and uncertain this uncertainty preserves the freeholds because the estate is capable to last forever or at least for the life of the tenant supposing the condition to remain unbroken but where the estate is at the utmost a chattel interest which must determine at a time certain and may determine sooner as a grant for ninetynine years provided a b and c or the survivor of them shall so long live this still continues a mere chattel and is not by such its uncertainty ranked among estates of freehold these express conditions if they be impossible at the time of their creation or afterwards become impossible by the act of god or the act of the feoffor himself or if they be contrary to law or repugnant to the nature of the estate are void in any of which cases if they be conditions subsequent      that is to be performed after the estate is vested the estate shall become absolute in the tenant as if a feoffment be made to a man in feesimple on condition that unless he goes to rome in twentyfour hours or unless he marries with jane s by such a day within which time the woman dies or the feoffor marries her himself or unless he kills another or in case he alienes in fee that then and in any of such cases the estate shall be vacated and determine here the condition is void and the estate made absolute in the feoffee for he hath by the grant the estate vested in him which shall not be defeated afterwards by a condition either impossible illegal or repugnantt but if the condition be precedent or to be performed before the estate vests as a grant to a man that if he kills another or goes to rome in a day he shall have an estate in fee here the void condition being precedent the estate which depends thereon     is also void and the grantee shall take nothing by the grant for he hath no estate until the condition be performedu there are some estates defeasible upon condition subsequent that require a more peculiar notice such are iii estates held in vadio in gage or pledge which are of two kinds vivum radium or living pledge and mortuum vadium dead pledge or mortgage vivum vadium or living pledge is when a man borrows a sum suppose  00l of another and grants him an estate as of  0l per annum to hold till the rents and profits shall repay the sum so borrowed this is an estate conditioned to be void as soon as such sum is raised and in this case the land or pledge is said to be living it subsists and survives the debt and immediately on the discharge of that results back to the borrowerw but mortuum vadium a dead pledge or mortgage which is much more common than the other is where a man borrows of another a specific sum eg  00l      and grants him an estate in fee on condition that if he the mortgagor shall repay the mortgagee the said sum of  00l on a certain day mentioned in the deed that then the mortgagor may reenter on the estate so granted in pledge or as is now the more usual way that then the mortgagee shall reconvey the estate to the mortgagor in this case the land which is so put in pledge is by law  in case of nonpayment at the time limited forever dead and gone from the mortgagor and the mortgagees estate in the lands is then no longer conditional but absolute but so long as it continues conditional that is between the time of lending the money and the time allotted for payment the mortgagee is called tenant in mortgagex but as it was formerly a doubty whether by taking such estate in fee it did not become liable to the wifes dower and other encumbrances of the mortgagee though that doubt has been long ago overruled by our courts of equityz it therefore became usual to grant only a long term of years by way of mortgage with condition to be void on repayment of the mortgagemoney which course has been since pretty generally continued principally because on the death of the mortgagee such term becomes vested in his personal representatives who alone are entitled in equity to receive the money lent of whatever nature the mortgage may happen to be as soon as the estate is created the mortgagee may immediately enter on the lands but is liable to be dispossessed upon performance of the condition by payment of the mortgagemoney at the day limited and therefore the usual way is to agree that the mortgagor shall hold the land till the day assigned for payment when in case of failure whereby the estate becomes absolute the mortgagee may enter upon it and take possession without any possibility at law of being afterwards evicted by the mortgagor to whom the land is now forever dead but here again the courts of equity interpose and though a mortgage be thus forfeited and the      estate absolutely vested in the mortgagee at the common law yet they will consider the real value of the tenements compared with the sum borrowed and if the estate be of greater value than the sum lent thereon they will allow the mortgagor at any reasonable time to recall or redeem his estate  paying to the mortgagee his principal     interest and expenses for otherwise in strictness of law an estate worth  000l might be forfeited for nonpayment of  00l or a less sum this reasonable advantage allowed to mortgagors is called the equity of redemption and this enables a mortgagor to call on the mortgagee who has possession of his estate to deliver it back and account for the rents and profits received on payment of his whole debt and interest thereby turning the mortuum into a kind of vivum vadium but on the other hand the mortgagee may either compel the sale of the estate in order to get the whole of his money immediately or else call upon the mortgagor to redeem his estate presently or in default thereof to be forever foreclosed from redeeming the same that is to lose his equity of redemption without possibility of recall and also in some cases of fraudulent mortgagesa the fraudulent mortgagor forfeits all equity of redemption whatsoever  it is not however usual for mortgagees to take possession of the mortgaged estate unless where the security is precarious or small or where the mortgagor neglects even the payment of interest when the mortgagee is frequently obliged to bring an ejectment 0 and take the land into his own hands     in the nature of a pledge or the pignus of the roman law whereas while it remains in the hands of the mortgagor it more resembles their hypotheca which was where the possession of the thing pledged remained with the debtorb   but by statute   geo ii c  0 after payment or tender by the mortgagor of principal interest and costs the mortgagee can maintain no ejectment but may be compelled to reassign his securities in glanvils time when the universal method of conveyance was by livery of seisin    0 or corporal tradition of the lands no gage or pledge of lands was good unless possession was also delivered to the creditor si non sequatur ipsius vadii traditio curia domini regis hujusmodi privatas conventiones tueri non solet for which the reason given is to prevent subsequent and fraudulent pledges of the same land cum in tali casu possit eadem res pluribus aliis creditoribus tum prius tum posterius invadiaric and the frauds which have arisen since the exchange of these public and notorious conveyances for more private and secret bargains have well evinced the wisdom of our ancient law     0 iv a fourth species of estates defeasible on condition subsequent are those held by statute merchant and statute staple which are very nearly related to the vivum vadium before mentioned or estate held till the profits thereof shall discharge a debt liquidated or ascertained for both the statute merchant and statute staple are securities for money the one entered into before the chief magistrate of some trading town pursuant to the statute    edw i de mercatoribus and thence called a statute merchant the other pursuant to the statute    edw iii c   before the mayor of the staple that is to say the grand mart for the principal commodities or manufactures of the kingdom formerly held by act of parliament in certain trading townsd from whence this security is called a statute staple they are both i say securities for debts acknowledged to be due and originally permitted only among traders for the benefit of commerce whereby not only the body of the debtor may be imprisoned and his goods seized in satisfaction of the debt but also his lands may be delivered to the creditor till out of the rents and profits of them the debt may be satisfied and during such time as the creditor so holds the lands he is tenant by statute merchant or statute staple there is also a similar security the recognizance in the nature of a statute staple acknowledged before either of the chief   0 justices or out of term before their substitutes the mayor of the staple at westminster and the recorder of london whereby the benefit of this mercantile transaction extended to all the kings subjects in general by virtue of the statute    hen viii c   amended by   geo i c    which directs such recognizances to be enrolled and certified into chancery but these by the statute of frauds    car ii c   are only binding upon the lands in the hands of bona fide purchasers from the day of their enrolment which is ordered to be marked on the record v another similar conditional estate created by operation of law for security and satisfaction of debts is called an      estate by elegit what an elegit is and why so called will be explained in the third part of these commentaries at present i need only mention that it is the name of a writ founded on the statutee of westm   by which after a plaintiff has obtained judgment for his debt at law the sheriff gives him possession of onehalf of the defendants lands and tenements to be occupied and enjoyed until his debt and damages are fully paid and during the time he so holds them he is called tenant by elegit it is easy to observe that this is also a mere conditional estate defeasible as soon as the debt is levied but it is remarkable that the feodal restraints of alienating lands and charging them with the debts of the owner were softened much earlier and much more effectually for the benefit of trade and commerce than for any other consideration before the statute of quia emptoresf it is generally thought that the proprietor of lands was enabled to alienate no more than a moiety of them the statute therefore of westm   permits only so much of them to be affected by the process of law as a man was capable of alienating by his own deed but by the statute de mercatoribus passed in the same yearg the whole of a mans lands was liable to be pledged in a statute merchant for a debt contracted in trade though onehalf of them was liable to be taken in execution for any other debt of the owner i shall conclude what i had to remark of these estates by statute merchant statute staple and elegit with the observation of sir edward cokeh these tenants have uncertain interests in lands and tenements and yet they have but chattels and no freeholds which makes them an exception to the general rule because though they may hold an estate of inheritance or for life ut liberum tenementum until their debt be paid yet it shall go to their executors for ut is similitudinary and though to recover their estates they shall have the same remedy by assize as a tenant of the freehold shall havei yet it is but the      similitude of a freehold and nullum simile est idem this indeed only proves them to be chattel interests because they go to the executors which is inconsistent with the nature of a freehold but it does not assign the reason why these estates in contradistinction to other uncertain interests shall vest in the executors of the tenant and not the heir which is probably owing to this that being a security and remedy provided for personal debts due to the deceased to which debts the executor is entitled the law has therefore thus directed their succession as judging it reasonable from a principle of natural equity that the security and remedy should be vested in those to whom the debts if recovered would belong for upon the same principle if lands be devised to a mans executor until out of their profits the debts due from the testator be discharged this interest in the lands shall be a chattel interest and on the death of such executor shall go to his executorsk because they being liable to pay the original testators debts so far as his assets will extend are in reason entitled to possess that fund out of which he has directed them to be paid     chapter xi estates in possession remainder and reversion hitherto we have considered estates solely with regard to their duration or the quantity of interest which the owners have therein we are now to consider them in another view with regard to the time of their enjoyment when the actual pernancy of the profits that is the taking perception or receipt of the rents and other advantages arising therefrom begins estates therefore with respect to this consideration may either be in possession or in expectancy and of expectancies there are two sorts one created by the act of the parties called a remainder the other by act of law and called a reversion  i of estates in possession which are sometimes called estates executed whereby a present interest passes to and resides in the tenant not depending on any subsequent circumstance or contingency as in the case of estates executory there is little or nothing peculiar to be observed all the estates we have hitherto spoken of are of this kind for in laying down general rules we usually apply them to such estates as are then actually in the tenants possession but the doctrine of estates in expectancy contains some of the nicest and most abstruse learning in the english law these will therefore require a minute discussion and demand some degree of attention ii an estate then in remainder may be defined to be an estate limited to take effect and be enjoyed after another estate is determined      as if a man seised in feesimple granteth lands to a for twenty years and after the determination of the said term then to b and his heirs forever here a is tenant for years remainder to b in fee in the first place an estate for years is created or carved out of the fee and given to a and the residue or remainder of it is given to b but both these interests are in fact only one estate the present term of years and the remainder afterwards when added together being equal only to one estate in feea they are indeed different parts but they constitute only one whole they are carved out of one and the same inheritance they are both created and may both subsist together the one in possession the other in expectancy so if land be granted to a for twenty years and after the determination of the said term to b for life and after the determination of bs estate for life it be limited to c and his heirs forever this makes a tenant for years with remainder to b for life remainder over to c in fee now here the estate of inheritance undergoes a division into three portions there is first as estate for years carved out of it and after that bs estate for life and then the whole that remains is limited to c and his heirs and here also the first estate and both the remainders for life and in fee are one estate only being nothing but parts or portions of one entire inheritance and if there were a hundred remainders it would still be the same thing upon a principle grounded in mathematical truth that all the parts are equal and no more than equal to the whole and hence also it is easy to collect that no remainder     can be limited after the grant of an estate in feesimpleb because a feesimple is the highest and largest estate that a subject is capable of enjoying and he that is tenant in fee hath in him the whole of the estate a remainder therefore which is only a portion or residuary part of the estate cannot be reserved after the whole is disposed of a particular estate with all      the remainders expectant thereon is only one feesimple as  0l is part of  00l and  0l is the remainder of it wherefore after a feesimple once vested there can no more be a remainder limited thereon than after the whole  00l is appropriated there can be any residue subsisting thus much being premised we shall be the better enabled to comprehend the rules that are laid down by law to be observed in the creation of remainders and the reasons upon which those rules are founded   and first there must necessarily be some particular estate precedent to the estate in remainderc as an estate for years to a remainder to b for life or an estate for life to a remainder to b in tail this precedent estate is called the particular estate as being only a small part or particula of the inheritance the residue or remainder of which is granted over to another the necessity of creating this preceding particular estate in order to make a good remainder arises from this plain reason that remainder is a relative expression and implies that some part of the thing is previously disposed of for where the whole is conveyed at once there cannot possibly exist a remainder but the interest granted whatever it be will be an estate in possession an estate created to commence at a distant period of time without any intervening estate is therefore properly no remainder it is the whole of the gift and not a residuary part and such future estates can only be made of chattel interests which were considered in the light of mere contracts by the ancient lawd to be executed either now or hereafter as the contracting parties should agree but an estate of freehold must be created to commence immediately for it is an ancient rule of the common law that an estate of freehold cannot be created to commence in futuro but it ought to take effect presently either in possession or remaindere because at      common law no freehold in lands could pass without livery of seisin which must operate either immediately or not at all it would therefore be contradictory if an estate which is not to commence till hereafter could be granted by a conveyance which imports an immediate possession therefore though a lease to a for seven years to commence from next michaelmas is good yet a conveyance to b of lands to hold to him and his heirs forever from the end of three years next ensuing is void  so that when it is intended to grant an estate of freehold whereof the enjoyment shall be deferred till a future time it is necessary to create a previous particular estate which may subsist till that period of time is completed and for the grantor to deliver immediate possession of the land to the tenant of this particular estate which is construed to be giving possession to him in remainder since his estate and that of the particular tenant are one and the same estate in law as where one leases to a for three years with remainder to b in fee and makes livery of seisin to a here by the livery the freehold is immediately created and vested in b during the continuance of as     term of years the whole estate passes at once from the grantor to the grantees and the remainderman is seised of his remainder at the same time that the termor is possessed of his term the enjoyment of it must indeed be deferred till hereafter but it is to all intents and purposes an estate commencing in præsenti though to be occupied and enjoyed in futuro as no remainder can be created without such a precedent particular estate therefore the particular estate is said to support the remainder but a lease at will is not held to be such a particular estate as will support a remainder overf for an estate at will is of a nature so slender and precarious that it is not looked upon as a portion of the inheritance and a portion must first be taken out of it in order to constitute a remainder besides if it be a freehold remainder livery of seisin must be given at the time of its creation and the entry of the grantor to do this determines the estate at will      in the very instant in which it is madeg or if the remainder be a chattel interest though perhaps the deed of creation might operate as a future contract if the tenant for years be a party to it yet it is void by way of remainder for it is a separate independent contract distinct from the precedent estate at will and every remainder must be part of one and the same estate out of which the preceding particular estate is takenh and hence it is generally true that if the particular estate is void in its creation or by any means is defeated afterwards the remainder supported thereby shall be defeated alsoi as where the particular estate is an estate for the life of a person not in essek or an estate for life upon condition on breach of which condition the grantor enters and avoids the estatel in either of these cases the remainder over is void   a second rule to be observed is this that the remainder must commence or pass out of the grantor at the time of the creation of the particular estatem as where there is an estate to a for life with remainder to b in fee here bs remainder in fee passes from the grantor at the same time that seisin is delivered to a of his lifeestate in possession and it is this which induces the necessity at common law of livery of seisin being made on the particular estate whenever a freehold remainder is created for if it be limited even on an estate for years it is necessary that the lessee for years should have livery of seisin in order to convey the freehold from and out of the grantor otherwise the remainder is voidn not that the livery is necessary to strengthen the estate for years but as livery of the land is requisite to convey the freehold and yet cannot be given to him in remainder without infringing the possession of the lessee for years therefore the law allows such livery made to the tenant of the particular estate to relate and enure to him in remainder as both are but one estate in lawo        a third rule respecting remainders is this that the remainder must vest in the grantee during the continuance of the particular estate or eo instanti that it determinesp as if a be tenant for life remainder to b in tail here bs remainder is vested in him at the creation of the particular estate to a for life or if a and b be tenants for their joint lives remainder to the survivor in fee here though during their joint lives the remainder is vested in neither yet on the death of either of them the remainder vests instantly in the survivor wherefore both these are good remainders but if an estate be limited to a for life remainder to the eldest son of b in tail and a dies before b hath any son here the remainder will be void for it did not vest in any one during the continuance nor at the determination of the particular estate and even supposing that b should afterwards have a son he shall not take by this remainder for as it did not vest at or before the end of the particular estate it never can vest at all but is gone foreverq and this depends upon the principle before laid down that the precedent particular estate and the remainder are one estate in law they must therefore subsist and be in esse at one and the     same instant of time either during the continuance of the first estate or at the very instant when that determines so that no other estate can possibly come between them for there can be no intervening estate between the particular estate and the remainder supported therebyr the thing supported must fall to the ground if once its support be severed from it  it is upon these rules but principally the last that the doctrine of contingent remainders depends for remainders are either vested or contingent vested remainders or remainders executed whereby a present interest passes to the party though to be enjoyed in futuro are where the estate is invariably fixed to remain to a determinate person after the      particular estate is spent as if a be tenant for twenty years remainder to b in fee here bs is a vested remainder which nothing can defeat or set aside contingent or executory remainders whereby no present interest passes are where the estate in remainder is limited to take effect either to a dubious and uncertain person or upon a dubious and uncertain event so that the particular estate may chance to be determined and the remainder never take effects  first they may be limited to a dubious and uncertain person as if a be tenant for life with remainder to bs eldest son then unborn in tail this is a contingent remainder for it is uncertain whether b will have a son of no but the instant that a son is born the remainder is no longer contingent but vested     though if a had died before the contingency happened that is before bs son was born the remainder would have been absolutely gone for the particular estate was determined before the remainder could vest nay by the strict rule of law if a were tenant for life remainder to his eldest son in tail and a died without issue born but leaving his wife enseint or big with child and after his death a posthumous son was born this son could not take the land by virtue of this remainder for the particular estate determined before there was any person in esse in whom the remainder could vestt but to remedy this hardship it is enacted by statute  0     w iii c    that posthumous children shall be capable of taking in remainder in the same manner as if they had been born in their fathers lifetime that is the remainder is allowed to vest in them while yet in their mothers wombu  this species of contingent remainders to a person not in being must however be limited to some one that may by common possibility or potentia propinqua be in esse at or before the particular estate determinesw as if an estate be   0    0 made to a for life remainder to the heirs of b now if a dies before b the remainder is at an end for during bs life he has no heir nemo est hæres viventis but if b dies first the remainder then immediately vests in his heir who will be entitled to the land on the death of a this is a good contingent remainder for the possibility of bs dying before a is potentia propinqua and therefore allowed in lawx but a remainder to the right heirs of b if there be no such person as b in esse is voidy for here there must two contingencies happen first that such a person as b shall be born and secondry that he shall also die during the continuance of the particular estate which make it potentia remotissima a most improbable possibility a remainder to a mans eldest son who hath none we have seen is good for by common possibility he may have one but if it be limited in particular to his son john or richard it is bad if he have no son of that name for it is too remote a possibility that he should not only have a son but a son of a particular namez  a limitation of a remainder to a bastard before it is born is not gooda  for though the law allows the possibility of having bastards it presumes it to be a very remote and improbable contingency thus may a remainder be contingent on account of the uncertainty of the person who is to take it a remainder may also be contingent where the person to whom it is limited is fixed and certain but the event upon which it is to take effect is vague and uncertain as where land is given to a for life and in case b survives him   0 then with remainder to b in fee here b is a certain person but the remainder to him is a contingent remainder depending upon a dubious event the uncertainty of his surviving a during the joint lives of a and b it is contingent and if b dies first it never can vest in his heirs but is forever gone but if a dies first the remainder to b becomes vested      contingent remainders of either kind if they amount to a freehold cannot be limited on an estate for years or any other particular estate less than a freehold thus if land be granted to a for ten years with remainder in fee to the right heirs of b this remainder is voidb but if granted to a for life with a like remainder it is good for unless the freehold passes out of the grantor at the time when the remainder is created such freehold remainder is void it cannot pass out of him without vesting somewhere and in the case of a contingent remainder it must vest in the particular tenant else it can vest nowhere unless therefore the estate of such particular tenant be of a freehold nature the freehold cannot vest in him and consequently the remainder is void  contingent remainders may be defeated by destroying or determining the particular estate upon which they depend before the contingency happens whereby they become vestedc therefore when there is tenant for life with divers remainders in contingency he may not only by his death but by alienation surrender or other methods destroy and determine his own lifeestate before any of those remainders vest the consequence of which is that he utterly defeats them all  as if there be tenant for life with remainder to his eldest son unborn in tail and the tenant for life before any son is born surrenders his lifeestate he by that means defeats the remainder in tail to his son for his son not being in esse when the particular estate determined the remainder could not then vest and as it could not vest then by the rules before laid down it never can vest at all in these cases therefore it is necessary to have trustees appointed to preserve the contingent remainders in whom there is vested an estate in remainder for the life of the tenant for life to commence when his estate determines 0 if therefore his estate for life determines otherwise than by his death the estate of the trustees for the residue of his natural life will then take effect and become a      particular estate in possession sufficient to support the remainders depending in contingency this method is said to have been invented by sir orlando bridgman sir geoffrey palmer and other eminent counsel who betook themselves to conveyancing during the time of the civil wars in order thereby to secure in family settlements a provision for the future children of an intended marriage who before were usually left at the mercy of the particular tenant for lifed and when after the restoration     these gentlemen came to fill the first offices of the law they supported this invention within reasonable and proper bounds and introduced it into general use   thus the student will observe how much nicety is required in creating and securing a remainder and i trust he will in some measure see the general reasons upon which this nicety is founded it were endless to attempt to enter upon the particular subtleties and refinements into which this doctrine by the variety of cases which have occurred in the course of many centuries has been spun out and subdivided neither are they consonant to the design of these elementary disquisitions   i must not however omit that in devises by last will and testament which being often drawn up when the party is inops consilii are always more favoured in construction than formal deeds which are presumed to be made with great caution forethought and advice in these devises i say remainders may be created in some measure contrary to the rules before laid down though our lawyers will not allow such dispositions to be strictly remainders but call them by another name that of executory devises or devises hereafter to be executed an executory devise of lands is such a disposition of them by will that thereby no estate vests at the death of the devisor but only on some future contingency   it differs from a remainder in three very material points   that it needs not any      particular estate to support it   that by it a feesimple or other less estate may be limited after a feesimple   that by this means a remainder may be limited of a chattel interest after a particular estate for life created in the same   the first case happens when a man devises a future estate to arise upon a contingency and till that contingency happens does not dispose of the feesimple but leaves it to descend to his heirs at law as if one devises land to a femesole and her heirs upon her day of marriage here is in effect a contingent remainder without any particular estate to support it a freehold commencing in futuro this limitation though it would be void in a deed yet is good in a will by way of executory devisee for since by a devise a freehold may pass without corporal tradition or livery of seisin as it must do if it passes at all therefore it may commence in futuro because the principal reason     why it cannot commence in futuro in other cases is the necessity of actual seisin which always operates in præsenti and since it may thus commence in futuro there is no need of a particular estate to support it the only use of which is to make the remainder by its unity with the particular estate a present interest and hence also it follows that such an executory devise not being a present interest cannot be barred by a recovery suffered before it commencesf   by executory devise a fee or other less estate may be limited after a fee and this happens where a devisor devises his whole estate in fee but limits a remainder thereon to commence on a future contingency as if a man devises land to a and his heirs but if he dies before the age of twentyone then to b and his heirs this remainder though void in deed is good by way of executory deviseg but in both these species of executory devises the contingencies ought to be such as may happen within a reasonable time as within one or more life or lives in being or within a mode      rate term of years for courts of justice will not indulge even wills so as to create a perpetuity which the law abhorsh because by perpetuities or the settlement of an interest which shall go in the succession prescribed without any power of alienationi estates are made incapable of answering those ends of social commerce and providing for the sudden contingencies of private life for which property was at first established the utmost length that has been hitherto allowed for the contingency of an executory devise of either kind to happen in is that of a life or lives in being and oneandtwenty years afterwards as when lands are devised to such unborn son of a femecovert as shall first attain the age of twentyone and his heirs the utmost length of time that can happen before the estate can vest is the life of the mother and the subsequent infancy of her son and this hath been decreed to be a good executory devisek         by executory devise a term of years may be given to one man for his life and afterwards limited over in remainder to another which could not be done by deed for by law the first grant of it to a man for life was a total disposition of the whole term a lifeestate being esteemed of a higher and larger nature than any term of yearsl and at first the courts were tender even in the case of a will of restraining the devisee for life from aliening the term but only held that in case he died without exerting that act of ownership the remainder over should then take placem for the restraint of the power of alienation especially in very long terms was introducing a species of perpetuity but soon afterwards it was heldn that the devisee for life hath no power of aliening the term so as to bar the remainderman yet in order to prevent the danger of perpetuities it was settledo that though such remainders may be limited to as many persons successively as the devisor thinks proper yet they must all be      in esse during the life of the first devisee for then all the candles are lighted and are consuming together and the ultimate remainder is in reality only to that remainderman who happens to survive the rest and it was also settled that such remainder may not be limited to take effect unless upon such contingency as must happen if at all during the life of the first deviseep       thus much for such estates in expectancy as are created by the express words of the parties themselves the most intricate title in the law there is yet another species which is created by the act and operation of the law itself and this is called a reversion iii an estate in reversion is the residue of an estate left in the grantor to commence in possession after the determination of some particular estate granted out by himq sir edward coker describes a reversion to be the returning of land to the grantor or his heirs after the grant is over as if there be a gift in tail the reversion of the fee is without any special reservation vested in the donor by act of law and so also the reversion after an estate for life years or at will continues in the lessor for the feesimple of all lands must abide somewhere and if he who was before possessed of the whole carves out of it any smaller estate and grants it away whatever is not so granted remains in him a reversion is never therefore created by deed or writing but arises from construction of law a remainder can never be limited unless by either deed or devise but both are equally transferable when actually vested being both estates in præsenti though taking effect in future the doctrine of reversions is plainly derived from the feodal constitution for when a feud was granted to a man for life or to him and his issue male rendering either rent or other services then on his death or the failure of issue male the feud was determined and resulted back to the      lord or proprietor to be again disposed of at his pleasure and hence the usual incidents to reversions are said to be fealty and rent when no rent is reserved on the particular estate fealty however results of course as an incident quite inseparable and may be demanded as a badge of tenure or acknowledgment of superiority being frequently the only evidence that the lands are holden at all where rent is reserved it is also incident though not inseparably so to the reversions the rent may be granted away reserving the reversion and the reversion may be granted away reserving the rent by special words but by a general grant of the reversion the rent will pass with it as incident thereunto though by the grant of the rent generally the reversion will not pass the incident passes by the grant of the principal but not e converso for the maxim of law is accessorium non ducit sed sequitur suum principalet these incidental rights of the reversioner and the respective modes of descent in which remainders very frequently differ from reversions have occasioned the law to be careful in distinguishing the one from the other however inaccurately the parties themselves may describe them for if one seised of a paternal estate in fee makes a lease for life with remainder to himself and his heirs this is properly a mere reversionu to which rent and fealty shall be incident and which shall only descend to the heirs of his fathers blood and not to his heirs general as a remainder limited to him by a third person would have donew for it is the old estate which was originally in him and never yet was out of him and so likewise if a man grants a lease for life to a reserving rent with reversion to b and his heirs b hath a remainder descendible to his heirs general and not a reversion to which the rent is incident but the grantor shall be entitled to the rent during the continuance of as estatex      in order to assist such persons as have any estate in remainder reversion or expectancy after the death of others against fraudulent concealments of their death it is enacted by the statute   anne c    that all persons on whose lives any lands or tenements are holden shall upon application to the court of chancery and order made thereupon once in every year if required be produced to the court or its commissioners or upon neglect or refusal they shall be taken to be actually dead and the person entitled to such expectant     estate may enter upon and hold the lands and tenements till the party shall appear to be living before we conclude the doctrine of remainders and reversions it may be proper to observe that whenever a greater estate and a less coincide and meet in one and the same person without any intermediate estatey the less is immediately annihilated or in the law phrase is said to be merged   that is sunk or drowned in the greater thus if there be tenant for years and the reversion in feesimple descends to or is purchased by him the term of years is merged in the inheritance and shall never exist any more but they must come to one and the same person in one and the same right else if the freehold be in his own right and he has a term in right of another en auter droit there is no merger   therefore if tenant for years dies and makes him who hath the reversion in fee his executor whereby the term of years vests also in him the term shall not merge for he hath the fee in his own right and the term of years in the right of the testator and subject to his debts and legacies so also if he who hath the reversion in fee marries the tenant for years there is no merger for he hath the inheritance in his own right the lease in the right of his wifez an estatetail is an exception to this rule for a man may have in his own right both an estatetail and a reversion in fee and the estatetail though a less estate shall not merge in the feea for estatestail are protected and preserved from merger by the      operation and construction though not by the express words of the statute de donis which operation and construction have probably arisen upon this consideration that in the     common cases of merger of estates for life or years by uniting with the inheritance the particular tenant hath the sole interest in them and hath full power at any time to defeat destroy or surrender them to him that hath the reversion therefore when such an estate unites with the reversion in fee the law considers it in the light of a virtual surrender of the inferior estateb but in an estatetail the case is otherwise the tenant for a long time had no power at all over it so as to bar or destroy it and now can only do it by certain special modes by a fine a recovery and the likec it would therefore have been strangely improvident to have permitted the tenant in tail by purchasing the reversion in fee to merge his particular estate and defeat the inheritance of his issue and hence it has become a maxim that a tenancy in tail which cannot be surrendered cannot also be merged in the fee chapter xii of estates in severalty jointtenancy coparcenary and common we come now to treat of estates with respect to the number and connections of their owners the tenants who occupy and hold them and considered in this view estates of any quantity or length of duration and whether they be in actual possession or expectancy may be held in four different ways in severalty in jointtenancy in coparcenary and in common  i he that holds lands or tenements in severalty or is sole tenant thereof is he that holds them in his own right only without any other person being joined or connected with him in point of interest during his estate therein this is the most common and usual way of holding an estate and therefore we may make the same observations here that we did upon estates in possession as contradistinguished from those in expectancy in the preceding chapter that there is little or nothing peculiar to be remarked concerning it since all estates are supposed to be of this sort unless where they are expressly declared to be otherwise and that in laying down general rules and doctrines we usually apply them to such estates as are held in severalty i shall therefore proceed to consider the other three species of estates in which there are always a plurality of tenants    0 ii an estate in jointtenancy is where lands or tenements are granted to two or more persons to hold in feesimple feetail for life for years or at will in consequence of such grants an estate is called an estate in jointtenancya and sometimes an estate in jointure which word as well as the other signifies a union or conjunction of interest though in common speech the term jointure is now usually confined to that jointestate which by virtue of the statute    hen viii c    is frequently vested in the husband and wife before marriage as a full satisfaction and bar of the womans dowerb in unfolding this title and the two remaining ones in the present chapter we will first inquire how these estates may be created next their properties and respective incidents and lastly how they may be severed or destroyed   the creation of an estate in jointtenancy depends on the wording of the deed or devise by which the tenants claim title for this estate can only arise by purchase or grant that is by the act of the parties and never by the mere act of law now if an estate be given to a plurality of persons without adding any restrictive exclusive or explanatory words  as if an estate be granted to   0 a and b and their heirs this makes them immediately jointtenants in fee of the lands for the law interprets the grant so as to make all parts of it take effect which can only be done by creating an equal estate in them both as therefore the grantor has thus united their names the law gives them a thorough union in all other respects  for   the properties of a jointestate are derived from its unity which is fourfold the unity of interest the unity of title the unity of time and the unity of possession or in other words jointtenants have one and the same interest accruing by one and the same conveyance commencing at one and the same time and held by one and the same undivided possession          first they must have one and the same interest  one jointtenant cannot be entitled to one period of duration or quantity of interest in lands and the other to a different one cannot be tenant for life and the other for years one cannot be tenant in fee and the other in tailc but if land be limited to a and b for their lives this makes them jointtenants of the freehold if to a and b and their heirs it makes them jointtenants of the inheritanced  if land be granted to a and b for their lives and to the heirs of a here a and b are jointtenants of the freehold during their respective lives and a has the remainder of the fee in severalty  or if land be given to a and b and the heirs of the body of a here both have a jointestate for life and a hath a several remainder in taile  secondly jointtenants must also have a unity of title their estate must be created by one and the same act whether legal or illegal as by one and the same grant or by one and the same disseisinf jointtenancy cannot arise by descent or act of law but merely by purchase or acquisition by the act of the party and unless that act be one and the same the two tenants would have different titles and if they had different titles one might prove good and the other bad which would absolutely destroy the jointure thirdly there must also be a unity of time their estates must be vested at one     and the same period as well as by one and the same title as in case of a present estate made to a and b or a remainder in fee to a and b after a particular estate in either case a and b are jointtenants of this present estate or this vested remainder but if after a lease for life the remainder be limited to the heirs of a and b and during the continuance of the particular estate a dies which vests the remainder of one moiety in his heir and then b dies whereby the other moiety becomes vested in the heir of b now as heir and bs heir are not jointtenants of this remainder but tenants in common for one moiety vested at one time and the other moiety vested at anotherg      yet where a feoffment was made to the use of a man and such wife as he should afterwards marry for term of their lives and he afterwards married in this case it seems to have been held that the husband and wife had a jointestate though vested at different timesh  because the use of the wifes estate was in abeyance and dormant till the intermarriage and being then awakened had relation back and took effect from the original time of creation  lastly in jointtenancy there must be a unity of possession jointtenants are said to be seised per my et per tout by the half or moiety and by all that is they each of them have the entire possession as well of every parcel as of the wholei they have not one of them a seisin of one half or moiety and the other of the other moiety neither can one be exclusively seised of one acre and his companion of another but each has an undivided moiety of the whole and not the whole of an undivided moietyj and therefore if an estate in fee be given to a man and his wife they are neither properly jointtenants nor tenants in common for husband and wife being considered as one person in law they cannot take the estate by moieties but both are seised of the entirety per tout et non per my the consequence of which is that neither the husband nor the wife can dispose of any part without the assent of the other but the whole must remain to the survivork 0     upon these principles of a thorough and intimate union of interest and possession depend many other consequences and incidents to the jointtenants estate if two jointtenants let a verbal lease of their land reserving rent to be paid to one of them it shall enure to both in respect of the jointreversionl   if their lessee surrenders his lease to one of them it shall also enure to both because of the privity or relation of their estatem on the same reason livery of seisin made to one jointtenant shall enure to both of themn and the entry or reentry of one jointtenant is as effectual in law as if it were the act of botho in all actions also relating to their jointestate one jointtenant cannot sue or be sued without joining the otherp   but if two or more jointtenants be seised of an advowson and they present different clerks the bishop     may refuse to admit either because neither jointtenant hath a several right of patronage but each is seised of      the whole and if they do not both agree within six months the right of presentation shall lapse but the ordinary may if he pleases admit a clerk presented by either for the good of the church that divine service may be regularly performed which is no more than he otherwise would be entitled to do in case their disagreement continued so as to incur a lapse and if the clerk of one jointtenant be so admitted this shall keep up the title in both of them in respect of the privity and union of their estateq upon the same ground it is held that one jointtenant cannot have an action against another for trespass in respect of his landr for each has an equal right to enter on any part of it but one jointtenant is not capable by himself to do any act which may tend to defeat or injure the estate of the other   as to let leases or to grant copyholdss and if any waste be done which tends to the destruction of the inheritance one jointtenant may have an action of waste against the other by construction of the statute westm   c   t so too though at common law no action of account lay for one jointtenant against another unless he had constituted him his bailiff or receiveru yet now by the statute   anne c    jointtenants may have actions of account against each other for receiving more than their due share of the profits of the tenements held in jointtenancy   from the same principle also arises the remaining grand incident of jointestates viz the doctrine of survivorship by which when two or more persons are seised of a joint estate of inheritance for their own lives or pur auter vie or are jointly possessed of any chattelinterest the entire tenancy upon the decease of any of them remains to the survivors and at length to the last survivor and he shall be entitled to the whole estate whatever it be whether an inheritance or a common freehold only or even a less estatew   this is the natural and regular consequence of the union and entirety of their interest the interest of two jointtenants      is not only equal or similar but also is one and the same one has not originally a distinct moiety from the other but if by any subsequent act as by alienation or forfeiture of either the interest becomes separate and distinct the jointtenancy instantly ceases but while it continues each of two jointtenants has a concurrent interest in the     whole and therefore on the death of his companion the sole interest in the whole remains to the survivor for the interest which the survivor originally had is clearly not devested by the death of his companion and no other person can now claim to have a jointestate with him for no one can now have an interest in the whole accruing by the same title and taking effect at the same time with his own neither can any one claim a separate interest in any part of the tenements for that would be to deprive the survivor of the right which he has in all and every part as therefore the survivors original interest in the whole still remains and as no one can now be admitted either jointly or severally to any share with him therein it follows that his own interest must now be entire and several and that he shall alone be entitled to the whole estate whatever it be that was created by the original grant   this right of survivorship is called by our ancient authorsx the jus accrescendi because the right upon the death of one jointtenant accumulates and increases to the survivors or as they themselves express it pars illa communis accrescit superstitibus de persona in personam usque ad ultimam superstitem and this jus accrescendi ought to be mutual which i apprehend to be one reason why neither the kingy nor any corporationz can be a jointtenant with a private person for here is no mutuality the private person has not even the remotest chance of being seised of the entirety by benefit of survivorship for the king and the corporation can never die          we are lastly to inquire how an estate in jointtenancy may be severed and destroyed and this may be done by destroying any of its constituent unities   that of time which respects only the original commencement of the jointestate cannot indeed being now past be affected by any subsequent transactions but   the jointtenants estate may be destroyed without any alienation by merely disuniting their possession for jointtenants being seised per my et per tout every thing that tends to narrow that interest so that they shall not be seised throughout the whole and throughout every part is a severance or destruction of the jointure and therefore if two jointtenants agree to part their lands and hold them in severalty they are no longer jointtenants for they have now no jointinterest in the whole but only a several interest respectively in the several parts and for that reason also the right of survivorship is by such separation destroyeda by common law all the jointtenants might agree to make partition of the lands but one of them could not compel the other so to dob for this being an estate originally created by the act and agreement of the parties the law would not permit any one or more of them to destroy the united possession without a similar universal consent but now by the statutes    hen viii c   and    hen viii c        jointtenants either of inheritances or other less estates are compellable by writ of partition to divide their landsc   the jointure may be destroyed by destroying the unity of title as if one jointtenant alienes and conveys his estate to a third person here the jointtenancy is severed and turned into tenancy in commond for the grantee and the remaining jointtenant hold by different titles one derived from the original the other from the subsequent grantor though till partition made the unity of possession continues   but a devise of ones share by will      is no severance of the jointure   for no testament takes effect till after the death of the testator and by such death the right of the survivor which accrued at the original creation of the estate and has therefore a priority to the othere is already vestedf 0   it may also be destroyed by destroying the unity of interest and therefore if there be two jointtenants for life and the inheritance is purchased by or descends upon either it is a severance of the jointureg though if an estate is originally limited to two for life and after to the heirs of one of them the freehold shall remain in jointure without merging in the inheritance because being created by one and the same conveyance they are not separate estates which is requisite in order to a merger but branches of one entire estateh in like manner if a jointtenant in fee makes a lease for life of his share this defeats the jointurei for it destroys the unity both of title and of interest and whenever or by whatever means the jointure ceases or is severed the right of survivorship or jus accrescendi the same instant ceases with itk yet if one of three jointtenants alienes his share the two remaining tenants still hold their parts by jointtenancy and survivorshipl and if one of three jointtenants release his share to one of his companions though the jointtenancy is destroyed with regard to that part yet the two remaining parts are still held in jointurem for they still preserve their original constituent unities but when by an act or event different interests are created in the several parts of the estate or they are held by different titles or if merely the possession is separated so that the tenants have no longer these four indispensable properties a sameness of interest and undivided possession a title vesting at one and the same time and by one and the same act or grant the jointure is instantly dissolved          in general it is advantageous for the jointtenants to dissolve the jointure since thereby the right of survivorship is taken away and each may transmit his own part to his own heirs sometimes however it is disadvantageous to dissolve the jointestate as if there be jointtenants for life and they make partition this dissolves the jointure and though before they each of them had an estate in the whole for their own lives and the life of their companion now they have an estate in a moiety only for their own lives merely and on the death of either the reversioner shall enter on his moietyn and therefore if there be two jointtenants for life and one grants away his part for the life of his companion it is a forfeitureo for in the first place by the severance of the jointure he has given himself in his own moiety only an estate for his own life and then he grants the same land for the life of another which grant by a tenant for his own life merely is a forfeiture of his estatep for it is creating an estate which may by possibility last longer than that which he is legally entitled to iii an estate held in coparcenary is where lands of inheritance descend from the ancestor to two or more persons it arises either by common law or particular custom by common law as where a person seised in feesimple or in feetail dies and his next heirs are two or more females his daughters sisters aunts cousins or their representatives in this case they shall all inherit as will be more fully shown when we treat of descents hereafter and these coheirs are then called coparceners or for brevity parceners onlyq parceners by particular custom are where lands descend as in gavelkind to all the males in equal degree as sons brothers uncles cr and in either of these cases all the parceners put together make but one heir and have but one estate among thems      the properties of parceners are in some respects like those of jointtenants they having the same unities of interest title and possession they may sue and be sued jointly for matters relating to their own landst and the entry of one of them shall in some cases enure as the entry of them allu they cannot have an action of trespass against each other but herein they differ from jointtenants that they are also excluded from maintaining an action of wastew for coparceners could at all times put a stop to any waste by writ of partition but till the statute of henry the eighth jointtenants had no such power parceners also differ materially from jointtenants in four other points   they always claim by descent whereas jointtenants always claim by purchase therefore if two sisters purchased lands to hold to them and their heirs they are not parceners but jointtenantsx and hence it likewise follows that no lands can be held in coparcenary but estates of inheritance which are of a descendible nature whereas not only estates in fee and in tail but for life or years may be held in jointtenancy   there is no unity of time necessary to an estate in coparcenary for if a man had two daughters to whom his estate descends in coparcenary and one dies before the other the surviving daughter and the heir of the other or when both are dead their two heirs are still parcenersy the estates vesting in each of them at different times though it be the same quantity of interest and held by the same title   parceners though they have a unity have not an entirety of interest they are properly entitled each to the whole of a distinct moietyz and of course there is no jus accrescendi or survivorship between them for each part descends severally to their respective heirs though the unity of possession continues and as long as the lands continue in a course of descent and united in possession so long are the tenants therein whether male or female called parceners but if      the possession be once severed by partition they are no longer parceners but tenants in severalty or if one parcener     alienes her share though no partition be made then are the lands no longer held in coparcenary but in commona   parceners are so called saith littletonb because they may be constrained to make partition   and he mentions many methods of making itc four of which are by consent and one by compulsion the first is where they agree to divide the lands into equal parts in severalty and that each shall have such a determinate part the second is when they agree to choose some friend to make partition for them and then the sisters shall choose each of them her part according to seniority of age or otherwise as shall be agreed the privilege of seniority is in this case personal for if the eldest sister be dead her issue shall not choose first but the next sister but if an advowson descend in coparcenary and the sisters cannot agree in the presentation the eldest and her issue nay her husband or her assigns shall present alone before the youngerd   and the reason given is that the former privilege of priority in choice upon a division arises from an act of her own the agreement to make partition and therefore is merely personal the latter of presenting to the living arises from the act of the law and is annexed not only to her person but to her estate also a third method of partition is where the eldest divides and then she shall choose last for the rule of law is cujus est divisio alterius est electio the fourth method is where the sisters agree to cast lots for their shares and these are the methods by consent that by compulsion is where one or more sue out a writ of partition against the others whereupon the sheriff shall go to the lands and make partition thereof by the verdict of a jury there impanelled and assign to each of the parceners her part in severaltye but there are some things    0 which are in their nature impartible the mansionhouse common of estovers common of piscary uncertain or any other common without stint shall not be divided but the eldest sister if she pleases shall have them and make the others a reasonable satisfaction in other parts of the inheritance or if that cannot be then they shall have the profits of the thing by turns in the same manner as they take the advowsonf there is yet another consideration attending the estate in coparcenary that if one of the daughters has had an estate given with her in frankmarriage by her ancestor which we may remember was a species of estatestail freely given by a relation for advancement of his kinswoman in marriageg in this case if lands descend from the same ancestor to her and her sisters in feesimple she or her heirs shall have no share of them unless they will agree to divide the lands so given in frankmarriage in equal proportion with the rest of the lands descendingh this mode of division was known in the law of the lombardsi which directs the woman so preferred in marriage and claiming her   0 share of the inheritance mittere in confusum cum sororibus quantum pater aut frater ei dederit quando ambulaverit ad maritum with us it is denominated bringing those lands into hotchpotk which term i shall explain in the very words of littletonl it seemeth that this word hotchpot is in english a pudding for in a pudding is not commonly put one thing alone but one thing with other things together by this housewifely metaphor our ancestors meant to inform usm that the lands both those given in frankmarriage and those descending in feesimple should be mixed and blended together and then divided in equal portions among all the daughters but this was left to the choice of the donee in frankmarriage and if she did not choose to put her lands into hotchpot she was presumed to be sufficiently      provided for and the rest of the inheritance was divided among her other sisters the law of hotchpot took place then only when the other lands descending from the ancestor were feesimple for if they descended in tail the donee in frankmarriage was entitled to her share without bringing her lands so given into hotchpotn and the reason is because lands descending in feesimple are distributed by the policy of law for the maintenance of all the daughters and if one has a sufficient provision out of the same inheritance equal to the rest it is not reasonable that she should have more but lands descending in tail are not distributed by the operation of the law but by the designation of the giver per forman doni it matters not therefore how unequal this distribution may be also no lands but such as are given in frankmarriage shall be brought into hotchpot for no others are looked upon in law as given for the advancement of the woman or by way of marriageportiono and therefore as gifts in frankmarriage are fallen into disuse i should hardly have mentioned the law of hotchpot had not this method of division been revived and copied by the statute for distribution of personal estates which we shall hereafter consider at large the estate in coparcenary may be dissolved either by partition which disunites the possession by alienation of one parcener which disunites the title and may disunite the interest or by the whole at last descending to and vesting in one single person which brings it to an estate in severalty iv tenants in common are such as hold by several and distinct titles but by unity of possession because none knoweth his own severalty and therefore they all occupy promiscuouslyp this tenancy therefore happens where there is a unity of possession merely but perhaps an entire disunion of interest of title and of time for if there be two tenants in common of lands one may hold his part in feesimple the other in tail or for life so that there is no      necessary unity of interest one may hold by descent the other by purchase or the one by purchase from a the other by purchase from b so that there is no unity of title ones estate may have been vested fifty years the others but yesterday so there is no unity of time the only unity there is is that of possession and for this littleton gives the true reason because no man can certainly tell which part is his own otherwise even this would be soon destroyed tenancy in common may be created either by the destruction of the two other estates in jointtenancy and coparcenary or by special limitation in a deed by the destruction of the two other estates i mean such destruction as does not sever the unity of possession but only the unity of title or interest as if one of two jointtenants in fee alienes his estate for the life of the alienee the alienee and the other jointtenant are tenants in common for they have now several titles the other jointtenant by the original grant the alienee by the new alienationq and they also have several interests the former jointtenant in feesimple the alienee for his own life only so if one jointtenant gives his part to a in tail and the other gives his to b in tail the donees are tenants in common as holding by different titles and conveyancesr if one of two parceners alienes the alienee and the remaining parcener are tenants in     commons because they hold by different titles the parcener by descent the alienee by purchase so likewise if there be a grant to two men or two women and the heirs of their bodies here the grantees shall be jointtenants of the lifeestate but they shall have several inheritances because they cannot possibly have one heir of their two bodies as might have been the case had the limitation been to a man and woman and the heirs of their bodies begottent and in this and the like cases their issue shall be tenants in common because they must claim by different titles one as heir of a and the other as heir of b and those two not titles by      purchase but descent in short whenever an estate in jointtenancy or coparcenary is dissolved so that there be no partition made but the unity of possession continues it is turned into a tenancy in common a tenancy in common may also be created by express limitation in a deed but here care must be taken not to insert words which imply a jointestate and then if lands be given to two or more and it be not jointtenancy it must be a tenancy in common but the law is apt in its constructions to favour jointtenancy rather than tenancy in commonu because the divisible services issuing from land as rent c are not divided nor the entire services as fealty multiplied by jointtenancy as they must necessarily be upon a tenancy in common land given to two to be holden the one moiety to one and the other moiety to the other is an estate in commonw and if one grants to another half his land the grantor and grantee are also tenants in commonx because as has been beforey observed jointtenants do not take by distinct halves or moieties and by such grants the division and severalty of the estate is so plainly expressed that it is impossible they should take a jointinterest in the whole of the tenements but a devise to two persons to hold jointly and severally is said to be a jointtenancyz because that is necessarily implied in the word jointly the word severally perhaps only implying the power of partition and an estate given to a and b equally to be divided between them though in deeds it hath been said to be a jointtenancya   for it implies no more than the law has annexed to that estate viz divisibilityb yet in wills it is certainly a tenancy in commonc because the devisor may be presumed to have meant what is most beneficial to both the devisees though his meaning is imperfectly expressed   and this nicety in the wording of grants makes it the most usual as well as the safest way when a tenancy in common      is meant to be created to add express words of exclusion as well as     description and limit the estate to a and b to hold as tenants in common and not as jointtenants as to the incidents attending a tenancy in common tenants in common like jointtenants are compellable by the statutes of henry viii and william iii before mentionedd to make partition of their lands which they were not at common law they properly take by distinct moieties and have no entirety of interest and therefore there is no survivorship between tenants in common   their other incidents are such as merely arise from the unity of possession and are therefore the same as appertain to jointtenants merely upon that account such as being liable to reciprocal actions of waste and of account by the statutes of westm   c    and   anne c    for by the common law no tenant in common was liable to account with his companion for embezzling the profits of the estatee though if one actually turns the other out of possession an action of ejectment will lie against himf   but as for other incidents of jointtenants which arise from the privity of title or the union and entirety of interest such as joining or being joined in actionsg unless in the case where some entire or indivisible thing is to be recoveredh these are not applicable to tenants in common whose interests are distinct and whose titles are not joint but several       estates in common can only be dissolved two ways   by uniting all the titles and interests in one tenant by purchase or otherwise which brings the whole to one severalty   by making partitions between the several tenants in common which gives them all respective severalties for indeed tenancies in common differ in nothing from sole estates but merely in the blending and unity of possession and this finishes our inquiries with respect to the nature of estates chapter xiii of the title to things real in general the foregoing chapters having been principally employed in defining the nature of things real in describing the tenures by which they may be holden and in distinguishing the several kinds of estate or interest that may be had therein i now come to consider lastly the title to things real with the manner of acquiring and losing it a title is thus defined by sir edward cokea—titulus est justa causa possidendi id quod nostrum est or it is the means whereby the owner of lands hath the just possession of his property there are several stages or degrees requisite to form a complete title to lands and tenements we will consider them in a progressive order i the lowest and most imperfect degree of title consists in the mere naked possession or actual occupation of the estate without any apparent right or any shadow or pretence of right to hold and continue such possession this     may happen when one man invades the possession of another and by force or surprise turns him out of the occupation of his lands which is termed a disseisin being a deprivation of that actual seisin or corporal freehold of the lands which the tenant before enjoyed or it may happen that after the death of the ancestor and before the entry of      the heir or after the death of a particular tenant and before the entry of him in remainder or reversion a stranger may contrive to get possession of the vacant land and hold out him that had a right to enter in all which cases and many others that might be here suggested the wrongdoer has only a mere naked possession which the rightful owner may put an end to by a variety of legal remedies as will more fully appear in the third book of these commentaries but in the mean time till some act be done by the rightful owner to devest this possession and assert his title such actual possession is prima facie evidence of a legal title in the possessor and it may by length of time and negligence of him who hath the right by degrees ripen into a perfect and indefeasible title  and at all events without such actual possession no title can be completely good ii the next step to a good and perfect title is the right of possession which may reside in one man while the actual possession is not in himself but in another for if a man be disseised or otherwise kept out of possession by any of the means before mentioned though the actual possession be lost yet he has still remaining in him the right of possession and may exert it whenever he thinks proper by entering upon the disseisor and turning him out of that occupancy which he has so illegally gained but this right of possession is of two sorts an apparent right of possession which may be defeated by proving a better and an actual right of possession which will stand the test against all opponents thus if the disseisor or other wrongdoer dies possessed of the land whereof he so became seised by his own unlawful act and the same descends to his heir now by the common law the heir hath obtained an apparent right though the actual right of possession resides in the person disseised and it shall not be lawful for the person disseised to devest this apparent right by mere entry or other act of his own but only by an action at lawb for until the contrary be proved by legal demonstration the law will rather presume the right to      reside in the heir whose ancestor died seised than in one who has no such presumptive evidence to urge in his own behalf which doctrine in some measure arose from the principles of the feodal law which after feuds became hereditary much favoured the right of descent in order that there might be a person always upon the spot to perform the feodal duties and servicesc and therefore when a feudatory died in battle or otherwise it presumed always that his children were entitled to the feud till the right was otherwise determined by his fellowsoldiers and fellowtenants the peers of the feodal court but if he who has the actual right of possession puts in his claim and brings his action within a reasonable time and can prove by what unlawful     means the ancestor became seised he will then by sentence of law recover that possession to which he hath such actual right  yet if he omits to bring this his possessory action within a competent time his adversary may imperceptibly gain an actual right of possession in consequence of the others negligence and by this and certain other means the party kept out of possession may have nothing left in him but what we are next to speak of viz iii the mere right of property the jus proprietatis without either possession or even the right of possession this is frequently spoken of in our books under the name of the mere right jus merum and the estate of the owner is in such cases said to be totally devested and put to a rightd a person in this situation may have the true ultimate property of the lands in himself but by the intervention of certain circumstances either by his own negligence the solemn act of his ancestor or the determination of a court of justice the presumptive evidence of that right is strongly in favour of his antagonist who has thereby obtained the absolute right of possession as in the first place if a person disseised or turned out of possession of his estate neglects to pursue his remedy within the time limited by law by this means the disseisor or his heirs gain the actual right of possession      for the law presumes that either he had a good right originally in virtue of which he entered on the lands in question or that since such his entry he has procured a sufficient title and therefore after so long an acquiescence the law will not suffer his possession to be disturbed without inquiring into the absolute right of property yet still if the person disseised or his heir hath the true right of property remaining in himself his estate is indeed said to be turned into a mere right but by proving such his better right he may at length recover the lands again if a tenant in tail discontinues his estatetail by alienating the lands to a stranger in fee and dies here the issue in tail hath no right of possession independent of the right of property for the law presumes prima facie that the ancestor would not disinherit or attempt to disinherit his heirs unless he had power so to do and therefore as the ancestor had in himself the right of possession and has transferred the same to a stranger the law will not permit that possession now to be disturbed unless by showing the absolute right of property to reside in another person the heir therefore in this case has only a mere right and must be strictly held to the proof of it in order to recover the lands lastly if by accident neglect or otherwise judgment is given for either party in any possessory action that is such wherein the right of possession only and not that of property is contested and the other party hath indeed in himself the right of property this is now turned to a mere right and upon proof thereof in a subsequent action denominated a writ of right he shall recover his seisin of the lands      thus if a disseisor turns me out of possession of my lands he thereby gains a mere naked possession and i still retain the right of possession and right of property if the disseisor dies and the lands descend to his son the son gains an apparent right of possession but i still retain the actual right both of possession and property if i acquiesce for thirty years without bringing any action to recover possession of the lands the son gains the actual right of possession and i retain      nothing but the mere right of property and even this right of property will fail or at least it will be without a remedy unless i pursue it within the space of sixty years so also if the father be tenant in tail and alienes the estatetail to a stranger in fee the alienee thereby gains the right of possession and the son hath only the mere right or right of property and hence it will follow that one man may have the possession another the right of possession and a third the right of property for if a tenant in tail enfeoffs a in feesimple and dies and b disseises a now b will have the possession a the right of possession and the issue in tail the right of property a may recover the possession against b and afterwards the issue in tail may evict a and unite in himself the possession the right of possession and also the right of property in which union consists iv a complete title to lands tenements and hereditaments for it is an ancient maxim of the lawe that no title is completely good unless the right of possession be joined with the right of property which right is then denominated a double right jus duplicatum or droit droitf and when to this double right the actual possession is also united when there is according to the expression of fletag juris et seisinæ conjunctio then and then only is the title completely legal  chapter xiv of title by descent the several gradations and stages requisite to form a complete title to lands tenements and hereditaments having been briefly stated in the preceding chapter we are next to consider the several manners in which this complete title and therein principally the right of property may be reciprocally lost and acquired whereby the dominion of things real is either continued or transferred from one man to another and here we must first of all observe that as gain and loss are terms of relation and of a reciprocal nature by whatever method one man gains an estate by that same method or its correlative some other man has lost it as where the heir acquires by descent the ancestor has first lost or abandoned his estate by his death where the lord gains land by escheat the estate of the tenant is first of all lost by the natural or legal extinction of all his hereditary blood where a man gains an interest by occupancy the former owner has previously relinquished his right of possession where one man claims  00 by prescription or immemorial usage another man has either parted with his right by an ancient and now forgotten grant or has forfeited it by the supineness or neglect of himself and his ancestors for ages and so in case of forfeiture the tenant by his own misbehaviour or neglect has renounced his interest in the estate whereupon it devolves to that person who by law may take advantage of such default and in alienation by common assurances   0  the two considerations of loss and acquisition are so interwoven and so constantly contemplated together that we never hear of a conveyance without at once receiving the ideas as well of the grantor as the grantee the methods therefore of acquiring on the one hand and of losing on the other a title to estates in things real are reduced by our law to two descent where the title is vested in a man by the single operation of law and purchase where the title is vested in him by his own act or agreementa  descent or hereditary succession is the title whereby a man on the death of his ancestor acquires his estate by right of representation as his heir at law an heir therefore is he upon whom the law casts the estate immediately on the  0  death of the ancestor  and an estate so descending to the heir is in law called the inheritance the doctrine of descents or law of inheritances in feesimple is a point of the highest importance and is indeed the principal object of the laws of real property in england all the rules relating to purchases whereby the legal course of descents is broken and altered perpetually refer to this settled law of inheritance as a datum or first principle universally known and upon which their subsequent limitations are to work thus a gift in tail or to a man and the heirs of his body is a limitation that cannot be perfectly understood without a previous knowledge of the law of descents in feesimple one may well perceive that this is an estate confined in its descent to such heirs only of the donee as have sprung or shall spring from his body but who those heirs are whether all his children both male and female or the male only and among the males whether the eldest youngest or other son alone or all the sons together shall be his heirs this is a point that we must result back to the standing law of descents in feesimple to be informed of   0  in order therefore to treat a matter of this universal consequence the more clearly i shall endeavour to lay aside such matters as will only tend to breed embarrassment and confusion in our inquiries and shall confine myself entirely to this one object i shall therefore decline considering at present who are and who are not capable of being heirs reserving that for the chapter of escheats i shall also pass over the frequent division of descents into those by custom statute and common law for descents by particular custom as to all the sons in gavelkind and to the youngest in borough english have already been oftenb hinted at and may also be incidentally touched upon again but will not make a separate consideration by themselves in a system so general as the present and descents by statute or feestail per formam doni in pursuance of the statute of westminster the second have also been alreadyc copiously handled and it has been seen that the descent in tail is restrained and regulated according to the words of the original donation and does not entirely pursue the commonlaw doctrine of inheritance which and which only it will now be our business to explain and as this depends not a little on the nature of kindred and the several degrees of consanguinity it will be previously necessary to state as briefly as possible the true notion of this kindred or alliance in bloodd consanguinity or kindred is defined by the writers on these subjects to be vinculum personarum ab eodem stipite descendentium the connection or relation of persons descended from the same stock or common ancestor this consanguinity is either lineal or collateral   0  lineal consanguinity is that which subsists between persons of whom one is descended in a direct line from the other as between john stiles the propositus in the table of consanguinity and his father grandfather greatgrandfather and so upwards in the direct ascending line or between john stiles and his son grandson greatgrandson and so downwards in the direct descending line every generation in this lineal direct consanguinity constitutes a different degree reckoning either upwards or downwards the father of john stiles is related to him in the first degree and so likewise is his son his grandsire and grandson in the second his greatgrandsire and greatgrandson in the third this is the only natural way of reckoning the degrees  0  nil  0  in the direct line and therefore universally obtains as well in the civile and canonf as in the common lawg  table of consanguinity the doctrine of lineal consanguinity is sufficiently plain and obvious but it is at the first view astonishing to consider the number of lineal ancestors which every man has within no very great number of degrees and so many different bloodsh is a man said to contain in his veins as he hath lineal ancestors of these he hath two in the first ascending degree his own parents he hath four in the second the parents of his father and the parents of his mother he hatl eight in the third the parents of his two grandfathers and two grandmothers and by the same rule of progression he hath an hundred and twentyeight in the seventh a thousand and twentyfour in the tenth and at the twentieth degree or the distance of twenty generations every man hath above a million of ancestors as common arithmetic will demonstratei this lineal consanguinity we may observe falls strictly within the definition of vinculum   0  personarum ab eodem stipite descendentium since lineal relations are such as descend one from the other and both of course from the same common ancestor collateral kindred answers to the same description collateral relations agreeing with the lineal in this that they descend from the same stock or ancestor but differing in this that they do not descend one from the other collateral kinsmen are such then as lineally spring from one and the same ancestor who is the stirps or root the stipes trunk or common stock from whence these relations are branched out as if john stiles hath two sons who have   0  each a numerous issue both these issues are lineally descended from john stiles as their common ancestor and they are collateral kinsmen to each other because they are all descended from this common ancestor and all have a portion of his blood in their veins which denominates them consanguineos we must be careful to remember that the very being of collateral consanguinity consists in this descent from one and the same common ancestor thus titius and his brother are related why because both are derived from one father titius and his first cousin are related why because both descend from the same grandfather and his second cousins claim to consanguinity is this that they are both derived from one and the same greatgrandfather in short as many ancestors as a man has so many common stocks he has from which collateral kinsmen may be derived and as we are taught by holy writ that there is one couple of ancestors belonging to us all from whom the whole race of mankind is descended the obvious and undeniable consequence is that all men are in some degree related to each other for indeed if we only suppose each couple of our ancestors to have left one with another two children and each of those children on an average to have left two more and without  0  such a supposition the human species must be daily diminishing we shall find that all of us have now subsisting near two hundred and seventy millions of kindred in the fifteenth degree at the same distance from the several common ancestors as ourselves are besides those that are one or two descents nearer to or farther from the common stock who may amount to as many morek and if this calculation should appear incompatible with the number of inhabitants on the earth it is because by intermarriages among the several descendants from the same ancestor a hundred or a thousand modes of consanguinity may be consolidated in one person or he may be related to us a hundred or a thousand different ways   0  the method of computing these degrees in the canon lawl which our law has adoptedm is as follows we begin at the common ancestor and reckon downwards and in whatsoever degree the two persons or the most remote of them is distant from the common ancestor that is the degree in which they are related to each other thus titius and his brother are related in the first   0  degree for from the father to each of them is counted only one titius and his nephew are related in the second degree for the nephew is two degrees removed from the common ancestor viz his own grandfather the father of titius or to give a more illustrious instance from our english annals king henry the seventh who slew richard the third in the battle of bosworth was related to that prince in the fifth degree let the propositus therefore in the table of consanguinity represent  0  king richard the third and the class marked e king henry the seventh now their common stock or ancestor was king edward the third the abavus in the same table from him to edmond duke of york the proavus is one degree to richard earl of cambridge the avus two to richard duke of york the pater three to king richard the third the propositus four and from king edward the third to john of gant a is one degree to john earl of somerset b two to john duke of somerset c three to margaret countess of richmond d four to king henry the seventh e five which lastmentioned prince being the farthest removed from the common stock gives the denomination to the degree of kindred in the canon and municipal law though according to the computation of the civilians who count upwards from either of the persons related to the common stock and then downwards again to the other reckoning a degree for each person both ascending and descending these two princes were related in the ninth degree for from richard the third to richard duke of york is one degree to richard earl of cambridge two to edmond duke of york three to king edward the third the common ancestor four to john of gant five to john earl of somerset six to john duke of somerset seven to margaret countess of richmond eight to king henry the seventh ninen    0  the nature and degrees of kindred being thus in some measure explained i shall next proceed to lay down a series of rules or canons of inheritance according to which estates are transmitted from the ancestor to the heir together with an explanatory comment remarking their original and progress the reasons upon which they are founded and in some cases their agreement with the laws of other nations i the first rule is that inheritances shall lineally descend to the issue of the person who last died actually seised in infinitum but shall never lineally ascend to explain the more clearly both this and the subsequent rules it must first be observed that by law no inheritance can vest nor can any person be the actual complete heir of another till the ancestor is previously dead nemo est hæres viventis  before that time the person who is next in the line of succession is called an heir apparent or heir presumptive heirs apparent are such whose  0  right of inheritance is indefeasible provided they outlive the ancestor as the eldest son or his issue who must by the course of the common law be heir to the father whenever he happens to die heirs presumptive are such who if the ancestor should die immediately would in the present circumstances of things be his heirs but whose right of inheritance may be defeated by the contingency of some nearer heir being born as a brother or nephew whose presumptive succession may be destroyed by the birth of a child or a daughter whose present hopes may be hereafter cut off by the birth of a son nay even if the estate hath descended by the death of the owner to such brother or nephew or daughter in the former cases the estate shall be devested and taken away by the birth of a posthumous child and in the latter it shall also be totally devested by the birth of a posthumous sono    0  we must also remember that no person can be properly such an ancestor as that an inheritance of lands or tenements can be derived from him unless he hath had actual seisin of such lands either by his own entry or by the possession of his own or his ancestors lessee for years or by receiving rent from a lessee of a freeholdp  or unless he hath had what is equivalent to corporal seisin in hereditaments that are incorporeal such as the receipt of rent a presentation to the church in case of an advowsonq and the like but he shall not be accounted an ancestor who hath had only a bare right or title to enter or be otherwise seised and therefore all the cases which will be mentioned in the present chapter are upon the supposition that the deceased whose inheritance is now claimed was the last person actually seised thereof for the law requires this notoriety of possession as evidence that the ancestor had that property in himself which is now to be transmitted to his heir  which notoriety had succeeded in the place of the ancient feodal investiture  0  whereby while feuds were precarious the vassal on the descent of lands was formerly admitted in the lords court as is still the practice in scotland and there received his seisin in the nature of a renewal of his ancestors grant in the presence of the feodal peers till at length when the right of succession became indefeasible an entry on any part of the lands within the county which if disputed was afterwards to be tried by those peers or other notorious possession was admitted as equivalent to the formal grant of seisin and made the tenant capable of transmitting his estate by descent the seisin therefore of any person thus understood makes him the root or stock from  0  which all future inheritance by right of blood must be derived which is very briefly expressed in this maxim seisina facit stipitemr    0 when therefore a person dies so seised the inheritance first goes to his issue as if there be geoffrey john and matthew grandfather father and son and john purchases lands and dies his son matthew shall succeed him as heir and not the grandfather geoffrey to whom the land shall never ascend but shall rather escheat to the lords  this rule so far as it is affirmative and relates to lineal descents is almost universally adopted by all nations and it seems founded on a principle of natural reason that whenever a right of property transmissible to representatives is admitted the possessions of the parents should go upon their decease in the first place to their children as those to whom they have given being and for whom they are therefore bound to provide but the negative branch or total exclusion of parents and all lineal ancestors from succeeding to the inheritance of their offspring is peculiar to our own laws and such as have been deduced from the same original for by the jewish law on failure of issue the father succeeded to the son in exclusion of brethren unless one of them married the widow and raised up seed to his brothert and by the laws of rome in the first place the children or lineal descendants were preferred and on failure of these the father and mother or lineal ascendants succeeded together with the brethren and sistersu though by the law of the twelve tables the mother was originally on account of her sex excludedv hence this rule of our laws has been censured and declaimed against as absurd and derogating from the maxims of equity and natural justicew yet that there is nothing unjust or absurd in it but that on the contrary it is founded upon very good legal reason may appear from considering as well the nature of the rule itself as the occasion of introducing it into our laws      we are to reflect in the first place that all rules of succession to estates are creatures of the civil polity and juris positivi merely the right of property which is gained by occupancy extends naturally no further than the life of the present possessor after which the land by the law of nature would again become common and liable to be seised by the next occupant but society to prevent the mischiefs that might ensue from a doctrine so productive of contention has established conveyances wills and successions whereby the property originally gained by possession is continued and transmitted from one man to another according to the rules which each state has respectively thought proper to prescribe there is certainly therefore no injustice done to individuals whatever be the path of descent marked out by the municipal law if we next consider the time and occasion of introducing this rule into our law we shall find it to have been grounded upon very substantial reasons i think there is no doubt to be made but that it was introduced at the same time with and in consequence of the feodal tenures for it was an express rule of     the feodal lawx that successionis feudi talis est natura quod ascendentes non succedunt and therefore the same maxim obtains also in the french law to this dayy 0 our henry the first indeed among other restorations of the old saxon laws restored the right of succession in the ascending linez but this soon fell again into disuse for so early as glanvils time who wrote under henry the second we find it laid down as established lawa that hæreditas nunquam ascendit which has remained an invariable maxim ever since these circumstances evidently show this rule to be of feodal original and taken in that light there are some arguments in its favour besides those which are drawn      merely from the reason of the thing for if the feud of which the son died seised was really feudum antiquum or one descended to him from his ancestors the father could not possibly succeed to it because it must have passed him in the course of descent before it could come to the son unless it were feudum maternum or one descended from his mother and then for other reasons which will appear hereafter the father could in no wise inherit it and if it were feudum novum or one newly acquired by the son then only the descendants from the body of the feudatory himself could succeed by the known maxim of the early feodal constitutionsb which was founded as well upon the personal merit of the vassal which might be transmitted to his children but could not ascend to his progenitors as also upon this consideration of military policy that the decrepit grandsire of a vigorous vassal would be but indifferently qualified to succeed him in his feodal services nay even if this feudum novum were held by the son ut feudum antiquum or with all the qualities annexed to a feud descended from his ancestors such feud must in all respects have descended as if it had been really an ancient feud and therefore could not go to the father because if it had been an ancient feud the father must have been dead before it could have come to the son thus whether the feud was strictly novum or strictly antiquum or whether it was novum held ut antiquum in none of these cases the father could possibly succeed these reasons drawn from the history of the rule itself seem to be more satisfactory than that quaint one of bractonc adopted by sir edward coked which regulates the descent of lands according to the laws of gravitation   ii a second general rule or canon is that the male issue shall be admitted before the female      thus sons shall be admitted before daughters or as our male lawgivers have somewhat uncomplaisantly expressed it the worthiest of blood shall be preferrede as if john stiles hath two sons matthew and gilbert and two daughters margaret and charlotte and dies first matthew and in case of his death without issue then gilbert shall be admitted to the succession in preference to both the daughters this preference of males to females is entirely agreeable to the law of succession among the jewsf and also among the states of greece or at least among the atheniansg but was totally unknown to the laws of romeh such of     them i mean as are at present extant wherein brethren and sisters were allowed to succeed to equal portions of the inheritance i shall not here enter into the comparative merit of the roman and the other constitutions in this particular nor examine into the greater dignity of blood in the male or female sex but shall only observe that our present preference of males to females seems to have arisen entirely from the feodal law for though our british ancestors the welsh appear to have given a preference to malesi yet our danish predecessors who succeeded them seem to have made no distinction of sexes but to have admitted all the children at once to the inheritancek but the feodal law of the saxons on the continent which was probably brought over higher and first altered by the law of king canute gives an evident preference of the male to the female sex pater aut mater defuncti filio non filiæ hæreditatem relinquent      qui defunctus non filios sed filias reliquerit ad eas omnis hæreditas pertineatl it is possible therefore that this preference might be a branch of that imperfect system of feuds which obtained here before the conquest especially as it subsists among the customs of gavelkind and as in the      charter or laws of king henry the first it is not like many norman innovations given up but rather enforcedm the true reason of preferring the males must be deduced from feodal principles for by the genuine and original policy of that constitution no female could ever succeed to a proper feudn inasmuch as they were incapable of performing those military services for the sake of which that system was established but our law does not extend to a total exclusion of females as the salic law and others where feuds were most strictly retained it only postpones them to males for though daughters are excluded by sons yet they succeed before any collateral relations our law like that of the saxon feudists before mentioned thus steering a middle course between the absolute rejection of females and the putting them on a footing with males iii a third rule or canon of descent is this that where there are two or more males in equal degree the eldest only shall inherit but the females all together   as if a man hath two sons matthew and gilbert and two daughters margaret and charlotte and dies matthew his eldest son shall alone succeed to his estate in exclusion of gilbert the second son and both the daughters but if both the sons die without issue before the father the daughters margaret and charlotte shall both inherit the estate as coparcenerso this right of primogeniture in males seems anciently to have only obtained among the jews in whose constitution the eldest son had a double portion of the inheritancep in the same manner as with us by the laws of king henry the firstq the eldest son had the capital fee or principal feud of his fathers possessions and no other preeminence and      as the eldest daughter had afterwards the principal mansion when the estate descended in coparcenaryr the greeks the romans the britons the saxons and even     originally the feudists divided the lands equally some among all the children at large some among the males only this is certainly the most obvious and natural way and has the appearance at least in the opinion of younger brothers of the greatest impartiality and justice but when the emperors began to create honorary feuds or titles of nobility it was found necessary in order to preserve their dignity to make them impartibles or as they styled them feuda individua and in consequence descendible to the eldest son alone this example was further enforced by the inconveniences that attended the splitting of estates namely the division of military services the multitude of infant tenants incapable of performing any duty the consequential weakening of the strength of the kingdom and the inducing younger sons to take up with the business and idleness of a country life instead of being serviceable to themselves and the public by engaging in mercantile in military in civil or in ecclesiastical employmentst these reasons occasioned an almost total change in the method of feodal inheritances abroad so that the eldest male began universally to succeed to the whole of the lands in all military tenures and in this condition the feodal constitution was established in england by william the conqueror yet we find that socage estates frequently descended to all the sons equally so lately as when glanvilu wrote in the reign of henry the second and it is mentioned in the mirrorw as a part of our ancient constitution that knights fees should descend to the eldest son and socage fees should be partible among the male children however in henry the thirds time we find by bractonx that socage lands in imitation of lands in chivalry had almost entirely fallen into the right of succession by primogeniture as the law now stands      except in kent where they gloried in the preservation of their antient gavelkind tenure of which a principal branch was a joint inheritance of all the sonsy and except in some particular manors and townships where their local customs continued the descent sometimes to all sometimes to the youngest son only or in other more singular methods of succession as to the females they are still left as they were by the antient law for they were all equally incapable of performing any personal service and therefore one main reason of preferring the eldest ceasing such preference would have been injurious to the rest and the other principal purpose the prevention of the too minute subdivision of estates was left to be considered and provided for by the lords who had the disposal of these female heiresses in marriage however the succession by primogeniture even among females took place as to the inheritance of the crownz wherein the necessity of a sole and determinate succession is as great in the one sex as the other and the right of sole succession though not of primogeniture was also established with respect to female dignities and titles of honour for if a man holds an earldom to him and the heirs of his body and dies leaving only daughters the eldest shall not of course be countess but the dignity is in suspense or abeyance till the king shall declare his pleasure for he being the fountain of honour may confer it on which of them he pleasesa   in which disposition is preserved a strong trace     of the antient law of feuds before the descent by primogeniture even among the males was established namely that the lord might bestow them on which of the sons he thought proper—progressum est ut ad filios deveniret in quem scilicet dominus hoc vellet beneficium confirmareb iv a fourth rule or canon of descents is this that the lineal descendants in infinitum of any person deceased      shall represent their ancestor that is shall stand in the same place as the person himself would have done had he been living thus the child grandchild or greatgrandchild either male or female of the eldest son succeeds before the younger son and so in infinitumc and these representatives shall take neither more nor less but just so much as their principals would have done as if there be two sisters margaret and charlotte and margaret dies leaving six daughters and then john stiles the father of the two sisters dies without other issue these six daughters shall take among them exactly the same as their mother margaret would have done had she been living that is a moiety of the lands of john stiles in coparcenary so that upon partition made if the land be divided into twelve parts thereof charlotte the surviving sister shall have six and her six nieces the daughters of margaret one apiece this taking by representation is called succession in stirpes according to the roots since all the branches inherit the same share that their root whom they represent would have done and in this manner also was the jewish succession directedd but the roman somewhat differed from it in the descending line the right of representation continued in infinitum and the inheritance still descended in stirpes as if one of three daughters died leaving ten children and then the father died the two surviving daughters had each onethird of his effects and the ten grandchildren had the remaining third divided between them and so among collaterals if any person of equal degree with the persons represented were still subsisting as if the deceased left one brother and two nephews the sons of another brother the succession was still guided by the roots but if both of the brethren were dead leaving issue then i apprehend their representatives in equal degree became themselves principals      and shared the inheritance per capita that is share and share alike they being themselves now the next in degree to the ancestor in their own right and not by right of representatione so if the next heirs of titius be six nieces three by one sister two by another and one by a third his inheritance by the roman law was divided into six parts and one given to each of the nieces whereas the law of england in this case would still divide it only into three parts and distribute it per stirpes thus onethird to the three children who represent one sister another third to the two who represent the second and the remaining third to the one child who is the sole representative of her mother this mode of representation is a necessary consequence of the double preference given by our law first to the male issue and next to the firstborn among the males to both which the roman law is a stranger for if all the children of three sisters were in england to claim per capita in their own right as next of kin to the ancestor without any respect to the stocks from whence they sprung and those children were partly male and partly female then the eldest male among them would exclude not only his own brethren and sisters but all the issue of the other two daughters or else the law in this instance must be inconsistent with itself and depart from the preference which it constantly gives to the males and the firstborn among persons in equal degree whereas by dividing the inheritance according to the roots or stirpes the rule of descent is kept uniform and steady the issue of the eldest son excludes all other pretenders     as the son himself if living would have done but the issue of two daughters divide the inheritance between them provided their mothers if living would have done the same and among these several issues or representatives of the respective roots the same preference to males and the saine right of primogeniture obtain as would have obtained at the first among the roots themselves the sons or daughters of the deceased and if a man hath two sons a and b and a dies leaving two      sons and then the grandfather dies now the eldest son of a shall succeed to the whole of his grandfathers estate and if a had left only two daughters they should have succeeded also to equal moieties of the whole in exclusion of b and his issue but if a man hath only three daughters c d and e and c dies leaving two sons d leaving two daughters and e leaving a daughter and a son who is younger than his sister here when the grandfather dies the eldest son of c shall succeed to onethird in exclusion of the younger the two daughters of d to another third in partnership and the son of e to the remaining third in exclusion of his elder sister and the same right of representation guided and restrained by the same rules of descent prevails downwards in infinitum   yet this right does not appear to have been thoroughly established in the time of henry the second when glanvil wrote and therefore in the title to the crown especially we find frequent contests between the younger but surviving brother and his nephew being the son and representative of the elder deceased in regard to the inheritance of their common ancestor for the uncle is certainly nearer of kin to the common stock by one degree than the nephew though the nephew by representing his father has in him the right of primogeniture the uncle also was usually better able to perform the services of the fief and besides had frequently superior interest and strength to back his pretensions and crush the right of his nephew and even to this day in the lower saxony proximity of blood takes place of representative primogeniture that is the younger surviving brother is admitted to the inheritance before the son of an elder deceased which occasioned the disputes between the two houses of mecklenburg schwerin and strelitz in     f yet glanvil with us even in the twelfth century seemsg to declare for the right of the nephew by representation provided the eldest son had not received a provision in lands from his father or as the civil law would call it had not been    0 forisfamiliated in his lifetime king john however who kept his nephew arthur from the throne by disputing this right of representation did all in his power to abolish it throughout the realmh but in the time of his son king henry the third we find the rule indisputably settled in the manner we have here laid it downi and so it has continued ever since and thus much for lineal descents     0 v a fifth rule is that on failure of lineal descendants or issue of the person last seised the inheritance shall descend to his collateral relations being of the blood of the first purchaser   subject to the three preceding rules     0 thus if geoffrey stiles purchases land and it descends to john stiles his son and john dies seised thereof without issue whoever succeeds to this inheritance must be of the blood of geoffrey the first purchaser of this familyk   the first purchaser perquisitor is he who first acquired the estate to his family whether the same was transferred to him by sale or by gift or by any other method except only that of descent this is a rule almost peculiar to our own laws and those of a similar original for it was entirely unknown among the jews greeks and romans none of whose laws looked any further than the person himself who died seised of the estate but assigned him an heir without considering by what title he gained it or from what ancestor he derived it but the law of normandyl agrees with our law in this respect nor indeed is that agreement to be wondered at since the law of descents in both is of feodal original and this rule or canon cannot otherwise be accounted for than by recurring to feodal principles when feuds first began to be hereditary it was made a necessary qualification of the heir who would succeed to a feud that he should be of the blood of that is lineally de      scended from the first feudatory or purchaser in consequence whereof if a vassal died seised of a feud of his own acquiring or feudum novum it could not descend to any but his own offspring no not even to his brother because he was not descended nor derived his blood from the first acquirer but if it was feudum antiquum that is one descended to the vassal from his ancestors then his brother or such other collateral relation as was descended and derived his blood from the first feudatory might succeed to such inheritance to this purpose speaks the following rule—frater fratri sine legitimo hærede defuncto in beneficio quod eorum patris fuit succedat sin autem unus e fratribus a domino feudum acceperit eo defuncto sine legitimo hærede frater ejus in feudum non succeditm the true feodal reason for which rule was this that what was given to a man for his personal service and personal merit ought not to descend to any but the heirs of his person and therefore as in estatestail which a proper feud very much resembled so in the feodal donation nomen hæredis in prima investitura expressum tantum ad descendentes ex corpore primi vasalli extenditur et non ad collaterales nisi ex corpore primi vasalli sive stipitis descendantn the will of the donor or original lord when feuds were turned from lifeestates into inheritances not being to make them absolutely hereditary like the roman allodium but hereditary only sub modo not hereditary to the collateral relations or lineal ancestors or husband or wife of the feudatory but to the issue descended from his body only however in process of time when the feodal rigour was in part abated a     method was invented to let in the collateral relations of the grantee to the inheritance by granting him a feudum novum to hold ut feudum antiquum that is with all the qualities annexed of a feud derived from his ancestors and then the collateral relations were admitted to succeed even in infinitum because they might have been of the blood of that is descended from the first imaginary purchaser for      since it is not ascertained in such general grants whether this feud shall be held ut feudum paternum or feudum avitum but ut feudum antiquum merely as a feud of indefinite antiquity that is since it is not ascertained from which of the ancestors of the grantee this feud shall be supposed to have descended the law will not ascertain it but will suppose any of his ancestors pro re nata to have been the first purchaser and therefore it admits any of his collateral kindred who have the other necessary requisites to the inheritance because every collateral kinsman must be descended from some one of his lineal ancestors of this nature are all the grants of feesimple estates of this kingdom for there is now in the law of england no such thing as a grant of a feudum novum to be held ut novum unless in the case of a feetail and there we see that this rule is strictly observed and none but the lineal descendants of the first donee or purchaser are admitted but every grant of lands in feesimple is with us a feudum novum to be held ut antiquum as a feud whose antiquity is indefinite and therefore the collateral kindred of the grantee or descendants from any of his lineal ancestors by whom the lands might have possibly been purchased are capable of being called to the inheritance   yet when an estate hath really descended in a course of inheritance to the person last seised the strict rule of the feodal law is still observed and none are admitted but the heirs of those through whom the inheritance hath passed for all others have demonstrably none of the blood of the first purchaser in them and therefore shall never succeed 0 as if lands come to john stiles by descent from his mother lucy baker no relation of his father as such shall ever be his heir of these lands and vice versa if they descended from his father geoffrey stiles no relation of his mother as such shall ever be admitted thereto for his fathers kindred have none of his mothers blood nor have his mothers relations any share of his fathers blood and so if the estate descended from his fathers father george stiles the relations of      his fathers mother cecilia kempe shall for the same reason never be admitted but only those of his fathers father   this is also the rule of the french lawo which is derived from the same feodal fountain here we may observe that so far as the feud is really antiquum the law traces it back and will not suffer any to inherit but the blood of those ancestors     from whom the feud was conveyed to the late proprietor but when through length of time it can trace it no farther as if it be not known whether his grandfather george stiles inherited it from his father walter stiles or his mother christian smith or if it appear that his grandfather was the first grantee and so took it by the general law as a feud of indefinite antiquity in either of these cases the law admits the descendants of any ancestor of george stiles either paternal or maternal to be in their due order the heirs to john stiles of this estate because in the first case it is really uncertain and in the second case it is supposed to be uncertain whether the grandfather derived his title from the part of his father or his mother this then is the great and general principle upon which the law of collateral inheritances depends that upon failure of issue in the last proprietor the estate shall descend to the blood of the first purchaser or that it shall result back to the heirs of the body of that ancestor from whom it either really has or is supposed by fiction of law to have originally descended according to the rule laid down in the yearbooksp fitzherbertq brookr and hales that he who would have been heir to the father of the deceased and of course to the mother or any other real or supposed purchasing ancestor shall also be heir to the son a maxim that will hold universally except in the case of a brother or sister of the halfblood which exception as we shall see hereafter depends upon very special grounds the rules of inheritance that remain are only rules of evidence calculated to investigate who the purchasing ancestor was which      in feudis vere antiquis has in process of time been forgotten and is supposed so to be in feuds that are held ut antiquis vi a sixth rule or canon therefore is that the collateral heir of the person last seised must be his next collateral kinsman of the whole blood   first he must be his next collateral kinsman either personally or jure representationis   which proximity is reckoned according to the canonical degrees of consanguinity before mentioned therefore the brother being in the first degree he and his descendants shall exclude the uncle and his issue who is only in the second and herein consists the true reason of the different methods of computing the degrees of consanguinity in the civil law on the     one hand and in the canon and common laws on the other the civil law regards consanguinity principally with respect to successions and therein very naturally considers only the person deceased to whom the relation is claimed it therefore counts the degrees of kindred according to the number of persons through whom the claim must be derived from him and makes not only his greatnephew but also his firstcousin to be both related to him in the fourth degree because there are three persons between him and each of them the canon law regards consanguinity principally with a view to prevent incestuous marriages between those who have a large portion of the same blood running in their respective veins and therefore looks up to the author of that blood or the common ancestor reckoning the degrees from him so that the greatnephew is related in the third canonical degree to the person proposed and the firstcousin in the second the former being distant three degrees from the common ancestor the father of the propositus and therefore deriving only onefourth of his blood from the same fountain the latter and also the propositus himself being each of them distant only two degrees from the common ancestor the grandfather of each and therefore having onehalf of each of their bloods the same the common law regards consanguinity principally with respect to descents and having therein the same object in view as the civil it may seem as if it ought      to proceed according to the civil computation but as it also respects the purchasing ancestor from whom the estate was derived it therein resembles the canon law and therefore counts its degrees in the same manner indeed the designation of person in seeking for the next of kin will come to exactly the same end though the degrees will be differently numbered whichever method of computation we suppose the law of england to use since the right of representation of the parent by the issue is allowed to prevail in infinitum   this allowance was absolutely     necessary else there would have frequently been many claimants in exactly the same degree of kindred as for instance uncles and nephews of the deceased which multiplicity though no material inconvenience in the roman law of partible inheritances yet would have been productive of endless confusion where the right of sole succession as with us is established the issue or descendants therefore of john stiless brother are all of them in the first degree of kindred with respect to inheritances those of his uncle in the second and those of his greatuncle in the third as their respective ancestors if living would have been and are severally called to the succession in right of such their representative proximity the right of representation being thus established the former part of the present rule amounts to this that on failure of issue of the person last seised the inheritance shall descend to the other subsisting issue of his next immediate ancestor thus if john stiles dies without issue his estate shall descend to francis his brother or his representatives he being lineally descended from geoffrey stiles johns next immediate ancestor or father on the failure of brethren or sisters and their issue it shall descend to the uncle of john stiles the lineal descendant of his grandfather george and so on in infinitum very similar to which was the law of inheritance among the ancient germans our progenitors—hæredes successoresque sui cuique liberi et nullum testamentum si liberi non sunt proximus gradus in possessione fratres patrui avunculit      now here it must be observed that the lineal ancestors though according to the first rule incapable themselves of succeeding to the estate because it is supposed to have already passed them are yet the common stocks from which the next successor must spring and therefore in the jewish law which in this respect entirely corresponds with oursu the father or other lineal ancestor is himself said to be the heir though long since dead as being represented by the persons of his issue who are held to succeed not in their own rights as brethren uncles c but in right of representation as the offspring of the father grandfather c of the deceasedw but though the common ancestor be thus the root of the inheritance yet with us it is not necessary to name him in making out the pedigree or descent for the descent     between two brothers is held to be an immediate descent and therefore title may be made by one brother or his representatives to or through another without mentioning their common fatherx if geoffrey stiles hath two sons john and francis francis may claim as heir to john without naming their father geoffrey and so the son of francis may claim as cousin and heir to matthew the son of john without naming the grandfather viz as son of francis who was the brother of john who was the father of matthew but though the common ancestors are not named in deducing the pedigree yet the law still respects them as the fountains of inheritable blood and therefore in order to ascertain the collateral heir of john stiles it is first necessary to recur to his ancestors in the first degree and if they have left any other issue besides john that issue will be his heir on default of such we must ascend one step higher to the ancestors in the second degree and then to those in the third and fourth and so upwards in infinitum till some couple of ancestors be found who have other issue descending from them besides the deceased in a parallel or collateral line from these ancestors the heir of john stiles must derive his descent and in such derivation the same rules must be observed with regard to the sex      primogeniture and representation that have before been laid down with regard to lineal descents from the person of the last proprietor but secondly the heir need not be the nearest kinsman absolutely but only sub modo that is he must be the nearest kinsman of the whole blood for if there be a much nearer kinsman of the halfblood a distant kinsman of the whole blood shall be admitted and the other entirely excluded nay the estate shall escheat to the lord sooner than the halfblood shall inherit   a kinsman of the whole blood is he that is derived not only from the same ancestor but from the same couple of ancestors for as every mans own blood is compounded of the bloods of his respective ancestors he only is properly of the whole or entire blood with another who hath so far as the distance of degrees will permit all the same ingredients in the composition of his blood that the other had thus the blood of john stiles being composed of those of geoffrey stiles his father and lucy baker his mother therefore his brother francis being descended from both the same parents hath entirely the same blood with john stiles or he is his brother of the whole blood but if after the death of geoffrey lucy baker the mother marries a second husband lewis gay and hath issue by him the blood of this issue being compounded of the blood of lucy baker it is true on the one part but that of lewis gay instead of geoffrey stiles on the other part it hath therefore only half the same ingredients with that of john stiles so that he is only his brother of the halfblood and for that reason they shall never inherit to each other so also if the father has two sons a and b by different venters or wives now these two brethren are not brethren of the whole blood and therefore shall never inherit to each other but the estate shall rather escheat to the lord nay even if the father dies and his lands descend to his eldest son a who enters thereon and dies seised without issue still b shall not be heir to this estate because he is only of the halfblood to a the person last seised but it shall descend to a sister if any of the whole blood to a for in such cases the maxim is that the seisin or possessio fratris facit sororem esse hæredem yet had a died without entry then b might have inherited not as      heir to a his halfbrother but as heir to the common father who was the person last actually seisedy       this total exclusion of the halfblood from the inheritance being almost peculiar to our own law is looked upon as a strange hardship by such as are unacquainted with the reasons on which it is grounded but these censures arise from a misapprehension of the rule which is not so much to be considered in the light of a rule of descent as of a rule of evidence an auxiliary rule to carry a former into execution and here we must again remember that the great and most universal principle of collateral inheritances being this that the heir to a feudum antiquum must be of the blood of the first feudatory or purchaser that is derived in a lineal descent from him it was originally requisite as upon gifts in tail it still is to make out the pedigree of the heir from the first donee or purchaser and to show that such heir was his lineal representative but when by length of time and a long course of descents it came in those rude and unlettered ages to be forgotten who was really the first feudatory or purchaser and thereby the proof of an actual descent from him became impossible then the law substituted what sir martin wrightz calls a reasonable in the stead of an impossible proof for it remits the proof of an actual descent from the first purchaser and only requires in lieu of it that the claimant be next of the whole blood to the person last in possession or derived from the same couple of ancestors which will probably answer the same end as if he could trace his pedigree in a direct line from the first purchaser for he who is my kinsman of the whole blood can have no ancestors beyond or higher than the common stock but what are equally my ancestors also and mine are vice versa his he therefore is very likely to be derived from that un known ancestor of mine from whom the inheritance descended but a kinsman of the halfblood has but onehalf of his ancestors above the common stock the same as mine and therefore there is not the same probability   of that standing requisite in the law that he be derived from the blood of the first purchaser          to illustrate this by example let there be john stiles and francis brothers by the same father and mother and another son of the same mother by lewis gay a second husband now if john dies seised of lands but it is uncertain whether they descended to him from his father or mother in this case his brother francis of the whole blood is qualified to be his heir for he is sure to be in the line of descent from the first purchaser whether it were the line of the father or the mother but if francis should die before john without issue the mothers son by lewis gay or brother of the halfblood is utterly incapable of being heir for he cannot prove his descent from the first purchaser who is unknown nor has he that fair probability which the law admits as presumptive evidence since he is to the full as likely not to be descended from the line of the first purchaser as to be descended and therefore the inheritance shall go to the nearest relation possessed of this presumptive proof the whole blood and as this is the case in feudis antiquis where there really did once exist a purchasing ancestor who is forgotten it is also the case in feudis novis held ut antiquis where the purchasing ancestor is merely ideal and never existed but only in fiction of law of this nature are all grants of lands in feesimple at this day which are inheritable as if they descended from some uncertain indefinite ancestor and therefore any of the collateral kindred of the real modern purchaser and not his own offspring only may inherit them provided they be of the whole blood for all such are in judgment of law likely enough to be derived from this indefinite ancestor but those of the halfblood are excluded for want of the same probability nor should this be thought hard that a brother of the purchaser though only of the halfblood must thus be disinherited and a more remote relation of the whole blood admitted merely upon a supposition and fiction of law since it is only upon a like supposition and fiction that brethren of purchasers whether of the whole or half blood are entitled to inherit at all for we have seen that in feudis stricte novis neither brethren nor any other collaterals were admitted as    0 therefore in feudis antiquis we have seen the reasonableness of excluding the halfblood if by a fiction of law a feudum novum be made descendible to collaterals as if it was feudum antiquum it is just and equitable that it should be subject to the same restrictions as well as the same latitude of descent perhaps by this time the exclusion of the halfblood does not appear altogether so unreasonable as at first sight it is apt to do it is certainly a very finespun and subtle nicety but considering the principles upon which our law is founded it is not an injustice nor always a hardship since even the succession of the whole blood was originally a beneficial indulgence rather than the strict right of collaterals and though that indulgence is not extended to the demikindred yet they are rarely abridged of any right which they could possibly have enjoyed before the doctrine of the whole blood was calculated to supply the frequent impossibility of proving a descent from the first purchaser without some proof of which according to our fundamental maxim there can be no inheritance allowed of and this purpose it answers for the most part effectually enough i speak with these restrictions because it does not neither can any other method answer this purpose entirely for though all the ancestors of john stiles above the common stock are also the ancestors of his collateral kinsman of the whole blood yet unless that common stock be in the first degree that is unless they have the same father and mother there will be intermediate ancestors below the common stock that belong to either of them respectively from which the other is not descended and therefore can have none of their blood thus though john stiles and his brother of the whole blood can each have no other ancestors than what are in common to them both yet with regard to his uncle where the common stock is removed one degree higher that is the grandfather and grandmother onehalf of johns ancestors will not be the ancestors of his uncle his patruus or fathers brother derives not his descent from johns maternal ancestors nor his avunculus or mothers brother      from those in the paternal line here then the supply of proof is deficient and by no     means amounts to a certainty and the higher the common stock is removed the more will even the probability decrease but it must be observed that upon the same principles of calculation the halfblood have always a much less chance to be descended from an unknown indefinite ancestor of the deceased than the whole blood in the same degree as in the first degree the whole brother of john stiles is sure to be descended from that unknown ancestor his halfbrother has only an even chance for half johns ancestors are not his so in the second degree johns uncle of the whole blood has an even chance but the chances are three to one against his uncle of the halfblood for threefourths of johns ancestors are not his in like manner in the third degree the chances are only three to one against johns greatuncle of the whole blood but they are seven to one against his greatuncle of the halfblood for seveneighths of johns ancestors have no connection in blood with him therefore the much less probability of the halfbloods descent from the first purchaser compared with that of the whole blood in the several degrees has occasioned a general exclusion of the halfblood in all but while i thus illustrate the reason of excluding the halfblood in general i must be impartial enough to own that in some instances the practice is carried further than the principle upon which it goes will warrant particularly when a kinsman of the whole blood in a remoter degree as the uncle or greatuncle is preferred to one of the halfblood in a nearer degree as the brother for the halfbrother hath the same chance of being descended from the purchasing ancestor as the uncle and a thrice   better chance than the greatuncle or kinsman in the third degree it is also more especially overstrained when a man has two sons by different venters and the estate on his death descends from him to the eldest who enters and dies without issue in which case the younger son cannot inherit this estate because he is not of the whole blood to the last proprietora this it must be      owned carries a hardship with it even upon feodal principles for the rule was introduced only to supply the proof of a descent from the first purchaser but here as this estate notoriously descended from the father and as both the brothers confessedly sprung from him it is demonstrable that the halfbrother must be of the blood of the first purchaser who was either the father or some of the fathers ancestors when therefore there is actual demonstration of the thing to be proved it is hard to exclude a man by a rule substituted to supply that proof when deficient so far as the inheritance can be evidently traced back there seems no need of calling in this presumptive proof this rule of probability to investigate what is already certain had the elder brother indeed been a purchaser there would have been no hardship at all for the reasons already given or had the frater uterinus only or brother by the mothers side been excluded from an inheritance which descended from the father it had been highly reasonable indeed it is this very instance of excluding a frater consanguineus or brother by the fathers side from an inheritance which descended a patre that craigb has singled out on which to ground his strictures on the english law of halfblood and really it should seem as if originally the custom of excluding the halfblood in normandyc extended only to exclude a frater uterinus when the inheritance descended a patre and vice versa and possibly in england also as even with us it remained a doubt in the time of bractond and of fletae whether the halfblood on the fathers side was excluded from the inheritance     which originally descended from the common father or only from such as descended from the respective mothers and from newlypurchased lands so also the rule of law as laid      down by our fortescuef extends no further than this frater fratri uterino non succedet in hæreditate paterna it is moreover worthy of observation that by our law as it now stands the crown which is the highest inheritance in the nation may descend to the halfblood of the preceding sovereigng so that it be the blood of the first monarch purchaser or in the feodal language conqueror of the reigning family thus it actually did descend from king edward the sixth to queen mary and from her to queen elizabeth who were respectively of the halfblood to each other for the royal pedigree being always a matter of sufficient notoriety there is no occasion to call in the aid of this presumptive rule of evidence to render probable the descent from the royal stock which was formerly king william the norman and is now by act of parliamenth the princess sophia of hanover hence also it is that in estatestail where the pedigree from the first donee must be strictly proved halfblood is no impediment to the descenti because when the lineage is clearly made out there is no need of this auxiliary proof   how far it might be desirable for the legislature to give relief by amending the law of descents in one or two instances and ordaining that the halfblood might always inherit where the estate notoriously descended from its own proper ancestor and in cases of newpurchased lands or uncertain descents should never be excluded by the whole blood in a remoter degree or how far a private inconvenience should be still submitted to rather than a longestablished rule should be shaken is not for me to determine 0 the rule then together with its illustration amounts to this that in order     to keep the estate of john stiles as nearly as possible in the line of his purchasing ancestor it must descend to the issue of the nearest couple of ancestors that have left descendants behind them because the descendants of one ancestor only are not so likely to be in the line of that purchasing ancestor as those who are descended from both      but here another difficulty arises in the second third fourth and every superior degree every man has many couples of ancestors increasing according to the distances in a geometrical progression upwardsk the descendants of all which respective couples are representatively related to him in the same degree thus in the second degree the issue of george and cecilia stiles and of andrew and esther baker the two grandsires and grandmothers of john stiles are each in the same degree of propinquity in the third degree the respective issues of walter and christian stiles of luke and frances kempe of herbert and hannah baker and of james and emma thorpe are upon the extinction of the two inferior degrees all equally entitled to call themselves the next kindred of the whole blood to john stiles to which therefore of these ancestors must we first resort in order to find out descendants to be preferably called to the inheritance in answer to this and likewise to avoid all other confusion and uncertainty that might arise between the several stocks wherein the purchasing ancestor may be sought for another qualification is requisite besides the proximity and entirety which is that of dignity or worthiness of blood for vii the seventh and last rule or canon is that in collateral inheritances the male stocks shall be preferred to the female that is kindred derived from the blood of the male ancestors however remote shall be admitted before those from the blood of the female however near unless where the lands have in fact descended from a female thus the relations on the fathers side are admitted in infinitum before those on the mothers side are admitted at alll and the relations of the fathers father before those of the fathers mother and so on   and in this the english law is not singular but warranted by the examples of the hebrew and     athenian laws as stated by seldenm and petitn though among the greeks in the time of hesiodo when a man died without wife or children all his kindred without any      distinction divided his estate among them it is likewise warranted by the example of the roman laws wherein the agnati or relations by the father were preferred to the cognati or relations by the mother till the edict of the emperor justinianp abolished all distinction between them it is also conformable to the customary law of normandyq which indeed in most respects agrees with our english law of inheritance however i am inclined to think that this rule of our law does not owe its immediate original to any view of conformity to those which i have just now mentioned but was established in order to effectuate and carry into execution the fifth rule or principal canon of collateral inheritance before laid down that every heir must be of the blood of the first purchaser for when such first purchaser was not easily to be discovered after a long course of descents the lawyers not only endeavoured to investigate him by taking the next relation of the whole blood to the person last in possession but also considering that a preference had been given to males by virtue of the second canon through the whole course of lineal descent from the first purchaser to the present time they judged it more likely that the lands should have descended to the last tenant from his male than from his female ancestors from the father for instance rather than from the mother from the fathers father rather than from the fathers mother and therefore they hunted back the inheritance if i may be allowed the expression through the male line and gave it to the next relations on the side of the father the fathers father and so upwards imagining with reason that this was the most probable way of continuing it in the line of the first purchaser a conduct much more rational than the preference of the agnati by the roman laws which as they gave no advantage to the males in the first instance or direct lineal succession had no reason for preferring them in the transverse collateral one upon which account this preference was very wisely abolished by justinian      that this was the true foundation of the preference of the agnati or male stocks in our law will further appear if we consider that whenever the lands have notoriously descended to a man from his mothers side this rule is totally reversed and no relation of his by the fathers side as such can ever be admitted to them because he cannot possibly be of the blood of the first purchaser and so e converso if the lands descended from the fathers side no relation of the mother as such shall ever inherit so also if they in fact descended to john stiles from his fathers mother cecilia kempe here not only the blood of lucy baker his mother but also of george stiles his fathers father is perpetually excluded and in like manner if they be known to have descended from frances holland the mother of cecilia kempe the line not only of lucy baker and of george stiles but also of luke kempe the father of cecilia is excluded whereas when the side from which they descended is forgotten or never known as in the case of an estate newly purchased to be holden ut feudum antiquum here the right of inheritance first runs up all the fathers side with a preference to the male stocks in every instance and if it finds no heirs there it then and then only resorts to the mothers side leaving no place untried in order to find heirs that may by possibility be derived from the original purchaser the greatest probability of finding such was among those descended from the male ancestors but upon failure of issue there they may possibly be found among those derived from the females       this i take to be the true reason of the constant preference of the agnatic succession or issue derived from the male ancestors through all the stages of collateral inheritance as the ability for personal service was the reason for preferring the males at first in the direct lineal succession we see clearly that if males had been perpetually admitted in utter exclusion of females the tracing the inheritance back through the male line of ancestors must at last have inevitably brought us up to the first purchaser but as males have not been      perpetually admitted but only generally preferred as females have not been utterly excluded but only generally postponed to males the tracing the inheritance up through the male stocks will not give us absolute demonstration but only a strong probability of arriving at the first purchaser which joined with the other probability of the wholeness of entirety of blood will fall little short of a certainty   before we conclude this branch of our inquiries it may not be amiss to exemplify these rules by a short sketch of the manner in which we must search for the heir of a person as john stiles who dies seised of land which he acquired and which therefore he held as a feud of indefinite antiquityr in the first place succeeds the eldest son matthew stiles or his issue n°  —if his line be extinct then gilbert stiles and the other sons respectively in order of birth or their issue n°  —in default of these all the daughters together margaret and charlotte stiles or their issue n°  —on failure of the descendants of john stiles himself the issue of geoffrey and lucy stiles his parents is called in viz first francis stiles the eldest brother of the whole blood or his issue n°  —then oliver stiles and the other whole brothers respectively in order of birth or their issue n°  —then the sisters of the whole blood all together bridget and alice stiles or their issue n°  —in defect of these the issue of george and cecilia stiles his fathers     parents respect being still had to their age and sex n°  —then the issue of walter and christian stiles the parents of his paternal grandfather n°  —then the issue of richard and anne stiles the parents of his paternal grandfathers father n°  —and so on in the paternal grandfathers paternal line or blood of walter stiles in infinitum in defect of these the issue of william and jane smith the parents of his paternal grandfathers mother n°  0—and so on in the paternal grandfathers maternal line or blood of christian smith in infinitum till both the      immediate bloods of george stiles the paternal grandfather are spent—then we must resort to the issue of luke and frances kempe the parents of john stiless paternal grandmother n°   —then to the issue of thomas and sarah kempe the parents of his paternal grandmothers father n°   —and so on in the paternal grandmothers paternal line or blood of luke kempe in infinitum—in default of which we must call in the issue of charles and mary holland the parents of his paternal grandmothers mother n°   —and so on in the paternal grandmothers maternal line or blood of frances holland in infinitum till both the immediate bloods of cecilia kempe the paternal grandmother are also spent—whereby the paternal blood of john stiles entirely failing recourse must then and not before be had to his maternal relations or the blood of the bakers n°          willises n°    thorpes n°       and whites n°  0 in the same regular successive order as in the paternal line the student should however be informed that the class n°  0 would be postponed to n°    in consequence of the doctrine laid down arguendo by justice manwoode in the case of clere and brookes from whence it is adopted by lord bacont and sir matthew haleu because it is said that all the female ancestors on the part of the father are equally worthy of blood and in that case proximity shall prevail and yet notwithstanding these respectable authorities the compiler of this table hath ventured in point of theory for the case never yet occurred in practice   to give the preference to n°  0 before n°    for the following reasons   because this point was not the principal question in the case of clere and brooke but the law concerning it is delivered obiter only and in the course of argument by justice manwoode though afterwards said to be confirmed by the three other justices in separate extrajudicial conferences with the reporter   because the chief justice sir james dyer in reporting the resolution of the court in what seems to be the same casew takes no notice of this doctrine   because it appears from plowdens report that very many gentlemen of the law were dissatisfied      with this position of justice manwoode since the blood of n°  0 was derived to the purchaser through a greater number of males than the blood of n°    and was therefore in their opinion the more worthy of the two   because the position itself destroys the otherwise entire and regular symmetry of our legal course of descents as is manifest by inspecting the table wherein n°    which is analogous in the maternal line to n°  0 in the paternal is preferred to n°    which is analogous to n°    upon the authority of the eighth rule laid down by hale himself and it destroys also that constant preference of the male stocks in the law of inheritance for which an additional reason is beforex given besides the mere dignity of blood   because it introduces all that uncertainty and contradiction which is pointed out by that ingenious authory and establishes a collateral doctrine viz the preference of n°    to n°  0 seemingly though perhaps not strictly incompatible with the principal point resolved in the case of clere and brooke viz the preference of n°    to n°    and though that learned writer proposes to rescind the principal point then resolved in order to nil         clear this difficulty it is apprehended that the difficulty may be better cleared by rejecting the collateral doctrine which was never yet resolved at all   because the reason that is given for this doctrine by lord bacon viz that in any degree paramount the first the law respecteth proximity and not dignity of blood is directly contrary to many instances given by plowden and hale and every other writer on the law of descents   because this position seems to contradict the allowed doctrine of sir edward cokez who lays it down under different names that the blood of the kempes alias sandies shall not inherit till the blood of the stileses alias fairfields fail now the blood of the stileses does certainly not fail till both n°   and n°  0 are extinct wherefore n°    being the blood of the kempes ought not to inherit till then   because in the case mich    edw iv   a much relied on in that of clere and brooke it is laid down as a rule that cestuy que doit inheriter al pere doit inheriter al filsb and so sir matthew halec says that though the law excludes the father from inheriting yet it substitutes and directs the descent as it should have been had the father inherited   now it is settled by the resolution of clere    0 and brooke that n°  0 should have inherited before n°    to geoffrey stiles the father had he been the person last seised and therefore n°  0 ought also to be preferred in inheriting to john stiles the son  table of descents in case john stiles was not himself the purchaser but the estate in fact came to him by descent from his father mother or any higher ancestor there is this difference that the blood of that line of ancestors from which it did not descend can never inherit as was formerly fully explainedd and the like rule as there exemplified will hold upon descents from any other ancestors the student should also bear in mind that during this whole process john stiles is the person supposed to have been last actually seised of the estate for if ever it comes to vest in any other person as heir to john stiles a new order of succession must be observed upon the death of such heir since he by his own seisin now becomes himself an ancestor or stipes and must be put in the place of john stiles the figures therefore denote the order in which the several classes would succeed to john stiles and not to each other and before we search for an heir in any of the higher figures as n°   we must be first assured that all the lower classes from n°   to n°   were extinct at john stiless decease       chapter xv of title by purchase and i by escheat purchase perquisitio taken in its largest and most extensive sense is thus defined by littletona the possession of lands and tenements which a man hath by his own act or agreement and not by descent from any of his ancestors or kindred in this sense it is contradistinguished from acquisition by right of blood and includes every other method of coming to an estate but merely that by inheritance wherein the title is vested in a person not by his own act or agreement but by the single operation of lawb purchase indeed in its vulgar and confined acceptation is applied only to such acquisitions of land as are obtained by way of bargain and sale for money or some other valuable consideration but this falls far short of the legal idea of purchase for if i give land freely to another he is in the eye of the law a purchaserc and falls within littletons definition for he comes to the estate by his own agreement that is he consents to the gift a man who has his fathers estate settled upon him in tail before he was born is also a purchaser for he takes quite another estate than the law of descents would have given him nay even if the ancestor devises his estate to his heiratlaw by will with other limitations or in any other shape than the course of descents would direct such heir shall take by purchased but if a man seised in fee devises his whole estate to his heiratlaw so that the heir takes neither a greater nor a less estate by the      devise than he would have done without it he shall be adjudged to take by descente even though it be charged with encumbrancesf this being for the benefit of creditors and others who have demands on the estate of the ancestor  if a remainder be limited to the heirs of     sempronius here sempronius himself takes nothing but if he dies during the continuance of the particular estate his heirs shall take as purchasersg but if an estate be made to a for life remainder to his right heirs in fee his heirs shall take by descent for it is an ancient rule of law that whenever the ancestor takes an estate for life the heir cannot by the same conveyance take an estate in fee by purchase but only by descenth and if a dies before entry still his heirs shall take by descent and not by purchase for where the heir takes any thing that might have vested in the ancestor he takes by way of descenti the ancestor during his life beareth in himself all his heirsk and therefore when once he is or might have been seised of the lands the inheritance so limited to his heirs vests in the ancestor himself and the word heirs in this case is not esteemed a word of purchase but a word of limitation enuring so as to increase the estate of the ancestor from a tenancy for life to a feesimple  and had it been otherwise had the heir who is uncertain till the death of the ancestor been allowed to take as a purchaser originally nominated in the deed as must have been the case if the remainder had been expressly limited to matthew or thomas by name then in the times of strict feodal tenure the lord would have been defrauded by such a limitation of the fruits of his signiory arising from a descent to the heir what we call purchase perquisitio the feudists called conquests conquæstus or conquisitiol both denoting any means of acquiring an estate out of the common course of inheritance and this is still the proper phrase in the law of scotlandm as it was among the norman jurists who styled      the first purchaser that is he who brought the estate into the family who at present owns it the conqueror or conquereurn which seems to be all that was meant by the appellation which was given to william the norman when his manner of ascending the throne of england was in his own and his successors charters and by the historians of the times entitled conquæstus and himself conquæstor or conquisitoro signifying that he was the first of his family who acquired the crown of england and from whom therefore all future claims by descent must be derived though now from our disuse of the feodal sense of the word together with the reflection on his forcible method of acquisition we are apt to annex the idea of victory to this name of conquest or conquisition a title which however just with regard to the crown the conqueror never pretended with regard to the realm of england nor in fact ever hadp the difference in effect between the acquisition of an estate by descent and by purchase consists principally in these two points   that by purchase the estate acquires a new inheritable quality and is descendible to the owners blood in general and not the blood only of some particular ancestor for when a man takes an estate by purchase he takes it not ut feudum paternum or maternum which would descend only to the heirs by the fathers or the mothers side but he takes it ut feudum antiquum as a feud of indefinite antiquity whereby it be comes inheritable to his heirs general first of the paternal and then of the     maternal line   an estate taken by purchase will not make the heir answerable for the acts of the ancestor as an estate by descent will for if the ancestor by any deed obligation covenant or the like bindeth himself and his heirs and dieth this deed obligation or covenant shall be binding upon the heir so far forth only as he or any other in trust for himq had any estate of inheritance vested in him by descent      from or any estate pur auter vie coming to him by special occupancy as heir tor that ancestor sufficient to answer the charges whether he remains in possession or hath alienated it before action broughtt which sufficient estate is in the law called assets from the french word assez enoughu therefore if a man covenants for himself and his heirs to keep my house in repair i can then and then only compel his heir to perform this covenant when he has an estate sufficient for this purpose or assets by descent from the covenantor for though the covenant descends to the heir whether he inherits any estate or no it lies dormant and is not compulsory until he has assets by descentv  this is the legal signification of the word perquisitio or purchase and in this sense it includes the five following methods of acquiring a title to estates   escheat   occupancy   prescription   forfeiture   alienation of all these in their order i escheat we may rememberw was one of the fruits and consequences of feodal tenure  the word itself is originally french or normanx in which language it signifies chance or accident and with us it denotes an obstruction of the course of descent and a consequent determination of the tenure by some unforeseen contingency in which case the land naturally results back by a kind of reversion to the original grantor or lord of the feey escheat therefore being a title frequently vested in the lord by inheritance as being the fruit of a signiory to which he was entitled by descent for which reason the lands escheated shall attend the signiory and be inheritable by such only of his heirs as are capable of inheriting the otherz it may seem in such cases to fall more properly under the former general head of acquiring title to estates viz by descent being vested in him by act of law and not by his own act      or agreement than under the present by purchase but it must be remembered that in order to complete this title by escheat it is necessary that the lord perform an act of his own by entering on the lands and tenements so escheated or suing out a writ of escheata on failure of which or by doing any act that amounts to an implied waiver of his right as by accepting homage or rent of a stranger who usurps the possession his title by escheat is barredb it is therefore in some respect a title acquired by his own act as well as by act of law indeed this may also be said of descents themselves in which an entry or other seisin is required in order to make a complete title and therefore this distribution of titles by our legal writers into those by descent and by purchase seems in this respect rather inaccurate and not marked with sufficient precision for as escheats must follow the nature of the signiory to which they belong they may vest by either purchase or descent according     as the signiory is vested and though sir edward coke considers the lord by escheat as in some respects the assignee of the last tenantc and therefore taking by purchase yet on the other hand the lord is more frequently considered as being ultimus hæres and therefore taking by descent in a kind of caducary succession the law of escheats is founded upon this single principle that the blood of the person last seised in feesimple is by some means or other utterly extinct and gone and since none can inherit his estate but such as are of his blood and consanguinity it follows as a regular consequence that when such blood is extinct the inheritance itself must fail the land must become what the feodal writers denominate feudum apertum and must result back again to the lord of the fee by whom or by those whose estate he hath it was given escheats are frequently divided into those propter defectum sanguinis and those propter delictum tenentis the one sort if the tenant dies without heirs the other if his blood be attaintedd but both these species may well be      comprehended under the first denomination only for he that is attainted suffers an extinction of his blood as well as he that dies without relations the inheritable quality is expunged in one instance and expires in the other or as the doctrine of escheats is very fully expressed in fletae dominus capitalis feodi loco hæredis habetur quoties per defectum vel delictum extinguitur sanguis tenentis escheats therefore arising merely upon the deficiency of the blood whereby the descent is impeded their doctrine will be better illustrated by considering the several cases wherein hereditary blood may be deficient than by any other method whatsoever       the first three cases wherein inheritable blood is wanting may be collected from the rules of descent laid down and explained in the preceding chapter and therefore will need very little illustration or comment first when the tenant dies without any relations on the part of any of his ancestors secondly when he dies without any relations on the part of those ancestors from whom his estate descended thirdly when he dies without any relations of the whole blood in two of these cases the blood of the first purchaser is certainly in the other it is probably at an end and therefore in all of them the law directs that the land shall escheat to the lord of the fee for the lord would be manifestly prejudiced if contrary to the inherent condition tacitly annexed to all feuds any person should be suffered to succeed to the lands who is not of the blood of the first feudatory to whom for his personal merit the estate is supposed to have been granted        a monster which hath not the shape of mankind but in any part evidently bears the resemblance of the brute creation hath no inheritable blood and cannot be heir to any land albeit it be brought forth in marriage but although it hath deformity in any part of its body yet if it      hath human shape it may be heirf this is a very ancient rule in the law of englandg and its reason is too obvious and too shocking to bear a minute discussion the roman law agrees with our own in excluding such births from successionsh yet accounts them however children in some respects where the parents or at least the father could reap any advantage therebyi as the jus trium liberorum and the like esteeming them the misfortune rather than the fault of that parent but our law will not admit a birth of this kind to be such an issue as shall entitle the husband to be tenant by the curtesyk because it is not capable of inheriting and therefore if there appears no other heir than such a prodigious birth the land shall escheat to the lord   bastards are incapable of being heirs bastards by our law are such children as are not born either in lawful wedlock or within a competent time after its determinationl such are held to be nullius filii the sons of nobody for the maxim of law is qui ex damnato coitu nascuntur inter liberos non computanturm being thus the sons of nobody they have no blood in them at least no inheritable blood consequently none of the blood of the first purchaser and therefore if there be no other claimant than such illegitimate children the land shall escheat to the lordn the civil law differs from ours in this point and allows a bastard to succeed to an inheritance if after its birth the mother was married to the fathero and also if the father had no lawful wife or child then even if the concubine was never married to the father yet she and her bastard son were admitted each to onetwelfth of the inheritancep and a bastard was likewise      capable of succeeding to the whole of his mothers estate although she was never married the mother being sufficiently certain though the father is notq but our law it favour of marriage is much less indulgent to bastards      there is indeed one instance in which our law has shown them some little regard and that is usually termed the case of bastard eignè and mulier puisnè this happens when a man has a bastard son and afterwards marries the mother and by her has a legitimate son who in the language of the law is called a mulier or as glanvilr expresses it in his latin filius mulieratus the woman before marriage being concubina and afterwards mulier now here the eldest son is bastard or bastard eignè and the younger son is legitimate or mulier puisnè if then the father dies and the bastard eignè enters upon his land and enjoys it to his death and dies seised thereof  whereby the inheritance descends to his issue in this case the mulier puisnè and all other heirs though minors femecoverts or under any incapacity whatsoever are totally barred of their rights and this   as a punishment on the mulier for his negligence in not entering during the bastards life and evieting him   because the law will not suffer a man to be bastardized after his death who entered as heir and died seised and so passed for legitimate in his lifetime    because the canon law following the civil did allow such bastard eignè to be legitimate on the subsequent marriage of his mother and therefore the laws of england though they would not admit either the civil or canon law to rule the inheritances of this kingdom yet paid such a regard to a person thus peculiarly circumstanced that after the land had descended to his issue they would not unravel the matter again and suffer his estate to be shaken but this indulgence was shown to no other kind of bastard for if the mother was never married to the father such bastard could have no colourable title at allt       as bastards cannot be heirs themselves so neither can they have any heirs but those of their own bodies for as all collateral kindred consists in being derived from the same common ancestor and a bastard has no legal ancestors he can have no collateral kindred and consequently can have no legal heirs but such as claim by a lineal descent from himself and therefore if a bastard purchase land and dies seised thereof without issue and intestate the land shall escheat to the lord of the feeu   aliensv also are incapable of taking by descent or inheritingw for they are not allowed to have any inheritable blood in them rather indeed upon a principle of national or civil policy than upon reasons strictly feodal though if lands had been suffered to fall into their hands who owe no allegiance to the crown of england the design of introducing our feuds the defence of the kingdom would have been defeated wherefore if a man leaves no other relations but aliens his land shall escheat to the lord 0 as aliens cannot inherit so far they are on a level with bastards but as they     are also disabled to hold by purchasex   they are under still greater disabilities and as they can neither hold by purchase nor by inheritance it is almost superfluous to say that they can have no heirs since they can have nothing for an heir to inherit but so it is expressly holdeny because they have not in them any inheritable blood and further if an alien be made a denizen by the kings letterspatent and then purchases land which the law allows such a one to do his son born before his denization shall not by the common law inherit those lands but a son born afterwards may even though his elder brother be living for the father before denization had no inheritable blood to communicate to his eldest son but by denization it acquires    0 an hereditary quality which will be transmitted to his subsequent posterity yet if he had been naturalized by act of parliament such eldest son might then have inherited for that cancels all defects and is allowed to have a retrospective energy which simple denization has notz   sir edward cokea also holds that if an alien cometh into england and there hath issue two sons who are thereby naturalborn subjects and one of them purchases land and dies yet neither of these brethren can be heir to the other for the commune vinculum or common stock of their consanguinity is the father and as he had no inheritable blood in him he could communicate none to his sons and when the sons can by no possibility be heirs to the father the one of them shall not be heir to the other and this opinion of his seems founded upon solid principles of the ancient law not only from the rule before citedb that cestuy que doit inheriter al père doit inheriter al fils but also because we have seen that the only feodal foundation upon which newlypurchased land can possibly descend to a brother is the supposition and fiction of law that it descended from some one of his ancestors but in this case as the intermediate ancestor was an alien from whom it could by no possibility descend this should destroy the supposition and impede the descent and the land should be inherited ut feudum stricte novum that is by none but the lineal descendants of the purchasing brother and on failure of them should escheat to the lord of the fee but this opinion hath been since overruledc and it is now held for law that the sons of an alien born here may inherit to each other the descent from one brother to another being an immediate descentd and reasonably enough upon the whole for as in common purchases the whole of the supposed descent from indefinite ancestors is but fictitious the law may as well suppose the requisite ancestor as suppose the requisite descent      it is also enacted by the statute        w iii c   that all persons being naturalborn subjects of the king may inherit and make their titles by descent from any of their ancestors lineal or collateral although their father or mother or other ancestor by from through or under whom they derive their pedigrees were born out of the kings allegiance but inconveniences were afterwards apprehended in case persons should thereby gain a future capacity to inherit who did not exist at the death of the person last seised as if francis the elder brother of john stiles be an alien and oliver the younger be a naturalborn subject upon johns death without issue his lands will descend to oliver the younger brother now if afterwards francis has a child born in england it was feared that under the statute of king william this newborn child might defeat the estate of his uncle oliver     wherefore it is provided by the statute    geo ii c    that no right of inheritance shall accrue by virtue of the former statute to any persons whatsoever unless they are in being and capable to take as heirs at the death of the person last seised—with an exception however to the case where lands shall descend to the daughter of an alien which descent shall be divested in favour of an afterborn brother or the inheritance shall be divided with an afterborn sister or sisters according to the usual rulee of descents by the common law   by attainder also for treason or other felony the blood of the person attainted is so corrupted as to be rendered no longer inheritable great care must be taken to distinguish between forfeiture of lands to the king and this species of escheat to the lord which by reason of their similitude in some circumstances and because the crown is very frequently the immediate lord of the fee and therefore entitled to both have been often confounded together forfeiture of lands and of whatever else the offender possessed was the doctrine of the old saxon lawf as a part of punishment for the offence      and does not at all relate to the feodal system nor is the consequence of any signiory or lordship paramountg but being a prerogative vested in the crown was neither superseded nor diminished by the introduction of the norman tenures a fruit and consequence of which escheat must undoubtedly be reckoned escheat therefore operates in subordination to this more antient and superior law of forfeiture the doctrine of escheat upon attainder taken singly is this that the blood of the tenant by the commission of any felony under which denomination all treasons were formerly comprisedh is corrupted and stained and the original donation of the feud is thereby determined it being always granted to the vassal on the implied condition of dum bene se gesserit upon the thorough demonstration of which guilt by legal attainder the feodal covenant and mutual bond of fealty are held to be broken the estate instantly falls back from the offender to the lord of the fee and the inheritable quality of his blood is extinguished and blotted out forever in this situation the law of feodal escheat was brought into england at the conquest and in general superadded to the antient law of forfeiture in consequence of which corruption and extinction of hereditary blood the land of all felons would immediately revest in the lord but that the superior law of forfeiture intervenes and intercepts it in its passage in case of treason forever in case of other felony for only a year and a day after which time it goes to the lord in a regular course of escheati as it would have done to the heir of the felon in case the feodal tenures had never been introduced and that this is the true operation and genuine history of escheats will most evidently appear from this incident to gavelkind lands which seems to be the old saxon tenure that they are in no case subject to escheat for felony though they are liable to forfeiture for treasonj      as a consequence of this doctrine of escheat all lands of inheritance immediately revesting in the lord the wife of the felon was liable to lose her dower till the statute   edw vi c    enacted that albeit any person be attainted of misprision of treason murder or felony yet his wife shall enjoy her dower but she has not this indulgence where the antient law of forfeiture operates for it is expressly provided by the statute      edw vi c    that the wife of one attaint of high treason shall not be endowed at all   hitherto we have only spoken of estates vested in the offender at the time of his offence or attainder and here the law of forfeiture stops but the law of escheat pursues the matter still further for the blood of the tenant being utterly corrupted and extinguished it follows not only that all that he now has     shall escheat from him but also that he shall be incapable of inheriting any thing for the future this may further illustrate the distinction between forfeiture and escheat if therefore a father be seised in fee and the son commits treason and is attainted and then the father dies here the lands shall escheat to the lord because the son by the corruption of his blood is incapable to be heir and there can be no other heir during his life but nothing shall be forfeited to the king for the son never had any interest in the lands to forfeitk in this case the escheat operates and not the forfeiture but in the following instance the forfeiture works and not the escheat as where a new felony is created by act of parliament and it is provided as is frequently the case that it shall not extend to corruption of blood here the lands of the felon shall not escheat to the lord but yet the profits of them shall be forfeited to the king for a year and a day and so long after as the offender livesl there is yet a further consequence of the corruption and extinction of hereditary blood which is this that the person      attainted shall not only be incapable himself of inheriting or transmitting his own property by heirship but shall also obstruct the descent of lands or tenements to his posterity in all cases where they are obliged to derive their title through him from any remoter ancestor the channel which conveyed the hereditary blood from his ancestors to him is not only exhausted for the present but totally dammed up and rendered impervious for the future this is a refinement upon the antient law of feuds which allowed that the grandson might be heir to his grandfather though the son in the intermediate generation was guilty of felonym but by the law of england a mans blood is so universally corrupted by attainder that his sons can neither inherit to him nor to any other ancestorsn at least on the part of their attainted father this corruption of blood cannot be absolutely removed but by authority of parliament the king may excuse the public punishment of an offender but cannot abolish the private right which has accrued or may accrue to individuals as a consequence of the criminals attainder he may remit a forfeiture in which the interest of the crown is alone concerned but he cannot wipe away the corruption of blood for therein a third person hath an interest the lord who claims by escheat if therefore a man hath a son and is attainted and afterwards pardoned by the king this son can never inherit to his father or fathers ancestors because his paternal blood being once thoroughly corrupted by his fathers attainder must continue so but if the son had been born after the pardon he might inherit because by the pardon the father is made a new man and may convey new inheritable blood to his afterborn childreno herein there is however a difference between aliens and persons attainted of aliens who could never by any possibility be heirs the law takes no notice and therefore we have      seen that an alien elder brother shall not impede the descent to a naturalborn younger brother but in attainders it is otherwise for if a man hath issue a son and is attainted and afterwards pardoned and then hath issue a second son and dies here the corruption of blood is not removed from the eldest and therefore he cannot be heir neither can the youngest be heir for he hath an elder brother living of whom the law takes notice as he once had a possibility of being heir and therefore the younger brother shall not inherit but the land shall escheat to the lord though had the elder died without issue in the life of the father the younger son born after the pardon might well have inherited for he hath no corruption of bloodp so if a man hath issue two sons and the elder in the lifetime of the father hath issue and then is attainted and executed and afterwards the father dies the lands of the father shall not descend to the younger son for the issue of the elder which had once a possibility to inherit shall impede the descent to the younger and the land shall escheat to the lordq sir edward coke in this case allowsr that if the ancestor be attainted his sons born before the attainder     may be heirs to each other and distinguishes it from the case of the sons of an alien because in this case the blood was inheritable when imparted to them from the father but he makes a doubt upon the principles before mentioned which are now overruleds whether sons born after the attainder can inherit to each other for they never had any inheritable blood in them upon the whole it appears that a person attainted is neither allowed to retain his former estate nor to inherit any future one nor to transmit any inheritance to his issue either immediately from himself or mediately through himself from any remoter ancestor for his inheritable blood which is necessary either to hold to take or to transmit any feodal property is blotted out corrupted and extinguished forever the consequence of which is that estates thus impeded in their descent result back and escheat to the lord      this corruption of blood thus arising from feodal principles but perhaps extended further than even those principles will warrant has been long looked upon as a peculiar hardship because the oppressive part of the feodal tenures being now in general abolished it seems unreasonable to reserve one of their most inequitable consequences namely that the children should not only be reduced to present poverty which however severe is sufficiently justified upon reasons of public policy but also be laid under future difficulties of inheritance on account of the guilt of their ancestors and therefore in most if not all of the new felonies created by parliament since the reign of henry the eighth it is declared that they shall not extend to any corruption of blood and by the statute   anne c    the operation of which is postponed by the statute    geo ii c    it is enacted that after the death of the late pretender and his sons no attainder for treason shall extend to the disinheriting any heir nor the prejudice of any person other than the offender himself which provisions have indeed carried the remedy further than was required by the hardship above complained of which is only the future obstruction of descents where the pedigree happens to be deduced through the blood of an attainted ancestor   before i conclude this head of escheat i must mention one singular instance in which lands held in feesimple are not liable to escheat to the lord even when their owner is no more and hath left no heirs to inherit them and this is the case of a corporation for if that comes by any accident to be dissolved the donor or his heirs shall have the land again in reversion and not the lord by escheat which is perhaps the only instance where a reversion can be expectant on a grant in feesimple absolute but the law we are toldt doth tacitly annex a condition to every such gift or grant that if the corporation be dissolved the donor or grantor shall reenter for the cause of the gift or grant      faileth this is indeed founded upon the selfsame principle as the law of escheat the heirs of the donor being only substituted instead of the chief lord of the fee which was formerly very frequently the case in subinfeudations or alienations of lands by a vassal to be holden as of himself till that practice was restrained by the statute of quia emptores    edw i st   to which this very singular instance still in some degree remains an exception there is one more incapacity of taking by descent which not being productive of any escheat is not strictly reducible to this head and yet must not be passed over in silence it is enacted by the statute        will iii c         that every papist who shall not abjure the errors of his religion by taking the oaths to the government and making the declaration against transubstantiation within six months after he has attained the age of eighteen years shall be incapable of inheriting or taking by descent as well as purchase any real estates whatsoever and his next of kin being a protestant shall hold them to his own use till such time as he complies with the terms imposed by the act this incapacity is merely personal it affects himself only and does not destroy the inheritable quality of his blood so as to impede the descents to others of his kindred in like manner as even in the times of popery one who entered into religion and became a monk professed was incapable of inheriting lands both in our ownu and the feodal law eo quod desiit esse miles seculi qui factus est miles christi nec beneficium pertinet ad eum qui non debet gerere officiumw but yet he was accounted only civiliter mortuus he did not impede the descent to others but the next heir was entitled to his or his ancestors estate   these are the several deficiencies of hereditary blood recognised by the law of england which so often as they happen occasion lands to escheat to the original proprietary or lord chapter xvi ii of title by occupancy occupancy is the taking possession of those things which before belonged to nobody this as we have seena is the true ground and foundation of all property or of holding those things in severalty which by the law of nature unqualified by that of society were common to all mankind but when once it was agreed that every thing capable of ownership should have an owner natural reason suggested that he who could first declare his intention of appropriating any thing to his own use and in consequence of such intention actually took it into possession should thereby gain the absolute property of it according to that rule of the law of nations recognised by the laws of romeb quod nullius est id ratione naturali occupanti conceditur this right of occupancy so far as it concerns real property for of personal chattels i am not in this place to speak hath been confined by the laws of england within a very narrow compass and was extended only to a single instance namely where a man was tenant pur auter vie or had an estate granted to himself only without mentioning his heirs for the life of another man and died during the life of cestuy que vie or him by whose life it was holden in this case he that could first enter on the land might lawfully retain the possession so long as cestuy que vie lived by right of occupancyc      this seems to have been recurring to first principles and calling in the law of nature to ascertain the property of the land when left without a legal owner for it did not revert to the grantor though it formerlyd     was supposed so to do for he had parted with all his interest so long as cestuy que vie lived it did not escheat to the lord of the fee for all escheats must be of the absolute entire fee and not of any particular estate carved out of it much less of so minute a remnant as this it did not belong to the grantee for he was dead it did not descend to his heirs for there were no words of inheritance in the grant nor could it vest in his executors for no executors could succeed to a freehold belonging therefore to nobody like the hæreditas jacens of the romans the law left it open to be seised and appropriated by the first person that could enter upon it during the life of cestuy que vie under the name of an occupant but there was no right of occupancy allowed where the king had the reversion of the lands for the reversioner hath an equal right with any other man to enter upon the vacant possession and where the kings title and a subjects concur the kings shall be always preferred against the king therefore there could be no prior occupant because nullum tempus occurrit regie and even in the case of a subject had the estate pur auter vie been granted to a man and his heirs during the life of cestuy que vie there the heir might and still may enter and hold possession and is called in law a special occupant as having a special exclusive right by the terms of the original grant to enter upon and occupy this hæreditas jacens during the residue of the estate granted though some have thought him so called with no very great proprietyf and that such estate is rather a descendible freehold but the title of common occupancy is now reduced almost to nothing by two statutes the one    car ii c   which enacts according to the ancient rule of lawg that where there is no special occupant in whom the estate may vest the tenant pur auter vie may devise it    0 by will or it shall go to the executors or administrators and be assets in their hands for payment of debts  the other that of    geo ii c  0   0 which enacts that the surplus of such estate pur auter vie after payment of debts shall go in a course of distribution like a chattel interest by these two statutes the title of common occupancy is utterly extinct and abolished though that of special occupancy by the heiratlaw continues to this day such heir being held to succeed to the ancestors estate not by descent for then he must take an estate of inheritance but as an occupant specially marked out and appointed by the original grant but as before the statutes there could no common occupancy be had of incorporeal hereditaments as of rents tithes advowsons commons or the likeh because with respect to them there could be no actual entry made or corporal seisin had and therefore by the death of the grantee pur auter vie a grant of such hereditaments was entirely determined so now i apprehend notwithstanding these statutes such grant would be determined likewise and the hereditaments would not be devisable nor vest in the executors nor go in a course of distribution for these statutes must not be construed so as to create any new estate or keep that alive which by the common law was determined and thereby to defer the grantors reversion but merely to dispose of an interest in being to which by law there was no owner and which therefore was left open to the first occupant  when there is a residue left the statutes give it to the executors and administrators instead of the first occupant but they will not create a residue on purpose to give it to eitheri they only meant to provide an appointed instead of a casual a certain instead of an uncertain owner of lands which before were nobodys and thereby to supply this casus omissus and render the disposition of law in all respects entirely uniform this being the only instance wherein a title to real estate could ever be acquired by occupancy           this i say was the only instance for i think there can be no other case devised wherein there is not some owner of the land appointed by the law in the case of a sole corporation as a parson of a church when he dies or resigns though there is no actual owner of the land till a successor be appointed yet there is a legal potential ownership subsisting in contemplation of law and when the successor is appointed his appointment shall have a retrospect and relation backwards so as to entitle him to all the profits from the instant that the vacancy commenced and in all other instances when the tenant dies intestate and no other owner of the lands is to be found in the common course of descents there the law vests an ownership in the king or in the subordinate lord of the fee by escheat so also in some cases where the laws of other nations give a right by occupancy as in lands newly created by the rising of an island in the sea or in a river or by the alluvion or dereliction of the waters in these instances the law of england assigns them an immediate owner for bracton tells usj that if an island arise in the middle of a river it belongs in common to those who have lands on each side thereof but if it be nearer to one bank than the other it belongs only to him who is proprietor of the nearest shore which is agreeable to and probably copied from the civil lawk yet this seems only to be reasonable where the soil of the river is equally divided between the owners of the opposite shores for if the whole soil is the freehold of any one man as it usually is whenever a several fishery is claimedl there it seems just and so is the constant practice that the eyotts or little islands arising in any part of the river shall be the property of him who owneth the piscary and the soil however in case a new island rise in the sea though the civil law gives it to the first occupantm yet ours gives it to the kingn      and as to lands gained from the sea either by alluvion by the washing up of sand and earth so as in time to make terra firma or by dereliction as when the sea shrinks back below the usual watermark in these cases the law is held to be that if this gain be by little and little by small and imperceptible degrees it shall go to the owner of the land adjoiningo for de minimis non curat lex and besides these owners being often losers by the breaking in of the sea or at charges to keep it out this possible gain is therefore a reciprocal consideration for such possible charge or loss but if the alluvion or dereliction be sudden and considerable in this case it belongs to the king for as the king is lord of the sea and so owner of the soil while it is covered with water it is but reasonable he should have the soil when the water has left it dryp so that the quantity of ground gained and the time during which it is gaining are what make it either the kings or the subjects property  in the same manner if a river running between two     lordships by degrees gains upon the one and thereby leaves the other dry the owner who loses his ground thus imperceptibly has no remedy but if the course of the river be changed by a sudden and violent flood or other hasty means and thereby a man loses his ground it is said that he shall have what the river has left in any other place as a recompense for this sudden lossq and this law of alluvions and derelictions with regard to rivers is nearly the same in the imperial lawr from whence indeed those our determinations seem to have been drawn and adopted but we ourselves as islanders have applied them to marine increase and have given our sovereign the prerogative he enjoys as well upon the particular reasons before mentioned as upon this other general ground of prerogative which was formerly remarkeds that whatever hath no other owner is vested by law in the king chapter xvii iii of title by prescription a third method of acquiring real property by purchase is that by prescription as when a man can show no other title to what he claims than that he and those under whom he claims have immemorially used to enjoy it concerning customs or immemorial usages in general with the several requisites and rules to be observed in order to prove their existence and validity we inquired at large in the preceding part of these commentariesa at present therefore i shall only first distinguish between custom strictly taken and prescription and then show what sort of things may be prescribed for and first the distinction between custom and prescription is this that custom is properly a local usage and not annexed to a person such as a custom in the manor of dale that lands shall descend to the youngest son prescription is merely a personal usage as that sempronius and his ancestors or those whose estate he hath have used time out of mind to have such an advantage or privilegeb  as for example if there be a usage in the parish of dale that all the inhabitants of that parish may dance on a certain close at all times for their recreation which is heldc to be a lawful usage this is strictly a custom for     it is applied to the place in general and not to any particular persons but if the      tenant who is seised of the manor of dale in fee alleges that he and his ancestors or all those whose estate he hath in the said manor have used time out of mind to have common of pasture in such a close this is properly called a prescription for this is a usage annexed to the person of the owner of this estate all prescription must be either in a man and his ancestors or in a man and those whose estate he hathd which last is called prescribing in a que estate and formerly a man might by the common law have prescribed for a right which had been enjoyed by his ancestors or predecessors at any distance of time though his or their enjoyment of it had been suspendede for an indefinite series of years but by the statute of limitations    hen viii c   it is enacted that no person shall make any prescription by the seisin or possession of his ancestor or predecessor unless such seisin or possession hath been within threescore years next before such prescription madef secondly as to the several species of things which may or may not be prescribed for we may in the first place observe that nothing but incorporeal hereditaments can be claimed by prescription as a right of way a common c but that no prescription can give a title to lands and other corporeal substances of which more certain evidence may be hadg for a man shall not be said to prescribe that he and his ancestors have immemorially used to hold the castle of arundel for this is clearly another sort of title a title by corporal seisin and inheritance which is more permanent and therefore more capable of proof than that of prescription but as to a right of way a common or the like a man may be allowed to prescribe for of these there is no corporal seisin the enjoyment will be frequently by intervals and therefore the right to enjoy them can depend on nothing else but immemorial usage   a prescription must always be      laid in him that is tenant of the fee a tenant for life for years at will or a copyholder cannot prescribe by reason of the imbecility of their estatesh for as prescription is usage beyond time of memory it is absurd that they should pretend to prescribe for any thing whose estates commenced within the remembrance of man and therefore the copyholder must prescribe under cover of his lords estate and the tenant for life under cover of the tenant in feesimple as if tenant for life of a manor would prescribe for a right of common as appurtenant to the same he must prescribe under cover of the tenant in feesimple and must plead that john stiles and his ancestors had immemorially used to have this right of common appurtenant to the said manor and that john stiles demised the said manor with its appurtenances to him the said tenant for life    a prescription cannot be for a     thing which cannot be raised by grant for the law allows prescription only in supply of the loss of a grant and therefore every prescription presupposes a grant to have existed  thus the lord of a manor cannot prescribe to raise a tax or toll upon strangers for as such claim could never have been good by any grant it shall not be good by prescriptioni    a fourth rule is that what is to arise by matter of record cannot be prescribed for but must be claimed by grant entered on record such as for instance the royal franchise of deodands felons goods and the like these not being forfeited till the matter on which they arise is found by the inquisition of a jury and so made a matter of record the forfeiture itself cannot be claimed by an inferior title but the franchises of treasuretrove waifs estrays and the like may be claimed by prescription for they arise from private contingencies and not from any matter of recordk   among things incorporeal which may be claimed by prescription a distinction must be made with regard to the manner of prescribing that is whether a man shall prescribe in a que estate or in himself and his ancestors for if a man prescribes in a que estate that is in himself and those whose estate he holds nothing      is claimable by this prescription but such things as are incident appendant or appurtenant to lands for it would be absurd to claim any thing as the consequence or appendix of an estate with which the thing claimed has no connection but if he prescribes in himself and his ancestors he may prescribe for any thing whatsoever that lies in grant not only things that are appurtenant but also such as may be in grossl therefore a man may prescribe that he and those whose estate he hath in the manor of dale have used to hold the advowson of dale as appendant to that manor but if the advowson be a distinct inheritance and not     appendant then he can only prescribe in his ancestors so also a man may prescribe in a que estate for a common appurtenant to a manor but if he would prescribe for a common in gross he must prescribe in himself and his ancestors   lastly  we may observe that estates gained by prescription are not of course descendible to the heirs general like other purchased estates but are an exception to the rule for properly speaking the prescription is rather to be considered as an evidence of a former acquisition than as an acquisition de novo and therefore if a man prescribes for a right of way in himself and his ancestors it will descend only to the blood of that line of ancestors in whom he so prescribes the prescription in this case being indeed a species of descent but if he prescribes for it in a que estate it will follow the nature of that estate in which the prescription is laid and be inheritable in the same manner whether that were acquired by descent or purchase for every accessory followeth the nature of its principal      chapter xviii iv of title by forfeiture forfeiture is a punishment annexed by law to some illegal act or negligence in the owner of lands tenements or hereditaments whereby he loses all his interest therein and they go to the party injured as a recompense for the wrong which either he alone or the public together with himself hath sustained lands tenements and hereditaments may be forfeited in various degrees and by various means   by crimes and misdemesnors   by alienation contrary to law   by nonpresentation to a benefice when the forfeiture is denominated a lapse   by simony   by nonperformance of condition   by waste   by breach of copyhold customs   by bankruptcy i the foundation and justice of forfeitures for crimes and misdemesnors and the several degrees of those forfeitures proportioned to the several offences have been hinted at in the preceding booka but it will be more properly considered and more at large in the fourth book of these commentaries at present i shall only observe in general that the offences which induce a forfeiture of lands and tenements to the crown are principally the following six   treason   felony   misprision of treason   præmunire        drawing a weapon on a judge or striking any one in the presence of the kings principal courts of justice   popish recusancy or nonobservance of certain laws enacted in restraint of papists  but at what time they severally commence how far they extend and how long they endure will with greater propriety be reserved as the object of our future inquiries  ii lands and tenements may be forfeited by alienation or conveying them to another contrary to law this is either alienation in mortmain alienation to an alien or alienation by particular tenants in the two former of which cases the forfeiture arises from the incapacity of the alienee to take in the latter from the incapacity of the alienor to grant   alienation in mortmain in mortua manu is an alienation of lands or tenements to any corporation sole or aggregate ecclesiastical or temporal but these purchases having been chiefly made by religious houses in consequence whereof the lands became perpetually inherent in one dead hand this hath occasioned the general appellation of mortmain to be applied to such alienationsb and the religious houses themselves to be principally considered in forming the statutes of mortmain in deducing the history of which statutes it will be matter of curiosity to observe the great address and subtle contrivance of the ecclesiastics in cluding from time to time the laws in being and the zeal with which successive parliaments have pursued them through all their finesses how new remedies were still the parents of new evasions till the legislature at last though with difficulty hath obtained a decisive victory by the common law any man might dispose of his lands to any other private man at his own discretion especially when the feodal restraints of alienation were worn away yet in consequence of these it was always and is still     necessaryc for corporations to have a license in mortmain      from the crown to enable them to purchase lands for as the king is the ultimate lord of every fee he ought not unless by his own consent to lose his privilege of escheats and other feodal profits by the vesting of lands in tenants that can never be attainted or die and such licenses of mortmain seem to have been necessary among the saxons above sixty years before the norman conquestd but besides this general license from the king as lord paramount of the kingdom it was also requisite whenever there was a mesne or intermediate lord between the king and the alienor to obtain his license also upon the same feodal principles for the alienation of the specific land and if no such license was obtained the king or other lord might respectively enter on the land so aliened in mortmain as a forfeiture the necessity of this license from the crown was acknowledged by the constitutions of clarendone in respect of advowsons which the monks always greatly coveted as being the groundwork of subsequent appropriationsf yet such were the influence and ingenuity of the clergy that notwithstanding this fundamental principle we find that the largest and most considerable dotations of religious houses happened within less than two centuries after the conquest and when a license could not be obtained their contrivance seems to have been this that as the forfeiture for such alienations accrued in the first place to the immediate lord of the fee the tenant who meant to alienate first conveyed his lands to the religious house and instantly took them back again to hold as tenant to the monastery which kind of instantaneous seisin was probably held not to occasion any forfeiture and then by pretext of some other forfeiture surrender or escheat the society entered into those lands in right of such their newlyacquired signiory as immediate lords of the fee but when these dotations began to grow numerous it was observed that the feodal services ordained for the defence of the kingdom were every day visibly withdrawn that the circulation of landed property from man to man began to    0 stagnate and that the lords were curtailed of the fruits of their signiories their escheats wardships reliefs and the like and therefore in order to prevent this it was ordered by the second of king henry iiis great charterg and afterwards by that printed in our common statutebook that all such attempts should be void and the land forfeited to the lord of the feeh but as this prohibition extended only to religious houses bishops and other sole corporations were not included therein and the aggregate ecclesiastical bodies who sir edward coke observesi in this were to be commended that they ever had of their counsel the best learned men that they could get found many means to creep out of this statute by buying in lands that were bonâ fide holden of themselves as lords of the fee and thereby evading the forfeiture or by taking long leases for years which first introduced those extensive terms for a thousand or more years which are now so frequent in conveyances this produced the statute de religiosis   edw i which provided that no person religious or other whatsoever should buy or sell or receive under pretence of a gift or term of years or any other title whatsoever nor should by any art or ingenuity appropriate to himself any lands or tenements in mortmain upon pain that the immediate lord of the fee or on his default for one year the lords paramount and in default of all of them the king might enter thereon as a forfeiture this seemed to be a sufficient security against all alienations in mortmain but as these statutes extended only to gifts and conveyances between the parties the religious houses now began to set up a fictitious title to the land which it was intended they should have and to bring an      action to recover it against the tenant who by fraud and collusion made no defence and     thereby judgment was given for the religious house which then recovered the land by sentence of law upon a supposed prior title and thus they had the honour of inventing those fictitious adjudications of right which are since become the great assurance of the kingdom under the name of common recoveries but upon this the statute of westminster the second    edw i c    enacted that in such cases a jury shall try the true right of the demandants or plaintiffs to the land and if the religious house or corporation be found to have it they shall still recover seisin otherwise it shall be forfeited to the immediate lord of the fee or else to the next lord and finally to the king upon the immediate or other lords default and the like provision was made by the succeeding chapterk in case the tenants set up crosses upon their lands the badges of knights templars and hospitallers in order to protect them from the feodal demands of their lords by virtue of the privileges of those religious and military orders so careful indeed was this provident prince to prevent any future evasions that when the statute of quia emptores    edw i abolished all subinfeudations and gave liberty for all men to alienate their lands to be holden of their next immediate lordl a proviso was insertedm that this should not extend to authorize any kind of alienation in mortmain and when afterwards the method of obtaining the kings license by writ of ad quod damnum was marked out by the statute    edw i st   it was further provided by statute    edw i st   that no such license should be effectual without the consent of the mesne or intermediate lords yet still it was found difficult to set bounds to ecclesiastical ingenuity for when they were driven out of all their former holds they devised a new method of conveyance by which the lands were granted not to themselves directly but to nominal feoffees to the use of the religious houses thus distinguishing between the possession and the use and receiving      the actual profits while the seisin of the land remained in the nominal feoffee who was held by the courts of equity then under the direction of the clergy to be bound in conscience to account to his cestuy que use for the rents and emoluments of the estate and it is to these inventions that our practisers are indebted for the introduction of uses and trusts the foundation of modern conveyancing but unfortunately for the inventors themselves they did not long enjoy the advantage of their new device for the statute    ric ii c   enacts that the lands which had been so purchased to uses should be amortised by license from the crown or else be sold to private persons and that for the future uses shall be subject to the statutes of mortmain and forfeitable like the lands themselves and whereas the statutes had been eluded by purchasing large tracts of land adjoining to churches and consecrating them by the name of churchyards such subtile imagination is also declared to be within the compass of the statutes of mortmain and civil or lay corporations as well as ecclesiastical are also declared to be within the mischief and of course within the remedy provided by those salutary laws and lastly as during the times of popery lands were frequently given to superstitious uses though not to any corporate bodies or were made liable in the hands of heirs and devisees to the charge of obits chaunteries and the like which were equally pernicious in a wellgoverned state as actual alienations in mortmain therefore at the dawn of the reformation the statute    hen viii c  0 declares that all future grants of lands for any of the purposes aforesaid if granted for any longer term than twenty years shall be void but during all this time it was in the power of the crown by granting a license of mortmain to remit the forfeiture so far as related to its own rights and to enable any spiritual or other corporation to purchase and hold any lands or tenements in perpetuity which prerogative is declared and confirmed by the statute    edw iii st   c   but as doubts were conceived at the time of the revolution how far such license was validn since the kings had no      power to dispense with the statutes of mortmain by a clause of non     obstanteo which was the usual course though it seems to have been unnecessaryp and as by the gradual declension of mesne signiories through the long operation of the statute of quia emptores the rights of intermediate lords were reduced to a very small compass it was therefore provided by the statute      w iii c    that the crown for the future at its own discretion may grant licenses to aliene or take in mortmain of whomsoever the tenements may be holden after the dissolution of monasteries under henry viii though the policy of the next popish successor affected to grant a security to the possessors of abbey lands yet in order to regain so much of them as either the zeal or timidity of their owners might induce them to part with the statutes of mortmain were suspended for twenty years by the statute      p and m c   and during that time any lands or tenements were allowed to be granted to any spiritual corporation without any license whatsoever and long afterwards for a much better purpose the augmentation of poor livings it was enacted by the statute    car ii c   that appropriators may annex the great tithes to the vicarages and that all benefices under  00l per annum may be augmented by the purchase of lands without license of mortmain in either case and the like provision hath been since made in favour of the governors of queen annes bountyq it hath also been heldr that the statute    hen viii before mentioned did not extend to any thing but superstitious uses and that therefore a man may give lands for the maintenance of a school a hospital or any other charitable uses but as it was apprehended from recent experience that persons on their deathbeds might make large and improvident dispositions even for these good purposes and defeat the political ends of the statutes of mortmain it is therefore enacted by the statute   geo ii c    that no lands or tenements or money to be laid out thereon shall      be given for or charged with any charitable uses whatsoever unless by deed indented executed in the presence of two witnesses twelve calendar months before the death of the donor and enrolled in the court of chancery within six months after its execution except stocks in the public funds which may be transferred within six months previous to the donors death and unless such gift be made to take effect immediately and be without power of revocation and that all other gifts shall be void      the two universities their colleges and the scholars upon the foundation of the colleges of eton winchester and westminster are excepted out of this act but such exemption was granted with this proviso that no college shall be at     liberty to purchase more advowsons than are equal in number to one moiety of the fellows or students upon the respective foundations    secondly alienation to an alien is also a cause of forfeiture to the crown of the land so alienated not only on account of his incapacity to hold them which occasions him to be passed by in descents of lands but likewise on account of his presumption in attempting by an act of his own to acquire any real property as was observed in the preceding bookt   lastly alienations by particular tenants when they are greater than the law entitles them to make and devest the remainder or reversionu are also forfeitures to him whose right is attacked thereby as if tenant for his own life alienes by feoffment or fine for the life of another or in tail or in fee  these being estates which either must or may last longer than his own the creating them is not only beyond his power and inconsistent with the nature of his interest but is also a forfeiture of his own particular estate to him in remainder or reversionv  for which there seem to be two reasons first because such alienation amounts to a renunciation of the feodal connection and dependence it implies a refusal to perform the due renders and services to the lord of      the fee of which fealty is constantly one and it tends in its consequence to defeat and devest the remainder or reversion expectant as therefore that is put in jeopardy by such act of the particular tenant it is but     just that upon discovery the particular estate should be forfeited and taken from him who has shown so manifest an inclination to make an improper use of it the other reason is because the particular tenant by granting a larger estate than his own has by his own act determined and put an entire end to his own original interest and on such determination the next taker is entitled to enter regularly as in his remainder or reversion the same law which is thus laid down with regard to tenants for life holds also with respect to all tenants of the mere freehold or of chattel interests but if tenant in tail alienes in fee this is no immediate forfeiture to the remainderman but a mere discontinuance as it is calledw of the estatetail which the issue may afterwards avoid by due course of lawx for he in remainder or reversion hath only a very remote and barely possible interest therein until the issue in tail is extinct but in case of such forfeitures by particular tenants all legal estates by them before created as if tenant for twenty years grants a lease for fifteen and all charges by him lawfully made on the lands shall be good and available in lawy for the law will not hurt an innocent lessee for the fault of his lessor nor permit the lessor after he has granted a good and lawful estate by his own act to avoid it and defeat the interest which he himself has created equivalent both in its nature and its consequences to an illegal alienation by the particular tenant is the civil crime of disclaimer as where a tenant who holds of any lord neglects to render him the due services and upon an action brought to recover them disclaims to hold of his lord which disclaimer of tenure in any court of record is a forfeiture of the lands to the lordz upon reasons most apparently feodal and so likewise if in any court of record the      particular tenant does any act which amounts to a virtual disclaimer if he claims any greater estate than was granted him at the first infeodation or takes upon himself those rights which belong only to tenant of a superior classa if he affirms the reversion to be in a stranger by accepting his fine attorning as his tenant collusive pleading and the likeb such behaviour amounts to a forfeiture of his particular estate iii lapse is a species of forfeiture whereby the right of presentation to a church accrues to the ordinary by neglect of the patron to present to the metropolitan by neglect of the ordinary and to the king by neglect of the metropolitan for it being for the interest of religion and the good of the public that the church should be provided with an officiating minister the law has therefore given this right of lapse in order to quicken the patron who might otherwise by suffering the church to remain vacant avoid paying his ecclesiastical dues and frustrate the pious intentions of his ancestors this right of lapse was first established about the time though not by the authorityc of the council of laterand which was in the reign of our henry the second when the bishops first began to exercise universally the right of institution to churchese and therefore where there is no right of institution there is no right of lapse so that no donative can lapse to the ordinaryf unless it hath been augmented by the queens bountyg but no right of lapse can accrue when the original presentation is in the crownh the term in which the title to present by lapse accrues from the one to the other successively is six calendar monthsi following in this case the computation of the church and not the usual one of the common law and this      exclusive of the day of the avoidancek but if the bishop be both patron and ordinary he shall not have a double time allowed him to collate inl for the forfeiture accrues by law whenever the negligence has continued six months in the same person and also if the bishop doth not collate his own clerk immediately to the living and the patron presents though after the six months are elapsed yet his presentation is good and the bishop is bound     to institute the patrons clerkm for as the law only gives the bishop this title by lapse to punish the patrons negligence there is no reason that if the bishop himself be guilty of equal or greater negligence the patron should be deprived of his turn if the bishop suffer the presentation to lapse to the metropolitan the patron has also the same advantage if he presents before the archbishop has filled up the benefice and that for the same reason yet the ordinary cannot after lapse to the metropolitan collate his own clerk to the prejudice of the archbishopn for he had no permanent right and interest in the advowson as the patron hath but merely a temporary one which having neglected to make use of during the time he cannot afterwards retrieve it but if the presentation lapses to the king prerogative here intervenes and makes a difference and the patron shall never recover his right till the king has satisfied his turn by presentation for nullum tempus occurrit regio and therefore it may seem as if the church might continue void forever unless the king shall be pleased to present and a patron thereby be absolutely defeated of his advowson but to prevent this inconvenience the law has lodged a power in the patrons hands of as it were compelling the king to present for if during the delay of the crown the patron himself presents and his clerk is instituted the king indeed by presenting another may turn out the patrons clerk or after induction may remove him by quare impedit but if he does not and the patrons clerk dies incumbent or is canonically deprived the king hath lost his right which was only to the next or first presentationp      in case the benefice becomes void by death or cession through plurality of benefices there the patron is bound to take notice of the vacancy at his own peril for these are matters of equal notoriety to the patron and ordinary but in case of a vacancy by resignation or canonical deprivation or if a clerk presented be refused for insufficiency these being matters of which the bishop alone is presumed to be cognizant here the law requires him to give notice thereof to the patron otherwise he can take no advantage by way of lapseq neither shall any lapse thereby accrue to the metropolitan or to the king for it is universally true that neither the archbishop nor the king shall ever present by lapse but where the immediate ordinary might have collated by lapse within the six months and hath exceeded his time for the first step or beginning faileth et quod non habet principium non habet finemr if the bishop refuse or neglect to examine and admit the patrons clerk without good reason assigned or notice given he is styled a disturber by the law and shall not have any title to present by lapse for no man shall take advantage of his own wrongs also if the right of presentation be litigious or contested and an action be brought against the bishop to try the title no lapse shall incur till the question of right be decidedt iv by simony the right of presentation to a living is forfeited and vested pro hac vice in the crown simony is the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical benefice for money gift or reward it is so called from the resemblance it is said to bear to the sin of simon magus though the purchasing of holy orders seems to approach nearer to his offence it was by the canon law a very grievous crime and is so much the more odious because as sir edward coke observesu it is ever accompanied with perjury for the presentee is sworn to have committed no simony however it was not an offence punishable in a criminal way at the common laww it being thought sufficient to leave the clerk to ecclesiastical censures but as these did not affect      the simoniacal patron nor were efficacious enough to repel the notorious practice of the thing divers acts of parliament have been made to restrain it by means of civil forfeitures which the modern prevailing usage with regard to spiritual preferments calls aloud to be put in execution i shall briefly consider them in this place because they devest the corrupt patron of the right of presentation and vest a new right in the crown     by the statute    eliz c   it is for avoiding of simony enacted that if any patron for any corrupt consideration by gift or promise directly or indirectly shall present or collate any person to an ecclesiastical benefice or dignity such presentation shall be void and the presentee be rendered incapable of ever enjoying the same benefice and the crown shall present to it for that turn onlyx but if the presentee dies without being convicted of such simony in his lifetime it is enacted by stat   w and m c    that the simoniacal contract shall not prejudice any other innocent patron on pretence of lapse to the crown or otherwise also by the statute    anne stat   c    if any person for money or profit shall procure in his own name or the name of any other the next presentation to any living ecclesiastical and shall be presented thereupon this is declared to be a simoniacal contract and the party is subject to all the ecclesiastical penalties of simony is disabled from holding the benefice and the presentation devolves to the crown upon these statutes many questions have arisen with regard to what is and what is not simony and among others these points seem to be clearly settled   that to purchase a presentation the living being actually vacant is open and notorious simonyy this being expressly in the face of the statute   that for a clerk to bargain for the next presentation the incumbent being sick and about to die was simony even before the statute of queen annez and now by that statute to purchase either in his own name or anothers the next presentation and be thereupon presented    0 at any future time to the living is direct and palpable simony but   it is held that for a father to purchase such a presentation in order to provide for his son is not simony for the son is not concerned in the bargain and the father is by nature bound to make a provision for hima   that if a simoniacal contract be made with the patron the clerk not being privy thereto the presentation for that turn shall indeed devolve to the crown as a punishment of the guilty patron but the clerk who is innocent does not incur any disability or forfeitureb   that bonds given to pay money to charitable uses on receiving a presentation to a living are not simoniacalc provided the patron or his relations be not benefited therebyd for this is no corrupt consideration moving to the patron   that bonds of resignation in case of nonresidence or taking any other living are not simoniacale there being no corrupt consideration herein but such only as is for the good of the public so also bonds to resign when the patrons son comes to canonical age are legal upon the reason being given that the father is bound to provide for his sonf   lastly general bonds to resign at the patrons request are held to be legalg for they may possibly be given for one of the legal considerations before mentioned and where there is a possibility that a transaction may be fair the law will not suppose it iniquitous without proof  but if the party can prove the contract to have been a corrupt one such proof will be admitted in order to show the bond simoniacal and therefore void neither will the patron be suffered to make an   0 ill use of such a general bond of resignation as by extorting a composition for tithes procuring an annuity for his relation or by demanding a resignation wantonly or without good cause such as is approved by the law as for the benefit of his own son or on account of nonresidence plurality of livings or gross immorality in the incumbenth      v the next kind of forfeitures are those by breach or nonperformance of a condition annexed to the estate either expressly by deed at its original creation or impliedly by law from a principle of natural reason both which we considered at large in a former chapteri vi   therefore now proceed to another species of forfeiture viz by waste waste vastum is a spoil or destruction in houses gardens trees or other corporeal hereditaments to the disherison of him that hath the remainder or reversion in feesimple or feetailk  waste is either voluntary which is a crime of commission as by pulling down a house or it is permissive  which is a matter of omission only as by suffering it to fall for want of necessary reparations whatever does a lasting damage to the freehold or inheritance is wastel therefore removing wainscot floors or other things once fixed to the freehold of a house is wastem 0 if a house     be destroyed by tempest lightning or the like which is the act of providence it is no waste but otherwise if the house be burned by the carelessness or negligence of the lessee though now by the statute   anne c    no action will     lie against a tenant for an accident of this kind   waste may also be committed in ponds dovehouses warrens and the like by so reducing the number of the creatures therein that there will not be sufficient for the reversioner when he comes to the inheritancen timber also is part of the inheritanceo such are oak ash and elm in all places and in some particular countries by local custom where other trees are generally used for building they are for that reason considered as timber and to cut down such trees or top them or do any other act whereby the timber may decay is wastep   but underwood the tenant may cut down at any seasonable time      that he pleasesq and may take sufficient estovers of common right for housebote and cartbote unless restrained which is usual by particular covenants or exceptionsr the conversion of land from one species to another is waste to convert wood meadow or pasture into arable to turn arable meadow or pasture into woodland or to turn arable or woodland into meadow or pasture are all of them wastes for as sir edward coke observest it not only changes the course of husbandry but the evidence of the estate when such a close which is conveyed and described as pasture is found to be arable and e converso and the same rule is observed for the same reason with regard to converting one species of edifice into another even though it is improved in its valueu to open the land to search for mines of metal coal c is waste for that is a detriment to the inheritancev   but if the pits or mines were open before     it is no waste for the tenant to continue digging them for his own usew for it is now become the mere annual profit of the land these three are the general heads of waste viz in houses in timber and in land though as was     before said whatever else tends to the destruction or depreciating the value of the inheritance is considered by the law as waste let us next see who are liable to be punished for committing waste and by the feodal law feuds being originally granted for life only we find that the rule was general for all vassals or feudatories si vasallus feudum dissipaverit aut insigni detrimento deterius fecerit privabiturx but in our antient common law the rule was by no means so large for not only he that was seised of an estate of inheritance might do as he pleased with it but also waste was not punishablo in any tenant save only in three persons guardian in chivalry tenant in dower and tenant by the      curtesyy and not in tenant for life or yearsz and the reason of the diversity was that the estate of the three former was created by the act of the law itself which therefore gave a remedy against them but tenant for life or for years came in by the demise and lease of the owner of the fee and therefore he might have provided against the committing of waste by his lessee and if he did not it was his own default but in favour of the owners of the inheritance the statutes of marlbridge    hen iii c    and of gloucester   edw i c   provided that the writ of waste shall not only lie against tenants by the law of england or curtesy and those in dower but against any farmer or other that holds in any manner for life or years so that for above five hundred years past all tenants merely for life or for any less estate have been punishable or liable to be impeached for waste both voluntary and permissive unless their leases be made as sometimes they are without impeachment of waste absque impetitione vasti that is with a provision or protection that no man shall impetere or sue him for waste committed but tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct is not impeachable for waste because his estate was at its creation an estate of inheritance and so not within the statutesa neither does an action of waste lie for the debtor against tenant by statute recognizance or elegit because against them the debtor may set off the damages in accountb but it seems reasonable that it should lie for the reversioner expectant on the determination of the debtors own estate or of these estates derived from the debtorc the punishment for waste committed was by common law and the statute of marlbridge only single damagesd except in the case of a guardian who also forfeited his wardshipe by the provisions of the great charterf but the statute of gloucester directs that the other four species of tenant shall lose and forfeit the place wherein the waste is committed and also treble damages to him that hath the inheritance the expression of the statute is he shall forfeit the thing which he hath wasted and it hath been determined that under these words the place is also includedg and if waste be done sparsim or here and there all over a wood the whole wood shall be recovered or if in several rooms of a      house the whole house shall be forfeitedh because it is impracticable for the reversioner to enjoy only the identical places wasted     when lying interspersed with the other but if waste be done only in one end of a wood or perhaps in one room of a house if that can be conveniently separated from the rest that part only is the locus vastatus or thing wasted and that only shall be forfeited to the reversioneri   vii a seventh species of forfeiture is that of copyhold estates by breach of the customs of the manor copyhold estates are not only liable to the same forfeitures as those which are held in socage for treason felony alienation and waste whereupon the lord may seise them without any presentment by the homagek but also to peculiar forfeitures annexed to this species of tenure which are incurred by the breach of either the general customs of all copyholds or the peculiar local customs of certain particular manors and we may observe that as these tenements were originally holden by the lowest and most abject vassals the marks of feodal dominion continue much the strongest upon this mode of property most of the offences which occasioned a resumption of the fief by the feodal law and were denominated feloniæ per quas vasallus amitteret feuduml still continue to be causes of forfeiture in many of our modern copyholds as by subtraction of suit and servicem si dominum deservire nolueritn by disclaiming to hold of the lord or swearing himself not his copyholdero si dominum ejuravit ie negavit se a domino feudum haberep by neglect to be admitted tenant within a year and a dayq si per annum et diem cessaverit in petenda investiturar by contumacy in not appearing in court after three proclamationss si a domino ter citatus non comparueritt or by refusing when sworn of the homage to present the truth according to his oathu      si pares veritatem noverint et dicant nescire cum sciantw in these and a variety of other cases which it is impossible here to enumerate the forfeiture does not accrue to the lord till after the offences are presented by the homage or jury of the lords courtbaronx per laudamentum parium suorumy or as it is more fully expressed in another placez nemo miles adimatur de possessione sui beneficii nisi convicta culpa quæ sit laudandaa per judicium parium suorum   viii the eighth and last method whereby lands and tenements may become forfeited is that of bankruptcy or the act of becoming a bankrupt which unfortunate person may from the several descriptions given of him in our statute law be thus defined a trader who secretes himself or does certain other acts tending to defraud his creditors who shall be such a trader or what acts are sufficient to denominate him a bankrupt with the several connected consequences resulting from that unhappy situation will be better considered in a subsequent chapter when we shall endeavour     more fully to explain its nature as it most immediately relates to personal goods and chattels i shall only here observe the manner in which the property of lands and tenements is transferred upon the supposition that the owner of them is clearly and indisputably a bankrupt and that a commission of bankrupt is awarded and issued against him by statute    eliz c   the commissioners for that purpose when a man is declared a bankrupt shall have full power to dispose of all his lands and tenements which he had in his own right at the time when he became a bankrupt or which shall descend or come to him at any time afterwards before his debts are satisfied or agreed for and all lands and tenements which were purchased by him jointly with his wife or children to his own use or such interest therein as      he may lawfully part with or purchased with any other person upon secret trust for his own use and to cause them to be appraised to their full value and to sell the same by deed indented and enrolled or divide them proportionably among the creditors this statute expressly included not only free but customary and copyhold lands but did not extend to estatestail further than for the bankrupts life nor to equities of redemption on a mortgaged estate wherein the bankrupt has no legal interest but only an equitable reversion whereupon the statute    jac i c    enacts that the commissioners shall be empowered to sell or convey by deed indented and enrolled any lands or tenements of the bankrupt wherein he shall be seised of an estatetail in possession remainder or reversion unless the remainder or reversion thereof shall be in the crown and that such sale shall be good against all such issues in tail remaindermen and reversioners whom the bankrupt himself might have barred by a common recovery or other means and that all equities of redemption upon mortgaged estates shall be at the disposal of the commissioners for they shall have power to redeem the same as the bankrupt himself might have done and after redemption to sell them and also by this and a former actb all fraudulent conveyances to defeat the intent of these statutes are declared void but that no purchaser bona fide for a good or valuable consideration shall be affected by the bankrupt laws unless the commission be sued forth within five years after the act of bankruptey committed by virtue of these statutes a bankrupt may lose all his real estates which may at once be transferred by his commissioners to their assignees without his participation or consent       chapter xix v of title by alienation the most usual and universal method of acquiring a title to real estates is that of alienation conveyance or purchase in its limited sense under which may be comprised any method wherein estates are voluntarily resigned by one man and accepted by another whether that be effected by sale gift marriage settlement devise or other transmission of property by the mutual consent of the parties this means of taking estates by alienation is not of equal antiquity in the law of england with that of taking them by descent for we may remember that by the feodal lawa a pure and genuine feud could not be transferred from one feudatory to another without the consent of the lord lest thereby a feeble or suspicious tenant might have been substituted and imposed upon him to perform the feodal services instead of one on whose abilities and fidelity he could depend neither could the feudatory then subject the land to his debts for if he might the feodal restraint of alienation would have been easily frustrated and evadedb and as he could not aliene it in his lifetime so neither could he by will defeat the succession by devising his feud to another family nor even alter the course of it by imposing particular limitations or prescribing an unusual path of descent nor in short could he aliene the estate even with the consent of the lord unless he had also obtained the consent of his own next apparent or presumptive heirc and therefore it was very usual in antient feoffments to express that      the alienation was made by consent of the heirs of the feoffor or sometimes for the heirapparent himself to join with the feoffor in the grantd and on the other hand as the feodal obligation was looked upon to be reciprocal the lord could not aliene or transfer his signiory without the consent of his vassal for it was esteemed unreasonable to subject a feudatory to a new superior with whom he might have a deadly enmity without his own approbation or even to transfer his fealty without his being thoroughly apprized of it that he might know with certainty to whom his renders and services were due and be able to distinguish a lawful distress for rent from a hostile seising of his cattle by the lord of a neighbouring clane this consent of the vassal was expressed by what was called attorningf or professing to become the tenant of the new lord which doctrine of attornment was afterwards extended to all lessees for life or years for if one bought an estate with any lease for life or years standing out thereon and the lessee or tenant refused to attorn to the purchaser and to become his tenant the grant or contract was in most cases void or at least incompleteg which was also an additional clog upon alienations but by degrees this feodal severity is worn off and experience hath shown that property best answers the purposes of civil life especially in commercial countries when its transfer and circulation are totally free and unrestrained the road was cleared in the first place by a law of king henry the first which allowed a man to sell and dispose of lands which he himself had purchased for over these he was thought to have a more extensive power than over what had been transmitted to him in a course of descent from his ancestorsh      a doctrine which is countenanced by the feodal constitutions themselvesi but he was not allowed to sell the whole of his own acquirements so as totally to disinherit his children any more than he was at liberty to aliene his paternal     estatej afterwards a man seems to have been at liberty to part with all his own acquisitions if he had previously purchased to him and his assigns by name but if his assigns were not specified in the purchasedeed he was not empowered to alienek and also he might part with onefourth of the inheritance of his ancestors without the consent of his heirl by the great charter of henry iiim no subinfeudation was permitted of part of the land unless sufficient was left to answer the services due to the superior lord which sufficiency was probably interpreted to be onehalf or moiety of the landn but these restrictions were in general removed by the statute of quia emptoreso whereby all persons except the kings tenants in capite were left at liberty to aliene all or any part of their lands at their own discretionp and even these tenants in capite were by the statute   edw iii c    permitted to aliene on paying a fine to the kingq by the temporary statutes   hen vii c   and   hen viii c   all persons attending the king in his wars were allowed to aliene their lands without license and were relieved from other feodal burdens and lastly these very fines for alienations were in all cases of freehold tenure entirely abolished by the statute    car ii c    as to the power of charging lands with the debts of the owner this was introduced so early as stat westm   whichr subjected a moiety of the tenants lands to executions for debts recovered by law as the whole of them was likewise subjected to be pawned in a statute merchant by the statute de mercatoribus made the same year and in a statute staple by statute    edw iii c   and in other similar recognizances by statute    0    hen viii c   and now the whole of them is not only subject to be pawned for the debts of the owner but likewise to be absolutely sold for the benefit of trade and commerce by the several statutes of bankruptcy the restraint of devising lands by will except in some places by particular custom lasted longer that not being totally removed till the abolition of the military tenures the doctrine of attornments continued still later than any of the rest and became extremely troublesome though many methods were invented to evade them till at last they were made no longer necessary to complete the grant or conveyance by statute      anne c    nor sliall by statute    geo ii c    the attornment of any tenant affect the possession of any lands unless made with consent of the landlord or to a mortgagee after the mortgage is forfeited or by direction of a court of justice    0 in examining the nature of alienation let us first inquire briefly who may aliene and to whom and then more largely how a man may aliene or the several modes of conveyance i who may aliene and to whom or in other words who is capable of conveying and who of purchasing and herein we must consider rather the incapacity than capacity of the several parties for all persons in possession are prima facie capable both of conveying and purchasing unless the law has laid them under any particular disabilities  but if a man has only in him the right of either possession or property he cannot convey it to any other lest pretended titles might be granted to great men whereby justice might be trodden down and the weak oppresseds  yet reversions and vested remainders may be   0 granted because the possession of the particular tenant is the possession of him in reversion or remainder but contingencies and mere possibilities though they may be released or devised by will  or may pass to the heir or executor yet cannot it hath been said be assigned to a stranger unless coupled with some present interestt  persons attainted of treason felony and præmunire are incapable of conveying from the time of the offence committed provided attainder followsu for such conveyance by them may tend to defeat the king of his forfeiture or the      lord of his escheat but they may purchase for the benefit of the crown or the lord of the fee though they are disabled to hold the lands so purchased if after attainder being subject to immediate forfeiture if before to escheat as well as forfeiture according to the nature of the crimew so also corporations religious or others may purchase lands yet unless they have     a license to hold in mortmain they cannot retain such purchase but it shall be forfeited to the lord of the fee idiots and persons of nonsane memory infants and persons under duress are not totally disabled either to convey or purchase but sub modo only for their conveyances and purchases are voidable but not actually void the king indeed on behalf of an idiot may avoid his grants or other actsx but it hath been said that a non compos himself though he be afterwards brought to a right mind shall not be permitted to allege his own insanity in order to avoid such grant for that no man shall be allowed to stultify himself or plead his own disability the progress of this notion is somewhat curious in the time of edward i non compos was a sufficient plea to avoid a mans own bondy and there is a writ in the registerz for the alienor himself to recover lands aliened by him during his insanity dum fuit non compos mentis suæ ut dicit c but under edward iii a scruple began to arise whether a man should be permitted to blemish himself by pleading his own insanitya and afterwards a defendant in assize having pleaded a release by the plaintiff since the last continuance to which the plaintiff replied ore tenus as the manner then was that he was out of his mind when he gave it the court adjourned the assize doubting whether as the plaintiff was sane both then and at the commencement of the suit he should be permitted to plead an intermediate deprivation of reason and the question was asked how he came to remember the release if out of his senses when he gave itb under henry vi this way of      reasoning that a man shall not be allowed to disable himself by pleading his own incapacity because he cannot know what he did under such a situation was seriously adopted by the judges in argumentc upon a question whether the heir was barred of his right of entry by the feoffment of his insane ancestor and from these loose authorities which fitzherbert does not scruple to reject as being contrary to reasond the maxim that a man shall not stultify himself hath been handed down as settled lawe though later opinions feeling the inconvenience of the rule have in many points endeavoured to restrain itf  and clearly the next heir or other person interested may after the death of the idiot or non compos take advantage of his incapacity and avoid the grantg and so too if he purchases under this disability and does not afterwards upon recovering his senses agree to the purchase his heir may either waive or accept the estate at his optionh in like manner an infant may waive such purchase or conveyance when he comes to full age or if he does not actually agree to it his heirs may waive it after himi persons also who purchase or convey under duress may affirm or avoid such transaction whenever the duress is     ceasedj  for all these are under the protection of the law which will not suffer them to be imposed upon through the imbecility of their present condition so that their acts are only binding in case they be afterwards agreed to when such imbecility ceases yet the guardians or committees of a lunatic by the statute of    geo iii c  0 are empowered to renew in his right under the directions of the court of chancery any lease for lives or years and apply the profits of such renewal for the benefit of such lunatic his heirs or executors  the case of a femecovert is somewhat different she may purchase an estate without the consent of her husband and the conveyance is good during the coverture till he avoids      it by some act declaring his dissentk and though be does nothing to avoid it or even if he actually consents the femecovert herself may after the death of her husband waive or disagree to the same nay even her heirs may waive it after her if she dies before her husband or if in her widowhood she does nothing to express her consent or agreementl but the conveyance or other contract of a femecovert except by some matter of record is absolutely void and not merely voidablem and therefore cannot be affirmed or made good by any subsequent agreement      the case of an alien born is also peculiar for he may purchase any thing but after purchase he can hold nothing 0 except a lease for years of a house for     convenience of merchandise in case he be an alien friend   all other purchases when found by an inquest of office being immediately forfeited to the crownn   papists lastly and persons professing the popish religion and neglecting to take the oath prescribed by statute    geo iii c  0 within the time limited for that purpose are by statute        w iii c   disabled to purchase any lands rents or hereditaments and all estates made to their use or in trust for them are voido   ii we are next but principally to inquire how a man may aliene or convey which will lead us to consider the several modes of conveyance in consequence of the admission of property or the giving a separate right by the law of society to those things which by the law of nature were in common there was necessarily some means to be devised whereby that separate right or exclusive property should be originally acquired      which we have more than once observed was that of occupancy or first possession but this possession when once gained was also necessarily to be continued or else upon one mans dereliction of the thing he had seised it would again become common and all those mischiefs and contentions would ensue which property was introduced to prevent for this purpose therefore of continuing the possession the municipal law has established descents and alienations the former to continue the possession in the heirs of the proprietor after his involuntary dereliction of it by his death the latter to continue it in those persons to whom the proprietor by his own voluntary act should choose to relinquish it in his lifetime a translation or transfer of property being thus admitted by     law it became necessary that this transfer should be properly evidenced in order to prevent disputes either about the fact as whether there was any transfer at all or concerning the persons by whom and to whom it was transferred or with regard to the subjectmatter as what the thing transferred consisted of or lastly with relation to the mode and quality of the transfer as for what period of time or in other words for what estate and interest the conveyance was made the legal evidences of this translation of property are called the common assurances of the kingdom whereby every mans estate is assured to him and all controversies doubts and difficulties are either prevented or removed these common assurances are of four kinds   by matter in pais or deed which is an assurance transacted between two or more private persons in pais in the country that is according to the old common law upon the very spot to be transferred   by matter of record or an assurance transacted only in the kings public courts of record   by special custom obtaining in some particular places and relating only to some particular species of property which three are such as take effect during the life of the party conveying or assuring   the fourth takes no effect till after his death and that is by devise contained in his last will and testament we shall treat of each in its order chapter xx of alienation by deed in treating of deeds i shall consider first their general nature and next the several sorts or kinds of deeds with their respective incidents and in explaining the former i shall examine first what a deed is secondly its requisites and thirdly how it may be avoided i first then a deed is a writing sealed and delivered by the partiesa it is sometimes called a charter carta from its materials but most usually when applied to the transactions of private subjects it is called a deed in latin factum ϰατ εξοχην because it is the most solemn and authentic act that a man can possibly perform with relation to the disposal of his property and therefore a man shall always be estopped by his own deed or not permitted to aver or prove any thing in contradiction to what he has once so solemnly and deliberately avowedb if a deed be made by more parties than one there ought to be regularly as many copies of it as there are parties and each should be cut or indented formerly in acute angles instar dentium like the teeth of a saw but at present in a waving line on the top or side to tally or correspond with the other which deed so made is called an indenture formerly when deeds were more concise than at present it was usual to write both parts on the same piece of parchment with some word or letters of the alphabet written between them through which the parchment was cut either in a straight or indented line in such a manner as to leave half the word on      one part and half on the other deeds thus made were denominated syngrapha by the canonistsc and with us chirographa or handwritingsd the word cirographum or cyrographum being usually that which is divided in making the indenture and this custom is still preserved in making out the indentures of a fine whereof hereafter but at length indenting only has come into use without cutting through any letters at all and it seems at present to serve for little other purpose than to give name to the species of the deed when the several parts of an indenture are interchangeably executed by the several parties that part or copy which is executed by the grantor is usually called the original and the rest are counterparts though of     late it is most frequent for all the parties to execute every part which renders them all originals a deed made by one party only is not indented but polled or shaved quite even and therefore called a deedpoll or a single deed  eii we are in the next place to consider the requisites of a deed the first of which is that there be persons able to contract and be contracted with for the purposes intended by the deed and also a thing or subjectmatter to be contracted for all which must be expressed by sufficient namesf so as in every grant there must be a grantor a grantee and a thing granted in every lease a lessor a lessee and a thing demised secondly the deed must be founded upon good and sufficient consideration not upon an usurious contractg nor upon fraud or collusion either to deceive purchasers bona fideh or just and lawful creditorsi any of which bad considerations will vacate the deed and subject such persons as put the same in ure to forfeitures and often to imprisonment a deed also or other grant made without any consideration is as it were of no effect for it is construed to enure or to be effectual only to the use of the grantor himselfk  the consideration may be either      a good or a valuable one a good consideration is such as that of blood or of natural love and affection when a man grants an estate to a near relation being founded on motives of generosity prudence and natural duty a valuable consideration is such as money marriage or the like which the law esteems an equivalent given for the grantl and is therefore founded in motives of justice deeds made upon good consideration only are considered as merely voluntary and are frequently set aside in favour of creditors and bona fide purchasers      thirdly the deed must be written or i presume printed  for it may be in any character or any language but it must be upon paper or parchment for if it be written on stone board linen leather or the like it is no deedm wood or stone may be more durable and linen less liable to rasures but writing on paper or parchment unites in itself more perfectly than any other way both those desirable qualities for there is nothing else so durable and at the same time so little liable to alteration nothing so secure from alteration that is at the same time so durable it must also have the regular stamps imposed on it by the several statutes for the increase of the public revenue else it cannot be given in evidence formerly many conveyances were made by parol or word of mouth only without writing but this giving a handle to a variety of frauds the statute    car ii c   enacts that no lease estate or interest in lands tenements or hereditaments made by livery of seisin or by parol only except leases not exceeding three years from the making and whereon the reserved rent is at least twothirds of the real value shall be looked upon as of greater force than a lease or estate at will nor shall any assignment grant or surrender of any interest in any freehold hereditaments be valid unless in both cases the same be put in writing and signed by the party granting or his agent lawfully authorized in writing      fourthly the matter written must be legally or orderly set forth that is there must be words sufficient to specify the agreement and bind the parties which      sufficiency must be left to the courts of law to determinen  for it is not absolutely necessary in law to have all the formal parts that are usually drawn out in deeds so as there be sufficient words to declare clearly and legally the partys meaning but as these formal and orderly parts are calculated to convey that meaning in the clearest distinctest and most effectual manner and have been well considered and settled by the wisdom of successive ages it is prudent not to depart from them without good reason or urgent necessity  and therefore i will here mention them in their usualo order   the premises may be used to set forth the number and names of the parties with their additions or titles they also contain the recital if any of such deeds agreements or matters of fact as are necessary to explain the reasons upon which the present transaction is founded and herein also is set down the consideration upon which the deed is made and then follows the certainty of the grantor grantee and thing grantedp     next come the habendum and tenendumq the office of the habendum is properly to determine what estate or interest is granted by the deed though this may be performed and sometimes is performed in the premises in which case the habendum may lessen enlarge explain or qualify but not totally contradict or be repugnant to the estate granted in the premises as if a grant be to a and the heirs of his body in the premises habendum to him and his heirs forever or vice versa here a has an estatetail and a feesimple expectant thereonr but had it been in the premises to him and his heirs habendum to him for life the habendum would be utterly voids for an estate of inheritance is vested in him before the habendum comes and shall not afterwards be taken away or devested by it the tenendum and to hold is now of very little use and is only kept in by custom it was sometimes formerly      used to signify the tenure by which the estate granted was to be holden viz tenendum per servitium militare in burgagio in libero socagio c but all these being now reduced to free and common socage the tenure is never specified before the statute of quia emptores    edw i it was also sometimes used to denote the lord of whom the land should be holden but that     statute directing all future purchasers to hold not of the immediate grantor but of the chief lord of the fee this use of the tenendum hath been also antiquated though for a long time after we find it mentioned in ancient charters that the tenements shall be holden de capitalibus dominis feodit but as this expressed nothing more than the statute had already provided for it gradually grew out of use   next follow the terms of stipulation if any upon which the grant is made the first of which is the reddendum or reservation whereby the grantor doth create or reserve some new thing to himself out of what he had before granted as rendering therefore yearly the sum of ten shillings or a peppercorn or two days ploughing or the likeu under the pure feodal system this render reditus return or rent consisted in chivalry principally of military services in villeinage of the most slavish offices and in socage it usually consists of money though it may still consist of services or of any other certain profitw to make a reddendum good if it be of any thing newly created by the deed the reservation must be to the grantors or some or one of them and not to any stranger to the deedx but if it be of antient services or the like annexed to the land then the reservation may be to the lord of the feey   another of the terms upon which a grant may be made is a condition which is a clause of contingency on the happening of which the estate granted may be defeated as provided always that if the mortgagor shall pay the mortgagee   00  00l upon such a day the whole estate granted shall determine and the likez   next may follow the clause of warranty whereby the grantor doth for himself and his heirs warrant and secure to the grantee the estate so granteda by the feodal constitution if the vassals title to enjoy the feud was disputed he might vouch or call the lord or donor to warrant or insure his gift which if he failed to do and the vassal was evicted the lord was bound to give him another feud of equal value in recompenseb and so by our antient law if before the statute of quia emptores a man enfeoffed another in fee by the feodal verb dedi to hold of himself and his heirs by certain services the law annexed a warranty to this grant which bound the feoffor and his heirs to whom the services which were the consideration and equivalent for the gift were originally stipulated to be renderedc or if a man and his ancestors had immemorially holden land of another and his ancestors by the service of homage which was called homage auncestral this also bound the lord to warrantyd the homage being an evidence of such a feodal grant and upon a similar principle in case after a partition or exchange of lands of inheritance either party or his heirs be evicted of his share the other and his heirs are bound to warrantye because they enjoy the equivalent and so even at this day upon a gift in tail or lease for life rendering rent the donor or lessor and his heirs to whom the rent is payable are bound to warrant the titlef but in a feoffment in fee by the verb dedi since the statute of quia emptores the feoffor only is bound in the implied warranty and not his heirsg because it is a mere personal contract on the part of the feoffor the tenure and of course the antient services resulting back to the superior lord of the fee and in other forms of alienation gradually introduced since that statute   0  no warranty whatsoever is impliedh they bearing no sort of analogy to the original feodal donation and therefore in such cases it became necessary to add an express clause of warranty to bind the grantor and his heirs which is a kind of covenant real and can only be created by the verb warrantizo or warranti these express warranties were introduced even prior to the statute of quia emptores in order to evade the strictness of the feodal doctrine of nonalienation  0  without the consent of the heir for though he at the death of his ancestor might have entered on any tenements that were aliened without his concurrence yet if a cause of warranty was added to the ancestors grant this covenant descending upon the heir insured the grantee not so much by confirming his title as by obliging such heir to yield him a recompense in lands of equal value the law in favour of alienations supposing that no ancestor would wantonly disinherit his next of bloodk and therefore presuming that he had received a valuable consideration either in land or in money which had purchased land and that this equivalent descended to the heir together with the ancestors warranty so that when either an ancestor being the rightful tenant of the freehold conveyed the land to a stranger and his heirs or released the right in feesimple to one who was already in possession and superadded a warranty to his deed it was held that such warranty not only bound the warrantor himself to protect and assure the title of the warrantee but it also bound his heir and this whether that warranty was lineal or collateral to the title of the land lineal warranty was where the heir derived or might by possibility have derived his title to the land warranted either from or through the ancestor who made the warranty as where a father or an elder son in the life of the father released to the disseisor of either themselves or the grandfather with warranty this was lineal to the younger sonl collateral warranty was where the heirs title to the land neither was nor could have been derived from the   0  warranting ancestor as where a younger brother released to his fathers disseisor with warranty this was collateral to the elder brotherm but where the very conveyance to which the warranty was annexed immediately followed a disseisin or operated itself as such as where a father tenant for years with remainder to his son in fee aliened in feesimple with warranty this being in its original manifestly founded on the tort or wrong of the warrantor himself was called a warranty commencing by disseisin and being too palpably injurious to be supported was not binding upon any heir of such tortious warrantorn in both lineal and collateral warranty the obligation of the heir in case the warrantee was evicted to yield him other lands in their stead was only on condition that he had other sufficient lands by descent from the warranting ancestoro but though without assets he was not bound to insure the title of another yet in case of lineal warranty whether assets descended or not the heir was perpetually barred from claiming the land himself for if he could succeed in such claim he would then gain assets by descent if he had them not before and must fulfil the warranty of his ancestor and the same rulep was with less justice adopted also in respect of collateral warranties which likewise though no assets descended barred the heir of the warrantor from claiming the land by any collateral title upon the presumption of law that he might hereafter have assets by descent either from or through the same ancestor the inconvenience of this latter branch of the rule was felt very early when tenants by the curtesy took upon them to aliene their lands with warranty which collateral warranty of the father descending upon the son who was the heir of both his parents barred him from claiming his maternal inheritance to remedy which the statute of gloucester   edw i c   declared that such warranty should be no bar to the son unless assets descended from the father it was afterwards attempted in  0 edw iii   0  to make the same provision universal by enacting that no collateral warranty should be a bar unless where assets descended from the same ancestorq but it then proceeded not to effect however by the statute    hen vii c  0 notwithstanding any alienation with warranty by tenant in dower the heir of the husband is not barred though he also be heir to the wife and by statute      anne c    all warranties by any tenant for life shall be void against those in remainder or reversion and all collateral warranties by any ancestor who  0  has no estate of inheritance in possession shall be void against his heir by the wording of which last statute it should seem that the legislature meant to allow that the collateral warranty of tenant in tail in possession descending though without assets upon a remainderman or reversioner should still bar the remainder or reversion for though the judges in expounding the statute de donis held that by analogy to the statute of gloucester a lineal warranty by the tenant in tail without assets should not bar the issue in tail yet they held such warranty with assets to be a sufficient barr which was therefore formerly mentioneds as one of the ways whereby an estatetail might be destroyed it being indeed nothing more in effect than exchanging the land entailed for others of equal value they also held that collateral warranty was not within the statute de donis as that act was principally intended to prevent the tenant in tail from disinheriting his own issue and therefore collateral warranty though without assets was allowed to be as at common law a sufficient bar of the estatetail and all remainders and reversions expectant thereont and so it still continues to be notwithstanding the statute of queen anne if made by tenant in tail in possession who therefore may now without the forms of a fine or recovery in some cases make a good conveyance in feesimple by superadding a warranty to his grant which if accompanied with assets bars his own issue and without them bars such of his heirs as may be in remainder or reversion    0    after warranty usually follow covenants  or conventions which are clauses of agreement contained in a deed whereby either party may stipulate for the truth of certain facts or may bind himself to perform or give something to the other thus the grantor may covenant that he hath a right to convey or for the grantees quiet enjoyment or the like the grantee may covenant to pay his rent or keep the premises in repair cu if the covenantor covenants for himself and his heirs it is then a covenant real and descends upon the heirs who are bound to perform it provided they have  0  assets by descent but not otherwise if he covenants also for his executors and administrators his personal assets as well as his real are likewise pledged for the performance of the covenant which makes such covenant a better security than any warranty 0 it is also in some respects a less security and therefore more beneficial to the grantor who usually covenants only for the acts of himself and his ancestors whereas a general warranty extends to all mankind for which reasons the covenant has in modern practice totally superseded the other   lastly comes the conclusion which mentions the execution and date of deed or the time of its being given or executed either expressly or by reference to some day and year before mentionedw not but a deed is good although it mention no date or hath a false date or even if it hath an impossible date as the thirtieth of february provided the real day of its being dated or given that is delivered can be provedx   i proceed now to the fifth requisite for making a good deed the reading of it this is necessary wherever any of the parties desire it and if it be not done on his request the deed is void as to him if he can he should read it himself if he be blind or illiterate another must read it to him if it be read falsely it will be void at least for so much as is misrecited unless it be agreed by collusion that the deed shall be read false on purpose to make it void for in such case it shall bind the fraudulent partyy   0  sixthly it is requisite that the party whose deed it is should seal   and now in most cases i apprehend should sign it also   the use of seals as a mark of authenticity to letters and other instruments in writing is extremely antient we read of it among the jews and persians in the earliest  0  and most sacred records of historyz and in the book of jeremiah there is a very remarkable instance not only of an attestation by seal but also of the other usual formalities attending a jewish purchasea in the civil law alsob seals were the evidence of truth and were required on the part of the witnesses at least at the attestation of every testament but in the times of our saxon ancestors they were not much in use in england for though sir edward cokec relies on an instance of king edwins making use of a seal about a hundred years before the conquest yet it does not follow that this was the usage among the whole nation and perhaps the charter he mentions may be of doubtful authority from this very circumstance of being sealed since we are assured by all our ancient historians that sealing was not then in common use the method of the saxons was for such as could write to subscribe their names and whether they could write or not to affix the sign of the cross which custom our illiterate vulgar do for the most part to this day keep up by signing a cross for their mark when unable to write their names and indeed this inability to write and therefore making a cross in its stead is honestly avowed by caedwalla a saxon king at the end of one of his chartersd in like manner and for the same insurmountable reason the normans a brave but   0  illiterate nation at their first settlement in france used the practice of sealing only without writing their names which custom continued when learning made its way among them though the reason for doing it had ceased and hence the charter of edward the confessor to westminster abbey himself being brought up in normandy was witnessed only by his seal and is generally thought to be the oldest sealed charter of any authenticity in englande at the conquest the norman lords brought over into this kingdom their own fashions and introduced waxen seals only instead of the english method of writing their names and signing with the sign of the crossf and in the reign of edward i every freeman and even such of the more substantial villeins as were fit to be put upon juries had their distinct particular sealsg the impressions of these seals were sometimes a knight on horseback sometimes other devices but coats of arms were not introduced into seals nor indeed into any other use till about the reign of richard the first who brought them from the croisade in the holy land where they were first invented and painted on the shields of the knights to distinguish the variety of persons of every christian nation who resorted thither and who could not when clad in complete steel be otherwise known or ascertained   this neglect of signing and resting only upon the authenticity of seals remained very long among us for it was held in all our books that sealing alone was sufficient to authenticate a deed and so the common form of attesting deeds  0  sealed and delivered continues to this day notwithstanding the statute    car ii c   before mentioned revives the saxon custom and expressly directs the signing in all grants of lands and many other species of deeds in which therefore signing seems to be now as necessary as sealing though it hath been sometimes held that the one includes the otherh   a seventh requisite to a good deed is that it be delivered   by the party himself or his certain attorney which therefore is   0  also expressed in the attestation sealed and delivered   a deed takes effect only from this tradition or delivery for if the date be false or impossible the delivery ascertains the time of it   and if another person seals the deed yet if the party delivers it himself he thereby adopts the sealingi and by a parity of reason the signing also and makes them both his own a delivery may be either absolute that is to the party or grantee himself or to a third person to hold till some conditions be performed on the part of the grantee in which last case it is not delivered as a deed but as an escrow that is as a scrowl or writing which is not to take effect as a deed till the conditions be performed and then it is a deed to all intents and purposesj    0  the last requisite to the validity of a deed is the attestation or execution of it in the presence of witnesses 0 though this is necessary rather for preserving the evidence than for constituting the essence of the deed our modern deeds are in reality nothing more than an improvement or amplification of the brevia testata mentioned by the feodal writersk which were written memorandums introduced to perpetuate the tenor of the conveyance and investiture when grants by parol only became the foundation of frequent dispute and uncertainty to this end they registered in the deed the persons who attended as witnesses which was formerly done without their signing their names that not being always in their power but they only heard the deed read and then the clerk or scribe added their names in a sort of memorandum thus—hijs testibus johanne moore jacobo smith et aliis ad hanc rem convocatisl this like all other solemn transactions was originally done only coram paribusm and frequently when assembled in the courtbaron hundred or countycourt which was then expressed in the attestation teste comitatu hundredo cn afterwards the attestation of other witnesses was allowed the trial in   0  case of a dispute being still reserved to the pares with whom the witnesses if more than one were associated and joined in the verdicto till that also was abrogated by the statute of york    edw ii st   c   and in this manner with some such clause of hijs testibus are all old deeds and charters particularly magna carta witnessed and in the time of sir edward coke creations of nobility were still witnessed in the same mannerp but in the kings common charters writs or letterspatent the style is now altered for at present the  0  king is his own witness and attests his letterspatent thus teste meipso witness ourself at westminster c a form which was introduced by richard the firstq but not commonly used till about the beginning of the fifteenth century nor the clause of hijs testibus entirely discontinued till the reign of henry the eighthr which was also the era of discontinuing it in the deeds of subjects learning being then revived and the faculty of writing more general and therefore ever since that time the witnesses have usually subscribed their attestations either at the bottom or on the back of the deeds iii we are next to consider how a deed may be avoided or rendered of no effect and from what has been before laid down it will follow that if a deed wants any of the essential requisites before mentioned either   proper parties and a proper subjectmatter   a good and sufficient consideration   writing on paper or parchment duly stamped   sufficient and legal words properly disposed   reading if desired before the execution   sealing and by the statute in most cases signing also or   delivery it is a void deed ab initio it may also be avoided by matter ex post facto as   by rasure interlining or other alteration in any material part unless a memorandum be made thereof at the time of the execution and attestationt     by breaking off or defacing the sealu     by delivering it up to be cancelled   0  that is to have lines drawn over it in the form of latticework or cancelli though the  0  phrase is now used figuratively for any manner of abliteration or defacing it     by the disagreement of such whose concurrence is necessary in order for the deed to stand as the husband where a femecovert is concerned an intant or person under duress when those disabilities are removed and the like   by the judgment or decree of a court of judicature this was anciently the province of the court of starchamber and now of the chancery   when it appears that the deed was obtained by fraud force or other foul practice or is proved to be an absolute forgeryw in any of these cases the deed may be avoided either in part or totally according as the cause of avoidance is more or less extensive and having thus explained the general nature of deeds we are next to consider their several species together with their respective incidents and herein i shall only examine the particulars of those which from long practice and experience of their efficacy are generally used in the alienation of real estates for it would be tedious nay infinite to descant upon all the several instruments made use of in personal concerns but which fall under our general definition of a deed that is a writing sealed and delivered the former being principally such as serve to convey the property of lands and tenements from man to man are commonly denominated conveyances which are either conveyances at common law or such as receive their force and efficacy by virtue of the statute of uses i of conveyances by the common law some may be called original or primary conveyances which are those by means whereof the benefit or estate is created or first arises other are derivative or secondary whereby the benefit or estate originally created is enlarged restrained transferred or extinguished    0 original conveyances are the following   feoffment   gift   grant   lease   exchange   partition derivative are   release   confirmation   surrender  0 assignment    defeazance   a feoffment feoffamentum is a substantive derived from the verb to enfeoff feoffare or infeudare to give one a feud and therefore feoffment is properly donatio feudix it is the most antient method of conveyance the most solemn and public and therefore the most easily remembered and proved and it may properly be defined the gift of any corporeal hereditament to another he that so gives or enfeoffs is called the feoffor and the person enfeoffed is denominated the feoffee this is plainly derived from or is indeed itself the very mode of the antient feodal donation for though it may be performed by the word enfeoff or grant yet the aptest word of feoffment is do or dediy and it is still directed and governed by the same feodal rules insomuch that the principal rule relating to the extent and effect of the feodal grant tenor est qui legem dat feudo is in   0 other words become the maxim of our law with relation to feoffments modus legem dat donationiz and therefore as in pure feodal donations the lord from whom the feud moved must expressly limit and declare the continuance or quantity of estate which he meant to confer ne quis plus donasse præsumatur quam in donatione expresserita so if one grants by feoffment lands or tenements to another and limits or expresses no estate the grantee due ceremonies of law being performed hath barely an estate for lifeb for as the personal abilities of the feoffee were originally presumed to be the immediate or principal inducements to the feoffment the feoffees estate ought to be confined to his person and subsist only for his life unless the feoffor by express provision in the creation      and constitution of the estate hath given it a longer continuance these express provisions are indeed generally made for this was for ages the only conveyance whereby our ancestors were wont to create an estate in feesimplec by giving the land to the feoffee to hold to him and his heirs forever though it serves equally well to convey any other estate or freeholdd but by the more words of the deed the feoffment is by no means perfected there remains a very material ceremony to be performed called livery of seisin without which the feoffee has but a mere estate at wille this livery of seisin is no other than the pure feodal investiture or delivery of corporal possession of the land or tenement which was held absolutely necessary to complete the donation nam feudum sine investitura nullo modo constitui potuitf and an estate was then only perfect when as the author of fleta expresses it in our law fit juris et seisinæ conjunctiog   investitures in their original rise were probably intended to demonstrate in conquered countries the actual possession of the lord and that he did not grant a bare litigious right which the soldier was ill qualified to prosecute but a peaceable and firm possession and at a time when writing was seldom practised a mere oral gift at a distance from the spot that was given was not likely to be either long or accurately retained in the memory of bystanders who were very little interested in the grant afterwards they were retained as a public and notorious act that the country might take notice of and testify the transfer of the estate and that such as claimed title by other means might know against whom to bring their actions in all wellgoverned nations some notoriety of this kind has been ever held requisite in order to acquire and ascertain      the property of lands in the roman law plenum dominium was not said to subsist unless where a man had both the right and the corporal possession which possession could not be acquired without both an actual intention to possess and an actual seisin or entry into the premises or part of them in the name of the wholeh and even in ecclesiastical promotions where the freehold passes to the person promoted corporal possession is required at this day to vest the property completely     in the new proprietor who according to the distinction of the canonistsi acquires the jus ad rem or inchoate and imperfect right by nomination and institution but not the jus in re or complete and full right unless by corporal possession therefore in dignities possession is given by instalment in rectories and vicarages by induction without which no temporal rights accrue to the minister though every ecclesiastical power is vested in him by institution so also even in descents of lands by our law which are cast on the heir by act of the law itself the heir has not plenum dominium or full and complete ownership till he has made an actual corporal entry into the lands for if he dies before entry made his heir shall not be entitled to take the possession but the heir of the person who was last actually seisedk it is not therefore only a mere right to enter but the actual entry that makes a man complete owner so as to transmit the inheritance to his own heirs non jus sed seisina facit stipiteml yet the corporal tradition of lands being sometimes inconvenient a symbolical delivery of possession was in many cases antiently allowed by transferring something near at hand in the presence of credible witnesses which by agreement should serve to represent the very thing designed to be conveyed and an occupancy of this sign or symbol was per     mitted as equivalent to occupancy of the land itself among the jews we find the evidence of a purchase thus defined in the book of ruthm now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a testimony in israel among the ancient goths and swedes contracts for the sale of lands were made in the presence of witnesses who extended the cloak of the buyer while the seller cast a clod of the land into it in order to give possession and a staff or wand was also delivered from the vendor to the vendee which passed through the hands of the witnessesn with our saxon ancestors the delivery of a turf was a necessary solemnity to establish the conveyance of landso and to this day the conveyance of our copyhold estates is usually made from the seller to the lord or his steward by delivery of a rod or verge and then from the lord to the purchaser by redelivery of the same in the presence of a jury of tenants conveyances in writing were the last and most refined improvement the mere delivery of possession either actual or symbolical depending on the ocular testimony and remembrance of the witnesses was liable to be forgotten or misrepresented and became frequently incapable of proof besides the new occasions and necessities introduced by the advancement of commerce required means to be devised of charging and encumbering estates and of making them liable to a multitude of conditions and minute designations for the purposes of raising money without an absolute sale of the land and sometimes the like proceedings were found useful in order to make a decent and competent provision for the numerous branches of a family and for other domestic views none of which could be effected by a mere simple corporal transfer of the soil from one man to another which was principally calculated for conveying an absolute unlimited dominion      written deeds were therefore introduced in order to specify and perpetuate the peculiar purposes of the party who conveyed yet still for a very long series of years they were never made use of but in company with the more antient and notorious method of transfer by delivery of corporal possession livery of seisin by the common law is necessary to be made upon every grant of an estate of freehold in hereditaments corporeal whether of inheritance or for life only in hereditaments incorporeal it is impossible to be made for they are not the object of the senses and in leases for years or other chattel interests it is not necessary in leases for years indeed an actual entry is necessary to vest the estate in the lessee for the bare lease gives him only a right to enter which is called his interest in the term or interesse termini and     when he enters in pursuance of that right he is then and not before in possession of his term and complete tenant for yearsp this entry by the tenant himself serves the purpose of notoriety as well as livery of seisin from the grantor could have done which it would have been improper to have given in this case because that solemnity is appropriated to the conveyance of a freehold and this is one reason why freeholds cannot be made to commence in futuro because they cannot at the common law be made but by livery of seisin which livery being an actual manual tradition of the land must take effect in præsenti or not at allq   on the creation of a freehold remainder at one and the same time with a particular estate for years we have before seen that at the common law livery must be made to the particular tenantr but if such a remainder be created afterwards expectant on a lease for years now in being the livery must not be made to the lessee for years for then it operates nothing nam quod semei meum est amplius meum esse non potests but it must be made to the remainderman      himself by consent of the lessee for years for without his consent no livery of the possession can be givent partly because such forcible livery would be an ejectment of the tenant from his term and partly for the reasons before givenu for introducing the doctrine of attornments livery of seisin is either in deed or in law livery in deed is thus performed the feoffor lessor or his attorney together with the feoffee lessee or his attorney for this may as effectually be done by deputy or attorney as by the principals themselves in person   come to the land or to the house and there in the presence of witnesses declare the contents of the feoffment or lease on which livery is to be made and then the feoffor if it be of land doth deliver to the feoffee all other persons being out of the ground a clod or turf or a twig or bough there growing with words to this effect i deliver these to you in the name of seisin of all the lands and tenements contained in this deed but if it be of a house the feoffor must take the ring or latch of the door the house being quite empty and deliver it to the feoffee in the same form and then the feoffee must enter alone and shut to the door and then open it and let in the othersw if the conveyance or feoffment be of divers lands lying scattered in one and the same county then in the feoffors possession livery of seisin of any parcel in the name of the rest sufficeth for allx but if they be in several counties there must be as many liveries as there are counties for if the title to these lands comes to be disputed there must be as many trials as there are counties and the jury of one county are no judges of the notoriety of a fact in another besides antiently this seisin was obliged to be delivered coram paribus de vicineto before the peers or freeholders of the neighbourhood who attested such delivery in the body or on the back of the deed according to the rule of the feodal lawy pares debent interesse investituræ feudi et non alii for which this reason is expressly given because      the peers or vassals of the lord being bound by their oath of fealty will take care that no fraud be committed to his prejudice which strangers might be apt to connive at and though afterwards the ocular attestation of the pares was held unnecessary and livery might be made before any credible witnesses yet the trial in case it was disputed like that of all other attestationsz was still reserved to the pares     or jury of the countya also if the lands be out on lease though all lie in the same county there must be as many liveries as there are tenants because no livery can be made in this case but by the consent of the particular tenant and the consent of one will not bind the restb and in all these cases it is prudent and usual to endorse the livery of seisin on the back of the deed specifying the manner place and time of making it together with the names of the witnessesc and thus much for livery in deed livery in law is where the same is not made on the land but in sight of it only the feoffor saying to the feoffee i give you yonder land enter and take possession here if the feoffee enters during the life of the feoffor it is a good livery but not otherwise unless he dares not enter through fear of his life or bodily harm and then his continual claim made yearly in due form of law as near as possible to the landsd will suffice without an entrye this livery in law cannot however be given or received by attorney but only by the parties themselvesf     the conveyance by gift donatio is properly applied to the creation of an estatetail as feoffment is to that of an estate in fee and lease to that of an estate for life or years it differs in nothing from a feoffment but in the nature of an estate passing by it for the operative words of conveyance in this case are do or dedig and gifts in tail are equally imperfect without livery or seisin as feoffments in feesimpleh      and this is the only distinction that littleton seems to take when he saysi it is to be understood that there is feoffor and feoffee donor and donee lessor and lessee viz feoffor is applied to a feoffment in feesimple donor to a gift in tail and lessor to a lease for life or for years or at will in common acceptation gifts are frequently confounded with the next species of deeds which are   grants concessiones the regular method by the common law of transferring the property of incorporeal hereditaments or such things whereof no livery can be hadk for which reason all corporeal hereditaments as lands and houses are said to lie in livery and the others as advowsons commons rents reversions c to lie in grantl and the reason is given by bractonm traditio or livery nihil aliud est quam rei corporalis de persona in personam de manu in manum translatio aut in possessionem inductio sed res incorporales quæ sunt ipsum jus rei vel corpori inhærens traditionem non patiuntur these therefore pass merely by the delivery of the deed and in signiories or reversions of lands such grant together with the attornment of the tenant while attornments were requisite were held to be of equal notoriety with and therefore equivalent to a feoffment and livery of lands in immediate possession it therefore differs but little from a feoffment except in its subjectmatter for the operative words therein commonly used are dedi et concessi have given and granted         a lease is properly a conveyance of any lands or tenements usually in consideration of rent or other annual recompense made for life for years or at will but always for a less time than the lessor hath in the premises for if it be for the whole interest it is more properly an assignment than a lease the usual words of operation in it are demise grant and to farm let demisi concessi et ad firmam      tradidi farm or feorme is an old saxon word signifying provisionn and it came to be used instead of rent or render because antiently the greater part of rents were reserved in provisions in corn in poultry and the like till the use of money became more frequent so that a farmer firmarius was one who held his lands upon payment of a rent or feorme though at present by a gradual departure from the original sense the word farm is brought to signify the very estate or lands so held upon farm or rent by this conveyance an estate for life for years or at will may be created either in corporeal or incorporeal hereditaments though livery of seisin is indeed incident and necessary to one species of leases viz leases for life of corporeal hereditaments but to no other whatever restriction by the severity of the feodal law might in times of very high antiquity be observed with regard to leases yet by the common law as it has stood for many centuries all persons seised of any estate might let leases to endure so long as their own interest lasted but no longer therefore tenant in feesimple might let leases of any duration for he hath the whole interest but tenant in tail or tenant for life could make no leases which should bind the issue in tail or reversioner nor could a husband seised jure uxoris make a firm or valid lease for any longer term than the joint lives of himself and his wife for then his interest expired yet some tenants for life where the feesimple was in abeyance might with the concurrence of such as have the guardianship of the fee make leases of equal duration with those granted by tenants in feesimple such as parsons and vicars with consent of the patron and ordinaryo so also bishops and deans and such other sole ecclesiastical corporations as are seised of the feesimple of lands in their corporate right might with the concurrence and confirmation of such persons as the law requires have made leases for years or for life estates in tail or in fee without any limitation or control and corporations aggregate      might have made what estates they pleased without the confirmation of any other person whatsoever whereas now by several statutes this power where it was unreasonable and might be made an ill use of is restrained and where in the other cases the restraint by the common law seemed too hard it is in some measure removed the former statutes are called the restraining the latter the enabling statute we will take a view of them all in order of time and first the enabling statute    hen viii c    empowers three manner of persons to make leases to endure for three lives or oneandtwenty years which could not do so before as first tenant in tail may by such leases bind his issue in tail but not those in remainder or reversion secondly a husband seised in right of his wife in feesimple or feetail provided the wife joins in such lease may bind her and her heirs thereby lastly all persons seised of an estate of feesimple in right of their churches which extends not to parsons and vicars may without the concurrence of any other person bind their successors but then there must many requisites be observed which the statute specifies otherwise     such leases are not bindingp   the lease must be by indenture and not by deedpoll or by parol   it must begin from the making or day of the making and not at any greater distance of time 0   if there be any old lease in being it must be first absolutely surrendered or be within a year of expiring   it must be either for twentyone years or three lives and not for both   it must not exceed the term of three lives or twentyone years but may be for a shorter term   it must be of corporeal hereditaments and not of such things as lie merely in grant for no rent can be reserved thereout by the common law as the lessor cannot resort to them to distreinq   it must be of    0 lands and tenements most commonly letten for twenty years past so that if they had been let for above half the time or eleven years out of the twenty either for life or for years at will or by copy of courtroll it is sufficient   the most usual and customary feorm or rent for twenty years past must be reserved yearly on such lease   such leases must not be made without impeachment of waste these are the guards imposed by the statute which was avowedly made for the security of farmers and the consequent improvement of tillage to prevent unreasonable abuses in prejudice of the issue the wife or the successor of the reasonable indulgence here given next follows in order of time the disabling or restraining statute   eliz c    made entirely for the benefit of the successor which enacts that all grants by archbishops and bishops which include even those confirmed by the dean and chapter the which however long or unreasonable were good at common law other than for the term of oneandtwenty years or three lives from the making or without reserving the usual rent shall be void concurrent leases if confirmed by the dean and chapter are held to be within the exception of this statute and therefore valid provided they do not exceed together with the lease in being the term permitted by the actr   but by   0 a saving expressly made this statute of   eliz did not extend to grants made by any bishop to the crown by which means queen elizabeth procured many fair possessions to be made over to her by the prelates either for her own use or with intent to be granted out again to her favourites whom she thus gratified without any expense to herself to prevent whichs for the future the statute   jac i c   extends the prohibition to grants and leases made to the king as well as to any of his subjects next comes the statute    eliz c  0 explained and enforced by the statutes    eliz c           eliz c    and    eliz c    which extend the restrictions laid by      the lastmentioned statute on bishops to certain other inferior corporations both sole and aggregate from laying all which together we may collect that all colleges cathedrals and other ecclesiastical or eleemosynary corporations and all parsons and vicars are restrained from making any leases of their lands unless under the following regulations   they must not exceed twentyone years or three lives from the making   the accustomed rent or more must be yearly reserved thereon   houses in corporations or markettowns may be let for forty years provided they be not the mansionhouses of the lessors nor have above ten acres of ground belonging to them and provided the lessee be bound to keep them in repair and they may also be aliened in feesimple for lands of equal value in recompense   where there is an old lease in being no concurrent lease shall be made unless where the old one will expire within three years   no lease by the equity of the statute shall be made without impeachment of wastet   all bonds and covenants tending to frustrate the provisions of the statutes of        eliz shall be void concerning these restrictive statutes there are two observations to be made first that they do not by any construction enable any persons to make such leases as they were by common law disabled to make therefore a parson or vicar though he is restrained from making longer leases than for twentyone years or three lives even with the consent of patron and ordinary yet is not enabled to make any lease at all so as to bind his successor without obtaining such consentu   secondly that though leases contrary to these acts are declared void yet they are good against the lessor during his life if he be a sole corporation and are also good against an aggregate corporation so long as the head of it lives who is presumed to be the most concerned in interest for the act was intended for the benefit of the successor only and no man shall make an advantage of his own wrongw      there is yet another restriction with regard to college leases by statute    eliz c   which directs that onethird of the old rent then paid should for the future be reserved in wheat or malt reserving a quarter of wheat for each  s  d or a quarter of malt for every  s or that the lessees should pay for the same according to the price that wheat and malt should be sold for in the market next adjoining to the respective colleges on the market day before the rent becomes due this is saidx to have been an invention of lord treasurer burleigh and sir thomas smith then principal secretary of state who observing how greatly the value of money had sunk and the price of all provisions risen by the quantity of bullion imported from the newfound indies which effects were likely to increase to a greater degree devised this method for upholding the revenues of colleges their foresight and penetration have in this respect been very apparent for though the rent so reserved in corn was at first but onethird of the old rent or half what was still reserved     in money yet now the proportion is nearly inverted and the money arising from cornrents is communibus annis almost double to the rents reserved in money   the leases of beneficed clergymen are further restrained in case of their nonresidence by statutes    eliz c  0    eliz c       eliz c    and    eliz c     which direct that if any beneficed clergyman be absent from his cure above fourscore days in any one year he shall not only forfeit one years profit of his benefice to be distributed among the poor of the parish but that all leases made by him of the profits of such benefice and all covenants and agreements of like nature shall cease and be void   except in the case of licensed pluralists who are allowed to demise the living on which they are nonresident to their curates only provided such curates do not absent themselves above      forty days in any one year and thus much for leases with their several enlargements and restrictionsy   an exchange is a mutual grant of equal interests the one in consideration of the other the word exchange is so individually requisite and appropriated by law to this case that it cannot be supplied by any other word or expressed by any circumlocutionz the estates exchanged must be equal in quantitya not of value for that is immaterial but of interest as feesimple for feesimple a lease for twenty years for a lease for twenty years and the like and the exchange may be of things that lie either in grant or in liveryb but no livery of seisin even in exchanges of freehold is necessary to perfect the conveyancec for each party stands in the place of the other and occupies his right and each of them hath already had corporal possession of his own land but entry must be made on both sides for if either party die before entry the exchange is void for want of sufficient notorietyd   and so also if two parsons by consent of patron and ordinary exchange their preferments and the one is presented instituted and inducted and the other is presented and instituted but dies before induction the former shall not keep his new benefice because the exchange was not completed and therefore he shall return back to his owne for if after an exchange of lands or other hereditaments either party be evicted of those which were taken by him in exchange through defect of the others title he shall return back to the possession of his own by virtue of the implied warranty contained in all exchangesf         a partition is when two or more jointtenants coparceners or tenants in common agree to divide the      lands so held among them in severalty each taking a distinct part here as in some instances there is a unity of interest and in all a unity of possession it is necessary that they all mutually convey and assure to each other the several estates which they are to take and enjoy separately by the common law coparceners being compellable to make partition might have made it by parol only but jointtenants and tenants in common must have done it by deed and in both cases the conveyance must have been perfected by livery of seising and the statutes of    hen viii c   and    hen viii c    made no alteration in this point but the statute of frauds    car ii c   hath now abolished this distinction and made a deed in all cases necessary   these are the several species of primary or original conveyances those which remain are of the secondary or derivative sort which presuppose some other conveyance precedent and only serve to enlarge confirm alter restrain restore or transfer the interest granted by such original conveyance as   releases which are a discharge or a conveyance of a mans right in lands or tenements to another that hath some former estate in possession   the words generally used therein are remised released and forever quitclaimedh and these releases may enure either   by way of enlarging an estate or enlarger lestate 0 as if there be tenant for life or years remainder to another in fee and he in remainder releases all his right to the particular tenant and his heirs this gives him the estate in feei but in this case the relessee must be in possession   of some estate for the release to work upon for if there be lessee for     years and before he enters and is in possession the lessor releases to him all his right in the reversion such release is void for want of possession in the relesseek     by way of passing an estate or mitter lestate as when one of two coparceners releaseth all her      right to the other this passeth the feesimple of the wholel   and in both these cases there must be a privity of estate between the relessor and relesseem that is one of their estates must be so related to the other as to make but one and the same estate in law   by way of passing a right   or mitter le droit as if a man be disseised and releaseth to his disseisor all his right hereby the disseisor acquires a new right which changes the quality of his estate and renders that lawful which before was tortious or wrongfuln     by way of extinguishment as if my tenant for life makes a lease to a for life remainder to b and his heirs and i release to a this extinguishes my right to the reversion and shall enure to the advantage of bs remainder as well as of as particular estateo     by way     of entry and feoffment as if there be two joint disseisors and the disseisee releases to one of them he shall be sole seised and shall keep out his former companion which is the same in effect as if the disseisee had entered and thereby put an end to the disseisin and afterwards had enfeoffed one of the disseisors in feep and hereupon we may observe that when a man has in himself the possession of lands he must at the common law convey the freehold by feoffment and livery which makes a notoriety in the country but if a man has only a right or a future interest he may convey that right or interest by a mere release to him that is in possession of the land for the occupancy of the relessee is a matter of sufficient notoriety already     a confirmation is of a nature nearly allied to a release sir edward coke defines itq to be a conveyance of an estate or right in esse whereby a voidable   estate is made sure and unavoidable or whereby a particular estate is increased and the words of making it are these have given granted ratified approved and confirmedr an instance of the first branch of the definition is if tenant for life leaseth for forty years and dieth during that term here the lease for years is voidable by him in reversion yet if he      hath confirmed the estate of the lessee for years before the death of tenant for life it is no longer voidable but sures the latter branch or that which tends to the increase of a particular estate is the same in all respects with that species of release which operates by way of enlargement       a surrender sursumredditio   or rendering up is of a nature directly opposite to a release for as that operates by the greater estates descending upon the less a surrender is the falling of a less estate into a greater it is definedt a yielding up of an estate for life or years to him that hath the immediate reversion or remainder wherein the particular estate may merge or drown by mutual agreement between them it is done by these words hath surrendered granted and yielded up 0 the surrenderor must be in possessionu and the surrenderee must have a higher estate in which the estate surrendered may merge therefore tenant for life cannot surrender to him in remainder for yearsw in a surrender there is no occasion for livery of seisinx for there is a privity of estate between the surrenderor and the surrenderee the ones particular estate and the others remainder are one and the same estate and livery having been once made at the creation of it there is no necessity for having it afterwards and for the same reason no livery is required on a release or confirmation in fee to tenant for years or at will though a freehold thereby passes since the reversion of the lessor or confirmor and the particular estate of the relessee or confirmee are one and the same estate and where there is already a possession derived from such a privity of estate any further delivery of possession would be vain and nugatoryy    0 an assignment is properly a transfer or making over to another of the right one has in any estate but it is usually applied to an estate for life or years and it differs from a lease only in this that by a lease one grants an interest less      than his own reserving to himself a reversion in assignments he parts with the whole property and the assignee stands to all intents and purposes in the place of the assignor          a defeazance is a collateral deed made at the same time with a feoffment or other conveyance containing certain conditions upon the performance of which the estate then created may be defeatedz or totally undone and in this manner mortgages were in former times usually made the mortgagor enfeoffing the mortgagee and he at the same time executing a deed of defeazance whereby the feoffment was rendered void on repayment of the money borrowed at a certain day and this when executed at the same time with the original feoffment was considered as part of it by the ancient lawa and therefore only indulged no subsequent secret revocation of a solemn conveyance executed by livery of seisin being allowed in those days of simplicity and truth though when uses were afterwards introduced a revocation of such uses was permitted by the courts of equity but things that were merely executory or to be completed by matter subsequent as rents of which no seisin could be had till the time of payment and so also annuities conditions warranties and the like were always liable to be recalled by defeazances made subsequent to the time of their creationb   ii there yet remain to be spoken of some few conveyances which have their force and operation by virtue of the statute of uses uses and trusts are in their original of a nature very similar or rather exactly     the same answering more to the fideicommissum than the usus fructus of the civil law which latter was the temporary right of using a thing without having the ultimate property or full dominion of the substancec but the fideicommissum which usually was created by will was the disposal of an inheritance to one in confidence that he      should convey it or dispose of the profits at the will of another and it was the business of a particular magistrate the prætor fidei commissarius instituted by augustus to enforce the observance of this confidenced so that the right thereby given was looked upon as a vested right and entitled to a remedy from a court of justice which occasioned that known division of rights by the roman law into jus legitimum a legal right which was remedied by the ordinary course of law jus fiduciarium a right in trust for which there was a remedy in conscience and jus precarium a right in courtesy for which the remedy was only by entreaty or requeste in our law a use might be ranked under the rights of the second kind being a confidence reposed in another who was tenant of the land or terretenant that he should dispose of the land according to the intentions of cestuy que use or him to whose use it was granted and suffer him to take the profitsf as if a feoffment was made to a and his heirs to the use of or in trust for b and his heirs here at the common law a the terretenant had the legal property and possession of the land but b the cestuy que use was in conscience and equity to have the profits and disposal of it this notion was transplanted into england from the civil law about the close of the reign of edward iiig by means of the foreign ecclesiastics who introduced it to evade the statutes of mortmain by obtaining grants of lands not to religious houses directly but to the use of the religious housesh which the clerical chancellors of those times held to be fideicommissa and binding in conscience and therefore assumed the jurisdiction which augustus had vested in his prætor of compelling the execution of such trusts in the court of chancery and as it was most easy to obtain such grants from dying persons a maxim was established that though by law the lands themselves were not devisable yet if a testator had enfeoffed another to his own use and so was      possessed of the use only such use was devisable by will but we have seeni how this evasion was crushed in its infancy by statute    ric ii c   with respect to religious houses yet the idea being once introduced however fraudulently it afterwards continued to be often innocently and sometimes very laudably applied to a number of civil purposes particularly as it removed the restraint of alienations by will and permitted the owner of lands in his lifetime to make various designations of their profits as prudence or justice or family convenience might from time to time require till at length during our long wars in france and the subsequent civil commotions between the houses of york and lancaster uses grew almost universal through the desire that men had when their lives were continually in hazard of providing for their children by will and of securing their estates from forfeitures when each of the contending parties as they became uppermost ulternately attainted the other wherefore about the reign of edw iv before whose time lord bacon remarksk there are not six cases to be found relating to the doctrine of uses the courts of equity began to reduce them to something of a regular system originally it was held that the chancery could give no relief but against the very person himself intrusted for cestuy que use and not against his heir or alienee this was altered in the reign of henry vi with respect to the heirl and afterwards the same rule by a parity of reason was extended to such alienees as had purchased either without a valuable consideration or with an express notice of the usem but a purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice might hold the land discharged of any trust or confidence and     also it was held that neither the king nor queen on account of their dignity royaln nor any corporation    0 aggregate on account of its limited capacityo could be seised to any use but their own that is they might hold the lands but were not compellable to execute the trust   and if the feoffee to uses died without heir or committed a forfeiture or married neither the lord who entered for his escheat or forfeiture nor the husband who retained the possession as tenant by the curtesy nor the wife to whom dower was as signed were liable to perform the usep because they were not parties to the trust but came in by act of law though doubtless their title in reason was no better than that of the heir on the other hand the use itself or interest of cestuy que use was learnedly refined upon with many elaborate distinctions and   it was held that nothing could be granted to a use whereof the use is inseparable from the possession as annuities ways commons and authorities quæ ipso usu consumunturq or whereof the seisin could not be instantly givenr   a use could not be raised without a sufficient consideration for where a man makes a feoffment to another without any consideration equity presumes that he meant it to the use of himselfs unless he expressly declares it to be to the use of another and then nothing shall be presumed contrary to his own expressionst   but if either a good or a valuable consideration appears equity will immediately raise a use correspondent to such considerationu   uses were descendible according to the rules of the common law in the case of inheritances in possessionw for in this and many other respects æquitas sequitur legem and cannot establish a different rule of property from that which the law has established   uses might be assigned by secret deeds between the partiesx or be devised by last will and testamenty for as the legal estate in the soil was not transferred by these transactions no livery of seisin was necessary      and as the intention of the parties was the leading principle in this species of property any instrument declaring that intention was allowed to be binding in equity but cestuy que use could not at common law aliene the legal interest of the lands without the concurrence of his feoffeez to whom he was accounted by law to be only tenant at sufferancea   uses were not liable to any of the feodal burthens and particularly did not escheat for felony or other defect of blood for escheats c are the consequence of tenure and uses are held of nobody but the land itself was liable to escheat whenever the blood of the     feoffee to uses was extinguished by crime or by defect and the lord as was before observed might hold it discharged of the useb   no wife could be endowed or husband have his curtesy of a usec for no trust was declared for their benefit at the original grant of the estate and therefore it became customary when most estates were put in use to settle before marriage some jointestate to the use of the husband and wife for their lives which was the original of modern jointuresd   a use could not be extended by writ of elegit or other legal process for the debts of cestuy que usee for being merely a creature of equity the common law which looked no further than to the person actually seised of the land could award no process against it it is impracticable upon our present plan to pursue the doctrine of uses through all the refinements and niceties which the ingenuity of the times abounding in subtle disquisitions deduced from this child of the imagination when once a departure was permitted from the plain simple rules of property established by the antient law these principal outlines will be fully sufficient to show the ground of lord bacons complaintf that this course of proceeding was turned to deceive many of their just and reasonable rights a man that had cause to sue for land knew not against whom to      bring his action or who was the owner of it the wife was defrauded of her thirds the husband of his curtesy the lord of his wardship relief heriot and escheat the creditor of his extent for debt and the poor tenant of his lease to remedy these inconveniences abundance of statutes were provided which made the lands liable to be extended by the creditors of cestuy que useg allowed actions for the freehold to be brought against him if in the actual pernancy or enjoyment of the profitsh made him liable to actions of wastei established his conveyances and leases made without the concurrence of his feoffeesk and gave the lord the wardship of his heir with certain other feodal perquisitesl these provisions all tended to consider cestuy que use as the real owner of the estate and at length that idea was carried into full effect by the statute    hen viii c  0 which is usually called the statute of uses or in conveyances and pleadings the statute for transferring uses into possession the hint seems to have been derived from what was done at the accession of king richard iii who having when duke of gloucester been frequently made a feoffee to uses would upon the assumption of the crown as the law was then understood have been entitled to hold the lands discharged of the use but to obviate sonotorious an injustice an act of parliament was immediately passedm which ordained that where he had been so enfeoffed jointly with other persons the land should vest in the other feoffees as if he had never been named and that where he stood solely enfeoffed the estate itself should vest in cestuy que use in like manner as he had the use and so the stat of henry viii after reciting the various inconveniences before mentioned and many others enacts that when any person shall be seised of lands c to the use confidence or trust of any other person or body      politic the person or corporation entitled to the use in feesimple feetail for life or years or otherwise shall from thenceforth stand and be seised or possessed of the land c of and in the like estates as they have in the use trust or confidence and that the estate of the person so seised to uses shall be deemed to be in him or them that have the use in such quality manner form and condition as they had before in the use the statute thus executes the use as our lawyers term it that is it conveys the possession to the use and transfers the use into possession thereby making cestuy que use complete owner of the lands and tenements as well at law as in equity     the statute having thus not abolished the conveyance to uses but only annihilated the intervening estate of the feoffee and turned the interest of cestuy que use into a legal instead of an equitable ownership the courts of common law began to take cognizance of uses instead of sending the party to seek his relief in chancery and considering them now as merely a mode of conveyance very many of the rules before established in equity were adopted with improvements by the judges of the common law the same persons only were held capable of being seised to a use the same considerations were necessary for raising it and it could only be raised of the same hereditaments as formerly but as the statute the instant it was raised converted it into an actual possession of the land a great number of the incidents that formerly attended it in its fiduciary state were now at an end the land could not escheat or be forfeited by the act or defect of the feoffee nor be aliened to any purchaser discharged of the use nor be liable to dower or curtesy on account of the seisin of such feoffee because the legal estate never rests in him for a moment but is instantaneously transferred to cestuy que use as soon as the use is declared and as the use and the land were now convertible terms they became liable to dower curtesy and escheat in consequence of the seisin of cestuy que use who was now become the terretenant also and they likewise were no longer devisable by will      the various necessities of mankind induced also the judges very soon to depart from the rigour and simplicity of the rules of the common law and to allow a more minute and complex construction upon conveyances to uses than upon others hence it was adjudged that the use need not always be executed the instant the conveyance is made but if it cannot take effect at that time the operation of the statute may wait till the use shall arise upon some future contingency to happen within a reasonable period of time and in the mean while the antient use shall remain in the original grantor as when lands are conveyed to the use of a and b after a marriage shall be had between themn or to the use of a and his heirs till b shall pay him a sum of money and then to the use of b and his heirso which doctrine when devises by will were again introduced and considered as equivalent in point of construction to declaration of uses was also adopted in favour of executory devisesp but herein these which are called contingent or springing uses   differ     from an executory devise in that there must be a person seised to such uses at the time when the contingency happens else they can never be executed by the statute and therefore if the estate of the feoffee to such use be destroyed by alienation or otherwise before the contingency arises the use is destroyed foreverq whereas by an executory devise the freehold itself is transferred to the future devisee and in both these cases a fee may be limited to take effect after a feer because though that was forbidden by the common law in favour of the lords escheat yet when the legal estate was not extended beyond one feesimple such subsequent uses after a use in fee were before the statute permitted to be limited in equity and then the statute executed the legal estate in the same manner as the use before subsisted it was also held that a use though executed may change from one to another by circumstances ex post factos as if a makes a feoffment      to the use of his intended wife and her eldest son for their lives upon the marriage the wife takes the whole use in severalty and upon the birth of a son the use is executed jointly in them botht this is sometimes called a secondary sometimes a shifting use and whenever the use limited by the deed expires or cannot vest it returns back to him who raised it after such expiration or during such impossibility and is styled a resulting use as if a man makes a feoffment to the use of his intended wife for life with remainder to the use of her firstborn son in tail here till he marries the use results back to himself after marriage it is executed in the wife for life and if she dies without issue the whole results back to him in feeu it was likewise held that the uses originally declared may be revoked at any future time and new uses be declared of the land provided the grantor reserved to himself such a power at the creation of the estate whereas the utmost that the common law would allow was a deed of defeazance coeval with the grant itself and therefore esteemed a part of it upon events specially mentionedw and in case of such a revocation the old uses were held instantly to cease and the new ones to become executed in their steadx and this was permitted partly to indulge the convenience and partly the caprice of mankind who as lord bacon observesy have always affected to have the disposition of their property revocable in their own time and irrevocable ever afterwards by this equitable train of decisions in the courts of law the power of the court of chancery over landed property was greatly curtailed and diminished       but one or two technical scruples which the judges found it hard to get over restored it with tenfold increase they held in the first place that no use could be limited on a usez and that when a man bargains and sells his land for money which raises a use by implication to the bargainee the limitation of     a further use to another person is repugnant and therefore      voida and therefore on a feoffment to a and his heirs to the use of b and his heirs in trust for c and his heirs they held that the statute executed only the first use and that the second was a mere nullity not adverting that the     instant the first use was executed in b he became seised to the use of c which second use the statute might as well be permitted to execute as it did the first and so the legal estate might be instantaneously transmitted down through a hundred uses upon uses till finally executed in the last cestuy que use   again as the statute mentions only such persons as were seised to the use of others this was held not to extend to terms of years or other chattel interests whereof the termor is not seised but only possessedb and therefore if a term of one thousand years be limited to a to the use of or in trust for b the statute does not execute this use but leaves it as at common lawc and lastly by more modern resolutions where lands are given to one and his heirs in trust to receive and pay over the profits to another this use is not executed by the statute for the land must remain in the trustee to enable him to perform the trustd   of the two more antient distinctions the courts of equity quickly availed themselves in the first case it was evident that b was never intended by the parties to have any beneficial interest and in the second the cestuy que use of the term was expressly driven into the court of chancery to seek his remedy and therefore that court determined that though these were not uses which the statute could execute yet still they were trusts in equity which in conscience ought to be performede to this the reason of mankind assented and the doctrine of uses was revived under the denomination of trusts and thus by this strict construction of the courts of law a statute made upon great deliberation and introduced in the most solemn manner has had little other effect than to make a slight alteration in the formal words of a conveyancef      however the courts of equity in the exercise of this new jurisdiction have wisely avoided in a great degeee those mischiefs which made uses intolerable the statute of frauds    car ii c   having required that every declaration assignment or grant of any trust in lands or hereditaments except such as arise from implication or construction of law shall be made in writing signed by the party or by his written will the courts now consider a trustestate either when expressly declared or resulting by such implication as     equivalent to the legal ownership governed by the same rules of property and liable to every charge in equity which the other is subject to in law and by a long series of uniform determinations for now near a century past with some assistance from the legislature they have raised a new system of rational jurisprudence by which trusts are made to answer in general all the beneficial ends of uses without their inconvenience or frauds the trustee is considered as merely the instrument of conveyance and can in no shape affect the estate unless by alienation for a valuable consideration to a purchaser without noticeg which as cestuy que use is generally in possession of the land is a thing that can rarely happen the trust will descend may be aliened is liable to debts to executions on judgments statutes and recognizances by the express provision of the statute of frauds 0 to forfeiture to leases and other encumbrances nay even to the curtesy of the husband as if it was an estate at law it has not yet indeed been subjected to dower more from a cautious adherence to some hasty precedentsh than from any wellgrounded principle   it hath also been held not liable to escheat to the lord in consequence of attainder or want of heirsi because the trust could never be intended for his benefit but let us now return to the statute of uses the only service as was before observed to which this statute is now consigned is in giving efficacy to certain new and secret species of conveyances introduced in order to render transactions of this sort as private as possible and to save the trouble of making livery of seisin the only antient conveyance of corporal freeholds the security and notoriety of which public investiture abundantly overpaid the labour of going to the land or of sending an attorney in ones stead but this now has given way to         a twelfth species of conveyance called a covenant to stand seised to uses   by which a man seised of lands covenants in consideration of     blood or marriage that he will stand seised of the same to the use of his child wife or kinsman for life in tail or in fee here the statute executes at once the estate for the party intended to be benefited having thus acquired the use is thereby put at once into corporal possession of the landk without ever seeing it by a kind of parliamentary magic but this conveyance can only operate when made upon such weighty and interesting considerations as those of blood or marriage    a thirteenth species of conveyance introduced by this statute is that of a bargain and sale of lands which is a kind of real contract whereby the bargainor for some pecuniary consideration bargains and sells that is contracts to convey the land to the bargainee and becomes by such a bargain a trustee for or seised to the use of the bargainee and then the statute of uses completes the purchasel or as it hath been well expressedm the bargain first vests the use and then the statute vests the possession but as it was foreseen that conveyances thus made would want all those benefits of notoriety which the commonlaw assurances were calculated to give to prevent therefore clandestine conveyances of freeholds it was enacted in the same session of parliament by statute    hen viii c    that such bargains and sales should not enure to pass a freehold unless the same be made by indenture and enrolled within six months in one of the courts of westminster hall or with the custos rotulorum of the county clandestine bargains and sales of chattel interests or leases for years were thought not worth regarding as such interests were very precarious till about six years beforen which also occasioned them to be overlooked in framing the statute of uses and therefore such bargains and sales are not directed to be enrolled but how impossible is it to      foresee and provide against all the consequences of innovations this omission has given rise to    a fourteenth species of conveyance viz by lease and release first invented by sergeant moore soon after the statute of uses and now the most common of any and therefore not to be shaken though very great lawyers as particularly mr noy attorneygeneral to charles i have formerly doubted its validityo it is thus contrived a lease or rather bargain and sale upon some pecuniary consideration for one year is made by the tenant of the freehold to the lessee or bargainee now this without any enrolment makes the bargainor stand seised to the use of the bargainee and vests in the bargainee the use of the term for a year and then the statute immediately invests the possession he therefore being thus in possession   is capable of receiving a release of the     freehold and reversion which we have seen beforep must be made to a tenant in possession and accordingly the next day a release is granted to himq this is held to supply the place of livery of seisin and so a conveyance by lease and release is said to amount to a feoffmentr      to these may be added deeds to lead or declare the uses of other more direct conveyances as feoffments fines and recoveries of which we shall speak in the next chapter and    deeds of revocation of uses hinted at in a former pages and founded in a previous power reserved at the raising of the usest to revoke such as were then declared and to appoint others in their stead which is incident to the power of revocationu and this may suffice for a specimen of conveyances founded upon the statute of uses and will finish our observations upon such deeds as serve to transfer real property     0    0 before we conclude it will not be improper to subjoin a few remarks upon such deeds as are used not to convey but to charge or encumber lands and to discharge them again of which nature are obligations or bonds recognizances and defeazances upon them both     an obligation or bond is a deedv whereby the obligor obliges himself his heirs executors and administrators to pay a certain sum of money to another at a day appointed if this be all the bond is called a single one simplex obligatio but there is generally a condition added that if the obligor does some particular act the obligation shall be void or else shall remain in full force as payment of rent performance of covenants in a deed or repayment of a principal sum of money borrowed of the obligee with interest which principal sum is usually onehalf of the penal sum specified in the bond in case this condition is not performed the bond becomes forfeited or absolute at law and charges the obligor while living and after his death the obligation descends upon his heir who on defect of personal assets is bound to discharge it provided he has real assets by descent as a recompense so that it may be called though not a direct yet a collateral charge upon the lands   how it affects the personal property of the obligor will be more properly considered hereafter   if the condition of a bond be impossible at the time of making it or be to do a thing contrary to some rule of law that is merely positive or be uncertain or insensible the condition alone is void and the bond shall stand single and unconditional for it is the folly of the obligor to enter into such an obligation from which he can never be released if it be to do a thing that is malum in se the obligation itself is void for the whole is an unlawful contract and the obligee shall take no advantage from such a transaction and if the condition be possible at the time of making it and afterwards      becomes impossible by the act of god the act of law or the act of the obligee himself there the penalty of the obligation is saved for no prudence or foresight of the obligor could guard against such a contingencyw on the forfeiture of the bond or its becoming single the whole penalty was formerly recoverable at law but here the courts of equity interposed and would not permit a man to take     more than in conscience he ought viz his principal interest and expenses in case the forfeiture accrued by nonpayment of money borrowed the damages sustained upon nonperformance of covenants and the like and the like practice having gained some footing in the courts of lawx the statute      anne c    at length enacted in the same spirit of equity that in case of a bond conditioned for the payment of money the payment or tender of the principal sum due with interest and costs even though the bond be forfeited and a suit commenced thereon shall be a full satisfaction and discharge     a recognizance is an obligation of record which a man enters into before some court of record or magistrate duly authorizedy with condition to do some particular act as to appear at the assizes to keep the peace to pay a debt or the like it is in most respects like another bond the difference being chiefly this that the bond is the creation of a fresh debt or obligation de novo the recognizance is an acknowledgment of a former debt upon record the form whereof is that a b doth acknowledge to owe to our lord the king to the plaintiff to cd or the like the sum of ten pounds with condition to be void on performance of the thing stipulated in which case the king the plaintiff c d c is called the recognizee is cui cognoscitur as he that enters into the recognizance is called the cognizor is qui cognoscit this being either certified to or taken by the officer of some court is witnessed only by the record of that court and not by the partys seal so that it is not in strict propriety a deed though the effects of it are greater than a      common obligation 0 being allowed a priority in point of payment and binding the lands of the cognizor from the time of enrolment on recordz   there are also other recognizances of a private kind in nature of a statute staple by virtue of the statute    hen viii c   which have been already explaineda and shown to be a charge upon real property   a defeazance on a bond or recognizance or judgment recovered is a condition which when performed defeats or undoes it in the same manner as a defeazance of an estate before mentioned it differs only from the common condition of a bond in that the one is always inserted in the deed or bond itself the other is made between the same parties by a separate and frequently a subsequent deedb this like the condition of a bond when performed discharges and disencumbers the estate of the obligor these are the principal species of deeds or matter in pais by which estates may be either conveyed or at least affected among which the conveyances     to uses are by much the most frequent of any though in these there is certainly one palpable defect the want of sufficient notoriety so that purchasers or creditors cannot know with any absolute certainty what the estate and the title to it in reality are upon which they are to lay out or to lend their money in the antient feodal method of conveyance by giving corporal seisin of the lands this notoriety was in some measure answered but all the advantages resulting from thence are now totally defeated by the introduction of deathbed devises and secret conveyances and there has never been yet any sufficient guard provided against fraudulent charges and encumbrances since the disuse of the old saxon custom of transacting all conveyances at the county court and entering a memorial of them in the chartulary or legerbook of some adjacent monasteryc and the failure of the general register established by king richard the first for the starrs or mortgages made to      jews in the capitula de judæis of which hoveden has preserved a copy how far the establishment of a like general register for deeds and wills and other acts affecting real property would remedy this inconvenience deserves to be well considered in scotland every act and event regarding the transmission of property is regularly entered on recordd and some of our own provincial divisions particularly the extended county of york and the populous county of middlesex have prevailed with the legislaturee to erect such register in their several districts but however plausible these provisions may appear in theory it hath been doubted by very competent judges whether more disputes have not arisen in those counties by the inattention and omissions of parties than prevented by the use of registers   chapter xxi of alienation by matter of record assurances by matter of record are such as do not entirely depend on the act or consent of the parties themselves but the sanction of a court of record is called in to substantiate preserve and be a perpetual testimony of the transfer of property from one man to another or of its establishment when already transferred of this nature are   private acts of parliament   the kings grants   fines   common recoveries i private acts of parliament  are especially of late years become a very common     mode of assurance for it may sometimes happen that by the ingenuity of some and the blunders of other practitioners an estate is most grievously entangled by a multitude of contingent remainders resulting trusts springing uses executory devises and the like artificial contrivances a confusion unknown to the simple conveyances of the common law so that it is out of the power of either the courts of law or equity to relieve the owner or it may sometimes happen that by the strictness or omissions of familysettlements the tenant of the estate is abridged of some reasonable power as letting leases making a jointure for a wife or the like which power cannot be given him by the ordinary judges either in common law or equity or it may be necessary in settling an estate to secure it against the claims of infants or other persons under legal disabilities who are not bound by any judgments or decrees of the ordinary courts of justice in these or other cases of      the like kind the transcendent power of parliament is called in to cut the gordian knot and by a particular law enacted for this very purpose to unfetter an estate to give its tenant reasonable powers or to assure it to a purchaser against the remote or latent claims of infants or disabled persons by settling a proper equivalent in proportion to the interest so barred  this practice was carried to a great length in the year succeeding the restoration by setting aside many conveyances alleged to have been made by constraint or in order to screen the estates from being forfeited during the usurpation and at last it proceeded so far that as the noble historian expresses ita every man had raised an equity in his own imagination that he thought was entitled to prevail against any descent testament or act of law and to find relief in parliament which occasioned the king at the close of the session to remarkb that the good old rules of law are the best security and to wish that men might not have too much cause to fear that the settlements which they make of their estate shall be too easily unsettled when they are dead by the power of parliament acts of this kind are however at present carried on in both houses with great deliberation and caution particularly in the house of lords they are usually referred to two judges to examine and report the facts alleged and to settle all technical forms nothing also is done without the consent expressly given of all parties in being and capable of consent that have the remotest interest in the matter unless such consent shall appear to be perversely and without any reason withheld and as was before hinted an equivalent in money or other estate is usually settled upon infants or persons not in esse or not of capacity to act for themselves who are to be concluded by this act and a general saving is constantly added at the close of the bill of the right and interest of all persons whatsoever except those whose consent is so given or purchased and who are therein particularly named though it hath been holden that even if such saving be omitted the act shall bind none but the partiesc          a law thus made though it binds all parties to the bill is yet looked upon rather as a private conveyance than as the solemn act of the legislature it is not therefore allowed to be a public but a mere private statute it is not printed or published among the other laws of the session it hath been relieved against when obtained upon fraudulent suggestionsd it hath been holden to be void if contrary to law and reasone  and no judge or jury is bound to take notice of it unless the same be specially set forth and pleaded to them it remains however enrolled among the public records of the nation to be forever preserved as a perpetual testimony of the conveyance or assurance so made or established      ii the kings grants are also matter of public record for as st germyn saysf the kings excellency is so high in the law that no freehold may be given to the king nor derived from him but by matter of record and to this end a variety of offices are erected communicating in a regular subordination one with another through which all the kings grants must pass and be transcribed and enrolled that the same may be narrowly inspected by his officers who will inform him if any thing contained therein is improper or unlawful to be granted these grants whether of lands honours liberties franchises or aught besides are contained in charters or letterspatent that is open letters literæ patentes so called because they are not sealed up but exposed to open view with the great seal pendant at the bottom and are usually directed or addressed by the king to all his subjects at large and therein they differ from certain other letters of the king sealed also with his great seal but directed to particular persons and for particular purposes which therefore not being proper for public inspection are closed up and sealed on the outside and are thereupon called writs close literæ clausæ and are recorded in the closerolls in the same manner as the others are in the patentrolls grants or letterspatent must first pass by bill which is prepared by the attorney and solicitor general in consequence      of a warrant from the crown and is then signed that is subscribed at the top with the kings own sign manual and sealed with his privy signet which is always in the custody of the principal secretary of state and then sometimes it immediately passes under the great seal in which case the patent is subscribed in these words per ipsum regem by the king himselfg otherwise the course is to carry an extract of the bill to the keeper of the privy seal who makes out a writ or warrant thereupon to the chancery so that the sign manual is the warrant to the privy seal and the privy seal is the warrant to the great seal and in this last case the patent is subscribed per breve de privato sigillo by writ of privy sealh  but there are some grants which only pass through certain offices as the admiralty or treasury in consequence of a sign manual without the confirmation of either the signet the great or the privy seal the manner of granting by the king does not more differ from that by a subject than the construction of his grants when made   a grant made by the king at the suit of the grantee shall be taken most beneficially for the king and against the party whereas the grant of a subject is construed most strongly against the grantor wherefore it is usual to insert in the kings grants that they are made not at the suit of the grantee but ex speciali gratia certa scientia et mero motu regis and then they have a more liberal constructioni   a subjects grant shall be construed to include many things besides what are expressed if necessary for the operation of the grant therefore in a private grant of the profits of land for one year free ingress egress and regress to cut and carry away those profits are also inclusively grantedj and if a feoffment of land was made by a lord to his villein this operated as a manumissionk for he was otherwise unable to hold it but the kings grant shall not enure to any other intent than that which is precisely expressed in the grant as if he grants land to an alien it operates nothing for      such grant shall not also enure to make him a denizen that so he may be capable of taking     by grantl   when it appears from the face of the grant that the king is mistaken or deceived either in matter of fact or matter of law as in case of false suggestion misinformation or misrecital of former grants or if his own title to the thing granted be different from what he supposes or if the grant be informal or if he grants an estate contrary to the rules of law in any of these cases the grant is absolutely voidm for instance if the king grants lands to one and his heirs male this is merely void for it shall not be an estatetail because there want words of procreation to ascertain the body out of which the heirs shall issue neither is it a feesimple as in common grants it would be because it may reasonably be supposed that the king meant to give no more than an estatetailn the grantee is therefore if any thing nothing more than tenant at willo and to prevent deceits of the king with regard to the value of the estate granted it is particularly provided by the statute   hen iv c   that no grant of his shall be good unless in the grantees petition for them express mention be made of the real value of the lands iii we are next to consider a very usual species of assurance which is also of record viz a fine of lands and tenements in which it will be necessary to explain   the nature of a fine   its several kinds and   its force and effect   a fine is sometimes said to be a feoffment of recordp though it might with more accuracy be called an acknowledgment of a feoffment on record by which is to be understood that it has at least the same force and effect with a feoffment in the conveying and assuring of lands though it is one of those methods of transferring estates of freehold by the common law in which livery of seisin is not necessary      to be actually given the supposition and acknowledgment thereof in a court of record however fictitious inducing an equal notoriety but more particularly a fine may be described to be an amicable composition or agreement of a suit either actual or fictitious by leave of the king or his justices whereby the lands in question become or are acknowledged to be the right of one of the partiesq in its original it was founded on an actual suit commenced at law for recovery of the possession of land or other hereditaments and the possession thus gained by such composition was found to be so sure and effectual that fictitious actions were and continue to be every day commenced for the sake of obtaining the same security a fine is so called because it puts an end not only to the suit thus commenced but also to all other suits and controversies concerning the same matter or as it is expressed in an ancient record of parliamentr    edw i non in regno angliæ providetur vel est aliqua securitas major vel solennior per quam aliquis statum certiorem habere possit neque ad statum suum verificandum aliquod solennius testimonium producere quam finem in curia domini regis levatum qui quidem finis sic vocatur eo quod finis et consummatio omnium placitorum esse debet et hac de causâ providebatur fines indeed are of equal antiquity with the first rudiments of the law itself are spoken of by glanvils and bractont in the reigns of henry ii and hen iii as things then well known and long established and instances have been produced of them even prior to the norman invasionu so that the statute    edw i called modus levandi fines did not give them original but only declared and regulated the manner in which they should be levied or carried on and that is as follows   the party to whom the land is to be conveyed or assured commences an action or suit at law against the other    0 generally an action of covenantv by suing out a writ of præcipe called a writ of covenantw the foundation of which is a supposed agreement or covenant that the one   0 shall convey the lands to the other on the breach of which agreement the action is brought on this writ there is due to the king by antient prerogative a primer fine or a noble for every five marks of land sued for that is onetenth of the annual valuex the suit being thus commenced then follows   the licentia concordandi or leave to agree the suity for as soon as the action is brought the defendant knowing himself to be in the wrong is supposed to make overtures of peace and accommodation to the plaintiff who accepting them but having upon suing out the writ given pledges to prosecute his suit which he endangers if he now deserts it without license he therefore applies to the court for leave to make the matter up this leave is readily granted but for it there is also another fine due to the king by his prerogative which is an antient revenue of the crown and is called the kings silver or sometimes the post fine with respect to the primer fine before mentioned and it is as much as the primer fine and half as much more or ten shillings for every five marks of land that is threetwentieths of the supposed annual valuez   next comes the concord or agreement itselfa after leave obtained from the court which is usually an acknowledgment from the deforciants or those who keep the other out of possession that the lands in question are the right of the complainant and from this acknowledgment or recognition of right the party levying the fine is called the      cognizor and he to whom it is levied the cognizee this acknowledgment must be made either openly in the court of common pleas  or before the lord chiefjustice of that court or else before one of the judges of that court or two or more commissioners in the country empowered by a special authority called a writ of dedimus potestatem  which judges and commissioners are bound by statute    edw i st   to take care that the cognizors be of full age sound memory and out of prison if there be any femecovert among the cognizors she is privately examined whether she does it willingly and freely or by compulsion of her husband by these acts all the essential parts of a fine are completed and if the cognizor dies the next moment after the fine is acknowledged provided it be subsequent to the day on which the writ is made returnableb still the fine shall be carried on in all its remaining parts of which the next is   the note of the finec which is only an abstract of the writ of covenant and the concord naming the parties the parcels of land and the agreement     this must be enrolled of record in the proper office by direction of the statute   hen iv c      the fifth part is the foot of the fine or conclusion of it which includes the whole matter reciting the parties day year and place and before whom it was acknowledged or leviedd of this there are indentures made or engrossed at the chirographers office and delivered to the cognizor and the cognizee usually beginning thus hæc est finalis concordia this is the final agreement and then reciting the whole proceeding at length and thus the fine is completely levied at common law  by several statutes still more solemnities are superadded in order to render the fine more universally public and less liable to be levied by fraud or covin and first  by    edw i      c   the note of the fine shall be openly read in the court of common pleas at two several days in one week and during such reading all pleas shall cease by   hen iv c    and    eliz c   all the proceedings on fines either at the time of acknowledgment or previous or subsequent thereto shall be enrolled of record in the court of common pleas by   ric iii c   confirmed and enforced by   hen vii c    the fine after engrossment shall be openly read and proclaimed in court during which all pleas shall cease sixteen times viz four times in the term in which it is made and four times in each of the three succeeding terms which is reduced to once in each term by    eliz c   and these proclamations are endorsed on the back of the recorde it is also enacted by    eliz c   that the chirographer of fines shall every term write out a table of the fines levied in each county in that term and shall affix them in some open part of the court of common pleas all the next term and shall also deliver the contents of such table to the sheriff of every county who shall at the next assizes fix the same in some open place in the court for the more public notoriety of the fine   fines thus levied are of four kinds   what in our law french is called a fine sur cognizance de droit come ceo que il ad de son done or a fine upon acknowledgment of the right of the cognizee as that which he hath of the gift of the cognizorf this is the best and surest kind of fine for thereby the deforciant in order to keep his covenant with the plaintiff of conveying to him the lands in question and at the same time to avoid the formality of an actual feoffment and livery acknowledges in court a former feoffment or gift in possession to have been made by him to the plaintiff this fine is therefore said to be a feoffment of record the livery thus acknowledged in court being equivalent to an actual livery so that this assurance is rather a confession of a former conveyance than a conveyance now originally made for the deforciant or cognizor acknowledges      cognoscit the right to be in the plaintiff or cognizee as that which he hath de son done of the proper gift of himself the cognizor   a fine sur cognizance de droit tantum or upon acknowledgment of the right merely not with the circumstance of a preceding gift from the cognizor this is commonly used to pass a reversionary interest which is in the cognizor for of such reversions there can be no feoffment or donation with livery supposed as the possession during the particular     estate belongs to a third persong it is worded in this manner that the cognizor acknowledges the right to be in the cognizee and grants for himself and his heirs that the reversion after the particular estate determines shall go to the cognizeeh   a fine sur concessit is where the cognizor in order to make an end of disputes though he acknowledges no precedent right yet grants to the cognizee an estate de novo usually for life or years by way of supposed composition and this may be done reserving a rent or the like for it operates as a new granti   a fine sur done grant et render is a double fine comprehending the fine sur cognizance de droit come ceo c and the fine sur concessit and may be used to create particular limitations of estate whereas the fine sur cognizance de droit come ceo c conveys nothing but an absolute estate either of inheritance or at least a freeholdj in this last species of fine the cognizee after the right is acknowledged to be in him grants back again or renders to the cognizor or perhaps to a stranger some other estate in the premises 0 but in general the first species of fine sur cognizance de droit come ceo c is the most used as it conveys a clean and absolute freehold and gives the cognizee a seisin in law without an actual livery and is therefore called a fine executed whereas the others are but executory   we are next to consider the force and effect of a fine these principally depend at this day on the common law and the two statutes   hen vii c    and    hen viii c    the antient common law with respect to this point      is very forcibly declared by the statute    edw i in these words—and the reason why such solemnity is required in the passing of a fine is this because the fine is so high a bar and of so great force and of a nature so powerful in itself that it precludes not only those which are parties and privies to the fine and their heirs but all other persons in the world who are of full age out of prison of sound memory and within the four seas the day of the fine levied unless they put in their claim on the footk of the fine within a year and a day but this doctrine of barring the right by nonclaim was abolished for a time by a statute made in    edw iii c    which admitted persons to claim and falsify a fine at any indefinite distancel whereby as sir edward coke observesm great contention arose and few men were sure of their possessions till the parliament held   hen vii reformed that mischief and excellently moderated between the latitude given by the statute and the rigour of the common law for the statute then maden restored the doctrine of nonclaim but extended the time of claim so that now by that statute the right of all strangers whatsoever is bound unless they make claim by way of action or lawful entry not within one year and a day as by the common law but within five years after proclamations made except femecoverts infants prisoners persons beyond the seas and such as are not of whole mind who have five years allowed to them and their heirs after the death of their husbands their attaining full age recovering their liberty returning into england or being restored to their right mind   it seems to have been the intention of that politic prince king henry vii to have covertly by this statute extended fines to have been a bar of estatestail     in order to unfetter the more easily the estates of his powerful nobility and lay      them more open to alienations being well aware that power will always accompany property but doubts having arisen whether they could by mere implication be adjudged a sufficient bar which they were expressly declared not to be by the statute de donis the statute    hen viii c    was thereupon made which removes all difficulties by declaring that a fine levied by any person of full age to whom or to whose ancestors lands have been entailed shall be a perpetual bar to them and their heirs claiming by force of such entail   unless the fine be levied by a woman after the death of her husband of lands which were by the gift of him or his ancestors assigned to her in tail for her jointureo or unless it be of lands entailed by act of parliament or letterspatent and whereof the reversion belongs to the crown from this view of the common law regulated by these statutes it appears that a fine is a solemn conveyance on record from the cognizor to the cognizee and that the persons bound by a fine are parties privies and strangers     the parties are either the cognizors or cognizees and these are immediately concluded by the fine and barred of any latent right they might have even though under the legal impediment of coverture and indeed as this is almost the only act that a femecovert or married woman is permitted by law to do and that because she is privately examined as to her voluntary consent which removes the general suspicion of compulsion by her husband it is therefore the usual and almost the only safe method whereby she can join in the sale settlement or encumbrance of any estate   privies to a fine are such as are any way related to the parties who levy the fine and claim under them by any right of blood or other right of representation such as are the heirs general of the cognizor the issue in tail since the statute of henry the eighth the vendee the devisee and all others who must make title by the persons who levied the fine for the act of the ancestor shall bind the heir and the act      of the principal his substitute or such as claim under any conveyance made by him subsequent to the fine so leviedp strangers to a fine are all other persons in the world except only parties and privies and these are also bound by a fine unless within five years after proclamations made they interpose their claim provided they are under no legal impediments and have then a present interest in the estate the impediments as hath before been said are coverture infancy imprisonment insanity and absence beyond sea and persons who are thus incapacitated to prosecute their rights have five years allowed them to put in their claims after such impediments are removed persons also that have not a present but a future interest only as those in remainder or reversion have five years allowed them to claim in from the time that such right accruesq and if within that time they neglect to claim or by the statute   anne c    if they do not bring an action to try the right within one year after making such claim and prosecute the same with effect all persons whatsoever are barred of whatever right they may have by force of the statute of nonclaim       but in order to make a fine of any avail at all it is necessary that the parties should have some interest or estate in the lands to be affected by it else it were possible that two strangers by a mere confederacy might without any risk defraud the owners by levying fines of their lands for if the attempt be discovered they can be no sufferers but must only remain in statu quo whereas if a tenant for life levies a fine it is an absolute forfeiture of his estate to the remainderman or reversionerr if claimed in proper time it is not therefore to be supposed that such tenants will frequently run so great a hazard but if they do and the claim is not duly made within five years after their respective terms expires the estate is forever barred by it yet where a stranger whose presumption cannot be thus punished officiously interferes in an estate which in no wise belongs to him      his fine is of no effect and may at any time be set aside unless by such as are parties or privies thereuntot by pleading that partes finis nihil habuerunt and even if a tenant for years who hath only a chattel interest and no freehold in the land levies a fine it operates nothing but is liable to be defeated by the same pleau wherefore when a lessee for years is disposed to levy a fine it is usual for him to make a feoffment first to displace the estate of the reversionerv and create a new freehold by disseisin   and thus much for the conveyance or assurance by fine which not only like other conveyances binds the grantor himself and his heirs but also all mankind whether concerned in the transfer or no if they fail to put in their claims within the time allotted by law       iv the fourth species of assurance by matter of record is a common recovery concerning the original of which it was formerly observedw that common recoveries were invented by the ecclesiastics to elude the statutes of mortmain and afterwards encouraged by the finesse of the courts of law in    edw iv in order to put an end to all fettered inheritances and bar not only estatestail but also all remainders and reversions expectant thereon i am now therefore only to consider first the nature of a common recovery and secondly its force and effect   and first the nature of it or what a common recovery is a common recovery is so far like a fine that it is a suit of action either actual or fictitious and in it the lands are recovered against the tenant of the freehold which recovery being a supposed adjudication of the right binds all persons and vests a free and absolute feesimple in the recoveror a recovery therefore being in the nature of an action at law not immediately compromised like a fine but carried on through every regular stage of proceeding i am greatly apprehensive that its form and method will not be easily understood by the student who is not yet acquainted      with the course of judicial proceedings which cannot be thoroughly explained till treated of at large in the third book of these commentaries however i shall endeavour to state its nature and progress as clearly and concisely as i can avoiding as far as possible all technical terms and phrases not hitherto interpreted let us in the first place suppose david edwardsx to be tenant of the freehold and desirous to suffer a common recovery in order to bar all entails remainders and reversions and to convey the same in feesimple to francis golding to effect this golding is to bring an action against him for the lands and he accordingly sues out a writ called a præcipe quod reddat because those were its initial or most operative words when the law proceedings were in latin in this writ the demandant golding alleges that the defendant edwards here called the tenant has no legal title to the land but that he came into possession of it after one hugh hunt had turned the demandant out of ity the subsequent proceedings are made up into a record or recoveryrollz in which the writ and complaint of the demandant are first recited whereupon the tenant appears and calls upon one jacob morland who is supposed at the original purchase to have warranted the title to the tenant and thereupon he prays that the said jacob morland may be called in to defend the title which he so warranted this is called the voucher vocatio or calling of jacob morland to warranty and morland is called the vouchee upon this jacob morland the vouchee appears is impleaded and defends the title whereupon golding the demandant desires leave of the court to imparl or confer with the vouchee in private which is as usual allowed him and soon afterwards the demandant golding returns to court but morland the vouchee disappears or makes default whereupon judgment is given for the demandant golding now called the recoveror to recover the lands in question against the tenant edwards who is now the recoveree      and edwards has judgment to recover of jacob morland lands of equal value in recompense for the lands so warranted by him and now lost by his default which is agreeable to the doctrine of warranty mentioned in the preceding chaptera this is called the recompense or recovery in value but jacob morland having no lands of his own being usually the crier of the court who from being frequently thus vouched is called     the common vouchee it is plain that edwards has only a nominal recompense for the land so recovered against him by golding which lands are now absolutely vested in the said recoveror by judgment of law and seisin thereof is delivered by the sheriff of the county so that this collusive recovery operates merely in the nature of a conveyance in feesimple from edwards the tenant in tail to golding the purchasor the recovery here described is with a single voucher only but sometimes it is with double treble or further voucher as the exigency of the case may require and indeed it is now usual always to have a recovery with double voucher at the least by first conveying an estate of freehold to any indifferent person against whom the præcipe is brought and then he vouches the tenant in tail who vouches over the common voucheeb for if a recovery be had immediately against tenant in tail it bars only such estate in the premises of which he is then actually seised whereas if the recovery be had against another person and the tenant in tail be vouched it bars every latent right and interest which he may have in the lands recoveredc if edwards therefore be tenant of the freehold in possession and john barker be tenant in tail in remainder here edwards doth first vouch barker and then barker vouches jacob morland the common vouchee who is always the last person vouched and always makes default whereby the demandant golding recovers the land against the tenant edwards and edwards recovers a recompense of equal value against barker the first vouchee who recovers the like against morland the common vouchee against whom such ideal recovery in value is always ultimately awarded     0    0 this supposed recompense in value is the reason why the issue in fail is held to be barred by a common recovery for if the recoveree should obtain a recompense in lands from the common vouchee which there is a possibility in contemplation of law though a very improbable one of his doing these lands would supply the place of those so recovered from him by collusion and would descend to the issue in taild this reason will also hold with equal force as to most remaindermen and reversioners to whom the possibility will remain and revert as a full recompense for the reality which they were otherwise entitled to but it will not always hold and therefore as pigot sayse the judges have been even astuti in inventing other reasons to maintain the authority of recoveries and in particular it hath been said that though the estatetail is gone from the recoveree yet it is not destroyed but only transferred and still subsists and will ever continue to subsist by construction of law in the recoveror his heirs and assigns and as the estatetail so continues to subsist forever the remainders or reversions expectant on the determination of such an estatetail can never take place   to such awkward shifts such subtle refinements and such strange reasoning were our ancestors obliged to have recourse in order to get the better of that stubborn statute de donis the design for which these contrivances were set on foot was certainly laudable the unriveting the fetters of estatestail which were attended with a legion of mischiefs to the commonwealth but while we applaud the end we cannot admire the means our modern courts of justice have indeed adopted a more manly way of treating the subject by considering common recoveries in no other light than as the formal mode of conveyance by which tenant in tail is enabled to aliene his lands but since the ill consequences of fettered inheritances are now generally seen      and allowed and of course the utility and expedience of setting them at liberty are apparent it hath often been wished that the process of this conveyance was shortened and rendered less subject to niceties by either totally repealing the statute de donis which perhaps by reviving the old doctrine of conditional fees might give birth to many litigations or by vesting in every tenant in tail of full age the same absolute feesimple at once which now he may obtain whenever he pleases by the collusive fiction of a common recovery though this might possibly bear hard upon those in remainder or reversion by abridging the chances they would otherwise frequently have as no recovery can be suffered in the intervals between term and term which sometimes continue for near five months together or lastly by empowering the tenant in tail to bar the estatetail by a solemn deed to be made in termtime and enrolled in some court of record which is liable to neither of the other objections and is warranted not only by the usage of our american colonies and the decisions of our own courts of justice which allow a tenant in tail without fine or recovery to appoint his estate to any charitable usef but also by the precedent of the statuteg    jac i c    which in case of the bankrupt tenant in tail empowers his commissioners to sell the estate at any time by deed indented and enrolled and if in so national a concern the emoluments of the officers concerned in passing recoveries are thought to be worthy attention those might be provided for in the fees to be paid upon each enrolment       the force and effect of common recoveries may appear from what has been said to be an absolute bar not only of all estatestail but of remainders and reversions expectant on the determination of such estates so that a tenant in tail may by this method of assurance convey the lands held in tail to the recoveror his heirs and assigns absolutely free and discharged of all conditions and limitations in tail and of all remainders and reversions but by statute        hen viii c  0 no recovery had against tenant in tail of the kings gift whereof the remainder or reversion is in the king shall bar such estatetail or the remainder or reversion of the crown and by the statute    hen vii c  0 no      woman after her husbands death shall suffer a recovery of lands settled on her by her husband or settled on her husband and her by any of his ancestors   and by statute    eliz c   no tenant for life of any sort can suffer a recovery so as to bind them in remainder or reversion for which reason if there be tenant for life with remainder in tail and other remainders over and the tenant for life is desirous to suffer a valid recoverys either he or the tenant to the præcipe by him made must vouch the remainderman in tail otherwise the recovery is void but if he does vouch such remaindermen and he appears and vouches the common vouchee it is then good for if a man be vouched and appears and suffers the recovery to be had against the tenant to the præcipe it is as effectual to bar the estatetail as if he himself were the recovereeh 0 in all recoveries it is necessary that the recoveree or tenant to the præcipe as he is usually called be actually seised of the freehold else the recovery is voidi for all actions to recover the seisin of lands must be brought against the actual tenant of the freehold else the suit will lose its effect since the freehold cannot be recovered of him who has it not and though these recoveries are in themselves fabulous and fictitious yet it is necessary that there be actores fabulæ properly qualified but the nicety thought by some modern practitioners to be requisite in conveying the legal freehold in order to make a good tenant to the præcipe is removed by the provisions of the statute    geo ii c  0 which enacts with a retrospect and conformity to the antient rule of lawj that though the legal freehold be vested in lessees yet those who are entitled to the next freehold estate in remainder or reversion may make a good tenant to the præcipe—that though the deed or fine which creates such tenant be subsequent to the judgment of recovery yet if it be in the same term the recovery shall be valid in law—and that though the recovery itself do not appear to be entered or be not regularly entered on record yet the deed to make a tenant to the præcipe and declare the uses of the recovery shall      after a possession of twenty years be sufficient evidence on behalf of a purchaser for valuable consideration that such recovery was duly suffered and this may suffice to give the student a general idea of common recoveries the last species of assurance by matter of record before i conclude this head i must add a word concerning deeds to lead or to declare the uses of fines and of recoveries for if they be levied or suffered without any good consideration and without any uses declared they like other conveyances enure only to the use of him who levies or suffers themk and     if a consideration appears yet as the most usual fine sur cognizance de droit come ceo c conveys an absolute estate without any limitations to the cognizee and as common recoveries do the same to the recoveror these assurances could not be made to answer the purpose of family settlements wherein a variety of uses and designations is very often expedient unless their force and effect were subjected to the direction of other more complicated deeds wherein particular uses can be more particularly expressed the fine or recovery itself like a power once gained in mechanics may be applied and directed to give efficacy to an infinite variety of movements in the vast and intricate machine of a voluminous settlement and if these deeds are made previous to the fine or recovery they are called deeds to lead the uses if subsequent deeds to declare them as if a tenant in tail with reversion to himself in fee would settle his estate on b for life remainder to c in tail remainder to d in fee that is what by law he has no power of doing effectually while his own estatetail is in being he therefore usually after making the settlement proposed covenants to levy a fine or if there be any intermediate remainders to suffer a recovery to e and directs that the same shall enure to the uses in such settlement mentioned this is now a deed to lead the uses of the fine or recovery and the fine when levied or recovery when suffered shall enure to the uses so specified and no other for though e the cognizee or recoveror hath a feesimple vested in himself by the fine or recovery yet by the operation of this deed he      becomes a mere instrument or conduitpipe seised only to the use of b c and d in successive order which use is executed immediately by force of the statute of usesl or if a fine or recovery be had without any previous settlement and a deed be afterwards made between the parties declaring the uses to which the same shall be applied this will be equally good as if it had been expressly levied or suffered in consequence of a deed directing its operation to those particular uses for by statute      anne c    indentures to declare the uses of fines and recoveries made after the fines and recoveries had and suffered shall be good and effectual in law and the fine and recovery shall enure to such uses and be esteemed to be only in trust notwithstanding any doubts that had arisen on the statute of frauds    car ii c   to the contrary       chapter xxii of alienation by special custom we are next to consider assurances by special custom obtaining only in particular places and relative only to a particular species of real property this therefore is a very narrow title being confined to copyhold lands and such customary estates as are holden in antient demesne or in manors of a similar     nature which being of a very peculiar kind and originally no more than tenancies in pure or privileged villenage were never alienable by deed for as that might tend to defeat the lord of his seigniory it is therefore a forfeiture of a copyholda nor are they transferable by matter of record even in the kings courts but only in the courtbaron of the lord  the method of doing this is generally by surrender though in some manors by special custom recoveries may be suffered of copyholdsb but these differing in nothing material from recoveries of free land save only that they are not suffered in the kings courts but in the courtbaron of the manor i shall confine myself to conveyances by surrender and their consequences surrender sursumredditio is the yielding up of the estate by the tenant into the hands of the lord for such purposes as in the surrender are expressed as it may be to the use and behoof of a and his heirs to the use of his own will and the like the process in most manors is that      the tenant comes to the steward either in court or if the custom permits out of court or else to two customary tenants of the same manor provided there be also a custom     to warrant it and there by delivering up a rod a glove or other symbol as the custom directs resigns into the hands of the lord by the hands and acceptance of his said steward or of the said two tenants all his interest and title to the estate in trust to be again granted out by the lord to such persons and for such uses as are named in the surrender and the custom of the manor will warrant if the surrender be made out of court then at the next or some subsequent court the jury or homage must present and find it upon their oaths which presentment is an information to the lord or his steward of what has been transacted out of court immediately upon such surrender in court or upon presentment of a surrender made out of court the lord by his steward grants the same land again to cestuy que use who is sometimes though rather improperly called the surrenderee to hold by the antient rents and customary services and thereupon admits him tenant to the copyhold according to the form and effect of the surrender which must be exactly pursued  and this is done by delivering up to the new tenant the rod or glove or the like in the name and as the symbol of corporal seisin of the lands and tenements upon which admission he pays a fine to the lord according to the custom of the manor and takes the oath of fealty  in this brief abstract of the manner of transferring copyhold estates we may plainly trace the visible footsteps of the feodal institutions the fief being of a base nature and tenure is unalienable without the knowledge and consent of the lord for this purpose it is resigned up or surrendered into his hands custom and the indulgence of the law which favours liberty has now given the tenant a right to name his successor but formerly it was far otherwise and i am apt to suspect that this right is of much the same antiquity with the introduction of uses with respect to freehold lands for the alience of a copyhold had merely jus fiduciarium for which      there was no remedy at law but only by subpæna in chanceryc when therefore the lord had accepted a surrender of his tenants interest upon confidence to regrant the estate to another person either then expressly named or to be afterwards named in the tenants will the chancery enforced this trust as a matter of conscience which jurisdiction though seemingly new in the time of edward ivd was generally acquiesced in as it opened the way for the alienation of copyholds as well as of freehold estates and as it rendered the use of them both equally devisable by testament yet even to this day the new tenant cannot be admitted but by composition with the lord and paying him a fine by way of acknowledgment for the license of alienation add to this the plain feodal investiture by delivering the symbol of seisin in the presence of the other tenants in open court quando hasta vel aliud corporeum quidlibet porrigitur a domino se investituram facere dicente quæ saltem coram duobus vasallis solemniter fieri debete and to crown the whole the oath of fealty is annexed the very bond of feodal subjection from all which we may fairly conclude that had there been no other evidence of the fact in the rest of our tenures and estates the very existence of copyholds and the manner in which they are transferred would incontestably prove the very universal reception which this northern     system of property for a long time obtained in this island and which communicated itself or at least its similitude even to our very villeins and bondmen this method of conveyance is so essential to the nature of a copyhold estate that it cannot properly be transferred by any other assurance no feoffment or grant has any operation thereupon if i would exchange a copyhold estate with another i cannot do it by an ordinary deed of exchange at the common law but we must surrender to each others use and the lord will admit us accordingly if i would devise a copyhold i must surrender      it to the use of my last will and testament  and in my will i must declare my intentions and name a devisee who will then be entitled to admissionf a fine or recovery had of copyhold lands in the kings court may indeed if not duly reversed alter the tenure of the lands and convert them into frank feeg which is defined in the old book of tenuresh to be land pleadable at the common law but upon an action on the case in the nature of a writ of deceit brought by the lord in the kings court such fine or recovery will be reversed the lord will recover his jurisdiction and the lands will be restored to their former state of copyholdi  in order the more clearly to apprehend the nature of this peculiar assurance let us take a separate view of its several parts the surrender the presentment and the admittance   a surrender  by an admittance subsequent whereto the conveyance is to     receive its perfection and confirmation is rather a manifestation of the alienors intention than a transfer of any interest in possession for till admittance of cestuy que use the lord taketh notice of the surrenderor as his tenant and he shall receive the profits of the land to his own use and shall discharge all services due to the lord yet the interest remains in him not absolutely but sub modo for he cannot pass away the land to any other or make it subject to any other encumbrance than it was subject to at the time of the surrender but no manner of legal interest is vested in the nominee before admittance if he enters he is a trespasser and punishable in an action of trespass  and if he surrenders to the use of another such surrender is merely void and by no matter ex post facto can be confirmed for though he be admitted in pursuance of the original surrender and thereby acquires afterwards a sufficient and plenary interest as absolute owner yet his second surrender previous to his own admittance is absolutely void ab initio because at the time of such surrender he had but a possibility of an interest and could therefore transfer nothing and no subsequent admittance can make an act good which was ab initio void yet though upon the original surrender the nominee hath but a possibility it is however such a possibility as may whenever he pleases be reduced to a certainty for he cannot either by force or fraud be deprived or deluded of the effects and fruits of the surrender but if the lord refuse to admit him he is compellable to do it by a bill in chancery or a mandamusk      and the surrenderor can in no wise defeat his grant his hands being forever bound from disposing of the land in any other way and his mouth forever stopped from revoking or countermanding his own deliberate actl    as to the presentment that by the general custom of manors is to be made at the next courtbaron immediately after the surrender but by special custom in some places it will be good though made at the second or other subsequent court and it is to be brought into court by the same persons that took the surrender and then to be presented by the homage and in all points material must correspond with the true tenor of the surrender itself and therefore if the surrender be conditional and the presentment be absolute both the surrender presentment and admittance thereupon are wholly voidm the surrender as being never truly presented the presentment as being false and the admittance as being founded on such untrue presentment if a man surrenders out of court and dies before presentment and presentment be made after his death according to the custom that is sufficientn so too if cestuy que use dies before presentment yet upon presentment made after his death his heir according to the custom shall be admitted the same law is if those into whose hands the surrender is made die before presentment for upon sufficient proof in court that such a surrender was made the lord shall be compelled to admit accordingly and if the steward the tenants or others into whose hands such surrender is made refuse or neglect to bring it in to be presented upon a petition preferred to the lord in his courtbaron the party grieved shall find remedy but if the lord will not do him right and justice he may sue both     the lord and them that took the surrender in chancery and shall there find reliefo     0   admittance 0 is the last stage or perfection of copyhold assurances and this is of three sorts first an admittance upon a voluntary grant from the lord secondly an admittance upon surrender by the former tenant and thirdly an admittance upon a descent from the ancestor in admittances even upon a voluntary grant from the lord when copyhold lands have escheated or reverted to him the lord is considered as an instrument for though it is in his power to keep the lands in his own hands or to dispose of them at his pleasure by granting an absolute feesimple a freehold or a chattel interest therein and quite to change their nature from copyhold to socage tenure so that he may well be reputed their absolute owner and lord yet if he will still continue to dispose of them as copyhold he is bound to observe the antient custom precisely in every point and can neither in tenure nor estate introduce any kind of alteration for that were to create a new copyhold wherefore in this respect the law accounts him customs instrument for if a copyhold for life falls into the lords hands by the tenants death though the lord may destroy the tenure and enfranchise the land yet if he grants it out again by copy he can neither add to nor diminish the antient rent nor make any the minutest variation in other respectsp nor is the tenants estate so granted subject to any charges or encumbrances by the lordq in admittances upon surrender of another the lord is to no intent reputed as owner but wholly as an instrument and the tenant admitted shall likewise be subject to no charges or encumbrances of the lord for his claim to the estate is solely under him that made the surrenderr and as in admittances upon surrenders so in admittances upon descents by the death of the ancestor the lord      is used as a mere instrument and as no manner of interest passes into him by the surrender or the death of his tenant so no interest passes out of him by the act of admittance and therefore neither in the one case nor the other is any respect had to the quantity or quality of the lords estate in the manor for whether he be tenant in fee or for years whether he be in possession by right or by wrong it is not material since the admittances made by him shall not be impeached on account of his title because they are judicial or rather ministerial acts which every lord in possession is bound to performs admittances however upon surrender differ from admittances upon descent in this that by surrender nothing is vested in cestuy que use before admittance no more than in voluntary admittances but upon descent the heir is tenant by copy immediately upon the death of his ancestor not indeed to all intents and     purposes for he cannot be sworn on the homage nor maintain an action in the lords court as tenant but to most intents the law taketh notice of him as of a perfect tenant of the land instantly upon the death of his ancestor especially where he is concerned with any stranger he may enter into the land before admittance may take the profits may punish any trespass done upon the groundt nay upon satisfying the lord for his fine due upon the descent may surrender into the hands of the lord to whatever use he pleases   for which reasons we may conclude that the admittance of an heir is principally for the benefit of the lord to entitle him to his fine and not so much necessary for the strengthening and completing the heirs title hence indeed an observation might arise that if the benefit which the heir is to receive by the admittance is not equal to the charges of the fine he will never come in and be admitted to his copyhold in court and so the lord may be defrauded of his fine but to this we may reply in      the words of sir edward cokeu i assure myself if it were in the election of the heir to be admitted or not to be admitted he would be best contented without admittance but the custom of every manor is in this point compulsory for either upon pain of forfeiture of their copyhold or of incurring some great penalty the heirs of copyholders are enforced in every manor to come into court and be admitted according to the custom within a short time after notice given of their ancestors decease   chapter xxiii of alienation by devise the last method of conveying real property is by devise or disposition contained in a mans last will and testament and in considering this subject i shall not at present inquire into the nature of wills and testaments which are more properly the instruments to convey personal estates but only into the original and antiquity of devising real estates by will and the construction of the several statutes upon which that power is now founded it seems sufficiently clear that before the conquest lands were devisable by willa but upon the introduction of the military tenures the restraint of devising lands naturally took place as a branch of the feodal doctrine of nonalienation without the consent of the lordb and some have questioned whether this restraint which we may trace even from the antient germansc was not founded upon truer principles of policy than the power of wantonly disinheriting the heir by will and transferring the estate through the dotage or     caprice of the ancestor from those of his blood to utter strangers for this it is alleged maintained the balance of property and prevented one man from growing too big or powerful for his neighbours since it rarely happens      that the same man is heir to many others though by art and management he may frequently become their devisee thus the antient law of the athenians directed that the estate of the deceased should always descend to his children or on failure of lineal descendants should go to the collateral relations which had an admirable effect in keeping up equality and preventing the accumulation of estates but when solond made a slight alteration by permitting them though only on failure of issue to dispose of their lands by testament and devise away estates from the collateral heir this soon produced an excess of wealth in some and of poverty in others which by a natural progression first produced popular tumults and dissensions and these at length ended in tyranny and the utter extinction of liberty which was quickly followed by a total subversion of their state and nation on the other hand it would now seem hard on account of some abuses which are the natural consequence of free agency when coupled with human infirmity to debar the owner of lands from distributing them after his death as the exigence of his family affairs or the justice due to his creditors may perhaps require and this power if prudently managed has with us a peculiar propriety by preventing the very evil which resulted from solons institution the too great accumulation of property which is the natural consequence of our doctrine of succession by primogeniture to which the athenians were strangers of this accumulation the ill effects were severely felt even in the feodal times but it should always be strongly discouraged in a commercial country whose welfare depends on the number of moderate fortunes engaged in the extension of trade however this be we find that by the common law of england since the conquest no estate greater than for term of years could be disposed of by testamente except only in kent and in some antient burghs and a few particular manors where their saxon immunities by special indulgence subsistedf and though the feodal restraint on alienations      by deed vanished very early yet this on wills continued for some centuries after from an apprehension of infirmity and imposition on the testator in extremis which made such devises suspiciousg besides in devises there was wanting that general notoriety and public designation of the successor which in descent is apparent to the neighbourhood and which the simplicity of the common law always required in every transfer and new acquisition of property but when ecclesiastical ingenuity had invented the doctrine of uses as a thing distinct from the land uses began to be devised very frequentlyh and the devisee of the use could in chancery compel its execution for it is observed by gilberti that as the popish clergy then generally sat in the court of chancery they considered that men are most liberal when they can enjoy their possessions no longer and therefore at their death would choose to dispose of them to those who according to the superstition of the times could intercede for their happiness in another world but when the statute of usesj had annexed the possession to the use these uses being now the very land itself became no longer devisable  which might have occasioned a great revolution in the law of devises had not the statute of wills been made about five years after viz    hen viii c   explained by    hen viii c   which enacted     that all persons being seised in feesimple  except femecoverts  infants idiots and persons of nonsane memory might by will and testament in writing devise to any other person except to bodies corporate twothirds of their lands tenements and hereditaments held in chivalry and the whole of those held in socage which now through the alteration of tenures by the statute of charles the second amounts to the whole of their landed property except their copyhold tenements corporations were excepted in these statutes to prevent the extension of gifts in mortmain but now by construction      of the statute    eliz c   it is held that a devise to a corporation for a charitable use is valid as operating in the nature of an appointment rather than of a bequest and indeed the piety of the judges hath formerly carried them great lengths in supporting such charitable usesk it being held that the statute of elizabeth which favours appointments to charities supersedes and repeals all former statutesl and supplies all defects of assurancesm and therefore not only a devise to a corporation but a devise by a copyhold tenant without surrendering to the use of his willn and a devise nay even a settlement by tenant in tail without either fine or recovery if made to a charitable use are good by way of appointmento with regard to devises in general experience soon showed how difficult and hazardous a thing it is even in matters of public utility to depart from the rules of the common law which are so nicely constructed and so artificially connected together that the least breach in any one of them disorders for a time the texture of the whole innumerable frauds and perjuries were quickly introduced by this parliamentary method of inheritance for so loose was the construction made upon this act by the courts of law that bare notes in the handwriting of another person were allowed to be good wills within the statutep to remedy which the statute of frauds and perjuries    car ii c   directs that all devises of lands and tenements shall not only be in writing but signed by the testator or some other person in his presence and by his express direction and be subscribed in his presence by three or four credible witnesses  and a solemnity nearly similar is requisite for revoking a devise by writing though the same may be also revoked by burning cancelling tearing or obliterating thereof by the devisor or in his presence and with his consent      as likewise impliedly by such a great and entire alteration in the circumstances and situation of the devisor as arises from marriage and the birth of a childq  in the construction of this last statute  it has been adjudged that the     testators name written with his own hand at the beginning of      his will as i john mills do make this my last will and testament is a sufficient signing without any name at the bottomr though the other is the     safer way  it has also been determined that though the witnesses must all see the testator sign or at least acknowledge the signing yet they may do it at different timess but they must all subscribe their names as witnesses in his presence lest by any possibility they should mistake the instrumentt and in one case determined by the court of kings benchu the judges were extremely     strict in regard to the credibility or rather the competency of the witnesses for they would not allow any legatee nor by consequence a creditor where the legacies and debts were charged on the real estate to be a competent witness to the devise as being too deeply concerned in interest not to wish the establishment of the will for if it were established he gained a security for his legacy or debt from the real estate whereas otherwise he had no claim but on the personal assets this determination however alarmed many purchasers and creditors and threatened to shake most of the titles in the kingdom that depended on devises by will for if the will was attested by a servant to whom wages were due by the apothecary or attorney whose very attendance made them creditors or by the minister of the parish who had any demand for tithes or ecclesiastical dues and these are the persons most likely to be present in the testators last illness and if in such case the testator had charged his real estate with the payment of his debts the whole will and every disposition therein so far as related to real property were held to be utterly void this occasioned the statute    geo ii c   which restored both the competency and the credit of such legatees by declaring void all legacies  given to witnesses and thereby removing all possibility of their interest affecting their testimony the same statute likewise established the competency of creditors by directing the testimony of all such creditors to be admitted but leaving their credit like that of all other witnesses to be considered on a view of all the circumstances by the court      and jury before whom such will shall be contested and in a much later casev the testimony of three witnesses who were creditors was held to be sufficiently credible though the land was charged with the payment of debts and the reasons given on the former determination were said to be insufficient 0 another inconvenience was found to attend this new method of conveyance by devise in that creditors by bond and other specialties which affected the heir provided he had assets by descent were now defrauded of their securities not having the same remedy against the devisee of their debtor to obviate which the statute      w and m c    hath provided that all wills and testaments limitations dispositions and appointments of real estates by tenants in feesimple or having power to dispose by will shall as against such creditors     only be deemed to be fraudulent and void and that such creditors may maintain their actions jointly against both the heir and the devisee   a will of lands made by the permission and under the control of these statutes is considered by the courts of law not so much in the nature of a testament as of a conveyance declaring the uses to which the land shall be subject with this difference that in other conveyances the actual subscription of the witnesses is not required by laww though it is prudent for them so to do in order to assist their memory when living and to supply their evidence when dead but in devises of lands such subscription is now absolutely necessary by statute in order to identify a conveyance which in its nature can never be set up till after the death of the devisor and upon this notion that a devise affecting lands is merely a species of conveyance is founded this distinction between such devises and testaments of personal chattels that the latter will operate upon whatever the testator dies possessed of the former only upon such real estates as were his at the time of executing and publishing his willx   wherefore     no      afterpurchased lands will pass under such devisey unless subsequent to the purchase or contractz the devisor republishes his willa   we have now considered the several species of common assurances whereby a title to lands and tenements may be transferred and conveyed from one man to another but before we conclude this head it may not be improper to take notice of a few general rules and maxims which have been laid down by courts of justice for the construction and exposition of them all these are       that the construction be favourable and as near the minds and apparent intents of the parties as the rules of law will admitb for the maxims of law are that verba intentioni debent inservire and benigne interpretamur chartas propter simplicitatem laicorum and therefore the construction must also be reasonable and agreeable to common understandingc   that quoties in verbis nulla est ambiguitas ibi nulla expositio contra verba fienda estd but that where the intention is clear too minute a stress be not laid on the strict and precise signification of words nam qui hæret in litera hæret in cortice therefore by a grant of a remainder a reversion may well pass and e conversoe and another maxim of law is that mala grammatica non vitiat chartam neither false english nor bad latin will destroy a deedf which perhaps a classical critic may think to be no unnecessary caution   that the construction be made upon the entire deed and not merely upon disjointed parts of it nam ex antecedentibus et consequentibus fit optima interpretatiog and    0 therefore that every part of it be if possible made to take effect and no word but what may operate in some shape or otherh nam verba debent intelligi cum effectu ut res magis valeat quam pereati   that the deed be taken most strongly against him that is the agent or contractor and in favour of the other party verba fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem as if tenant in feesimple grants to any one an estate for life generally it shall be construed an estate for the life of the granteej for the principle of selfpreservation will make men sufficiently careful not to prejudice their own interest by the too extensive meaning of their words and hereby all manner of deceit in any grant is avoided for men would always affect ambiguous and intricate expressions provided they were afterwards at liberty to put their own construction upon them but here a distinction must be taken between an indenture and a deedpoll for the words of an indenture executed by both parties are to be considered as the words of them both for though delivered as the words of one party yet they are not his words only because the other party hath given his consent to every one of them but in a deedpoll executed only by the grantor they are the words of the grantor only and shall be taken most strongly against himk   and in general this rule being a rule of some strictness and rigour is the last to be resorted to and is never to be relied upon but where all other rules of exposition faill   that if the words will bear two senses one agreeable to and another against law that sense be preferred which is most agreeable theretom as if tenant in tail lets a lease to have and to hold during life generally it shall be construed to be a lease for his own life only for that stands with the law and not for the life of the lessee which is beyond his power to grant        that in a deed if there be two clauses so totally repugnant to each other that they cannot stand together the first shall be received and the latter rejectedn wherein it differs from a will for there of two such repugnant clauses the latter shall stando which is owing to the different natures of the two instruments for the first deed and the last will are always most available in law   yet in both cases we should rather attempt to reconcile themp       that a devise be most favourably expounded to pursue if possible the will of the devisor who for want of advice or learning may have emitted the legal or proper phrases and therefore many times the law dispenses with the want of words in devises that are absolutely requisite in all other instruments thus a fee may be conveyed without words of inheritanceq and an estatetail without words of procreationr   by a will also an estate may pass by mere implication without any express words to direct its course as where a man devises lands to his heiratlaw after the death of his wife here though no estate is given to the wife in express terms yet she shall have an estate for life by implications for the intent of the testator is clearly to postpone the heir till after her death and if she does not take it nobody else can   so also where a devise is of blackacre to a and of whiteacre to b in tail and if they both die without issue then to c in fee here a and b have crossremainders by implication and on the failure of eithers issue the other or his issue shall take the whole and cs remainder over shall be postponed till the issue of both shall failt but to avoid confusion no such crossremainders are allowed between more than two deviseesu   and in general where any implications     are allowed they must be such as are necessary or at least highly      probable and not merely possible implicationsw and herein there is no distinction between the rules of law and of equity for the will being considered in both courts in the light of a limitation of usesx is construed in each with equal favour and benignity and expounded rather on its own particular circumstances than by any general rules of positive law       and thus we have taken a transient view in this and the three preceding chapters of a very large and diffusive subject the doctrine of common assurances which concludes our observations on the title to things real or the means by which they may be reciprocally lost and acquired we have before considered the estates which may be had in them with regard to their duration or quantity of interest the time of their enjoyment and the number and connections of the persons entitled to hold them we have examined the tenures both antient and modern whereby those estates have been and are now holden and have distinguished the object of all these inquiries namely things real into the corporeal or substantial and incorporeal or ideal kind and have thus considered the rights of real property in every light wherein they are contemplated by the laws of england a system of laws that differs much from every other system except those of the same feodal origin in its notions and regulations of landed estates and which therefore could in this particular be very seldom compared with any other the subject which has thus employed our attention is of very extensive use and of as extensive variety and yet i am afraid it has afforded the student less amusement and pleasure in the pursuit than the matters discussed in the preceding book to say the truth the vast alterations which the doctrine of real property has undergone from the conquest to the present time the infinite determinations upon points that continually arise and which have been heaped one upon another for a course of seven centuries without any order or      method and the multiplicity of acts of parliament which have amended or sometimes only altered the common law these causes have made the study of this branch of our national jurisprudence a little perplexed and intricate it hath been my endeavour principally to select such parts of it as were of the most general use where the principles were the most simple the reasons of them the most obvious and the practice the least embarrassed yet i cannot presume that i have always been thoroughly intelligible to such of my readers as were before strangers even to the very terms of art which i have been obliged to make use of though whenever those have first occurred i have generally attempted a short explication of their meaning these are indeed the more numerous on account of the different languages which our law has at different periods been taught to speak the difficulty arising from which will insensibly diminish by use and familiar acquaintance and therefore i shall close this branch of our inquiries with the words of sir edward cokey—albeit the student shall not at any one day do what he can reach to the full meaning of all that is here laid down yet let him no way discourage himself but proceed for on some other day in some other place or perhaps upon a second perusal of the same his doubts will be probably removed     chapter xxiv of things personal under the name of things personal are included all sorts of things movable which may attend a mans person wherever he goes  and therefore being only the objects of the law while they remain within the limits of its jurisdiction and being also of a perishable quality are not esteemed of so high a nature nor paid so much regard to by the law as things that are in their nature more permanent and immovable as land and houses and the profits issuing thereout these being constantly within the reach and under the protection of the law were the principal favourites of our first legislators who took all imaginable care in ascertaining the rights and directing the disposition of such property as they imagined to be lasting and which would answer to posterity the trouble and pains that their ancestors employed about them but at the same time entertained a very low and contemptuous opinion of all personal estate which they regarded as only a transient commodity the amount of it indeed was comparatively very trifling during the scarcity of money and the ignorance of luxurious refinements which prevailed in the feodal ages hence it was that a tax of the fifteenth tenth or sometimes a much larger proportion of all the movables of the subject was frequently laid without scruple and is mentioned with much unconcern by our antient historians though now it would justly alarm our opulent merchants and stockholders and hence      likewise may be derived the frequent forfeitures inflicted by the common law of all a mans goods and chattels for misbehaviours and inadvertencies that at present hardly seem to deserve so severe a punishment our antient lawbooks which are founded upon the feodal provisions do not therefore often condescend to regulate this species of property there is not a chapter in britton or the mirror that can fairly be referred to this head and the little that is to be found in glanvil bracton and fleta seems principally borrowed from the civilians but of later years since the introduction and extension of trade and commerce which are entirely occupied in this species of property and have greatly augmented its quantity and of course its value we have learned to conceive different ideas of it our courts now regard a mans personalty in a light nearly if not     quite equal to his realty and have adopted a more enlarged and less technical mode of considering the one than the other frequently drawn from the rules which they found already established by the roman law wherever those rules appeared to be well grounded and apposite to the case in question but principally from reason and convenience adapted to the circumstances of the times preserving withal a due regard to antient usages and a certain feodal tincture which is still to be found in some branches of personal property but things personal by our law do not only include things movable but also something more the whole of which is comprehended under the general name of chattels which sir edward coke saysa is a french word signifying goods the appellation is in truth derived from the technical latin word catalla which primarily signified only beasts of husbandry or as we still call them cattle but in its secondary sense was applied to all movables in generalb in the grand coustumier of normandyc a chattel is described as a mere movable but at the same time it is set in opposition to a fief or feud so that not only goods but whatever was not a feud were accounted chattels      and it is in this latter more extended negative sense that our law adopts it the idea of goods or movables only being not sufficiently comprehensive to take in every thing that the law considers as a chattel interest for since as the commentator on the coustumierd observes there are two requisites to make a fief or heritage duration as to time and immobility with regard to place whatever wants either of these qualities is not according to the normans an heritage or fief or according to us is not a real estate the consequence of which in both laws is that it must be a personal estate or chattel chattels therefore are distributed by the law into two kinds chattels real and chattels personale   chattels real saith sir edward cokef are such as concern or savour of the realty as terms for years of land wardships in chivalry while the military tenures subsisted the next presentation to a church estates by a statutemerchant statutestaple elegit or the like of all which we have already spoken and these are called real chattels as being interests issuing out of or annexed to real estates of which they have one quality viz immobility which denominates them real but want the other viz a sufficient legal indeterminate duration and this want it is that constitutes them chattels the utmost period for which they can last is fixed and determinate either for such a space of time certain or till such a particular sum of money be raised out of such a particular income so that they are not equal in the eye of the law to the lowest estate of freehold a lease for anothers life their tenants were considered upon feodal principles as merely bailiffs or farmers and the tenant of the freehold might at any time have destroyed their interest till the reign of henry viiig a freehold which alone is a real estate and seems as has been said to answer to the fief in normandy is conveyed by corporal investiture and      livery of seisin which gives the tenant so strong a hold of the land that it never after can be wrested from him during his life but by his own act of voluntary transfer or of forfeiture or else by the happening of some future contingency as in estates pur auter vie and the determinable freeholds mentioned in a former chapterh and even these being of an uncertain duration may by possibility last for the owners life for the law will not presuppose the contingency to happen before it actually does and till then the estate is to all intents and purposes a lifeestate and therefore a freehold interest on the other hand a chattel interest in lands which the normans put in opposition to fief and we to freehold is conveyed by no seisin or corporal investiture but the possession is gained by the mere entry of the tenant himself and it will certainly expire at a time prefixed and determined if not sooner thus a lease     for years must necessarily fail at the end and completion of the term the next presentation to a church is satisfied and gone the instant it comes into possession that is by the first avoidance and presentation to the living the conditional estates by statutes and elegit are determined as soon as the debt is paid and so guardianships in chivalry expired of course the moment that the heir came of age and if there be any other chattel real it will be found to correspond with the rest in this essential quality that its duration is limited to a time cortain beyond which it cannot subsist    chattels personal are properly and strictly speaking things movable which may be annexed to or attendant on the person of the owner and carried about with him from one part of the world to another such are animals household stuff money jewels corn garments and every thing else that can properly be put in motion and transferred from place to place and of this kind of chattels it is that we are principally to speak in the remainder of this book having been unavoidably led to consider the nature of chattels real and their incidents in the former chapters which were      employed upon real estates that kind of property being of a mongrel amphibious nature originally endowed with one only of the characteristics of each species of things the immobility of things real and the precarious duration of things personal chattel interests being thus distinguished and distributed it will be proper to consider first the nature of that property or dominion to which they are liable which must be principally nay solely referred to personal chattels and secondly the title to that property or how it may be lost and acquired of each of these in its order chapter xxv of property in things personal property in chattels personal may be either in possession which is where a man hath not only the right to enjoy but hath the actual enjoyment of the thing or else it is in action where a man hath only a bare right without any occupation or enjoyment and of these the former or property in possession is divided into two sorts an absolute and a qualified property i first then of property in possession absolute  which is where a man hath solely and exclusively the right and also the occupation of any movable chattels so that they cannot be transferred from him or cease to be his without his own act or default such may be all inanimate things as goods plate money jewels implements of war garments and the like such also may be all vegetable productions as the fruit or other parts of a plant when severed from the body of it or the whole plant itself when severed from the ground none of which can be moved out of the owners possession without his own act or consent or at least without doing him an injury which it is the business of the law to prevent or remedy of these therefore there remains little to be said but with regard to animals which have in themselves a principle and power of     motion and unless particularly confined can convey themselves from one part of the world to another there is a great difference made with respect to    0 their several classes not only in our law but in the law of nature and of all civilized nations they are distinguished into such as are domitæ and such as are feræ naturæ some being of a tame and others of a wild disposition in such as are of a nature tame and domestic as horses kine sheep poultry and the like a man may have as absolute a property as in any inanimate beings because these continue perpetually in his occupation and will not stray from his house or person unless by accident or fraudulent enticement in either of which cases the owner does not lose his propertya in which our law agrees with the laws of france and hollandb the stealing or forcible abduction of such property as this is also felony for these are things of intrinsic value serving for the food of man or else for the uses of husbandryc but in animals feræ naturæ a man can have no absolute property of all tame and domestic animals the brood belongs to the owner of the dam or mother the english law agreeing with the civil that partus sequitur ventrem in the brute creation though for the most part in the human species it disallows that maxim and therefore in the laws of englandd as well as romee si equam meam equus tuus prægnantem fecerit non est tuum sed meum quod natum est and for this puffendorff gives a sensible reason not only because the male is frequently unknown but also because the dam during the time of her pregnancy is almost useless to the proprietor and must be maintained with great expense and care wherefore as her owner is the loser by her pregnancy he ought to be the gainer by her brood an exception to this rule is in the case of young cygnets which belong equally to the owner of the cock and hen and shall be divided between themg but here the reasons of the general rule cease and cessante      ratione cessat et ipsa lex for the male is well known by his constant association with the female and for the same reason the owner of the one doth not suffer more disadvantage during the time of pregnancy and nurture than the owner of the other ii other animals that are not of a tame and domestic nature are either not the objects of property at all or else fall under our other division namely that of qualified limited or special property which is such as is not in its nature permanent but may sometimes subsist and at other times not subsist in discussing which subject i shall in the first place show how this species of property may subsist in such animals as are feræ naturæ or of a wild nature and then how it may subsist in any other things when under particular circumstances first then a man may be invested with a qualified but not an absolute property in all creatures that are feræ naturæ either per industriam propter impotentiam or propter privilegium   a qualified property may subsist in animals feræ naturæ per industriam hominis  by a mans reclaiming and making them tame by art industry and education or by so confining them within his own immediate power that they cannot escape and use their natural liberty and under this head some writers have ranked all the former species of animals we have mentioned apprehending none to be originally and naturally tame but only made so by art and custom as horses swine and other cattle which if originally left to themselves would have chosen to rove up and down seeking their food at large and are only made domestic by use and familiarity and are therefore say they called mansueta quasi manui assueta but however well this notion may be founded abstractedly considered our law apprehends the most obvious distinction to be     between such animals as we generally see tame and are therefore seldom if ever found wandering at large which it calls domitæ naturæ and such creatures as are usually found at liberty which are therefore supposed to be more emphatically feræ natu     ræ though it may happen that the latter shall be sometimes tamed and confined by the art and industry of man such as are deer in a park hares or rabbits in an enclosed warren doves in a dovehouse pheasants or partridges in a mew hawks that are fed and commanded by their owner and fish in a private pond or in trunks these are no longer the property of a man than while they continue in his keeping or actual possession but if at any time they regain their natural liberty his property instantly ceases unless they have animum revertendi which is only to be known by their usual custom of returningh  a maxim which is borrowed from the civil lawi revertendi animum videntur desinere habere tunc cum revertendi consuetudinem deseruerint the law therefore extends this possession further than the mere manual occupation for my tame hawk that is pursuing his quarry in my presence though he is at liberty to go where he pleases is nevertheless my property for he hath animum revertendi so are my pigeons that are flying at a distance from their home especially of the carrier kind and likewise the deer that is chased out of my park or forest and is instantly pursued by the keeper or forester all which remain still in my possession and i still preserve my qualified property in them but if they stray without my knowledge and do not return in the usual manner it is then lawful for any stranger to take themk but if a deer or any wild animal reclaimed hath a collar or other mark put upon him and goes and returns at his pleasure or if a wild swan is taken and marked and turned loose in the river the owners property in him still continues and it is not lawful for any one else to take himl but otherwise if the deer has been long absent without returning or the swan leaves the neighbourhood bees also are feræ naturæ but when hived and reclaimed a man may have a qualified property in them by the law of nature as well as by the civil lawm      and to the same purpose not to say in the same words with the civil law speaks bractonn occupation that is hiving or including them gives the property in bees for though a swarm lights upon my tree i have no more property in them till i have hived them than i have in the birds which make their nests thereon and therefore if another hives them he shall be their proprietor but a swarm which fly from and out of my hive are mine so long as i can keep them in sight and have power to pursue them and in these circumstances no one else is entitled to take them but it hath been also saido that with us the only ownership in bees is ratione soli and the charter of the forestp which allows every freeman to be entitled to the honey found within his own woods affords great countenance to this doctrine that a qualified property may be had in bees in consideration of the property of the soil whereon they are found      in all these creatures reclaimed from the wildness of their nature the property is not absolute but defeasible a property that may be destroyed if they resume their antient wildness and are found at large for if the pheasants escape from the mew or the fishes from the trunk and are seen wandering at large in their proper element they become feræ naturæ again and are free and open to the first occupant that hath ability to seize them but while they thus continue my qualified or defeasible property they are as much under the protection of the law as if they were absolutely and indefeasibly mine and an action will lie against any man that detains them from me or unlawfully destroys them it is also as much felony by common law to steal such of them as are fit for food  as it is to steal tame animalsq but not so if they are only kept for pleasure curiosity or whim as dogs bears cats apes parrots and singingbirdsr because their value is not intrinsic but depending only on the caprice of the owners though it is such an invasion of property as may      amount to a civil injury and be redressed by a civil actiont yet to steal a reclaimed hawk is felony both by common law and statuteu which seems to be a relic of the tyranny of our antient sportsmen and among our elder ancestors the antient britons another species of reclaimed animals viz cats were looked upon as creatures of intrinsic value and the killing or stealing one was a grievous crime and subjected the offender to a fine especially if it belonged to the kings household and was the custos horrei regii for which     there was a very peculiar forfeiturew  and thus much of qualified property in wild animals reclaimed per industriam   a qualified property may also subsist with relation to animals feræ naturæ ratione impotentiæ on account of their own inability as when hawks herons or other birds build in my trees or coneys or other creatures make their nests or burrows in my land and have young ones there i have a qualified property in those young ones till such time as they can fly or run away and then my property expiresx but till then it is in some cases trespass and in others felony for a stranger to take them awayy for here as the owner of the land has it in his power to do what he pleases with them the law therefore vests a property in him of the young ones in the same manner as it does of the old ones if reclaimed and confined for these cannot through weakness any more than the others through restraint use their natural liberty and forsake him   a man may lastly have a qualified property in animals feræ naturæ propter privilegium that is he may have the privilege of hunting taking and killing them in      exclusion of other persons here he has a transient property in these animals usually called game so long as they continue within his libertyz and may restrain any stranger from taking them therein but the instant they depart into another liberty this qualified property ceases the manner in which the privilege is acquired will be shown in a subsequent chapter the qualified property which we have hitherto considered extends only to animals feræ naturæ when either reclaimed impotent or privileged many other things may also be the objects of qualified property it may subsist in the very elements of fire or light of air and of water a man can have no absolute permanent property in these as he may in the earth and land since these are of a vague and fugitive nature and therefore can admit only of a precarious and qualified ownership which lasts so long as they are in actual use and occupation but no longer if a man disturbs another and deprives him of the lawful enjoyment of these if one obstructs anothers antient windowsa corrupts the air of his house or gardensb fouls his waterc or unpens and lets it out or if he diverts an antient watercourse that used to run to the others mill or meadowd the law will animadvert hereon as an injury and protect the party injured in his possession but the property in them ceases the instant they are out of possession for when no man is engaged in their actual occupation they become again common and every man has an equal right to appropriate them to his own use these kinds of qualification in property depend upon the peculiar circumstances of the subjectmatter which is not capable of being under the absolute dominion of any proprietor but property may also be of a qualified or special nature on account of the peculiar circumstances of the owner when the thing itself is very capable of absolute ownership      as in case of bailment or delivery of goods to another person for a particular use as to a carrier to convey to london to an innkeeper to secure in his inn or the like here there is no absolute property in either the bailor or the bailee the person delivering or him to whom it is delivered for the bailor hath only the right and not the immediate possession the bailee hath the possession and only a temporary right but it is a qualified property in them both and each of them     is entitled to an action in case the goods be damaged or taken away the bailee on account of his immediate possession the bailor because the possession of the bailee is immediately his possession alsoe so also in case of goods pledged or pawned upon condition either to repay money or otherwise both the pledger and pledgee have a qualified but neither of them an absolute property in them the pledgers property is conditional and depends upon the performance of the condition of repayment c and so too is that of the pledgee which depends upon its nonperformancef the same may be said of goods distreined for rent or other cause of distress which are in the nature of a pledge and are not at the first taking the absolute property of either the distreinor or party distreined upon but may be redeemed or else forfeited by the subsequent conduct of the latter but a servant who hath the care of his masters goods or chattels as a butler of plate a shepherd of sheep and the like hath not any property or possession either absolute or qualified but only a mere charge or oversightg having thus considered the several divisions of property in possession which subsists there only where a man hath both the right and also the occupation of the thing we will proceed next to take a short view of the nature of property in action or such where a man hath not the occupation but merely a bare right to occupy the thing in question the possession whereof may however be recovered by a suit or action at law from whence the thing so recoverable is called      a thing or chose in actionh thus money due on a bond is a chose in action for a property in the debt vests at the time of forfeiture mentioned in the obligation but there is no possession till recovered by course of law if a man promises or covenants with me to do any act and fails in it whereby i suffer damage the recompense for this damage is a chose in action for though a right to some recompense vests in me at the time of damage done yet what and how large such recompense shall be can only be ascertained by verdict and the possession can only be given me by legal judgment and execution in the former of these cases the student will observe that the property or right of action depends upon an express contract or obligation to pay a stated sum and in the latter it depends upon an implied contract that if the covenantor does not perform the act he engaged to do he shall pay me the damages i sustain by this breach of covenant and hence it may be collected that all property in action depends entirely upon contracts either express or implied which are the only regular means of acquiring a chose in action and of the nature of which we shall discourse at large in a subsequent chapter  at present we have only to remark that upon all contracts or promises either express or implied and the infinite variety of cases into which they are and may be spun out the law gives an action of some sort or other to the party injured in case of nonperformance to compel the wrongdoer to do justice to the party with whom he has contracted and on failure of performing the identical thing he engaged to do to render a satisfaction equivalent to the damage sustained but while the thing or its equivalent remains in suspense and the     injured party has only the right and not the occupation it is called a chose in action being a thing rather in potentia than in esse though the owner may have as      absolute a property in and be as well entitled to such things in action as to things in possession and having thus distinguished the different degree or quantity of dominion or property to which things personal are subject we may add a word or two concerning the time of their enjoyment and the number of their owners in conformity to the method before observed in treating of the property of things real first as to the time of enjoyment by the rules of the antient common law there could be no future property to take place in expectancy created in personal goods and chattels because being things transitory and by many accidents subject to be lost destroyed or otherwise impaired and the exigencies of trade requiring also a frequent circulation thereof it would occasion perpetual suits and quarrels and put a stop to the freedom of commerce if such limitations in remainder were generally tolerated and allowed but yet in last wills and testaments such limitations of personal goods and chattels in remainder after a bequest for life were permittedi though originally that indulgence was only shown when merely the use of the goods and not the goods themselves was given to the first legateek the property being supposed to continue all the time in the executor of the devisor but now that distinction is disregardedl and therefore if a man either by deed or will limits his books or furniture to a for life with remainder over to b this remainder is good but where an estatetail in things personal is given to the first or any subsequent possessor it vests in him the total property and no remainder over shall be permitted on such a limitationm for this if allowed would tend to a perpetuity as the devisee or grantee in tail of a chattel has no method of barring the entail and therefore the law vests in him at once the entire dominion of goods being analogous to the feesimple which a tenant in tail may acquire in a real estate       next as to the number of owners  things personal may belong to their owners not only in severalty but also in jointtenancy and in     common as well as real estates they cannot indeed be vested in coparcenary because they do not descend from the ancestor to the heir which is necessary to constitute coparceners but if a horse or other personal chattel be given to two or more absolutely they are jointtenants hereof and unless the jointure be severed the same doctrine of survivorship shall take place as in estates of lands and tenementsn and in like manner if the jointure be severed as by either of them selling his share the vendee and the remaining partowner shall be tenants in common without any jus accrescendi or survivorshipo so also if  00l be given by will to two or more equally to be divided between them this makes them tenants in commonp as we have formerly seenq the same words would have done in regard to real estates but for the encouragement of husbandry and trade it is held that a stock on a farm though occupied jointly and also a stock used in a joint undertaking by way of partnership in trade shall always be considered as common and not as joint property and there shall be no survivorship thereinr 0  00 chapter xxvi of title to things personal by occupancy we are next to consider the title to things personal or the various means of acquiring and of losing such property as may be had therein both which considerations of gain and loss shall be blended together in one and the same view as was done in our observations upon real property since it is for the most part impossible to contemplate the one without contemplating the other also and these methods of acquisition or loss are principally twelve—  by occupancy   by prerogative   by forfeiture   by custom   by succession   by marriage   by judgment   by gift or grant   by contract  0 by bankruptcy    by testament    by administration and first a property in goods and chattels may be acquired by occupancy which we have more than once remarkeda was the original and only primitive method of acquiring any property at all but which has since been restrained and abridged by the positive laws of society in order to maintain peace and harmony among mankind for this purpose by the laws of england gifts and contracts testaments legacies and administrations have been introduced and countenanced in order to transfer and continue that property and possession in things personal which has once been acquired by the owner and where such   0  things are found without any other owner they for the most part belong to the king by virtue of his prerogative except in some few instances wherein the original and natural right of occupancy is still permitted to subsist and which we are now to consider   thus in the first place it hath been said that anybody may seize to his own use such goods as belong to an alien enemyb  for such enemies not being looked upon as members of our society are not entitled during their state of enmity to the benefit or protection of the laws and therefore every man that has opportunity is permitted to seize upon their chattels without being compelled as in other cases to make restitution or satisfaction to the owner but this however generally laid down by some of our writers must in reason and justice be restrained to such captors as are authorized by the public authority or the state residing in the crownc and to such goods as are brought into this country by an alien enemy after a declaration of war without a safeconduct or passport and therefore it hath been holdend that where a foreigner is resident in england and afterwards a war breaks out between his country and ours his goods are not liable to be seized  it hath also been adjudged that if an enemy take the goods of an englishman which are afterwards retaken by another subject of this kingdom the former owner shall lose his property therein and it shall be indefeasibly vested in the second taker unless they were retaken the same day and the owner before sunset puts in his claim of propertye which is agreeable to the law of nations as understood in the  0  time of grotiusf even with regard to captures made at sea which were held to be the property of the captors after a possession of twentyfour hours though the modern authoritiesg require that before the property can   0  be changed the goods must have been brought into port and have continued a night intra presidia in a place of safe custody so that all hope of recovering them was lost  and as in the goods of an enemy so also in his person a man may acquire a sort of qualified property by taking him a prisoner in warh at least till his ransom be paidi  and this doctrine seems to have been extended to negroservantsj who are purchased when captives of the nations with whom they are at war and are therefore supposed to continue in some degree the property of the masters who buy them though accurately speaking that property if it indeed continues consists rather in the perpetual service than in the body or person of the captivesk   thus again whatever movables are found upon the surface of the earth or in the sea and are unclaimed by any owner are supposed to be abandoned by the last proprietor and as such are returned into the common stock and mass of things and therefore they belong as in a state of nature to the first occupant or fortunate finder unless they fall within the description of waifs or estrays  0  or wreck or hidden treasure for these we have formerly seenl are vested by law in the king and form a part of the ordinary revenue of the crown    thus too the benefit of the elements the light the air and the water can only be appropriated by occupancy if i have an antient window  overlooking my neighbours ground he may not erect any blind to obstruct the light but if i build my house close to his wall which darkens it i cannot compel him to demolish his wall for there the first occupancy is rather in him than in me  0  if my neighbour   0  makes a tanyard so as to annoy and render less salubrious the air of my house or garden the law will furnish me with a remedy but if he is first in possession of the air and i fix my habitation near him the nuisance is of my own seeking and may continue if a stream be unoccupied i may erect a mill thereon and detain the water yet not so as to injure my neighbours prior mill or his meadow for he hath by the first occupancy acquired a property in the current    with regard likewise to animals feræ naturæ all mankind had by the original grant of the creator a right to pursue and take any fowl or insect of the air any fish or inhabitants of the waters and any beast or reptile of the field and this natural right still continues in every individual unless where it is restrained by the civil laws of the country and when a man has once so seized them they become while living his qualified property or if dead are absolutely his own so that to steal them or otherwise invade this property is according to their respective values sometimes a criminal offence sometimes only a civil injury the restrictions which are laid upon this right by the laws of england relate principally to royal fish as whale and sturgeon and such terrestrial aerial or aquatic animals as go under the denomination of game the taking of which is made the exclusive right of the prince and such of his subjects to whom he has granted the same royal privilege but those animals which are not expressly so reserved are still liable to be taken and appropriated by any of the kings subjects upon their own territories in the same manner as they might have taken even game itself till these civil prohibitions were issued there being in nature no distinction between one species of wild animals and another between the right of acquiring property in a hare or a squirrel in a partridge or a butterfly but the difference at present made arises merely from the positive municipal law   to this principle of occupancy also must be referred the method of acquiring a special personal property in corn growing on the ground or other emblements  by any possessor   0  of the land who hath sown or planted it whether he be owner of the inheritance or of a less estate which emblements are distinct from the real estate in the land and subject to many though not all  0  the incidents attending personal chattels they were devisable by testaments before the statute of willsm and at the death of the owner shall vest in his executor and not his heir they are forfeitable by outlawry in a personal actionn and by the statute    geo ii c    though not by the common lawo they may be distreined for rent arrere  the reason for admitting the acquisition of this special property by tenants who have temporary interests was formerly givenp and it was extended to tenants in fee principally for the benefit of their creditors and therefore though the emblements are assets in the hands of the executor are forfeitable upon outlawry and distreinable for rent they are not in other respects considered as personal chattels and particularly they are not the object of larceny before they are severed from the groundq   the doctrine of property arising from accession is also grounded on the right of occupancy by the roman law if any given corporeal substance received afterwards an accession by natural or by artificial means as by the growth of vegetables the pregnancy of animals the embroidering of cloth or the conversion of wood or metal into vessels and utensils the original owner of the thing was entitled by his right of possession to the property of it under such its state of improvementr but if the thing itself by such operation was changed into a different species as by making wine oil or bread out of anothers grapes olives or wheat it belonged to the new operator who was only to make a satisfaction to the former proprietor for the materials which he had so converteds 0 and these doctrines are implicitly copied and adopted by our bractont and have since been   0  confirmed by many resolutions of the courtsu it hath even been held that if one takes away and clothes anothers  0  wife or son and afterwards they return home the garments shall cease to be his property who provided them being annexed to the person of the child or womanw   but in the case of confusion of goods where those of two persons are so intermixed that the several portions can be no longer distinguished the english law partly agrees with and partly differs from the civil if the intermixture be by consent i apprehend that in both laws the proprietors have an interest in common in proportion to their respective sharesx but if one wilfully intermixes his money corn or hay with that of another man without his approbation or knowledge or casts gold in like manner into anothers meltingpot or crucible the civil law though it gives the sole property of the whole to him who has not interfered in the mixture yet allows a satisfaction to the other for what he has so improvidently losty but our law to guard against fraud gives the entire property without any account to him whose original dominion is invaded and endeavoured to be rendered uncertain without his own consentz     there is still another species of property which if it subsists by the common law being grounded on labour and invention is more properly reducible to the head of occupancy than any other since the right of occupancy itself is supposed by mr lockea and many othersb to be founded on the personal labour of the occupant   and this is the right which an author may be supposed to have in his own original literary composition so that no other person without his leave may publish or make profit of the copies when a man by the exertion of his rational powers has produced an original work he seems to have clearly a   0  right to dispose of that identical work as he pleases and any attempt to vary the disposition he has made of it appears to be an invasion of that right now the identity of a literary composition consists entirely in the sentiment and the language the same conceptions clothed in the same words must necessarily be the same composition and whatever method be taken of exhibiting that composition to the ear or the eye of another by recital by writing or by printing in any number of copies or at any period of time it is always the identical work of the author which is so exhibited and no other man it hath been thought can have a right to exhibit it especially for profit without the authors consent this consent may perhaps be tacitly given to all  0  mankind when an author suffers his work to be published by another hand without any claim or reserve of right and without stamping on it any marks of ownership it being then a present to the public like building a church or bridge or laying out a new highway but in case the author sells a single book or totally grants the copyright it hath been supposed in the one case that the buyer hath no more right to multiply copies of that book for sale than he hath to imitate for the like purpose the ticket which is bought for admission to an opera or a concert and that in the other the whole property with all its exclusive rights is perpetually transferred to the grantee on the other hand it is urged that though the exclusive property of the manuscript and all which it contains undoubtedly belongs to the author before it is printed or published yet from the instant of publication the exclusive right of an author or his assigns to the sole communication of his ideas immediately vanishes and evaporates as being a right of too subtle and substantial a nature to become the subject of property at the common law and only capable of being guarded by positive statutes and special provisions of the magistrate the roman law adjudged that if one man wrote any thing on the paper or parchment of another the writing should belong to the owner of the blank materialsc meaning thereby the mechanical operation of writing for which it directed the   0  scribe to receive a satisfaction for in works of genius and invention as in painting on another mans canvas the same lawd gave the canvas to the painter as to any other property in the works of the understanding the law is silent though the sale of literary copies for the purposes of recital or multiplication is certainly as antient as the times of terencee martialf and statiusg neither with us in england hath there been till very lately any finalh determination upon the right of authors at the common law    0  but whatever inherent copyright might have been supposed to subsist by the common law the statute   anne c    amended by statute    geo iii c    hath now declared that the author and his assigns shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting his works for the term of fourteen years and no longeri and hath also protected that property by additional penalties and forfeitures directing further that if at the end of that term the author himself be living the right shall then return to him for another term of the same duration   and a similar privilege is extended to the inventors of prints and engravings  0  for the term of eightandtwenty years by the statutes   geo ii c    and   geo iii c    besides an action for damages with double costs by statute    geo iii c    all which parliamentary protections appear to have been suggested by the exception in the statute of monopolies    jac i c    0  which allows a royal patent of privilege to be granted for fourteen years to any inventor of a new manufacture for the sole working or making of the same by  0  virtue whereof it is held that a temporary property therein becomes vested in the kings patenteek    0  chapter xxvii of title by prerogative and forfeiture a second method of acquiring property in personal chattels is by the kings prerogative whereby a right may accrue either to the crown itself or to such as claim under the title of the crown as by the kings grant or by prescription which supposes an antient grant such in the first place are all tributes taxes and customs whether constitutionally inherent in the crown as flowers of the prerogative and branches of the census regalis or antient royal revenue or whether they be occasionally created by authority of parliament of both which species of revenue we treated largely in the former book in these the king acquires and the subject loses a property the instant they become due if paid they are a chose in possession if unpaid a chose in action hither also may be referred all forfeitures fines and amercements due to the king which accrue by virtue of his antient prerogative or by particular modern statutes which revenues created by statute do always assimilate or take the same nature with the antient revenues and may therefore be looked upon as arising from a kind of artificial or secondary prerogative and in either case the owner of the thing forfeited and the person fined or amerced lose and part with the property of the forfeiture fine or amercement the instant the king or his grantee acquires it   0  in these several methods of acquiring property by prerogative there is also this peculiar quality that the king cannot have a joint property with any person in one entire chattel or such a one as is not capable of division or separation but where the titles of the king and a subject concur the king shall have the whole in like manner as the king cannot either by grant or contract become a jointtenant of a chattel real with another persona but by such grant or contract shall become entitled to the whole in severalty thus if a horse be given to the king and a private person the king shall have the sole property if a bond be made to the king and a subject the king shall have the whole penalty the debt or duty being one single chattelb and so if two persons have the property of a horse between them or have a joint debt owing them on bond and one of them assigns his part to the king or is attainted whereby his moiety is forfeited to the crown the king shall have the entire horse and entire debtc for as it is not consistent with the dignity of the crown to be partner with a subject so neither does the king ever lose his right  0  in any instance but where they interfere his is always preferred to that of another persond from which two principles it is a necessary consequence that the innocent though unfortunate partner must lose his share in both the debt and the horse or in any other chattel in the same circumstance  this doctrine has no opportunity to take place in certain other instances of title by prerogative that remain to be mentioned as the chattels thereby vested are originally and solely vested in the crown without any transfer or derivative assignment either by deed or law from any former proprietor such is the acquisition of property in wreck in treasuretrove in waifs in estrays in royal fish in swans and the    0 like which are not transferred to the sovereign from any former owner but are originally inherent in him by the rules of law and are derived to particular subjects as royal franchises by his bounty these are ascribed to him partly upon the particular reasons mentioned in the eighth chapter of the former book and partly upon the general principle of their being bona vacantia and therefore vested in the king as well to preserve the peace of the public as in trust to employ them for the safety and ornament of the commonwealth there is also a kind of prerogative copyright subsisting in certain books which is held to be vested in the crown upon different reasons thus   the king as the executive magistrate has the right of promulgating to the people all acts of state and government this gives him the exclusive privilege of printing at his own press or that of his grantees all acts of parliament proclamations and orders of council   as supreme head of the church he hath a right to the publication of all liturgies and books of divine service   he is also said to have a right by purchase to the copies of such lawbooks grammars and other compositions as were compiled or translated at the expense of the crown and upon these two last principles combined the exclusive right of printing the translation of the bible is founded  there still remains another species of prerogative property founded upon a very different principle from any that have been mentioned before the property of such animals feræ naturæ as are known by the denomination of game with the right of pursuing taking and destroying them which is vested in the king alone and from him derived to such of his subjects as have received the grants of a chase a park a free warren or free fishery this may lead us into an   0 inquiry concerning the original of these franchises or royalties on which we touched a little in a former chapterf the      right itself being an incorporeal hereditament though the fruits and profits of it are of a personal nature in the first place then we have already shown and indeed it cannot be denied that by the law of nature every man from the prince to the peasant has an equal right of pursuing and taking to his own use all such creatures as are feræ naturæ and therefore the property of nobody but liable to be seized by the first occupant and so it was held by the imperial law even so late as justinians time—feræ igitur bestiæ et volucres et omnia animalia quæ mari cælo et terra nascuntur simul atque ab aliquo capta fuerint jure gentium statim illius esse incipiunt quod enim nullius est id naturali ratione occupanti concediturg but it follows from the very end and constitution of society that this natural right as well as many others belonging to man as an individual may be restrained by positive laws enacted for reasons of state or for the supposed benefit of the community this restriction may be either with respect to the place in which this right may or may not be exercised with respect to the animals that are the subject of this right or with respect to the persons allowed or forbidden to exercise it and in consequence of this authority we find that the municipal laws of many nations have exerted such power of restraint have in general forbidden the entering on another mans grounds for any cause without the owners leave have extended their protection to such particular animals as are usually the objects of pursuit and have invested the prerogative of hunting and taking such animals in the sovereign of the state only and such as he shall authorizeh many reasons have concurred for making these constitutions as   for the encouragement of agriculture and improvement of lands by giving every man an exclusive dominion over his own soil   for preservation of the several species of these animals which would soon be extirpated by general liberty   for prevention of idleness and dissipation in husbandmen artificers and      others of lower rank which would be the unavoidable consequence of universal license   for prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to the government by disarming the bulk of the peoplei which last is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of forest or game laws  nor certainly in these prohibitions is there any natural injustice as some have weakly enough supposed since as puffendorff observes the law does not hereby take from any man his present property or what was already his own but barely abridges him of one means of acquiring a future property that of occupancy which indeed the law of nature would allow him but of which the laws of society have in most instances very justly and reasonably deprived him yet however defensible these provisions in general may be on the footing of reason or justice or civil policy we must notwithstanding acknowledge that in their present shape they owe their immediate original to slavery it is not till after the irruption of the northern nations into the roman empire that we read of any other prohibitions than that natural one of not sporting on any private grounds without the owners leave and another of a more spiritual nature which was rather a rule of ecclesiastical discipline than a branch of municipal law the roman or civil law though it knew no restriction as to persons or animals so far regarded the article of place that it allowed no man to hunt or sport upon anothers ground but by consent of the owner of the soil qui alienum fundum ingreditur venandi aut aucupandi gratiâ potest a domino prohiberi     ne ingrediaturk for if there can by the law of nature be any inchoate imperfect property supposed in wild animals before they are taken it seems most reasonable to fix it in him upon whose land they are found and as to the other restriction which relates to persons and not to place the pontifical or canon lawl interdicts venationes et sylvaticas vagationes cum canibus et accipitribus to all clergymen without distinction grounded on      a saying of st jeromem that it never is recorded that these diversions were used by the saints or primitive fathers and the canons of our saxon church published in the reign of king edgarn concur in the same prohibition though our secular laws at least after the conquest did even in the times of popery dispense with this canonical impediment and spiritual persons were allowed by the common law to hunt for their recreation in order to render them fitter for the performance of their duty as a confirmation whereof we may observe that it is to this day a branch of the kings prerogative at the death of every bishop to have his kennel of hounds or a composition in lieu thereofo  but with regard to the rise and original of our present civil prohibitions it will be found that all forest and game laws were introduced into europe at the same time and by the same policy as gave birth to the feodal system when those swarms of barbarians issued from their northern hive and laid the foundation of most of the present kingdoms of europe on the ruins of the western empire for when a conquering general came to settle the economy of a vanquished country and to part it out among his soldiers or feudatories who were to render him military service for such donations it behooved him in order to secure his new acquisitions to keep the rustici or natives of the country and all who were not his military tenants in as low a condition as possible and especially to prohibit them the use of arms nothing could do this more effectually than a prohibition of hunting and sporting and therefore it was the policy of the conqueror to reserve this right to himself and such on whom he should bestow it which were only his capital feudatories or greater barons and accordingly we find in the feudal constitutionsp one and the same law prohibiting the rustici in general from carrying arms and also proscribing the use of nets snares or other engines for destroying the game      this exclusive privilege well suited the martial genius of the conquering troops who delighted in a sportq which in its pursuit and slaughter bore some resemblance to war vita omnis says cæsar speaking of the antient germans in venationibus atque in studiis rei militaris consistitr and tacitus in like manner observes that quoties bella non ineunt multum venatibus plus per otium transigunts and indeed like some of their modern successors they had no other amusement to entertain their vacant hours despising all arts as effeminate and having no other learning than was couched in such rude ditties as were sung at the solemn carousals which succeeded these antient huntings and it is remarkable that in those nations where the feodal policy remains the most uncorrupted the forest or game laws continue in their highest rigour in france     all game is properly the kings  and in some parts of germany it is death for a peasant to be found hunting in the woods of the nobilityt with us in england also hunting has ever been esteemed a most princely diversion and exercise the whole island was replenished with all sorts of game in the time of the britons who lived in a wild and pastoral manner without enclosing or improving their grounds and derived much of their subsistence from the chase which they all enjoyed in common but when husbandry took place under the saxon government and lands began to be cultivated improved and enclosed the beasts naturally fled into the woody and desert tracts which were called the forests and having never been disposed of in the first distribution of lands were therefore held to belong to the crown these were filled with great plenty of game which our royal sportsmen reserved for their own diversion on pain of a pecuniary      forfeiture for such as interfered with their sovereign but every freeholder had the full liberty of sporting upon his own territories provided he abstained from the kings forests as is fully expressed in the laws of canuteu and of edward the confessorv sit quilibet homo dignus venatione sua in sylva et in agris sibi propriis et in dominio suo et abstineat omnis homo a venariis regiis ubicunque pacem eis habere voluerit which indeed was the antient law of the scandinavian continent from whence canute probably derived it cuique enim in proprio fundo quamlibet feram quoquo modo venari permissumw however upon the norman conquest a new doctrine took place and the right of pursuing and taking all beasts of chase or venary and such other animals as were accounted game was then held to belong to the king or to such only as were authorized under him and this as well upon the principles of the feodal law that the king is the ultimate proprietor of all the lands in the kingdom they being all held of him as the chief lord or lord paramount of the fee and that therefore he has the right of the universal soil to enter thereon and to chase and take such creatures at his pleasure as also upon another maxim of the common law which we have frequently cited and illustrated that these animals are bona vacantia and having no other owner belong to the king by his prerogative as therefore the former reason was held to vest in the king a right to pursue and take them anywhere the latter was supposed to give the king and such as he should authorize a sole and exclusive right this right thus newly vested in the crown was exerted with the utmost rigour at and after the time of the norman establishment not only in the antient forests but in the new ones which the conqueror made by laying together vast      tracts of country depopulated for that purpose and reserved solely for the kings royal diversion in which were exercised the most horrid tyrannies and oppressions under colour of forest law for the sake of preserving the beasts of chase to kill any of which within the limits of the forest was as penal as the death of a man and in pursuance of the same principle king john laid a total interdict upon the winged as well as the fourfooted creation capturam avium per totam angliam interdixitx the cruel and insupportable hardships which those forest laws created to the subject occasioned our ancestors to be as jealous for their reformation as for the relaxation of the feodal rigours and the other exactions introduced by the norman family and accordingly we find the immunities of carta de foresta as warmly contended for and extorted from the king with as much difficulty as those of magna carta itself by this charter confirmed in parliamenty many forests were disafforested or stripped of their oppressive privileges and regulations     were made in the regimen of such as remained particularlyz killing the kings deer was made no longer a capital offence but only punished by a fine imprisonment or abjuration of the realm and by a variety of subsequent statutes together with the long acquiescence of the crown without exerting the forest laws this prerogative is now become no longer a grievance to the subject but as the king reserved to himself the forests for his own exclusive diversion so he granted out from time to time other tracts of lands to his subjects under the names of chases or parksa or gave them license to make such in their own grounds which indeed are smaller forests in the hands of a subject but not governed by the forest laws and by the common law no person is at liberty to take or kill any beasts of chase but such as hath an antient chase or park unless they be also beasts of prey      as to all inferior species of game called beasts and fowls of warren the liberty of taking or killing them is another franchise of royalty derived likewise from the crown and called free warren a word which signifies preservation or custody as the exclusive liberty of taking and killing fish in a public stream or river is called a free fishery of which however no new franchise can at present be granted by the express provision of magna carta c   b the principal intention of granting to any one these franchises or liberties was in order to protect the game by giving the grantee a sole and exclusive power of killing it himself provided he prevented other persons and no man but he who has a chase or free warren by grant from the crown or prescription which supposes one can justify hunting or sporting upon another mans soil nor indeed in thorough strictness of common law either hunting or sporting at all however novel this doctrine may seem to such as call themselves qualified sportsmen it is a regular consequence from what has been before delivered that the sole right of taking and destroying game belongs exclusively to the king this appears as well from the historical deduction here made as because he may grant to his subjects an exclusive right of taking them which he could not do unless such a right was first inherent in himself and hence it will follow that no person whatever but he who has such derivative right from the crown is by common law entitled to take or kill any beasts of chase or other game whatsoever it is true that by the acquiescence of the crown the frequent grants of free warren in antient times and the introduction of new penalties of late by certain statutes for preserving the game this exclusive prerogative of the king is little known or considered every man that is exempted from these modern penalties looking upon himself as at liberty to do what he pleases with the game whereas the contrary is strictly true that no man however well qualified he      may vulgarly be esteemed has a right to encroach on the royal prerogative by the killing of game unless he can show a particular grant of free warren or a prescription which presumes a grant or some authority under an act of parliament as for the latter i recollect but two instances wherein an express permission to kill game was ever given by statute the one by   jac i cap    altered by   jac i cap    and virtually repealed by        car ii c    which gave authority so long as they remained in force to the owners of free warren to lords of manors and to all freeholders having  0l per annum in lands of inheritance or  0l for life or lives or  00l personal estate and their servants to take partridges and pheasants upon their own or their masters free warren inheritance or freehold  the other by   anne c    which     empowers lords and ladies of manors to appoint gamekeepers to kill game for the use of such lord or lady which with some alteration still subsists and plainly supposes such power not to have been in them before the truth of the matter is that these game laws of which we shall have occasion to speak again in the fourth book of these commentaries do indeed qualify nobody except in the instance of a gamekeeper to kill game but only to save the trouble and formal process of an action by the person injured who perhaps too might remit the offence these statutes inflict additional penalties to be recovered either in a regular or summary way by any of the kings subjects from certain persons of inferior rank who may be found offending in this particular but it does not follow that persons excused from these additional penalties are therefore authorized to kill game the circumstance of having  00l per annum and the rest are not properly qualifications but exemptions and these persons so exempted from the penalties of the game statutes are not only liable to actions of trespass by the owners of the land but also if they kill game within the limits of any royal franchise they are liable to the actions of such who may have the right of chase or free warren therein       upon the whole it appears that the king by his prerogative and such persons as have under his authority the royal franchises of chase park free warren or free fishery are the only persons who may acquire any property however fugitive and transitory in these animals feræ naturæ while living which is said to be vested in them as was observed in a former chapter propter privilegium  and it must also be remembered that such persons as may     thus lawfully hunt fish or fowl ratione privilegii have as has been said only a qualified property in these animals it not being absolute or permanent but lasting only so long as the creatures remain within the limits of such respective franchise or liberty and ceasing the instant they voluntarily pass out of it it is held indeed that if a man starts any game within his own grounds and follows it into anothers and kills it there the property remains in himselfc and this is grounded on reason and natural justiced for the property consists in the possession which possession commences by the finding it in his own liberty and is continued by the immediate pursuit and so if a stranger starts game in one mans chase or free warren and hunts it into another liberty the property continues in the owner of the chase or warren this property arising from privilegee and not being changed by the act of a mere stranger or if a man starts game on anothers private grounds and kills it there the property belongs to him in whose ground it was killed because it was also started theref the property arising ratione soli whereas if after being started there it is killed in the grounds of a third person the property belongs not to the owner of the first ground because the property is local nor yet to the owner of the second because it was not started in his soil but it vests in the person who started and killed itg though guilty of a trespass against both the owners     0 iii i proceed now to a third method whereby a title to goods and chattels may be acquired and lost viz by forfeiture as a punishment for some crime or misdemesnor in the party forfeiting and as a compensation for the offence and injury committed against him to whom they are forfeited of forfeitures considered as the means whereby real property might be lost and acquired we treated in a former chapterh it remains therefore in this place only to mention by what means or for what offences goods and chattels become liable to forfeiture in the variety of penal laws with which the subject is at present encumbered it were a tedious and impracticable task to reckon up the various forfeitures inflicted by special statutes for particular crimes and misdemesnors some of which are mala in se or offences against the divine law either natural or revealed but by far the greatest part are mala prohibita or such as derive their guilt merely from their prohibition by the laws of the land such as is the forfeiture of  0s per month by the statute   eliz c   for exercising a trade without having served seven years as an apprentice thereto 0 and the forfeiture of  0l by   anne c      for printing an almanac without a stamp i shall therefore confine myself to those offences only by which all the goods and chattels of the offender are forfeited referring the student for such where pecuniary mulcts of different quantities are inflicted to their several proper heads under which very many of them have been or will be mentioned or else to the collections of hawkins and burn and other laborious compilers indeed as most of these forfeitures belong to the crown they may seem as if they ought to have been referred to the preceding method of acquiring personal property   0 namely by prerogative but as in the instance of partial forfeitures a moiety often goes to the informer the poor or sometimes to other persons and as one total forfeiture namely that by a bankrupt who is guilty of felony by      concealing his effects accrues entirely to his creditors i have therefore made it a distinct head of transferring property goods and chattels then are totally forfeited by conviction of high treason or misprision of treason of petit treason of felony in general and particularly of felony de se and of manslaughter nay even by conviction of excusable homicidei by outlawry for treason or felony by conviction of petit larceny by flight in treason or felony even though the party be acquitted of the fact by standing mute when arraigned of felony by drawing a weapon on a judge or striking any one in the presence of the kings courts by præmunire by pretended prophecies upon a second conviction by owling by the residing abroad of artificers   and by challenging to fight on account of money won at gaming all these offences as will more fully appear in the fourth book of these commentaries induce a total forfeiture of goods and chattels and this forfeiture commences from the time of conviction not the time of committing the fact as in forfeitures of real property for chattels are of so vague and fluctuating a nature that to affect them by any relation back would be attended with more inconvenience than in the case of landed estates and part if not the whole of them must be expended in maintaining the delinquent between the time of committing the fact and his conviction yet a fraudulent conveyance of them to defeat the interest of the crown is made void by statute    eliz c     chapter xxviii of title by custom a fourth method of acquiring property in things personal or chattels is by custom whereby a right vests in some particular persons either by the local usage of some particular place or by the almost general and universal usage of the kingdom it were endless should i attempt to enumerate all the several kinds of special customs which may entitle a man to a chattel interest in different parts of the kingdom i shall therefore content myself with making some observations on three sorts of customary interests which obtain pretty generally throughout most parts of the nation and are therefore of more universal concern viz heriots mortuaries and heirlooms   heriots  which were slightly touched upon in a former chaptera are     usually divided into two sorts heriotservice and heriotcustom the former are such as are due upon a special reservation in a grant or lease of lands and there fore amount to little more than a mere rentb the latter arise upon no special reservation whatsoever but depend merely upon immemorial usage and customc of these therefore we are here principally to speak and they are defined to be a customary tribute of goods and chattels payable to the lord of the fee on the decease of the owner of the land      the first establishment if not introduction of compulsory heriots into england was by the danes and we find in the laws of king canuted the several heregeates or heriots specified which were then exacted by the king on the death of divers of his subjects according to their respective dignities from the highest eorle down to the most inferior thegne or land holder these for the most part consisted in arms horses and habiliments of war which the word itself according to sir henry spelmane signifies these were delivered up to the sovereign on the death of the vassal who could no longer use them to be put into other hands for the service and defence of the country and upon the plan of this danish establishment did william the conqueror fashion his law of relief as was formerly observedf when he ascertained the precise relief to be taken of every tenant in chivalry and contrary to the feodal custom and the usage of his own duchy of normandy required arms and implements of war to be paid instead of moneyg the danish compulsive heriots being thus transmuted into reliefs underwent the same several vicissitudes as the feodal tenures and in socage estates do frequently remain to this day in the shape of a double rent payable at the death of the tenant the heriots which now continue among us and preserve that name seeming rather to be of saxon parentage and at first to have been merely discretionaryh these are now for the most part confined to copyhold tenures and are due by custom only which is the life of all estates by copy and perhaps are the only instance where custom has favoured the lord for this payment was originally a voluntary donation or gratuitous legacy of the tenant perhaps in acknowledgment of his having been raised a degree above villeinage when all his goods and chattels were quite at the mercy of the lord and      custom which has on the one hand confirmed the tenants interest in exclusion of the lords will has on the other hand established this discretional piece of gratitude into a permanent duty an heriot may also appertain to free land that is held by service and suit of court in which case it is most commonly a copyhold enfranchised whereupon the heroit is still due by custom bractoni speaks of heriots as frequently due on the death of both species of tenants—est quidem alia præstatio quæ nominatur heriettum ubi tenens liber vel servus in morte sua dominum suum de quo tenuerit respicit de meliori averio suo vel de secundo meliori secundum diversam locorum consuetudinem and this he adds magis fit de gratia quam de jure in which fletak and brittonl agree thereby plainly intimating the original of this custom to have been merely voluntary as a legacy from the tenant though now the immemorial usage has established it as of right in the lord this heriot is sometimes the best live beast or averium which the tenant     dies possessed of which is particularly denominated the villeins relief in the twentyninth law of william the conqueror sometimes the best inanimate good under which a jewel or piece of plate may be included but it is always a personal chattel which immediately on the death of the tenant who was the owner of it being ascertained by the option of the lordm becomes vested in him as his property and is no charge upon the lands but merely on the goods and chattels the tenant must be the owner of it else it cannot be due and therefore on the death of a femecovert no heriot can be taken for she can have no ownership in things personaln in some places there is a customary composition in money as ten or twenty shillings in lieu of a heriot by which the lord and tenant are both bound if it be an indisputably antient custom but a new composition of this sort will not bind the representatives of either party for that amounts to the creation of a new custom which is now impossibleo         mortuaries are a sort of ecclesiastical heriots being a customary gift claimed by and due to the minister in very many parishes on the death of his parishioners they seem originally to have been like lay heriots only a voluntary bequest to the church being intended as lyndewode informs us from a constitution of archbishop langham as a kind of expiation and amends to the clergy for the personal tithes and other ecclesiastical duties which the laity in their lifetime might have neglected or forgotten to pay for this purpose afterp the lords heriot or best good was taken out the second best chattel was reserved to the church as a mortuary si decedens plura habuerit animalia optimo cui de jure fuerit debitum reservato ecclesiæ suæ sine dolo fraude seu contradictione qualibet pro recompensatione subtractionis decimarum personalium necnon et oblationum secundum melius animal reservetur post obitum pro salute animæ suæq and therefore in the laws of king canuter this mortuary is called soulscot  or symbolum animæ and in pursuance of the same principle by the laws of venice where no personal tithes have been paid during the life of the party they are paid at his death out of his merchandise jewels and other movabless so also by a similar policy in france every man that died without bequeathing a part of his estate to the church which was called dying without confession was formerly deprived of christian burial or if he died intestate the relations of the deceased jointly with the bishop named proper arbitrators to determine what he ought to have given to the church in case he had made a will but the parliament in   0  redressed this grievancet it was antiently usual in this kingdom to bring the mortuary to church along with the corpse when it came to be buried and thenceu it is sometimes called a corsepresent a      term which bespeaks it to have been once a voluntary donation however in bractons time so early as henry iii we find it riveted into an established custom insomuch that the bequests of heriots and mortuaries were held to be necessary ingredients in every testament of chattels imprimis autem debet quilibet qui testamentum fecerit dominum suum de meliori re quam habuerit recognoscere et postea ecclesiam de alia meliori the lord must have the best good left him as an heriot and the church the second best as a mortuary but yet this custom was different in different places in quibusdam locis habet ecclesia melius animal de consuetudine in quibusdam secundum vel tertium melius et in quibusdam nihil et ideo consideranda est consuetudo lociw this custom still varies in different places not only as the mortuary to be paid but the person to whom it is payable in wales the mortuary or corsepresent was due upon the death of every clergyman     to the bishop of the diocese till abolished upon a recompense given to the bishop by the statute    anne st   c   and in the archdeaconry of chester a custom also prevailed that the bishop who is also archdeacon should have at the death of every clergyman dying therein his best horse or mare bridle saddle and spurs his best gown or cloak hat upper garment under his gown and tippet and also his best signet or ringx but by statute    geo ii c   this mortuary is directed to cease and the act has settled upon the bishop an equivalent in its room the kings claim to many goods on the death of all prelates in england seems to be of the same nature though sir edward cokey apprehends that this is a duty due upon death and not a mortuary a distinction which seems to be without a difference for not only the kings ecclesiastical character as supreme ordinary but also the species of the goods claimed which bear so near a resemblance to those in the archdeaconry of chester which was an acknowledged mortuary puts the matter out of dispute the king according to the record vouched by sir edward coke is entitled to six things the      bishops best horse or palfrey with his furniture his cloak or gown and tippet his cup and cover his basin and ewer his gold ring and lastly his muta canum his mew or kennel of hounds as was mentioned in the preceding chapterz this variety of customs with regard to mortuaries giving frequently a handle to exactions on the one side and frauds or expensive litigations on the other it was thought proper by statute    hen viii c   to reduce them to some kind of certainty for this purpose it is enacted that all mortuaries or corsepresents to parsons of any parish shall be taken in the following manner unless where by custom less or none at all is due viz for every person who does not leave goods to the value of ten marks nothing for every person who leaves goods to the value of ten marks and under thirty pounds  s  d if above thirty pounds and under forty pounds  s  d if above forty pounds of what value soever they may be  0s and no more and no mortuary shall throughout the kingdom be paid for the death of any femecovert nor for any child nor for any one of full age that is not a housekeeper nor for any wayfaring man but such wayfaring mans mortuary shall be paid in the parish to which he belongs and upon this statute stands the law of mortuaries to this day   heirlooms  are such goods and personal chattels as contrary to the nature     of chattels shall go by special custom to the heir along with the inheritance and not to the executor of the last proprietor the termination loom is of saxon original in which language it signifies a limb or membera so that an heirloom is nothing else but a limb or member of the inheritance they are generally such things as cannot be taken away without damaging or dismembering the freehold otherwise the general rule is that no chattel interest whatsoever shall go to the heir notwithstanding it be expressly limited to a man and his heirs but shall vest in the executorb  but deer in a real      authorized park fishes in a pond doves in a dovehouse c though in themselves personal chattels yet they are so annexed to and so necessary to the well being of the inheritance that they shall accompany the land wherever it vests by either descent or purchasec for this reason also i apprehend it is that the antient jewels of the crown are held to be heirloomsd for they are necessary to maintain the state and support the dignity of the sovereign for the timebeing charters likewise  and deeds courtrolls and other evidences of the land together with the chests in which they are contained shall pass together with the land to the heir in the nature of heirlooms and shall not go to the executore by special custom also in some places carriages utensils and other household implements may be heirloomsf but such custom must be strictly proved on the other hand by almost general custom whatever is strongly affixed to the freehold or inheritance and cannot be severed from thence without violence or damage quod ab ædibus non facile revelliturg is become a member of the inheritance and shall thereupon pass to the heir as chimneypieces pumps old fixed or dormant tables benches and the likeh a very similar notion to which prevails in the duchy of brabant where they rank certain things movable among those of the immovable kind calling them by a very particular appellation prædia volantia or volatile estates such as beds tables and other heavy implements of furniture which as an author of their own observes dignitatem istam nacta sunt ut villis sylvis et ædibus aliisque prædiis comparentur quod solidiora mobilia ipsis ædibus ex destinatione patrisfamilias cohærere videantur et pro parte ipsarum ædium æstimenturi other personal chattels there are which also descend to the heir in the nature of heirlooms as a monument or tombstone in a church or the coatarmour of his ancestor there      hung up with the pennons and other ensigns of honour suited to his degree in this case albeit the freehold of the church is in the parson and these are annexed to that freehold yet cannot the parson or any other take them away or deface them but is liable to an action from the heirk pews  in the church are somewhat of the same nature which     may descend by custom immemorial without any ecclesiastical concurrence from the ancestor to the heirl but though the heir has a property in the monuments and escutcheons of his ancestors yet he has none in their bodies or ashes nor can he bring any civil action against such as indecently at least if not impiously violate and disturb their remains when dead and buried the parson indeed who has the freehold of the soil may bring an action of trespass against such as dig and disturb it and if any one in taking up a dead body steals the shroud or other apparel it will be felonym for the property thereof remains in the executor or whoever was at the charge of the funeral  but to return to heirlooms these though they be mere chattels yet cannot be devised away from the heir by will but such a devise is voidn even by a tenant in feesimple  for though the owner might during his life have sold or disposed of them as he might of the timber of the estate since as the inheritance was his own he might mangle or dismember it as he pleased yet they being at his death instantly vested in the heir the devise which is subsequent and not to take effect till after his death shall be postponed to the custom whereby they have already descended    0 chapter xxix of title by succession marriage and judgment in the present chapter we shall take into consideration three other species of title to goods and chattels v the fifth method therefore of gaining a property in chattels either personal or real is by succession which is in strictness of law only applicable to corporations aggregate of many as dean and chapter mayor and commonalty master and fellows and the like in which one set of men may by succeeding another set acquire a property in all the goods movables and other chattels of the corporation the true reason whereof is because in judgment of law a corporation never dies and therefore the predecessors who lived a century ago and their successors now in being are one and the same body corporatea which identity is a property so inherent in the nature of a body politic that even when it is meant to give any thing to be taken in succession by such a body that succession need not be expressed but the law will of itself imply it so that a gift to such a corporation either of lands or of chattels without naming their successors vests an absolute property in them so long as the corporation subsistsb and thus a lease for years an      obligation a jewel a flock of sheep or other chattel interest will vest in the successors by succession as well as in the identical members to whom it was originally given but with regard to sole corporations a considerable distinction must be made for if such sole corporation be the representative of a number of persons as the master of an hospital who is a corporation for the benefit of the poor brethren an abbot or prior by the old law before the reformation who represented the whole convent or the dean of some antient cathedral who stands in the place of and represents in his corporate capacity the chapter such sole corporations as these have in this respect the same powers as corporations aggregate have to take personal property or chattels in succession and therefore a bond to such a master abbot or dean and his successors is good in law and the successor shall have the advantage of it for the benefit of the aggregate society of which he is in law the representativec whereas in the case of sole corporations which represent no others but themselves as bishops parsons and the like no chattel interest can regularly go in succession and therefore if a lease for years be made to the bishop of oxford and his successors in such case his executors or administrators and not his successors shall have itd for the word successors when applied to a person in his political capacity is equivalent to the word heirs in his natural and as such a lease for years if made to john and his heirs would not vest in his heirs but his executors so if it be made to john bishop of oxford and his successors who are the heirs of his body politic it shall still vest in his executors and not in such his successors the reason of this is obvious for besides that the law looks upon goods and chattels as of too low and perishable a nature to be limited either to heirs or such successors as are equivalent to heirs it would also follow that if any such chattel interest granted to a sole corporation and his successors were allowed to descend to such successor the property thereof must be in abeyance from the      death of the present owner until the successor be appointed and this is contrary to the nature of a chattel interest which can never be in abeyance or without an ownere but a mans right therein when once suspended is gone forever this is not the case in corporations aggregate where the right     is never in suspense nor in the other sole corporations before mentioned who are rather to be considered as heads of an aggregate body than subsisting merely in their own right the chattel interest therefore in such a case is really and substantially vested in the hospital convent chapter or other aggregate body though the head is the visible person in whose name every act is carried on and in whom every interest is therefore said in point of form to vest but the general rule with regard to corporations merely sole is this that no chattel can go to or be acquired by them in right of successionf yet to this rule there are two exceptions one in the case of the king in whom a chattel may vest by a grant of it formerly made to a preceding king and his successorsg the other exception is where by a particular custom some particular corporations sole have acquired a power of taking particular chattel interests in succession and this custom being against the general tenor of the common law must be strictly interpreted and not extended to any other chattel interests than such immemorial usage will strictly warrant thus the chamberlain of london who is a corporation sole may by the custom of london take bonds and recognizances to himself and his successors for the benefit of the orphans fundh but it will not follow from thence that he has a capacity to take a lease for years to himself and his successors for the same purpose for the custom extends not to that nor that he may take a bond to himself and his successors for any other purpose than the benefit of the orphans fund for that also is not warranted by the custom wherefore upon the whole we may close this head with laying down this general rule that such right of succession to chattels is      universally inherent by the common law in all aggregate corporations in the king and in such single corporations as represent a number of persons and may by special custom belong to certain other sole corporations for some particular purposes although generally in sole corporations no such right can exist vi a sixth method of acquiring property in goods and chattels is by marriage whereby those chattels which belonged formerly to the wife are by act of law vested in the husband with the same degree of property and the same powers as the wife when sole had over them this depends entirely on the notion of a unity of person between the husband and wife it being held that they are one person in lawi so that the very being and existence of the woman is suspended during the coverture or entirely merged or incorporated in that of the husband and hence it follows that whatever personal property belonged to the wife before marriage is by marriage absolutely vested in the husband in a real estate he only gains a title to the rents and profits during coverture for that depending upon feodal principles remains entire to the wife after the death of her husband or to her heirs if she dies before him unless by the birth of a child he becomes tenant for life by the curtesy but in chattel interests the sole and absolute property vests in the husband to be disposed of at his pleasure if he chooses to take possession of them for unless he reduces them to possession by exercising some act of ownership upon them no property vests in him but they shall remain to the wife or to her representatives after the coverture is determined there is therefore a very considerable difference in the acquisition of this species of property by the husband      according to the subjectmatter viz whether it be a chattel real or chattel personal and of chattels personal whether it be in possession or in action only a chattel real vests in the husband not absolutely but sub modo as in case of a lease for years the husband shall receive all the rents and profits of it and may if he pleases sell surrender or dispose of it during the coverturek if he be outlawed or attainted it shall be forfeited to the kingl it is liable to execution for his debtsm and if he survives his wife it is to all intents and purposes his ownn yet if he has made no disposition thereof in his lifetime and dies before     his wife he cannot dispose of it by willo for the husband having made no alteration in the property during his life it never was transferred from the wife but after his death she shall remain in her antient possession and it shall not go to his executors so it is also of chattels personal or choses in action as debts upon bond contracts and the like these the husband may have if he pleases that is if he reduces them into possession by receiving or recovering them at law  and upon such receipt or recovery they are absolutely and     entirely his own and shall go to his executors or administrators or as he shall bequeath them by will and shall not revest in the wife but if he dies before he has recovered or reduced them into possession so that at his death they shall continue choses in action they shall survive to the wife for the husband never exerted the power he had of obtaining an exclusive property in themp and so if an estray comes into the wifes franchise and the husband seizes it it is absolutely his property but if he dies without seizing it his executors are not now at liberty to seize it but the wife or her heirsq for the husband never exerted the right he had which right determined with the coverture thus in both these species of property the law is the same in case the wife survives the husband but in case the husband survives the wife the law is very different with respect to chattels real and choses in action for he shall have      the chattel real by survivorship but not the chose in actionr except in the case of arrears for rent due to the wife before her coverture which in case of her death are given to the husband by statute    hen viii c    and the reason for the general law is this that the husband is in absolute possession of the chattel real during the coverture by a kind of jointtenancy with his wife wherefore the law will not wrest it out of his hands and give it to her representatives though in case he had died first it would have survived to the wife unless he thought proper in his lifetime to alter the possession but a chose in action shall not survive to him because he never was in possession of it at all during the coverture and the only method he had to gain possession of it was by suing in his wifes right but as after her death he cannot as husband bring an action in her right because they are no longer one and the same person in law therefore he can never as such recover the possession but he still will be entitled to be her administrator and may in that capacity recover such things in action as became due to her before or during the coverture  thus and upon these reasons stands the law between husband and wife with regard to chattels real and choses in action but as to chattels personal or choses in possession which the wife hath in her own right as ready money jewels household goods and the like the husband hath therein an immediate and absolute property devolved to him by the marriage not only potentially but in fact which never can again revest in the wife or her representativess and as the husband may thus generally acquire a property in all the personal substance of the wife so in one particular instance the wife may acquire a property in some of her husbands goods which shall remain to her after his death and not go to his executors these are called her paraphernalia      which is a term borrowed from the civil lawt and is derived from the greek language signifying something over and above her dower our law uses it to signify the apparel and ornaments of the wife suitable to her rank and degree and therefore even the jewels of a peeress usually worn     by her have been held to be paraphernaliau these she becomes entitled to at the death of her husband over and above her jointure or dower and preferably to all other representativesw neither can the husband devise by his will such ornaments and jewels of his wife though during his life perhaps he hath the power if unkindly inclined to exert it to sell them or give them awayx but if she continues in the use of them till his death she shall afterwards retain them against his executors and administrators and all other persons except creditors where there is a deficiency of assetsy and her necessary apparel is protected even against the claim of creditorsz  vii a judgment in consequence of some suit or action in a court of justice is frequently the means of vesting the right and property of chattel interests in the prevailing party and here we must be careful to distinguish between property the right of which is before vested in the party and of which only possession is recovered by suit or action and property to which a man before had no determinate title or certain claim but he gains as well the right as the possession by the process and the judgment of the law of the former sort are all debts and choses in action as if a man gives bond for  0l or agrees to buy a horse at a stated sum or takes up goods of a tradesman upon an implied contract to pay as much as they are reasonably worth in all these cases the right accrues to the creditor and is completely vested in him at the time of the bond being sealed or the contract or agreement made and the law only gives him a remedy to recover the possession of that right which already in justice belongs to him       but there is also a species of property to which a     man has not any claim or title whatsoever till after suit commenced and judgment obtained in a court of law where the right and the remedy do not follow each other as in common cases but accrue at one and the same time and where before judgment had no man can say that he has any absolute property either in possession or in action of this nature are   such penalties as are given by particular statutes to be recovered in an action popular or in other words to be recovered by him or them that will sue for the same such as the penalty of  00l which those persons are by several acts of parliament made liable to forfeit that being in particular offices or situations in life neglect to take the oaths to the government which penalty is given to him or them that will sue for the same now here it is clear that no particular person a or b has any right claim or demand in or upon this penal sum till after action broughta for he that brings his action and can bona fide obtain judgment first will undoubtedly secure a title to it in exclusion of everybody else he obtains an inchoate imperfect degree of property by commencing his suit but it is not consummated till judgment for if any collusion appears he loses the priority he had gainedb but otherwise the right so attaches in the first informer that the king who before action brought may grant a pardon which shall be a bar to all the world cannot after suit commenced remit any thing but his own part of the penaltyc for by commencing the suit the informer has made the popular action his own private action and it is not in the power of the crown or of any thing but parliament to release the informers interest this therefore is one instance where a suit and judgment at law are      not only the means of recovering but also of acquiring property and what is said of this one penalty is equally true of all others that are given thus at large to a common informer or to any person that will sue for the same they are placed as it were in a state of nature accessible by all the kings subjects but the acquired right of none of them open therefore to the first occupant who declares his intention to possess them by bringing his action and who carries that intention into execution by obtaining judgment to recover them   another species of property that is acquired and lost by suit and judgment at law is that of damages given to a man by a jury as a compensation and satisfaction for some injury sustained as for a battery for imprisonment for slander or for trespass here the plaintiff has no certain demand till after verdict but when the jury has assessed his damages and judgment is given thereupon whether they amount to twenty pounds or twenty shillings he instantly acquires and the defendant loses at the same time a right to that specific sum it is true that this is not an acquisition so perfectly original as in the former instance for here the injured party has unquestionably a vague and indeterminate right to some damages or other the instant he receives the injury and the verdict of the jurors and judgment of the court thereupon do not in this case so properly vest a new title in him as fix and ascertain the old one they do not give but define the right but however though strictly speaking the primary right to a satisfaction for injuries is given by the law of nature and the suit is only the means of ascertaining and recovering that satisfaction yet as the legal proceedings are the only visible means of this acquisition of property we may fairly enough rank such damages or satisfaction assessed under the head of property acquired by suit and judgment at law        hither also may be referred upon the same principle all title to costs and expenses of suit which are often arbitrary and rest entirely on the determination of the court upon weighing all circumstances both as to the quantum and also in the courts of equity especially and upon motions in   0 the courts of law whether there shall be any costs at all these costs therefore when given by the court to either party may be looked upon as an acquisition made by the judgment of law chapter xxx of title by gift grant and contract we are now to proceed according to the order marked out to the discussion of two remaining methods of acquiring a title to property in things personal which are much connected together and answer in some measure to the conveyances of real estates being those by gift or grant and by contract whereof the former vests a property in possession the latter a property in action viii gifts then or grants which are the eighth method of transferring personal property are thus to be distinguished from each other that gifts are always gratuitous grants are upon some consideration or equivalent and they may be divided with regard to their subjectmatter into gifts or grants of chattels real and gifts or grants of chattels personal under the head of gifts or grants of chattels real may be included all leases for years of land assignments and surrenders of those leases and all the other methods of conveying an estate less than freehold which were considered in the twentieth chapter of the present book and therefore need not be here again repeated though these very seldom carry the outward appearance of a gift however freely bestowed being usually expressed to be made in consideration of blood or natural affection or of five or ten shillings nominally paid to the grantor and in case of leases always reserving a rent though it be but a peppercorn any of which considerations will in the eye of the law convert the gift if executed into a grant if not executed into a contract      grants or gifts of chattels personal  are the act of transferring the right and the possession of them whereby one man renounces and another man immediately acquires all title and interest therein which may be done either in writing or by word of moutha attested by sufficient evidence of which the delivery of possession is the strongest and most essential but this conveyance when merely voluntary is somewhat suspicious and is usually construed to be fraudulent if creditors or others become sufferers thereby and particularly by statute   hen vii c   all deeds of gift of goods made in trust     to the use of the donor shall be void because otherwise persons might be tempted to commit treason or felony without danger of forfeiture and the creditors of the donor might also be defrauded of their rights and by statute    eliz c   every grant or gift of chattels as well as lands with an intent to defraud creditors or othersb shall be void as against such persons to whom such fraud would be prejudicial but as against the grantor himself shall stand good and effectual and all persons partakers in or privy to such fraudulent grants shall forfeit the whole value of the goods one moiety to the king and another moiety to the party grieved and also on conviction shall suffer imprisonment for half a year  a true and proper gift or grant is always accompanied with delivery of possession and takes effect immediately  as if a gives to b  00l or a flock of sheep and puts him in possession of them directly it is then a gift executed in the donee and it is not in the donors power to retract it though he did it without any consideration or recompensec unless it be prejudicial to creditors or the donor were under any legal incapacity as infancy coverture duress or the like or if he were drawn in circumvented or imposed upon by false pretences ebriety or surprise but if the gift does not take effect by delivery of immediate possession it is then not properly a gift but a contract      and this a man cannot be compelled to perform but upon good and sufficient consideration as we shall see under our next division ix a contract which usually conveys an interest merely in action is thus defined—an agreement upon sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing from which definition there arise three points to be contemplated     in all contracts   the agreement   the consideration and   the thing to be done or omitted or the different species of contracts first then it is an agreement a mutual bargain or convention and therefore there must at least be two contracting parties of sufficient ability to make a contract as where a contracts with b to pay him  00l and thereby transfers a property in such sum to b which property is however not in possession but in action merely and recoverable by suit at law wherefore it could not be transferred to another person by the strict rules of the antient common law for no chose in action could be assigned or granted overd because it was thought to be a great encouragement to litigiousness if a man were allowed to make over to a stranger his right of going to law but this nicety is now disregarded though in compliance with the antient principle the form of assigning a chose in action is in the nature of a declaration of trust and an agreement to permit the assignee to make use of the name of the assignor in order to recover the possession and therefore when in common acceptation a debt or bond is said to be assigned over it must still be sued in the original creditors name the person to whom it is transferred being rather an attorney than an assignee but the king is an exception to this general rule for he might always either grant or receive a chose in action by assignmente and our courts of equity considering that in a commercial country almost all personal property must necessarily lie in contract will protect the assignment of a chose in action as much as the law will that of a chose in possessionf       this contract or agreement may be either express or implied express contracts are where the terms of the agreement are openly uttered and avowed at the time of the making as to deliver an ox or ten loads of timber or to pay a stated price for certain goods implied are such as reason and justice dictate and which therefore the law presumes that every man undertakes to perform as if i employ a person to do any business for me or perform any work the law implies that i undertook or contracted to pay him as much as his labour deserves if i take up wares from a tradesman without any agreement of price the law concludes that i contracted to pay their real value and there is also one species of implied contracts which runs through and is annexed to all other contracts conditions and covenants viz that if i fail in my part of the agreement i shall pay the other party such damages as he has sustained by such my neglect or refusal in short almost all the rights of personal property when not in actual possession do in great measure depend upon contracts of one kind or other or at least might be reduced under some of them which indeed is the method taken by the civil law it having referred the greatest part of the duties and rights which it treats of to the head of obligations ex contractu and quasi ex contractug a contract may also be either executed as if a agrees to change horses with b and they do it immediately in which case the possession and the right are transferred together or it may be executory as if they agree to change next week here the right only vests and their reciprocal property in each others horse is not in possession but in action for a contract executed which differs     nothing from a grant conveys a chose in possession a contract executory conveys only a chose in action having thus shown the general nature of a contract we are secondly to proceed to the consideration upon which it is founded or the reason which moves the contracting party to      enter into the contract it is an agreement upon sufficient consideration the civilians hold that in all contracts either express or implied there must be something given in exchange something that is mutual or reciprocalh this thing which is the price or motive of the contract we call the consideration and it must be a thing lawful in itself or else the contract is void a good consideration we have before seeni is that of blood or natural affection between near relations the satisfaction accruing from which the law esteems an equivalent for whatever benefit may move from one relation to anotherj this consideration may sometimes however be set aside and the contract become void when it tends in its consequences to defraud creditors or other third persons of their just rights but a contract for any valuable consideration as for marriage for money for work done or for other reciprocal contracts can never be impeached at law and if it be of a sufficient adequate value is never set aside in equity for the person contracted with has then given an equivalent to recompense and is therefore as much an owner or a creditor as any other person      these valuable considerations are divided by the civiliansk into four species   do ut des as when i give money or goods on a contract that i shall be repaid money or goods for them again of this kind are all loans of money upon bond or promise of repayment and all sales of goods in which there is either an express contract to pay so much for them or else the law implies a contract to pay so much as they are worth   the second species is facio ut facias as when i agree with a man to do his work for him if he will do mine for me or if two persons agree to marry together or to do any positive acts on both sides or it may be to forbear on one side on consideration of something done on the other as that in consideration a the tenant will repair his house b the landlord will not sue him for waste or it may be for mutual forbearance on both sides      as that in consideration that a will not trade to lisbon b will not trade to marseilles so as to avoid interfering with each other   the third species of consideration is facio ut des when a man agrees to perform any thing for a price either specifically mentioned or left to the determination of the law to set a value to it as when a servant hires himself to his master for certain wages or an agreed sum of money here the servant contracts to do his masters service in order to earn that specific sum otherwise if he be hired generally for then he is under an implied contract to perform this service for what it shall be reasonably worth   the fourth species is do ut facias which is the direct counterpart of the preceding as when i agree with a servant to give him such wages upon his performing such work which we see is nothing else but the last species inverted for servus facit ut herus det and herus dat ut servus faciat a consideration of some sort or other is so absolutely necessary to the forming of a contract that a nudum pactum or agreement to do or pay any thing on one side without any compensation on the other is totally void in law and a man cannot be compelled to perform itl  as if one man promises to give another  00l here there is nothing contracted for or given on the one side and therefore there is nothing binding on the other and however a man may or may not be bound to perform it in honour or conscience which the municipal laws do not take upon them to decide certainly those municipal laws will not     compel the execution of what he had no visible inducement to engage for and therefore our law has adoptedm the maxim of the civil lawn that ex nude pacto non oritur actio but any degree of reciprocity will prevent the pact from being nude nay even if the thing be founded on a prior moral obligation as a promise to pay a just debt though barred by the statute of limitations it is no longer nudum pactum  and as this rule was principally established to avoid the inconvenience that would arise from setting up mere verbal promises for which no good reason could      be assignedo it therefore does not hold in some cases where such promise is authentically proved by written documents for if a man enters into a voluntary bond or gives a promissory note he shall not be allowed to aver the want of a consideration in order to evade the payment for every bond from the solemnity of the instrumentp and every note from the subscription of the drawerq  carries with it an internal evidence of a good consideration courts of justice will therefore support them both as against the contractor himself but not to the prejudice of creditors or strangers to the contract we are next to consider thirdly the thing agreed to be done or omitted a contract is an agreement upon sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing the most usual contracts whereby the right of chattels personal     may be acquired in the laws of england are   that of sale or exchange   that of bailment   that of hiring and borrowing   that of debt   sale or exchange is a transmutation of property from one man to another in consideration of some price or recompense in value for there is no sale without a recompense there must be quid pro quor if it be a commutation of goods for goods it is more properly an exchange but if it be a transferring of goods for money it is called a sale which is a method of exchange introduced for the convenience of mankind by establishing a universal medium which may be exchanged for all sorts of other property whereas if goods were only to be exchanged for goods by way of barter it would be difficult to adjust the respective values and the carriage would be intolerably cumbersome all civilized nations adopted therefore very early the use of money for we find abraham giving four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant for the field of machpelahs though the practice of exchange still subsists among several of the savage nations but with regard to the law of      sales and exchanges there is no difference i shall therefore treat of them both under the denomination of sales only and shall consider their force and effect in the first place where the vendor hath in himself and secondly where he hath not the property of the thing sold where the vendor hath in himself the property of the goods sold he hath the liberty of disposing of them to whomsoever he pleases at any time and in any manner unless judgment has been obtained against him for a debt or damages and the writ of execution is actually delivered to the sheriff for then by the statute of fraudst the sale shall be looked upon as fraudulent and the property of the goods shall be bound to answer the debt from the time of delivering the writ formerly it was bound from the teste or issuing of the writu and any subsequent sale was fraudulent but the law was thus altered in favour of purchasers though it still remains the same between the parties and therefore if a defendant dies after the awarding and before the delivery of the writ his goods are bound by it in the hands of his executorsv  if a man agrees with another for goods at a certain price he may not carry them away before he hath paid for them for it is no sale without payment unless the contrary be expressly agreed and therefore if the vendor says the price of a beast is four pounds and the vendee says he will give four pounds the bargain is struck and they neither of them are at liberty to be off provided immediate possession be tendered by the other side but if neither the money be paid nor the goods delivered nor tender made nor any subsequent agreement be entered into it is no contract and the owner may dispose of the goods as he pleasesw 0 but if any part of the price is paid down if it be but a     penny or any portion of the goods delivered by way of earnest which the civil law calls arrha and interprets to be emptionis venditionis      contractæ argumentumx the property of the goods is absolutely bound by it and the vendee may recover the goods by action as well as the vendor may the price of themy   and such regard does the law pay to earnest as an evidence of a contract that by the same statute    car ii c   no contract for the sale of goods to the value of  0l or more shall be valid unless the buyer actually receives part of the goods sold by way of earnest on his part unless he gives part of the price to the vendor by way of earnest to bind the bargain or in part of payment or unless some note in writing be made and signed by the party or his agent who is to be charged with the contract and with regard to goods under the value of  0l no contract or agreement for the sale of them shall be valid unless the goods are to be delivered within one year or unless the contract be made in writing and signed by the party or his agent who is to be charged therewith   antiently among all the northern nations shaking of hands was held necessary to bind the bargain a custom which we still retain in many verbal contracts a sale thus made was called handsale venditio per mutuam manuum complexionemz till in process of time the same word was used to signify the price or earnest which was given immediately after the shaking of hands or instead thereof as soon as the bargain is struck the property of the goods is transferred to the vendee and that of the price to the vendor but the vendee cannot take the goods until he tenders the price agreed ona   but if he tenders the money to     the vendor and he refuses it the vendee may seize the goods or have an action against the vendor for detaining them and by a regular sale without delivery the property is so absolutely vested in the vendee that if a sells a horse to b for  0l and b pays him earnest or signs a note in writing of the bargain and afterwards before the delivery of the horse or money paid the horse dies in the vendors custody still he is entitled to the money because by the      contract the property was in the vendeeb thus may property in goods be transferred by sale where the vendor hath such property in himself   but property may also in some cases be transferred by sale though the vendor hath none at all in the goods for it is expedient that the buyer by taking proper precautions may at all events be secure of his purchase otherwise all commerce between man and man must soon be at an end and therefore the general rule of law isc that all sales and contracts of any thing vendible in fairs or markets overt that is open shall not only be good between the parties but also be binding on all those that have any right or property therein and for this purpose the mirror informs usd were tolls established in markets viz to testify the making of contracts for every private contract was discountenanced by law insomuch that our saxon ancestors prohibited the sale of any thing above the value of twenty pence unless in open market and directed every bargain and sale to be contracted in the presence of credible witnessese market overt in the country is only held on the special days provided for particular towns by charter or prescription but in london every day except sunday is marketdayf the marketplace or spot of ground set apart by custom for the sale of particular goods is also in the country the only market overtg but in london every shop in which goods are exposed publicly to sale is market overt for such things only as the owner professes to trade inh but if my goods are stolen from me and sold out of market overt my property is not altered and i may take them wherever i find them     and it is expressly provided by statute   jac i c    that the sale of any goods wrongfully taken to any pawnbroker in london or within two miles thereof shall not alter the property for this being usually a clandestine trade is therefore made an exception to the general rule and even in market overt if the goods be the property of the king such sale though regular in all other respects    0 will in no case bind him though it binds infants femecoverts idiots and lunatics and men beyond sea or in prison or if the goods be stolen from a common person and then taken by the kings officer from the felon and sold in open market still if the owner has used due diligence in prosecuting the thief to conviction he loses not his property in the goodsi   so likewise if the buyer knoweth the property not to be in the seller or there be any other fraud in the transaction if he knoweth the seller to be an infant or femecovert not usually trading for herself if the sale be not originally and wholly made in the fair or market or not at the usual hours the owners property is not bound therebyj if a man buys his own goods in a fair or market the contract of sale shall not bind him so that he shall render the price unless the property had been previously altered by a former salek and notwithstanding any number of intervening sales if the original vendor who sold without having the property comes again into possession of the goods the original owner may take them when found in his hands who was guilty of the first breach of justicel by which wise regulations the common law has secured the right of the proprietor in personal chattels from being divested so far as was consistent with that other necessary policy that purchasers bona fide in a fair open and regular manner shall not be afterwards put to difficulties by reason of the previous knavery of the seller but there is one species of personal chattels in which the property is not easily altered by sale without the express consent of the owner and those are horsesm for a purchaser gains no property in a horse that has been stolen unless it be bought in a fair or market overt according to the direction of the statutes   p  m c   and    eliz c    by which it is enacted that the horse shall be openly exposed in the time of such fair or market for one whole hour together between ten in the morning and sunset in the public place used for such sales and not in any private yard or stable and afterwards brought by both the vendor and vendee to the bookkeeper of such fair or market that toll be paid if any      be due and if not one penny to the bookkeeper who shall enter down the price colour and marks of the norse with the names additions and abode of the vendee and vendor the latter being properly attested nor shall such sale take away the property of the owner if within six months after the horse is stolen he puts in his claim before some magistrate where the horse shall be found and within forty days more proves such his property by the oath of two witnesses and tenders to the person in possession such price as he bona fide paid for him in market overt but in case any one of the points before mentioned be not observed such sale is utterly void and the owner shall not lose his property but at any distance of time may seize or bring an action for his horse wherever he happens to find him by the civil lawn an implied warranty was annexed to every sale in respect to the title of the vendor and so too in our law a purchaser of goods and chattels may have a satisfaction from the seller if he sells them as his own and     the title proves deficient without any express warranty for that purposoo but with regard to the goodness of the wares so purchased the vendor is not bound to answer unless he expressly warrants them to be sound and goodp   or unless he knew them to be otherwise and hath used any art to disguise themq or unless they turn out to be different from what he represented them to the buyer         bailment from the french bailler to deliver is a delivery of goods in trust upon a contract expressed or implied that the trust shall be faithfully executed on the part of the bailee as if cloth be delivered or in our legal dialect bailed to a tailor to make a suit of clothes he has it upon an implied contract to render it again when made and that in a workmanly mannerr if money or goods be delivered to a common carrier to convey from oxford to london he is under a contract in law to pay or carry them to the person appointeds if a horse or other goods be delivered to an innkeeper or his servants he is bound to keep      them safely and restore them when his guest leaves the houset if a man takes in a horse or other cattle to graze and depasture in his grounds which the law calls agistment he takes them upon an implied contract to return them on demand to the owneru if a pawnbroker receives plate or jewels as a pledge or security for the repayment of money lent thereon at a day certain he has them upon an express contract or condition to restore them if the pledger performs his part by redeeming them in due timew for the due execution of which contract many useful regulations are made by statute  0 geo ii c    and so if a landlord distrains goods for rent or a parish officer for taxes these for a time are only a pledge in the hands of the distrainors and they are bound by an implied contract in law to restore them on payment of the debt duty and expenses before the time of sale or when sold to render back the overplus if a friend delivers any thing to his friend to keep for him the receiver is bound to restore it on demand and it was formerly held that in the mean time he was answerable for any damage or loss it might sustain whether by accident or otherwisex unless he expressly undertooky to keep it only with the same care as his own goods and then he should not be answerable for theft or other accidents but now the law seems to be settledz that such a general bailment will not charge the bailee with any loss unless it happens by gross neglect which is an evidence of fraud but if he undertakes specially to keep the goods safely and securely he is bound to take the same care of them as a prudent man would take of his owna in all these instances there is a special qualified property transferred from the bailor to the bailee together with the possession it is not an absolute property because of his      contract for restitution the bailor having still left in him the right to a chose in action grounded upon such contract and on account of this qualified property of the bailee he may as well as the bailor maintain an action against such as injure or take away these chattels the tailor the carrier the innkeeper the agisting farmer the pawnbroker the distrainor and the general bailee may all of them vindicate in their own right     this their possessory interest against any stranger or third personb for being responsible to the bailor if the goods are lost or damaged by his wilful default or gross negligence or if he do not deliver up the chattels on lawful demand it is therefore reasonable that he should have a right of action against all other persons who may have purloined or injured them that he may always be ready to answer the call of the bailor   hiring and borrowing are also contracts by which a qualified property may be transferred to the hirer or borrower in which there is only this difference that hiring is always for a price or stipend or additional recompense borrowing is merely gratuitous but the law in both cases is the same   they are both contracts whereby the possession and a transient property is transferred for a particular time or use on condition to restore the goods so hired or borrowed as soon as the time is expired or use performed together with the price or stipend in case of hiring either expressly agreed on by the parties or left to be implied by law according to the value of the service by this mutual contract the hirer or borrower gains a temporary property in the thing hired accompained with an implied condition to use it with moderation and not to abuse it and the owner or lender retains a reversionary interest in the same and acquires a new property in the price or reward thus if a man hires or borrows a horse for a month he has the possession and a qualified property therein during that period on the expiration of which his qualified property determines and the owner becomes in case of hiring entitled also to the price for which the horse was hiredc      there is one species of this price or reward the most usual of any but concerning which many good and learned men have in former times very much perplexed themselves and other people by raising doubts about its legality in foro conscientiæ that is when money is lent on a contract to receive not only the principal sum again but also an increase by way of compensation for the use which generally is called interest by those who think it lawful and usury by those who do not so for the enemies to interest in general make no distinction between that and usury holding any increase of money to be indefensibly usurious and this they ground as well on the prohibition of it by the law of moses among the jews as also upon what is said to be laid down by aristotled that money is naturally barren and to make it breed money is preposterous and a perversion of the end of its institution which was only to serve the purposes of exchange and not of increase hence the school divines have branded the practice of taking interest as being contrary to the divine law both natural and revealed and the canon lawe has proscribed the taking any the least increase for the loan of money as a mortal sin but in answer to this it hath been observed that the mosaical precept was clearly a political and not a moral precept it only prohibited the jews from taking usury from their brethren the jews but in express words permitted them to take it of a strangerf which proves that the taking of moderate usury or a reward for the use for so the word signifies is not malum in se since it was allowed where any but an israelite was concerned and as to the reason supposed to be given by aristotle and deduced from the natural barrenness of money the same may with equal force be alleged of houses which never breed houses and twenty other things which nobody doubts it is lawful to make profit of by letting them to hire and though money was originally used only for the purposes of exchange yet the laws of any state      may be well justified in permitting it to be turned to the purposes of profit if the     convenience of society the great end for which money was invented shall require it and that the allowance of moderate interest tends greatly to the benefit of the public especially in a trading country will appear from that generally acknowledged principle that commerce cannot subsist without mutual and extensive credit unless money therefore can be borrowed trade cannot be carried on and if no premium were allowed for the hire of money few persons would care to lend it or at least the ease of borrowing at a short warning which is the life of commerce would be entirely at an end thus in the dark ages of monkish superstition and civil tyranny when interest was laid under a total interdict commerce was also at its lowest ebb and fell entirely into the hands of the jews and lombards but when mens minds began to be more enlarged when true religion and real liberty revived commerce grew again into credit and again introduced with itself its inseparable companion the doctrine of loans upon interest and as to any scruples of conscience since all other conveniences of life may either be bought or hired but money can only be hired there seems to be no greater oppression in taking a recompense or price for the hire of this than of any other convenience to demand an exorbitant price is equally contrary to conscience for the loan of a horse or the loan of a sum of money but a reasonable equivalent for the temporary inconvenience which the owner may feel by the want of it and for the hazard of his losing it entirely is not more immoral in one case than it is in the other indeed the absolute prohibition of lending upon any even moderate interest introduces the very inconvenience which it seems meant to remedy the necessity of individuals will make borrowing unavoidable without some profit allowed by law there will be but few lenders and those principally bad men who will break through the law and take a profit and then will endeavour to indemnify themselves from the danger of the penalty by making that profit exorbitant a capital      distinction must therefore be made between a moderate and exorbitant profit to the former of which we usually give the name of interest to the latter the truly odious appellation of usury the former is necessary in every civil state if it were but to exclude the latter which ought never to be tolerated in any wellregulated society for as the whole of this matter is well summed up by grotiusg if the compensation allowed by law does not exceed the proportion of the hazard run or the want felt by the loan its allowance is neither repugnant to the revealed nor the natural law but if it exceeds those bounds it is then oppressive usury and though the municipal laws may give it impunity they can never make it just we see that the exorbitance or moderation of interest for money lent depends upon two circumstances the inconvenience of parting with it for the present and the hazard of losing it entirely the inconvenience to individual lenders can never be estimated by laws the rate therefore of general interest must depend upon the usual or general inconvenience this results entirely from the quantity of specie or current money in the kingdom for the more specie there is circulating in any nation the greater superfluity there will be beyond what is necessary to carry on the business of exchange and the common concerns of life in every nation or public community there is a certain quantity of money thus necessary which a person well skilled in political arithmetic might perhaps calculate as exactly as a private banker can the demand for running cash in his own shop all above this necessary quantity may be spared or lent without much inconvenience to the respective lenders and the greater this national superfluity is the more numerous will be the lenders and the lower ought the rate of the national interest to be but where there is not enough circulating cash or barely enough to answer the ordinary uses of the public interest will be proportionably high for lenders will be but few as few can submit to the inconvenience of lending            so also the hazard of an entire loss has its weight in the regulation of interest hence the better the security the lower will the interest be the rate of interest being generally in a compound ratio formed out of the inconvenience and the hazard and as if there were no inconvenience there should be no interest but what is equivalent to the hazard so if there were no hazard there ought to be no interest save only what arises from the mere inconvenience of lending thus if the quantity of specie in a nation be such that the general inconvenience of lending for a year is computed to amount to three per cent a man that has money by him will perhaps lend it upon a good personal security at five per cent allowing two for the hazard run he will lend it upon landed security or mortgage at four per cent the hazard being proportionably less but he will lend it to the state on the maintenance of which all his property depends at three per cent the hazard being none at all but sometimes the hazard may be greater than the rate of interest allowed by law will compensate and this gives rise to the practice of   bottomry or respondentia   policies of insurance   annuities upon lives and first bottomry which originally arose from permitting the master of a ship in a foreign country to hypothecate the ship in order to raise money to refit is in the nature of a mortgage of a ship when the owner takes up money to enable him to carry on his voyage and pledges the keel or bottom of the ship partem pro toto as a security for the repayment in which case it is understood that if the ship be lost the lender loses also his whole money but if it returns in safety then he shall receive back his principal and also the premium or interest agreed upon however it may exceed the legal rate of interest and this is allowed to be a valid contract in all trading      nations for the benefit of commerce and by reason of the extraordinary hazard run by the lenderh and in this case the ship and tackle if brought home are answerable as well as the person of the borrower for the money lent but if the loan is not upon the vessel but upon the goods and merchandise which must necessarily be sold or exchanged in the course of the voyage then only the borrower personally is bound to answer the contract who therefore in this case is said to take up money at respondentia these terms are also applied to contracts for the repayment of money borrowed not on the ship and goods only but on the mere hazard of the voyage itself when a man lends a merchant  000l to be employed in a beneficial trade with condition to be repaid with extraordinary interest in case such a voyage be safely performedi which kind of agreement is sometimes called fœnus nauticum and sometimes usura maritimaj but as this gave an opening for usurious and gaming contracts especially upon long voyages it was enacted by the statute    geo ii c    that all moneys lent on     bottomry or at respondentia on vessels bound to or from the east indies shall be expressly lent only upon the ship or upon the merchandise that the lender shall have the benefit of salvagek and that if the borrower hath not an interest in the ship or in the effects on board equal to the value of the sum borrowed he shall be responsible to the lender for so much of the principal as hath not been laid out with legal interest and all other charges though the ship and merchandise be totally lost 0 secondly a policy of insurance is a contract between a and b that upon as paying a premium equivalent to the hazard run b will indemnify or insure him against a particular event this is founded upon one of the same principles as the doctrine of interest upon loans that of hazard but not that of inconvenience for if i insure a ship to the levant and back again at five per cent here i calculate the chance that she performs her voyage to be twenty to one against her being lost and if she be lost i lose  00l and get  l now this is much the same as if i lend the merchant whose whole fortunes are embarked in this vessel  00l at      the rate of eight per cent for by a loan i should be immediately out of possession of my money the inconvenience of which we have supposed equal to three per cent if therefore i had actually lent him  00l i must have added  l on the score of inconvenience to the  l allowed for the hazard which together would have made  l but as upon an insurance i am never out of possession of my money till the loss actually happens nothing is therein allowed upon the principle of inconvenience but all upon the principle of hazard thus too in a loan if the chance of repayment depends upon the borrowers life it is frequent besides the usual rate of interest for the borrower to have his life insured till the time of repayment for which he is loaded with an additional premium suited to his age and constitution thus if sempronius has only an annuity for his life and would borrow  00l of titius for a year the inconvenience and general hazard of this loan we have seen are equivalent to  l which is therefore the legal interest but there is also a special hazard in this case for if sempronius dies within the year titius must lose the whole of his  00l suppose this chance to be as one to ten it will follow that the extraordinary hazard is worth  0l more and therefore that the reasonable rate of interest in this case would be fifteen per cent but this the law to avoid abuses will not permit to be taken sempronius therefore gives titius the lender only  l the legal interest but applies to gaius an insurer and gives him the other  0l to indemnify titius against the extraordinary hazard and     in this manner may any extraordinary or particular hazard be provided against which the established rate of interest will not reach that being calculated by the state to answer only the ordinary and general hazard together with the lenders inconvenience in parting with his specie for the time but in order to prevent these insurances from being turned into a mischievous kind of gaming it is enacted by statute    geo iii c    that no insurance shall be made on lives or on any other event wherein the party insured hath no interest that in all policies the name of such interested party shall be    0 inserted and nothing more shall be recovered thereon than the amount of the interest of the insured this does not however extend to marine insurances which were provided for by a prior law of their own the learning relating to these insurances hath of late years been greatly improved by a series of judicial decisions which have now established the law in such a variety of cases that if well and judiciously collected they would form a very complete title in a code of commercial jurisprudence but being founded on equitable principles which chiefly result from the special circumstances of the case it is not easy to reduce them to any general heads in mere elementary institutes thus much however may be said that being contracts the very essence of which consists in observing the purest good faith and integrity they are vacated by any the least shadow of fraud or undue concealment and on the other hand being much for the benefit and extension of trade by distributing the loss or gain among a number of adventurers they are greatly encouraged and protected both by common law and acts of parliament but as a practice had obtained of insuring large sums without having any property on board which were called insurances interest or no interest and also of insuring the same goods several times over both of which were a species of gaming without any advantage to commerce and were denominated wagering policies it is therefore enacted by the stat    geo ii c    that all insurances interest or no interest or without further proof of interest than the policy itself or by way of gaming or wagering or without benefit of salvage to the insurer all of which had the same pernicious tendency shall be totally null and void except upon privateers or upon ships or merchandise from the spanish and portuguese dominions for reasons sufficiently obvious and that no reassurance shall be lawful except the former insurer shall be insolvent a bankrupt or dead and lastly that in the east india trade the lender of money on bottomry or at respondentia shall alone have a right to be insured for the money lent and the borrower      shall in case of a loss recover no more upon any insurance than the surplus of his property above the value of his bottomry or respondentia bond thirdly the practice of purchasing annuities for lives at a certain price or premium instead of advancing the same sum on an ordinary loan arises usually from the inability of the borrower to give the lender a permanent security for the return of the money borrowed at any one period of time he therefore stipulates in effect to repay annually during his life some part of the money borrowed together with legal interest for so much of the principal as annually remains unpaid and an additional compensation for the extraordinary hazard run of losing that principal entirely by the contingency of the borrowers death all which considerations being calculated and blended together will constitute the just proportion or quantum of the annuity which ought to be granted the real value of that contingency must depend on the age constitution situation and conduct of the borrower and therefore the price of such annuities cannot without the utmost difficulty be reduced to any general rules so that if by the terms of the contract the lenders principal is bona fide and not colourablyl put in jeopardy no inequality of price will make it an usurious bargain though under some circumstances of imposition it may be relieved against in equity to throw however some check upon improvident transactions of this kind which are usually carried on with great privacy the statute    geo iii c    has directed that upon the sale of any lifeannuity of     more than the value of ten pounds per annum unless on a sufficient pledge of lands in feesimple or stock in the public funds the true consideration which shall be in money only shall be set forth and described in the security itself and a memorial of the date of the security of the names of the parties cestuy que trusts cestuy que vies and witnesses and of the considerationmoney shall within twenty days after its execution be enrolled in the court of chancery else the security shall be null and void   and in case of collusive practices respecting the consideration the      court in which any action is brought or judgment obtained upon such collusive security may order the same to be cancelled and the judgment if any to be vacated and also all contracts for the purchase of annuities from infants shall remain utterly void and be incapable of confirmation after such infants arrive to the age of maturity but to return to the doctrine of common interest on loans upon the two principles of inconvenience and hazard compared together different nations have at different times established different rates of interest the romans at one time allowed centesimæ one per cent monthly or twelve per cent per annum to be taken for common loans but justinianm reduced it to trientes or onethird of the as or centesimæ that is four per cent but allowed higher interest to be taken of merchants because there the hazard was greater so too grotius informs usn that in holland the rate of interest was then eight per      cent in common loans but twelve to merchants and lord bacon was desirous of introducing a similar policy in englando but our law establishes one standard for all alike where the pledge of security itself is not put in jeopardy lest under the general pretence of vague and indeterminate hazard a door should be opened to fraud and usury leaving specific hazards to be provided against by specific insurances by annuities for lives or by loans upon respondentia or bottomry but as to the rate of legal interest it has varied and decreased for two hundred years past according as the quantity of specie in the kingdom has increased by accessions of trade the introduction of paper credit and other circumstances the statute of    hen viii c   confined interest to ten per cent and so did the statute    eliz c   but as through the encouragements given in her reign to commerce the nation grew more wealthy so under her successor the statute    jac i c    reduced it to eight per cent as did the statute    car ii c    to six and lastly by the statute    anne st   c    it was brought down to five per cent yearly which is now the extremity of legal interest that can be taken   but yet if a contract which     carries interest be made in a foreign country our courts will direct the payment of interest according to the law of that country in which the contract was madep thus irish american turkish and indian interest have      been allowed in our courts to the amount of even twelve per cent for the moderation or exorbitance of interest depends upon local circumstances and the refusal to enforce such contracts would put a stop to all foreign trade   and by statute    geo iii c    all mortgages and other securities upon estates or other property in ireland or the plantations bearing interest not exceeding six per cent shall be legal though executed in the kingdom of great britain unless the money lent shall be known at the time to exceed the value of the thing in pledge in which case also to prevent usurious contracts at home under colour of such foreign securities the borrower shall forfeit treble the sum so borrowed         the last general species of contracts which i have to mention is that of debt whereby a chose in action or right to a certain sum of money is mutually acquired and lostq this may be the counterpart of and arise from any of the other species of contracts as in case of a sale where the price is not paid in ready money the vendee becomes indebted to the vendor for the sum agreed on and the vendor has a property in this price as a chose in action by means of this contract of debt in bailment if the bailee loses or detains a sum of money bailed to him for any special purpose he becomes indebted to the bailor in the same numerical sum upon his implied contract that he should execute the trust reposed in him or repay the money to the bailor upon hiring or borrowing the hirer or borrower at the same time that he acquires a property in the thing lent may also become indebted to the lender upon his contract to restore the money borrowed to pay the price or premium of the loan the hire of the horse or the like any contract in short whereby a determinate sum of money becomes due to any person and is not paid but remains in action merely is a contract of debt and taken in this light it comprehends a great variety of      acquisition being usually divided into debts of record debts by special and debts by simple contract       a debt of record is a sum of money which appears to be due by the evidence of a court of record thus when any specific sum is adjudged to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff on an action or suit at law this is a contract of the highest nature being established by the sentence of a court of judicature     debts upon recognizance are also a sum of money recognised or acknowledged to be due to the crown or a subject in the presence of some court or magistrate with a condition that such acknowledgment shall be void upon the appearance of the party his good behaviour or the like and these together with statutes merchant and statutes staple c if forfeited by nonperformance of the condition are also ranked among this first and principal class of debts viz debts of record since the contract on which they are founded is witnessed by the highest kind of evidence viz by matter of record debts by specialty or special contract are such whereby a sum of money becomes or is acknowledged to be due by deed or instrument under seal such as by deed of covenant by deed of sale by lease reserving rent or by bond or obligation which last we took occasion to explain in the twentieth chapter of the present book and then showed that it is a creation or acknowledgment of a debt from the obligor to the obligee unless the obligor performs a condition thereunto usually annexed as the payment of rent or money borrowed the observance of a covenant and the like on failure of which the bond becomes forfeited and the debt becomes due in law these are looked upon as the next class of debts after those of record being confirmed by special evidence under seal debts by simple contract are such where the contract upon which the obligation arises is neither ascertained by matter of record nor yet by deed or special instrument but by mere oral evidence the most simple of any or by notes      unsealed which are capable of a more easy proof and therefore only better than a verbal promise it is easy to see into what a vast variety of obligations this last class may be branched out through the numerous contracts for money which are not only expressed by the parties but virtually implied in law some of these we have already occasionally hinted at and the rest to avoid repetition must be referred to those particular heads in the third book of these commentaries where the breach of such contracts will be considered i shall only observe at present that by the statute    car ii c   no executor or administrator shall be charged upon any special promise to answer damages out of his own estate and no person shall be charged upon any promise to answer for the debt or default of another or upon any agreement in consideration of marriage or upon any contract or sale of any real estate or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making unless the agreement or some memorandum thereof be in a writing and signed by the party himself or by his authority but there is one species of debts upon simple contract which being a transaction now introduced into all sorts of civil life under the name of paper credit deserves a more particular regard these are debts by bills of exchange and promissory notes     a bill of exchange is a security originally invented among merchants in different countries for the more easy remittance of money from the one to the other which has since spread itself into almost all pecuniary transactions it is an open letter of request from one man to another desiring him to pay a sum named therein to a third person on his account by which means a man at the most distant part of the world may have money remitted to him from any trading country if a lives in jamaica and owes b who lives in england  000l now if c be going from england to jamaica he may pay b this  000l and take a bill of exchange drawn by b in england upon a in jamaica and receive it when he comes hither thus does b receive his debt at any distance of place by transferring it to c who carries over his money      in paper credit without danger of robbery or loss this method is said to have been brought into general use by the jews and lombards when banished for their usury and other vices in order the more easily to draw their effects out of france and england into those countries in which they had chosen to reside but the invention of it was a little earlier for the jews were banished out of guienne in      and out of england in    0r and in      the use of paper credit was introduced into the mogul empire in chinas in common speech such a bill is frequently called a draft but a bill of exchange is the more legal as well as mercantile expression the person however who writes this letter is called in law the drawer and he to whom it is written the drawee and the third person or negotiator to whom it is payable whether especially named or the bearer generally is called the payee these bills are either foreign or inland foreign when drawn by a merchant residing abroad upon his correspondent in england or vice versa   and inland when both the drawer and the drawee reside within the kingdom formerly foreign bills of exchange were much more regarded in the eye of the law than inland ones as being thought of more public concern in the advancement of trade and commerce but now by two statutes the one     0 w iii c    the other      anne c   inland bills of exchange are put upon the same footing as foreign ones what was the law and custom of merchants with the regard to the one and taken notice of merely as sucht being by those statutes expressly enacted with regard to the other so that now there is not in law any manner of difference between them   promissory notes or notes of hand are a plain and direct engagement in writing to pay a sum specified at the time therein limited to a person therein named or sometimes to his order or often to the bearer at large these also     by the same statute      anne c   are made assignable and endorsable in like manner as bills of exchange but by statute    geo iii c    all promissory or other notes      bills of exchange drafts and undertakings in writing being negotiable or transferable for the payment of less than twenty shillings are declared to be null and void and it is made penal to utter or publish any such they being deemed prejudicial to trade and public credit and by    geo iii c  0 all such notes bills drafts and undertakings to the amount of twenty shillings and less than five pounds are subjected to many other regulations and formalities the omission of any one of which vacates the security and is penal to him that utters it   the payee we may observe either of a bill of exchange or promissory note has clearly a property vested in him not indeed in possession but in action by the express contract of the drawer in the case of a promissory note and in the case of a bill of exchange by his implied contract viz that provided the drawee does not pay the bill the drawer will for which reason it is usual in bills of exchange to express that the value thereof hath been received by the draweru in order to show the consideration upon which the implied contract of repayment arises and this property so vested may be transferred and assigned from the payee to any other man contrary to the general rule of the common law that no chose in action is assignable which assignment is the life of paper credit it may therefore be of some use to mention a few of the principal incidents attending this transfer or assignment in order to make it regular and thereby to charge the drawer with the payment of the debt to other persons than those with whom he originally contracted in the first place then the payee or person to whom or whose order such bill of exchange or promissory note is payable may by endorsement or writing his name in dorso or on the back of it assign over his whole property to the bearer or else to another person by name either of whom is then called the endorsee and he may assign the same to another and so on in infinitum and a promissory note payable to a or bearer is negotiable without any endorsement and payment thereof may be demanded by any bearer      of itv but in case of a bill of exchange the payee or the endorsee whether it be a general or particular endorsement is to go to the drawee and offer his bill for acceptance which acceptance so as to charge the drawer with costs must be in writing under or on the back of the bill if the drawee accepts the bill either verbally or in writingw he then makes himself liable to pay it this being now a contract on his side grounded on an acknowledgment that the drawer has effects in his hands or at least credit sufficient to warrant the payment if the drawee refuses to accept the bill and it be of the value of  0l or upwards and expressed to be for value received   the payee or endorsee may protest it for nonacceptance which protest must be made in writing under a copy of such bill of exchange by some notary public or if no such notary be resident in the place then by any other substantial inhabitant in the presence     of two credible witnesses and notice of such protest must within fourteen days after be given to the drawer 0 but in case such bill be accepted by the drawee and after acceptance he fails or refuses to pay it within three days after it becomes due which three days are called days of grace the payee or endorsee is then to get it protested for nonpayment in the same manner and by the same persons who are to protest it in case of nonacceptance and such protest must also be notified within fourteen days after to the drawer and he on producing such protest either of nonacceptance or nonpayment is bound to make good to the payee or endorsee not only the amount of the said bills which he is bound to do within a reasonable time after nonpayment without any protest by the rules of the common lawx but also interest and all charges to be computed from the time of making such protest but if no protest be made or notified to the drawer and any damage accrues by such neglect it shall fall on the holder of the bill the bill when refused must be demanded of the drawer as soon as conveniently may be for though when one draws a bill of    0 exchange he subjects himself to the payment if the person on whom it is drawn refuses either to accept or pay yet that is with this limitation that if the bill be not paid when due the person to whom it is payable shall in convenient time give the drawer notice thereof for otherwise the law will imply it paid since it would be prejudicial to commerce if a bill might rise up to charge the drawer at any distance of time when in the mean time all reckonings and accounts may be adjusted between the drawer and the draweey if the bill be an endorsed bill and the endorsee cannot get the drawee to discharge it he may call upon either the drawer or the endorser or if the bill has been negotiated through many hands upon any of the endorsers for each endorser is a warrantor for the payment of the bill which is frequently taken in payment as much or more upon the credit of the endorser as of the drawer and if such endorser so called upon has the names of one or more endorsers prior to his own to each of whom he is properly an endorsee he is also at liberty to call upon any of them to make him satisfaction and so upwards but the first endorser has nobody to resort to but the drawer only   what has been said of bills of exchange is applicable also to promissory notes that are endorsed over and negotiated from one hand to another only that in this case as there is no drawee there can be no protest for nonacceptance or rather the law considers a promissory note in the light of a bill drawn by a man upon himself and accepted at the time of drawing and in case of nonpayment   0 by the drawer the several endorsees of the promissory note have the same remedy as upon bills of exchange against the prior endorsers chapter xxxi of title by bankruptcy the preceding chapter having treated pretty largely of the acquisition of personal property by several commercial methods we from thence shall be easily led to take into our present consideration a tenth method of transferring property which is that of x bankruptcy a title which we before lightly touched upona so far as it related to the transfer of the real estate of the bankrupt at present we are to treat of it more minutely as it principally relates to the disposition of chattels in which the property of persons concerned in trade more usually consists than in lands or tenements let us therefore first of all consider   who may become a bankrupt   what acts make a bankrupt   the proceedings on a commission of bankrupt and   in what manner an estate in goods and chattels may be transferred by bankruptcy   who may become a bankrupt a bankrupt was beforeb defined to be a trader who secretes himself or does certain other acts tending to defraud his creditors he was formerly considered merely in the light of a criminal or offenderc and in this spirit we are told by sir edward coked that we have fetched as well the name as the wickedness      of bankrupts from foreign nationse but at present the laws of bankruptcy are considered as laws calculated for the benefit of trade and founded on the principles of humanity as well as justice and to that end they confer some privileges not only on the creditors but also on the bankrupt or debtor himself on the creditors by compelling the bankrupt to give up all his effects to their use without any fraudulent concealment on the debtor by exempting him from the rigour of the general law whereby his person might be confined at the discretion of his creditor though in reality he has nothing to satisfy the debt whereas the law of bankrupts taking into consideration the sudden and unavoidable accidents to which men in trade are liable has given them the liberty of their persons and some pecuniary emoluments upon condition they surrender up their whole estate to be divided among their creditors in this respect our legislature seems to have attended to the example of the roman law i mean not the terrible law of the twelve tables whereby the creditors might cut the debtors body into pieces and each of them take his proportionable share if indeed that law de debitore in partes secando is to be understood in so very butcherly a light which many learned men have with reason doubtedf nor do i mean those less inhuman laws if they may be called so as their meaning is indisputably certain of imprisoning the debtors person in chains subjecting him to stripes and hard labour at the mercy of his rigid creditors and sometimes selling him his wife and children to perpetual foreign slavery trans tiberimg an oppression which produced so many      popular insurrections and secessions to the mons sacer but i mean the law of cession introduced by the christian emperors whereby if a     debtor ceded or yielded up all his fortune to his creditors he was secured from being dragged to a gaol omni quoque corporali cruciatu semotoh for as the emperor justly observesi inhumanum erat spoliatum fortunis suis in solidum damnari thus far was just and reasonable but as the departing from one extreme is apt to produce its opposite we find it afterwards enactedk that if the debtor by any unforeseen accident was reduced to low circumstances and would swear that he had not sufficient left to pay his debts he should not be compelled to cede or give up even that which he had in his possession a law which under a false notion of humanity seems to be fertile of perjury injustice and absurdity the laws of england more wisely have steered in the middle between both extremes providing at once against the inhumanity of the creditor who is not suffered to confine an honest bankrupt after his effects are delivered up and at the same time taking care that all his just debts shall be paid so far as the effects will extend but still they are cautious of encouraging prodigality and extravagance by this indulgence to debtors and therefore they allow the benefit of the laws of bankruptcy to none but actual traders since that set of men are generally speaking the only persons liable to accidental losses and to an inability of paying their debts without any fault of their own if persons in other situations of life run in debt without the power of payment they must take the consequences of their own indiscretion even though they meet with sudden accidents that may reduce their fortunes for the law holds it to be an unjustifiable practice for any person but a trader to encumber himself with debts of any considerable value if a gentleman or      one in a liberal profession at the time of contracting his debts has a sufficient fund to pay them the delay of payment is a species of dishonesty and a temporary injustice to his creditor and if at such time he has no sufficient fund the dishonesty and injustice is the greater he cannot therefore murmur if he suffers the punishment which he has voluntarily drawn upon himself but in mercantile transactions the case is far otherwise trade cannot be carried on without mutual credit on both sides the contracting of debts is therefore here not only justifiable but necessary and if by accidental calamities as by the loss of a ship in a tempest the failure of brother traders or by the nonpayment of persons out of trade a merchant or trader becomes incapable of discharging his own debts it is his misfortune and not his fault to the misfortunes therefore of debtors the law has given a compassionate remedy but denied it to their faults since at the same time that it provides for the security of commerce by enacting that every considerable trader may be declared a bankrupt for the benefit of his creditors as well as himself it has also to discourage extravagance declared that no one shall be capable of being made a bankrupt but only a trader nor capable of receiving the full benefit of the statutes but only an industrious trader the first statute made concerning any english bankrupts was    hen viii c   when trade began first to be properly cultivated in england which has been almost totally altered by statute    eliz c   whereby bankruptcy is confined to such persons only as have used the trade of merchandise in gross or by retail by way of bargaining exchange rechange bartering chevisancel or otherwise or have sought their living by buying and selling and by statute    jac i c    persons using the trade or profession of a scrivener receiving other mens moneys and estates into their trust and custody are also made liable to the statutes of bankruptcy and the benefits as well as the penal parts of the law are      extended as well to aliens and denizens as to naturalborn subjects being intended entirely for the protection of trade in which aliens are often as deeply concerned as natives by many subsequent statutes but lastly by statute   geo ii c  0m bankers brokers and factors are declared liable to the statutes of bankruptcy and this upon the same reason that scriveners are included by the statute of james i viz for the relief of their creditors     whom they have otherwise more opportunities of defrauding than any other set of dealers and they are properly to be looked upon as traders since they make merchandise of money in the same manner as other merchants do of goods and other movable chattels but by the same actn no farmer grazier or drover shall as such be liable to be deemed a bankrupt for though they buy and sell corn and hay and beasts in the course of husbandry yet trade is not their principal but only a collateral object their chief concern being to manure and till the ground and make the best advantage of its produce and besides the subjecting them to the laws of bankruptcy might be a means of defeating their landlords of the security which the law has given them above all others for the payment of their reserved rents wherefore also upon a similar reason a receiver of the kings taxes is not capableo as such of being a bankrupt lest the king should be defeated of those extensive remedies against his debtors which are put into his hands by the prerogative by the same statutep no person shall have a commission of bankrupt awarded against him unless at the petition of some one creditor to whom he owes  00l or of two to whom he is indebted   0l or of more to whom altogether he is indebted  00l for the law does not look upon persons whose debts amount to less to be traders considerable enough either to enjoy the benefit of the statutes themselves or to entitle the creditors for the benefit of public commerce to demand the distribution of their effects       in the interpretation of these several statutes it hath been held that buying only or selling only will not qualify a man to be a bankrupt but it must be both buying and selling and also getting a livelihood by it as by exercising the calling of a merchant a grocer a mercer or in one general word a chapman  who is one that buys and sells any thing but no handicraft     occupation where nothing is bought and sold and where therefore an extensive credit for the stock in trade is not necessary to be had will make a man a regular bankrupt as that of a husbandman a gardener and the like who are paid for their work and labourq also an innkeeper cannot as such be a bankruptr for his gain or livelihood does not arise from buying and selling in the way of merchandise but greatly from the use of his rooms and furniture his attendance and the like and though he may buy corn and victuals to sell again at a profit yet that no more makes him a trader than a schoolmaster or other person is that keeps a boardinghouse and makes considerable gains by buying and selling what he spends in the house and such a one is clearly not within the statutess but where persons buy goods and make them up into salable commodities as shoemakers smiths and the like here though part of the gain is by bodily labour and not by buying and selling yet they are within the statutes of bankruptst for the labour is only in melioration of the commodity and rendering it more fit for sale one single act of buying and selling will not make a man a trader  but a repeated practice and profit by it buying and selling bankstock or other government securities will not make a man a bankrupt they not being goods wares or merchandise within the intent of the statute by which a profit may be fairly madeu neither will buying and selling under particular restraints or for particular purposes as if      a commissioner of the navy uses to buy victuals for the fleet and dispose of the surplus and refuse he is not thereby made a trader within the statutesw an infant though a trader cannot be made a bankrupt for an infant can owe nothing but for necessaries and the statutes of bankruptcy create no new debts but only give a speedier and more effectual remedy for recovering such as were before due and no person can be made a bankrupt for debts which he is not liable at law to payx but a femecovert in london being a sole trader according to the custom is liable to a commission of bankrupty       having thus considered who may and who may not be made a bankrupt we are to inquire secondly by what acts a man may become a bankrupt a bankrupt is a trader who secretes himself or does certain other acts tending to defraud his creditors we have hitherto been employed in explaining the former part of this description a trader let us now attend to the latter who secretes himself or does certain other acts tending to defraud his creditors and in general whenever such a trader as is before described hath endeavoured to avoid his creditors or evade their just demands this hath been declared by the legislature to be an act of bankruptcy upon which a commission may be sued out for in this extrajudicial method of proceeding which is allowed merely for the benefit of commerce the law is extremely watchful to detect a man whose circumstances are declining in the first instance or at least as early as possible that the creditors may receive as large a proportion of their debts as may be and that a man may not go on wantonly wasting his substance and then claim the benefit of the statutes when he has nothing left to distribute to learn what the particular acts of bankruptcy are which render a man a bankrupt we must consult the several statutes and the resolutions formed by the courts thereon      among these may therefore be reckoned   departing from the realm whereby a man withdraws himself from the jurisdiction and coercion of the law with intent to defraud his creditorsz   departing from his own house with intent to secrete himself and avoid his creditorsa   keeping in his own house privately so as not to be seen or spoken with by his creditors except for just and necessary cause which is likewise construed to be an intention to defraud his creditors by avoiding the process of the lawb   procuring or suffering himself willingly to be arrested or outlawed or imprisoned without just and lawful cause which is likewise deemed an attempt to defraud his creditorsc   procuring his money goods chattels and effects to be attached or sequestered by any legal process which is another plain and direct endeavour to disappoint his creditors of their securityd   making any fraudulent conveyance to a friend or secret trustee of his lands tenements goods or chattels which is an act of the same suspicious nature with the laste   procuring any protection not being himself privileged by parliament in order to screen his person from arrests which also is an endeavour to elude the justice of the lawf   endeavouring or desiring by any petition to the king or bill exhibited in any of the kings courts against any creditors to compel them to take less than their just debts or to procrastinate the time of payment originally contracted for which are an acknowledgment of either his poverty or his knaveryg   lying in prison for two months or more upon arrest or other detention for debt without finding bail in order to obtain his libertyh for the inability to procure bail argues a strong deficiency in his credit owing either to his suspected poverty or ill character and his neglect to do it if able can arise only from a fraudulent intention in either of which cases it is high time for his creditors to look to themselves      and compel a distribution of his effects  0 escaping from prison after an arrest for a just debt of  00l or upwardsi for no man would break prison that was able and desirous to procure bail which brings it within the reason of the last case    neglecting to make satisfaction for any just debt to the amount of  00l within two months after service of legal process for such debt upon any trader having privilege of parliamentk      these are the several acts of bankruptcy expressly defined by the statutes relating to this title which being so numerous and the whole law of bankrupts being an innovation on the common law our courts of justice have been tender of extending or multiplying acts of bankruptcy by any construction or implication and therefore sir john holt heldl that a man removing his goods privately to prevent their being seized in execution was no act of bankruptcy for the statutes mention only fraudulent gifts to third persons and procuring them to be seized by sham process in order to defraud creditors but this though a palpable fraud yet falling within neither of those cases cannot be adjudged an act of bankruptcy so also it has been determined expressly that a bankers stopping or refusing payment is no act of bankruptcy for it is not within the description of any of the statutes and there may be good reasons for his so doing as suspicion of forgery and the like and if in consequence of such refusal he is arrested and puts in bail still it is no act of bankruptcym but if he goes to prison and lies there two months then and not before he is become a bankrupt we have seen who may be a bankrupt and what acts will make him so let us next consider   the proceedings on a commission of bankrupt so far as they affect the bankrupt himself and these depend entirely    0 on the several statutes of bankruptcy all which i shall endeavour to blend together and digest into a concise methodical order and first there must be a petition to the lord chancellor by one creditor to the amount of  00l or by two to the amount of   0l or by three or more to the amount of  00l which debts must be proved by affidavitn upon which he grants a commission to such discreet persons as to him shall seem good who are then styled commissioners of bankrupto the petitioners to prevent malicious applications must be bound in a security of  00l to make the party amends in case they do not prove him a bankrupt and if on the other hand they receive any money or effects from the bankrupt as a recompense for suing out the commission so as to receive more than their ratable dividends of the bankrupts estate they forfeit not only what they shall have so received but their whole debt these provisions are made as well to secure persons in good credit from being damnified by malicious petitions as to prevent knavish combinations between the creditors and bankrupt in order to obtain the benefit of a commission when the commission is awarded and issued the commissioners are to meet at their own expense and to take an oath for the due execution of their commission and to be allowed a sum not exceeding  0s per diem each at every sitting and no commission of bankrupt shall abate or be void upon any demise of the crownp when the commissioners have received their commission they are first to receive proof of the persons being a trader and having committed some act of bankruptcy and then to declare him a bankrupt if proved so and to give notice thereof in the gazette and at the same time to appoint three meetings at one of these meetings an election must be made of assignees or persons to whom the bankrupts estate shall be assigned and in whom it shall be vested for the benefit of the creditors which assignees are to be chosen by the major   0      part in value of the creditors who shall then have proved their debts but may be originally appointed by the commissioners and afterwards approved or rejected by the creditors but no creditor shall be admitted to vote in the choice of assignees whose debt on the balance of accounts does not amount to  0l and at the third meeting at furthest which must be on the fortysecond day after the advertisement in the gazette unless the time be enlarged by the lord chancellor the bankrupt upon notice also personally served upon him or left at his usual place of abode must surrender himself personally to the commissioners which surrender if voluntary protects him from all arrests till his final examination is past and he must thenceforth in all respects conform to the directions of the statutes of bankruptcy or in default of either surrender or conformity shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy and shall suffer death and his goods and estate shall be distributed among his creditorsq in case the bankrupt absconds or is likely to run away between the time of the commission issued and the last day of surrender he may by warrant from any judge or justice of the peace be apprehended and committed to the county gaol in order to be forthcoming to the commissioners who are also empowered immediately to grant a warrant for seizing his goods and papersr when the bankrupt appears the commissioners are to examine him touching all matters relating to his trade and effects they may also summon before them and examine the bankrupts wifes and any other person whatsoever as to all matters relating to the bankrupts affairs and in case any of them shall refuse to answer or shall not answer fully to any lawful question or shall refuse to subscribe such their examination the commissioners may commit them to prison without bail till they submit themselves and make and sign a full answer the commissioners specifying in their warrant of commitment the question so refused to be answered and any gaoler permitting such person to escape or go out of prison shall forfeit  00l to the creditorst      the bankrupt upon this examination is bound upon pain of death to make a full discovery of all his estate and effects as well in expectancy as possession and how he has disposed of the same together with all books and writings relating thereto and is to deliver up all in his own power to the commissioners except the necessary apparel of himself his wife and his children or in case he conceals or embezzles any effects to the amount of  0l or withholds any books or writings with intent to defraud his creditors he shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy and his goods and estates shall be divided among his creditorsu and unless it shall appear that his inability to pay his debts arose from some casual loss he may upon conviction by indictment of such gross misconduct and negligence be set upon the pillory for two hours and have one of his ears nailed to the same and cut offv after the time allowed to the bankrupt for such discovery is expired any other person voluntarily discovering any part of his estate before unknown to the assignees shall be entitled to five per cent out of the effects so discovered and such further reward as the assignees and commissioners shall think proper and any trustee wilfully concealing the estate of any bankrupt after the expiration of twoandforty days shall forfeit  00l and double the value of the estate concealed to the creditorsw hitherto every thing is in favour of the creditors and the law seems to be pretty rigid and severe against the bankrupt but in case he proves honest it makes him full amends for all this rigour and severity for if the bankrupt hath made an ingenuous discovery of the truth and sufficiency of which there remains no reason to doubt and hath conformed in all points to the directions of the law and if in consequence thereof the creditors or four parts in five of them in number and value but none of them creditors for less than  0l     will sign a certificate to that purport the commissioners are then to authenticate such certificate under their hands and seals and to transmit it to the lord chancellor and he or two of the judges whom he shall appoint on oath      made by the bankrupt that such certificate was obtained without fraud may allow the same or disallow it upon cause shown by any of the creditors of the bankruptx if no cause be shown to the contrary the certificate is allowed of course and then the bankrupt is entitled to a decent and reasonable allowance out of his effects for his future support and maintenance and to put him in a way of honest industry this allowance is also in proportion to his former good behaviour in the early discovery of the decline of his affairs and thereby giving his creditors a larger dividend for if his effects will not pay onehalf of his debts or ten shillings in the pound he is left to the discretion of the commissioners and assignees to have a competent sum allowed him not exceeding three per cent but if they pay ten shillings in the pound he is to be allowed five per cent if twelve shillings and sixpence then seven and a half per cent and if fifteen shillings in the pound then the bankrupt shall be allowed ten per cent provided that such allowance do not in the first case exceed  00l in the second   0l and in the third  00ly besides this allowance he has also an indemnity granted him of being free and discharged forever from all debts owing by him at the time he became a bankrupt even though judgment shall have been obtained against him and he lies in prison upon execution for such debts and for that among other purposes all proceedings on commissions of bankrupt are on petition to be entered of record as a perpetual bar against actions to be commenced on this account though in general the production of the certificate properly allowed shall be sufficient evidence of all previous proceedingsz thus      the bankrupt becomes a clear man again and by the assistance of his allowance and his own industry may become a useful member of the commonwealth which is the rather to be expected as he cannot be entitled to these benefits unless his failures have been owing to misfortunes rather than to misconduct and extravagance for no allowance or indemnity shall be given to a bankrupt unless his certificate be signed and allowed as before mentioned and also if any creditor produces a fictitious debt and the bankrupt does not make discovery of it but suffers the fair creditors to be imposed upon he loses all title to these advantagesa neither can he claim them if he has given with any of his children above  00l for a marriage portion unless he had at that time sufficient left to pay all his debts or if he has lost at any one time  l or in the whole  00l within a twelvemonth before he became bankrupt by any manner of gaming or wagering whatsoever or within the same time has lost the value of  00l by stockjobbing also to prevent the too common practice of frequent or fraudulent or careless breaking a mark is set upon such as have been once cleared by a commission of bankrupt or have compounded with their creditors or have been delivered by an act of insolvency which is an occasional act frequently passed by the legislature whereby all persons whatsoever who are either in too low a way of dealing to become bankrupts or not being in a mercantile state of life are not included within the laws of bankruptcy are discharged from all suits and imprisonment upon delivering up all their estate and effects to their creditors upon oath at the sessions or assizes in which case their perjury or fraud is usually as in case of bankrupts punished with death persons who have been once cleared by any of these methods and afterwards become bankrupts again unless they pay full      fifteen shillings in the pound are only thereby indemnified as to the confinement of their bodies but any future     estate they shall acquire remains liable to their creditors excepting their necessary apparel household goods and the tools and implements of their tradesb thus much for the proceedings on a commission of bankrupt so far as they affect the bankrupt himself personally let us next consider   how such proceedings affect or transfer the estate and property of the bankrupt the method whereby a real estate in lands tenements and hereditaments may be transferred by bankruptcy was shown under its proper head in a former chapterc at present therefore we are only to consider the transfer of things personal by this operation of law by virtue of the statutes before mentionedd all the personal estate and effects of the bankrupt are considered as vested by the act of bankruptcy in the future assignees of his commissioners whether they be goods in actual possession or debts contracts and other choses in action and the commissioners by their warrant may cause any house or tenement of the bankrupt to be broken open in order to enter upon and seize the same and when the assignees are chosen or approved by the creditors the commissioners are to assign every thing over to them and the property of every part of the estate is thereby as fully vested in them as it was in the bankrupt himself and they have the same remedies to recover ite  the property vested in the assignees is the whole that the bankrupt had in himself at the time he committed the first act of bankruptcy or that has been vested in him since before his debts are satisfied or agreed for therefore it is usually said that once a bankrupt and always a bankrupt by which is meant that a plain direct act of bankruptcy once      committed cannot be purged or explained away by any subsequent conduct as a dubious equivocal act may bef but that if a commission is afterwards awarded the commission and the property of the assignees shall have a relation or reference back to the first and original act of bankruptcyg inasmuch that all transactions of the bankrupt are from that time absolutely null and void either with regard to the alienation of his property or the receipt of his debts from such as are privy to his bankruptcy for they are no longer his property or his debts but those of the future assignees and if an execution be sued out but not served and executed on the bankrupts effects till after the act of bankruptcy it is void as against the assignees but the king is not bound by this fictitious relation nor is he within the statutes of bankruptsh for if after the act of bankruptcy committed and before the assignment of his effects an extent issues for the debt of the crown the goods are bound therebyi in france this doctrine of relation is carried to a very great length for there every act of a merchant for ten days precedent to the act of bankruptcy is presumed to be fraudulent and therefore voidk but with us the law stands upon a more reasonable footing for as these acts of bankruptcy may sometimes be secret to all but a few and it would be prejudicial to trade to carry this notion to its utmost length it is provided by statute    geo ii c    that no money paid by a bankrupt to a bonâ fide or real creditor in the course of trade even after an     act of bankruptcy done shall be liable to be refunded nor by statute   jac i c    shall any debtor of a bankrupt that pays him his debt without knowing of his bankruptcy be liable to account for it again the intention of this relative power being only to reach fraudulent transactions and not to distress the fair trader the assignees may pursue any legal method of recovering this property so vested in them by their own authority but      cannot commence a suit in equity nor compound any debts owing to the bankrupt nor refer any matters to arbitration without the consent of the creditors or the major part of them in value at a meeting to be held in pursuance of notice in the gazettel when they have got in all the effects they can reasonably hope for and reduced them to ready money the assignees must after four and within twelve months after the commission issued give oneandtwenty days notice to the creditors of a meeting for dividend or distribution at which time they must produce their accounts and verify them upon oath if required and then the commissioners shall direct a dividend to be made at so much in the pound to all creditors who have before proved or shall then prove their debts this dividend must be made equally and in a ratable proportion to all the creditors according to the quantity of their debts no regard being had to the quality of them mortgages indeed for which the creditor has a real security in his own hands are entirely safe for the commission of bankrupt reaches only the equity of redemptionm so are also personal debts where the creditor has a chattel in his hands as a pledge or pawn for the payment or has taken the debtors lands or goods in execution and upon the equity of the statute   anne c    which directs that upon all executions of goods being on any premises demised to a tenant one years rent and no more shall if due be paid to the landlord it hath also been held that under a commission of bankrupt which is in the nature of a statuteexecution the landlord shall be allowed his arrears of rent to the same amount in preference to other creditors even though he had neglected to distrein while the goods remained on the premises which he is otherwise entitled to do for his entire rent be the quantum what it mayn but otherwise judgments and recognizances both which are debts of record and therefore at other times have a priority and also bonds and obligations by deed or special instrument which are called debts by specialty and are usually the next      in order these are all put on a level with debts by mere simple contract and all paid pari passuo nay so far is this matter carried that by the express provision of the statutep debts not due at the time of the dividends made as bonds or notes of hand payable at a future day certain shall be proved and paid equally with the restq allowing a discount or drawback in proportion and insurances and obligations upon bottomry or respondentia bonâ fide made by the bankrupt though forfeited after the commission is awarded shall be looked upon in the same light as debts contracted before any act of bankruptcyr within eighteen months after the commission issued a second and final dividend shall be made unless all the effects were exhausted by the firsts and if any surplus remains after selling his estates and paying every creditor his full debt it shall be restored to the bankruptt this is a case which sometimes happens to men in trade who involuntarily or at least unwarily commit acts of bankruptcy by absconding and the like while their effects are more than sufficient to pay their creditors and if any suspicious or malevolent creditor will take the advantage of such acts and sue out a commission the bankrupt has no remedy but must quietly submit to the effects of his own imprudence except that upon satisfaction made to all the creditors the commission may be supersededu this case may also happen when a knave is desirous of defrauding his creditors and is compelled by a commission to do them that justice     which otherwise he wanted to evade and therefore though the usual rule is that all interest on debts carrying interest shall cease from the time of issuing the commission yet in case of a surplus left after payment of every debt such interest shall again revive and be chargeable on the bankruptw or his representatives chapter xxxii of title by testament and administration there yet remain to be examined in the present chapter two other methods of acquiring personal estates—viz by testament and administration and these i propose to consider in one and the same view they being in their nature so connected and blended together as makes it impossible to treat of them distinctly without manifest tautology and repetition xi xii in the pursuit then of this jointsubject i shall first inquire into the original and antiquity of testaments and administrations shall secondly show who is capable of making a last will and testament shall thirdly consider the nature of a testament and its incidents shall fourthly show what an executor and administrator are and how they are to be appointed and lastly shall select some few of the general heads of the office and duty of executors and administrators first as to the original of testaments and administrations we have more than once observed that when property came to be vested in individuals by the right of occupancy it became necessary for the peace of society that this occupancy should be continued not only in the present possessor but in those persons to whom he should think proper to transfer it which introduced the doctrine and practice of alienations    0 gifts and contracts but these precautions would be very short and imperfect if they were confined to the life only of the occupier for then upon his death all his goods would again become common and create an infinite variety of strife and confusion the law of very many societies has therefore given to the proprietor a right of continuing his property after his death in such persons as he shall name and in defect of such appointment or nomination or where no nomination is permitted the law of every society has directed the goods to be vested in certain particular individuals exclusive of all other personsa the former method of acquiring personal property according to the express directions of the deceased we call a testament the latter which is also according to the will of the deceased not expressed indeed but presumed by the lawb we call in england an administration being the same which the civil lawyers term a succession ab intestato and which answers to the descent or inheritance of real estates testaments are of very high antiquity we find them in use among the antient hebrews though i hardly think the example usually givenc of abrahams complainingd that unless he had some children of his body his steward eliezer of damascus would be his heir is quite conclusive to show that he had made him so by will and indeed a learned writere has adduced this very passage to prove that in the patriarchal age on failure of children or kindred the servants born under their masters roof succeeded to the inheritance as heirsatlawf but to omit what eusebius and others have related of noahs testament made in writing and witnessed under his seal whereby he disposed of the whole worldg i apprehend that a much more authentic instance of the early use of testaments may be found in the sacred writingsh   0 wherein jacob bequeaths to his son joseph a portion of his      inheritance double to that of his brethren which will we find carried into execution many hundred years afterwards when the posterity of joseph were divided into two distinct tribes those of ephraim and manasseh and had two several inheritances assigned them whereas the descendants of each of the other patriarchs formed only one single tribe and had only one lot of inheritance solon was the first legislator that introduced wills into athensi but in many other parts of greece they were totally discountenancedk in rome they were unknown till the laws of the twelve tables were compiled  which first gave the right of bequeathingl and among the northern nations particularly among the germansm testaments were not received into use and this variety may serve to evince that the right of making wills and disposing of property after death is merely a creature of the civil staten which has permitted it in some countries and denied it in others and even where it is permitted by law it is subjected to different formalities and restrictions in almost every nation under heaveno with us in england this power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the law for we have no traces or memorials of any time when it did not exist mention is made of intestacy in the old law before the conquest as being merely accidental and the distribution of the intestates estate after payment of the lords heriot is then directed to go according to the established law sive quis incuria sive morte repentina fuerit intestatus mortuus dominus tamen nullam rerum suarum partem præter eam quæ jure debetur hereoti nomine sibi assumito verum possessiones uxori liberis et cognatione proximis pro suo cuique jure distribuanturp but we are not to imagine that this power of bequeathing extended originally to all a mans personal estate on the contrary glanvil informs usq that by the common law      as it stood in the reign of henry the second a mans goods were to be divided into three equal parts of which one went to his heirs or lineal descendants another to his wife and the third was at his own disposal or if he died without a wife he might then dispose of one moiety and the other went to his children and so e converso if he had no children the wife was entitled to one moiety and he might bequeath the other but if he died without either wife or issue the whole     was at his own disposalr the shares of the wife and children were called their reasonable parts and the writ de rationabili parte bonorum was given to recover thems this continued to be the law of the land at the time of magna carta which provides that the kings debts shall first of all be levied and then the residue of the goods shall go to the executor to perform the will of the deceased and if nothing be owing to the crown omnia catalla cedant defuncto salvis uxori ipsius et pueris suis rationabilibus partibus suist in the reign of king edward the third this right of the wife and children was still held to be the universal or common lawu though frequently pleaded as the local custom of berks devon and other countiesw and sir henry finch lays it down expresslyx in the reign of charles the first to be the general law of the land but this law is at present altered by imperceptible degrees and the deceased may now by will bequeath the whole of his goods and chattels though we cannot trace out when first this alteration began indeed sir edward cokey is of opinion that this never was      the general law but only obtained in particular places by special custom and to establish that doctrine he relies on a passage in bracton which in truth when compared with the context makes directly against his opinion for bractonz lays down the doctrine of the reasonable part to be the common law but mentions that as a particular exception which sir edward coke has hastily cited for the general rule and glanvil magna carta fleta the yearbooks fitzherbert and finch do all agree with bracton that this right to the pars rationabilis was by the common law which also continues to this day to be the general law of our sister kingdom of scotlanda to which we may add that whatever may have been the custom of later years in many parts of the kingdom or however it was introduced in derogation of the old common law the antient method continued in use in the province of york the principality of wales and in the city of london till very modern times when in order to favour the power of bequeathing and to reduce the whole kingdom to the same standard three statutes have been provided the one      w and m c   explained by      anne c   for the province of york another      w iii c    for wales and a third    geo i c    for london whereby it is enacted that persons within those districts and liable to those customs may if they think proper dispose of all their personal estates by will and the claims of the widow children and other relations to the contrary are totally barred thus is the old common law now utterly abolished throughout all the kingdom of england and a man may devise the whole of his chattels as freely as he formerly could his third part or moiety in disposing of which he was bound by the custom of many places as was stated in a former chapterb to remember his lord and the church by leaving them his two best chattels which was the original of heriots and mortuaries and afterwards he was left at his own liberty to bequeath the remainder as he pleased      in case a person made no disposition of such of his goods as were testable whether that were only part or the whole of them he was and is said to die intestate and in such case it is said that by the old law the king was entitled to seize upon his goods as the parens patriæ and general trustee of the kingdomc this prerogative the king continued to exercise for some time by his own ministers of justice and probably in the county court where matters of all kinds were determined and it was granted as a franchise to many lords of manors and others who have to this day a prescriptive right to grant administration to their intestate tenants and suitors in their own courtsbaron     and other courts or to have their wills there proved in case they made any dispositiond afterwards the crown in favour of the church invested the prelates with this branch of the prerogative which was done saith perkinse because at was intended by the law that spiritual men are of better conscience than laymen and that they had more knowledge what things would conduce to the benefit of the soul of the deceased the goods therefore of intestates were given to the ordinary by the crown and he might seize them and keep them without wasting and also might give aliene or sell them at his will and dispose of the money in pios usus and if he did otherwise he broke the confidence which the law reposed in himf so that properly the whole interest and power which were granted to the ordinary were only those of being the kings almoner within his diocese in trust to distribute the intestates goods in charity to the poor or in such superstitious uses as the mistaken zeal of the times had denominated piousg and as he had thus the disposition of intestates effects the probate of wills of course followed for it was thought just and natural that the will of the deceased should be proved to the satisfaction of the prelate whose right of distributing his chattels for the good of his soul was effectually superseded thereby      the goods of the intestate being thus vested in the ordinary upon the most solemn and conscientious trust the reverend prelates were therefore not accountable to any but to god and themselves for their conducth but even in fletas time it was complainedi quod ordinarii hujusmodi bona nomine ecclesiæ occupantes nullam vel saltem indebitam faciunt distributionem and to what a length of iniquity this abuse was carried most evidently appears from a gloss of pope innocent ivk written about the year    0 wherein he lays it down for established canon law that in britannia tertia pars bonorum decedentium ab intestato in opus ecclesiæ et pauperum dispensanda est thus the popish clergy took to themselvesl under the name of the church and poor the whole residue of the deceaseds estate after the partes rationabiles or twothirds of the wife and children were deducted without paying even his lawful debts or other charges thereon for which reason it was enacted by the statute of westm  m that the ordinary shall be bound to pay the debts of the intestate so far as his goods will extend in the same manner that executors were bound in case the deceased had left a will a use more truly pious than any requiem or mass for his soul this was the first check given to that exorbitant power which the law had intrusted with ordinaries but though they were now made liable to the creditors of the intestate for their just and lawful demands yet the residuum after payment of debts remained still in their hands to be applied to whatever purposes the conscience of the ordinary shall approve the flagrant abuses of which power occasioned the legislature again to interpose in order to prevent the ordinaries from keeping any longer the administration in their own hands or those of their immediate      dependents and therefore the statute    edw iii c    provides that in case of intestacy the ordinary shall depute the nearest and most lawful friends of the deceased to administer his goods which administrators are put upon the same footing with regard to suits and to accounting as executors appointed by will this is the original of administrators as they at present stand who are only the officers of the ordinary appointed by him in pursuance of this statute which singles out the next and most lawful friend of the intestate who is interpretedn to be the next of blood that is under no legal disabilities the statute    hen viii c   enlarges a little more the power of the ecclesiastical judge and permits him to grant administration either to the widow or the next of kin or to both of them at his own discretion and where two or more persons are in the same degree of kindred gives the ordinary his election to accept whichever he pleases     upon this footing stands the general law of administrations at this day i shall in the further progress of this chapter mention a few more particulars with regard to who may and who may not be administrator and what he is bound to do when he has taken this charge upon him what has been hitherto remarked only serving to show the original and gradual progress of testaments and administrations in what manner the latter was first of all vested in the bishops by the royal indulgence and how it was afterwards by authority of parliament taken from them in effect by obliging them to commit all their power to particular persons nominated expressly by the law i proceed now secondly to inquire who may or may not make a testament or what persons are absolutely obliged by law to die intestate and this lawo is entirely prohibitory for regularly every person hath full power and liberty to make a will that is not under some special prohibition by law or custom which prohibitions are principally upon three      accounts for want of sufficient discretion for want of sufficient liberty and free will and on account of their criminal conduct   in the first species are to be reckoned infants under the age of fourteen if males and twelve if females which is the rule of the civil lawp for though some of our common lawyers have held that an infant of any age even four  years old might make a testamentq and others have denied that under eighteen he is capabler yet as the ecclesiastical court is the judge of every testators capacity this case must be governed by the rules of the ecclesiastical law so that no objection can be admitted to the will of an infant of fourteen merely for want of age but if the testator was not of sufficient discretion whether at the age of fourteen or fourandtwenty that will overthrow his testament madmen or otherwise non compotes idiots or natural fools persons grown childish by reason of old age or distemper  such as have their senses besotted with drunkenness —all these are incapable by reason of mental disability to make any will so long as such disability lasts to this class also may be referred such persons as are born deaf blind and dumb who as they have always wanted the common inlets of understanding are incapable of having animum testandi and their testaments are therefore void   such persons as are intestable for want of liberty or freedom of will are by the civil law of various kinds as prisoners captives and the likes but the law of england does not make such persons absolutely intestable but only leaves it to the discretion of the court to judge upon the consideration of their     particular circumstances of duress whether or no such person could be supposed to have liberum animum testandi and with regard to femecoverts our law differs still more materially from the civil among the romans there was no distinction a married woman was as capable of bequeathing as a femesolet but with us a      married woman is not only utterly incapable of devising lands being excepted out of the statute of wills        hen viii c   but also she is incapable of making a testament of chattels without the license of her husband for all her personal chattels are absolutely his and he may dispose of her chattels real or shall have them to himself if he survives her it would be therefore extremely inconsistent to give her a power of defeating that provision of the law by bequeathing those chattels to anotheru yet by her husbands license she may make a testamentv and the husband upon marriage frequently covenants with her friends to allow her that license but such license is more properly his assent for unless it be given to the particular will in question it will not be a complete testament even though the husband beforehand hath given her permission to make a willw yet it shall be sufficient to repel the husband from his general right of administering his wifes effects and administration shall be granted to her appointee with such testamentary paper annexedx so that in reality the woman makes no will at all but only something like a willy operating in the nature of an appointment the execution of which the husband by his bond agreement or covenant is bound to allow a distinction similar to which we meet with in the civil law for though a son who was in potestate parentis could not by any means make a formal and legal testament even though his father permitted itz yet he might with the like permission of his father make what was called a donatio mortis causaa the queenconsort is an exception to this general rule for she may dispose of her chattels by will without the consent of her lordb and any femecovert may make her will of goods which are in her possession in auter droit as executrix or administratrix for these can never be the property of her husbandc and if she has any pinmoney or separate maintenance it is said she may dispose of her savings thereout      by testament without the control of her husbandd but if a femesole makes her will and afterwards marries such subsequent marriage is esteemed a revocation in law and entirely vacates the wille   persons incapable of making testaments on account of their criminal conduct are in the first place all traitors and felons from the time of conviction for then their goods and chattels are no longer at their own disposal but forfeited to the king  neither can a felo de se make a will of goods and chattels for they are forfeited by the act and manner of his death but he may make a devise of his lands for they are not subjected to any forfeituref  outlaws also though it be but for debt are incapable of making a will so long as the outlawry subsists for their goods and chattels are forfeited during that timeg as for persons guilty of other crimes short of felony who are by the civil law precluded from making testaments as usurers libellers and others     of a worse stamp by the common law their testaments may be goodh and in general the rule is and has been so at least ever since glanvils timei quod libera sit cujuscunque ultima voluntas let us next thirdly consider what this last will and testament is which almost every one is thus at liberty to make or what are the nature and incidents of a testament testaments both justinianj and sir edward cokek agree to be so called because they are testatio mentis an etymon which seems to savour too much of the conceit it being plainly a substantive derived from the verb testari in like manner as juramentum incrementum and others from other verbs the definition of the old roman lawyers is much better than their etymology—voluntatis nostræ justa sententia de eo quod quis post mortem suam fieri velitl which may be thus rendered into english the legal declaration of a mans intentions   00 which he wills to be performed after his death it is called sententia to denote the circumspection and prudence with which it is supposed to be made it is voluntatis nostræ sententia because its efficacy depends on its declaring the testators intention whence in england it is emphatically styled his will it is justa sententia that is drawn attested and published with all due solemnities and forms of law it is de eo quod quis post mortem suam fieri velit because a testament is of no force till after the death of the testator these testaments are divided into two sorts written and verbal or nuncupative of which the former is committed to writing the latter depends merely upon oral evidence being declared by the testator in extremis before a sufficient number of witnesses and afterwards reduced to writing a codicil codicillus a little book or writing is a supplement to a will or an addition made by the testator and annexed to and to be taken as part of a testament being for its explanation or alteration or to make some addition to or else some subtraction from the former disposition of the testatorm this may also be either written or nuncupative but as nuncupative wills and codicils which were formerly more in use than at present when the art of writing is become more universal are liable to great impositions and may occasion many perjuries the statute of frauds    car ii c   hath laid them under many restrictions except when made by mariners at sea and soldiers in actual service as to all other persons it enacts   that no written will shall be revoked or altered by a subsequent nuncupative one except the same be in the lifetime of the testator reduced to writing and read over to him and approved  and unless the same be proved to have been so done by the oaths of three witnesses at the least who by statute      anne c    must be such as are admissible upon trials at common law   that no nuncupative will shall in any wise be good where the estate bequeathed exceeds  0l unless proved by three such witnesses present at the making thereof the roman law requiring sevenn and unless they or some of them were specially required to bear   0  witness thereto by the testator himself and unless it was made in his last sickness in his own habitation or dwellinghouse or where he had been previously resident ten days at the least except he be surprised with sickness on a journey or from home and dies without returning to his dwelling   that no nuncupative will shall be proved by the witnesses after six months from the making unless it were put in writing within six days nor shall it be proved  0  till fourteen days after the death of the testator nor till process hath first issued to call in the widow or next of kin to contest it if they think proper thus hath the legislature provided against any frauds in setting up nuncupative wills by so numerous a train of requisites that the thing itself has fallen into disuse  and is hardly ever heard of but in the only instance where favour ought to be shown to it when the testator is surprised by sudden and violent sickness the testamentary words must be spoken with an intent to bequeath not any loose idle discourse in his illness for he must require the bystanders to bear witness of such his intention the will must be made at home or among his family or friends unless by unavoidable accident to prevent impositions from strangers it must be in his last sickness for if he recovers he may alter his dispositions and has time to make a written will it must not be proved at too long a distance from the testators death lest the words should escape the memory of the witnesses nor yet too hastily and without notice lest the family of the testator should be put to inconvenience or surprised  as to written wills they need not any witness of their publication i speak not here of devises of lands which are quite of a different nature being conveyances by statute unknown to the feodal or common law and not under the same jurisdiction as personal testaments but a testament of chattels written in the testators own hand though it has neither his name nor seal to it nor witnesses present at its publication is good provided sufficient proof can be had that it is his handwritingo and though   0  written in another mans hand and never signed by the testator yet if proved to be according to his instructions and approved by him it hath been held a good  0  testament of the personal estatep yet it is the safer and more prudent way and leaves less in the breast of the ecclesiastical judge if it be signed or sealed by the testator and published in the presence of witnesses which last was always required in the time of bractonq or rather he in this respect has implicitly copied the rule of the civil law 0 no testament is of any effect till after the death of the testator nam omne testamentum morte consummatum est et voluntas testatoris est ambulatoria usque ad mortemr   and therefore if there be many testaments the last overthrows all the formers but the republication of a former will revokes one of a later date and establishes the first againt   hence it follows that testaments may be avoided three ways   if made by a person labouring under any of the incapacities before mentioned   by making another testament of a later date and   by cancelling or revoking it for though i make a last will and testament irrevocable in the strongest words yet i am at liberty to revoke it because my own act or words cannot alter the disposition of law so as to make that irrevocable which is in its own nature revocableu for this saith lord baconw would be for a man to deprive himself of that which of all other things is most incident to human condition and that is alteration or repentance it hath also been held that without an express revocation if a man who hath made his will afterwards marries and hath a child this is a presumptive or implied revocation of his former will which he made in his state of celibacyx   the romans were also wont to set aside testaments as being inofficiosa deficient in natural duty if they disinherited or totally passed by without assigning a true and suf  0  ficient reasony any of the children of the testatorz but if the child had any legacy though ever so small it was a proof that the testator had not lost his memory or his reason which otherwise the law presumed but was then supposed to have acted thus for some substantial cause  0  and in such case no querela inofficiosi testamenti was allowed hence probably has arisen that groundless vulgar error of the necessity of leaving the heir a shilling or some other express legacy in order to disinherit him effectually whereas the law of england makes no such constrained suppositions of forgetfulness or insanity and therefore though the heir or next of kin be totally omitted it admits no querela inofficiosi to set aside such a testament   we are next to consider fourthly what is an executor and what an administrator and how they are both to be appointed an executor is he to whom another man commits by will the execution of that his last will and testament and all persons are capable of being executors that are capable of making wills and many others besides as femecoverts   and infants nay even infants unborn or in ventre sa mere may be made executorsa but no infant can act as such till the age of seventeen years till which time administration must be granted to some other durante minore ætateb in like manner as it may be granted durante absentia or pendente lite when the executor is out of the realmc or when a suit is commenced in the ecclesiastical court touching the validity of the willd this appointment of an executor is essential to the making of a wille and it may be performed either by express words or such as strongly imply the same   but if the testator makes an incomplete will without naming any executors or if he names incapable persons or if the executors named refuse to act in any of these cases the ordinary must   0  grant administration cum testamento annexof to some other person and then the duty of the administrator as also when he is constituted only durante minore ætate c of another is very little different from that of an executor and this was law so early as the reign of henry ii when glanvilg informs us that testamenti executores esse debent ii quos testator ad hoc elegerit et quibus curam ipse commiserit si vero testator nullos ad hoc nominaverit possunt propinqui et consanguinei ipsius defuncti ad id faciendum se ingerere but if the deceased died wholly intestate without making either will or executors then general letters of administration must be granted by the ordinary to such administrator as the statutes of edward the third and henry the eighth before mentioned direct in consequence of which we may observe   that the ordinary is compellable to grant administration of the goods and chattels of the wife to the husband or his representativesh and of the husbands effects to the widow or next of kin but he may grant it to either or both at his discretioni   that among the kindred those are to be preferred that are the nearest in degree to the intestate but of persons in equal degree the ordinary may take which he pleasesk   that this nearness or propinquity of degree shall be reckoned according to the computation of the civiliansl  0  and not of the canonists which the law of england adopts in the descent of real estatesm because in the civil computation the intestate himself is the terminus a quo the several degrees are numbered and not the common ancestor according to the rule of the canonists and therefore in the first place the children or on failure of children the parents of the deceased are entitled to the administration both which are indeed in the first degree but   0  with usn the children are allowed the preferenceo then follow brothersp grandfathersq uncles or nephewsr and the females of each class respectively and lastly cousins   the halfblood is admitted to the administration as well as the whole for they are of the kindred of the intestate and only excluded from inheritances of land upon feodal reasons therefore the brother of the halfblood shall exclude the uncle of the whole bloods and the ordinary may grant administration to the sister of the half or the brother of the whole blood at his own discretiont   if none of the kindred will take out administration a creditor may by custom do itu   if the executor refuses or dies intestate the administration may be granted to the residuary legatee in exclusion of the next of kinw   and lastly the ordinary may in defect of all these commit administration as he might have donex before the statute of edward iii to such discreet person as he approves of or may grant letters ad colligendum bona defuncti which neither makes him executor nor administrator his only business being to keep the goods in his safe custodyy and to do other acts for the benefit of such as are entitled to the property of the deceasedz if a bastard who has no kindred being nullius filius or any one else that has no kindred dies intestate and without wife or child it hath formerly been helda that the ordinary might seize his goods and dispose of them in pios usus but the usual course now is for some one to procure letters  0  patent or other authority from the king and then the ordinary of course grants administration to such appointee of the crownb the interest vested in the executor by the will of the deceased may be continued and kept alive by the will of the same executor so that the executor of as executor is to all intents and purposes the executor and representative of a himselfc but the executor of as administrator or the administrator of as executor is not the representative of ad for the power of an executor is founded upon the special confidence and actual appointment of the deceased and such executor is therefore allowed to transmit that power to another in whom he has equal confidence but the administrator of a is merely the officer of the ordinary prescribed to him by act of parliament in whom the deceased has reposed no trust at all and therefore on the death of that officer it results back to the ordinary to appoint another and with regard to the administrator of as executor he has clearly no privity or relation to a being only commissioned to administer the effects of the intestate executor and not of the original testator wherefore in both these cases and whenever the course of representation from executor to executor is interrupted by any one administration it is necessary for the ordinary to commit administration afresh of the goods of the deceased not administered by the former executor or administrator and this administrator de bonis non is the only legal representative of the deceased in matters of personal propertye but he may as well as an original administrator have only a limited or special administration  0  committed to his care viz of certain specific effects such as a term of years and the like the rest being committed to othersf   0  having thus shown what is and who may be an executor or administrator i proceed now fifthly and lastly to inquire into some few of the principal points of their office and duty these in general are very much the same in both executors and administrators excepting first that the executor is bound to perform a will which an administrator is not unless where a testament is annexed to his administration and then he differs still less from an executor and secondly that an executor may do many acts before he proves the willg   but an administrator may do nothing   till letters of administration are issued for the former derives his power from the will and not from the probateh the latter owes his entirely to the appointment of the ordinary if a stranger takes upon him to act as executor without any just authority as by intermeddling with the goods of the deceasedi and many other transactionsk he is called in law an executor of his own wrong de son tort   and is liable to all the trouble of an executorship without any of the profits or advantages but merely doing acts of necessity or humanity as locking up the goods or burying the corpse of the deceased will not amount to such an intermeddling as will charge a man as executor of his own wrongl such a one cannot bring an action himself in right of the deceasedm 0 but actions may be brought against him and in all actions by creditors against such an officious intruder he shall be named an executor generallyn for the most obvious conclusion which strangers can form from his conduct is that he hath a will of the deceased wherein he is named executor but hath not yet taken probate thereofo he is chargeable with the debts of the deceased so far as assets come to his handsp and as against creditors in general shall be allowed all payments made to any other creditor in the same or a superior degreeq   0  himself only exceptedr and though as against the rightful executor and administrator he cannot plead such payment yet it shall be allowed him in mitigation of damagess unless perhaps upon a deficiency of assets whereby  0  the rightful executor may be prevented from satisfying his own debtt   but let us now see what are the power and duty of a rightful executor or administrator   he must bury the deceased in a manner suitable to the estate which he leaves behind him necessary funeral expenses are allowed previous to all other debts and charges but if the executor or administrator be extravagant it is a species of devastation or waste of the substance of the deceased and shall only be prejudicial to himselfu and not to the creditors or legatees of the deceased   the executor or the administrator durante minore ætate or durante absentia or cum testamento annexo must prove the will of the deceased which is done either in common form which is only upon his own oath before the ordinary or his surrogate or per testes in more solemn form of law in case the validity of the will be disputedw when the will is so proved the original must be deposited in the registry of the ordinary and a copy thereof in parchment is made out under the seal of the ordinary and delivered to the executor or administrator together with a certificate of its having been proved before him all which together is usually styled the probate in defect of any will the person entitled to be administrator must also at this period take out letters of administration under the seal of the ordinary whereby an executorial power to collect and administer that is dispose of the goods of the deceased is vested in him and he must by statute        car ii c  0 enter into a bond with sureties faithfully to execute his trust if all the goods of the deceased lie within the same jurisdiction a probate before the   0  ordinary or an administration granted by him are the only proper ones but if the deceased had bona notabilia or chattels to the value of a hundred shillings in two distinct dioceses or jurisdictions then the will must be proved or administration taken out before the metropolitan of the province by way of special prerogativex whence the courts where the validity of such wills is tried and the offices where they are registered are called the prerogative courts and the prerogative offices of the provinces of canterbury and york lyndewode who flourished in the beginning of the fifteenth century and was official to archbishop chichele interprets these hundred shillings to signify solidos legales of which he tells us seventytwo amounted to a pound of gold which in his time was valued at fifty nobles or   l   s  d he therefore computesy that the hundred shillings which constituted bona notabilia were then equal in current money to   l  s 0¼d this will account for what is said in our antient books that bona notabilia in the diocese of londonz and indeed everywhere elsea were of the value of ten pounds by composition for if we pursue the calculations of lyndewode to their full extent and consider that a pound of gold is now almost equal in value to a hundred and fifty nobles we shall extend the present amount of bona notabilia to nearly  0l but the makers of the canons of   0  understood this antient rule to be meant of the shillings current in the reign of james i and have therefore directedb that five pounds shall for the future be the standard of bona notabilia so as to make the probate fall within the archiepiscopal prerogative which prerogative properly understood is grounded upon this reasonable foundation that as the bishops were themselves originally the administrators to all intestates in their own diocese and as the present administrators are in effect no other than their officers or substitutes it was impossible for the bishops or those who acted under them to collect  0  any goods of the deceased other than such as lay within their    0 own dioceses beyond which their episcopal authority extends not but it would be extremely troublesome if as many administrations were to be granted as there are dioceses within which the deceased had bona notabilia besides the uncertainty which creditors and legatees would be at in case different administrators were appointed to ascertain the fund out of which their demands are to be paid a prerogative is therefore very prudently vested in the metropolitan of each province to make in such cases one administration serve for all this accounts very satisfactorily for the reason of taking out administration to intestates that have large and diffusive property in the prerogative court and the probate of wills naturally follows as was before observed the powers of granting administrations in order to satisfy the ordinary that the deceased has in a legal manner by appointing his own executor excluded him and his officers from the privilege of administering the effects   the executor or administrator is to make an inventoryc of all the goods and chattels whether in possession or action of the deceased which he is to deliver in to the ordinary upon oath if thereunto lawfully required     he is to collect all the goods and chattels so inventoried and to that end he has very large powers and interests conferred on him by law being the representative of the deceasedd and having the same property in his goods as the principal had when living and the same remedies to recover them and if there be two or more executors a sale or release by one of them shall be good against all the reste but in case of administrators it is otherwisef   whatever is so recovered that is of a salable nature and may be converted into ready money is called assets in the hands of the executor or administratorg that is sufficient or enough from the french assez to make him chargeable to a creditor or legatee so far as such goods and chattels extend      whatever assets so come to his hands he may convert into ready money to answer the demands that may be made upon him which is the next thing to be considered for   the executor or administrator must pay the debts of the deceased in payment of debts he must observe the rules of priority otherwise on deficiency of assets if he pays those of a lower degree first he must answer those of a higher out of his own estate and first he may pay all funeral charges and the expense of proving the will and the like secondly debts due to the king on record or specialtyh thirdly such debts as are by particular statutes to be preferred to all others as the forfeitures for not burying in woolleni money due upon poorratesk for letters to the postofficel and some others fourthly debts of record as judgments docketed according to the statute      w and m c  0 statutes and recognizancesm   fifthly debts due on special contracts     as for rent for which the lessor has often a better remedy in his own hands by distreining or upon bonds covenants and the like under sealn lastly debts on simple contracts viz upon notes unsealed and verbal promises among these simple contracts servants wages are by someo with reason preferred to any other and so stood the antient law according to bractonp and fletaq who reckon among the first debts to be paid servita servientium et stipendia famulorum among debts of equal degree the executor or administrator is allowed to pay himself first by retaining in his hands so much as his debt amounts tor but an executor of his own wrong is not allowed to retain for that would tend to encourage creditors to strive who should first take possession of the goods of the deceased and would besides be taking advantage of his own wrong which is contrary to the rule of laws if a      creditor constitutes his debtor his executor this is a release or discharge of the debt whether the executor acts or not provided there be assets sufficient to pay the testators debts for though this discharge of the debt shall take place of all legacies   yet it were unfair to defraud the testators creditors of their just debts by a release which is absolutely voluntaryu   also if no     suit is commenced against him   the executor may pay any one creditor in equal     degree his whole debt though he has nothing left for the rest for without a suit commenced the executor has no legal notice of the debtw     when the debts are all discharged the legacies claim the next regard which are to be paid by the executor so far as his assets will extend but he may not give himself the preference herein as in the case of debtsx     a legacy is a bequest or gift of goods and chattels by testament and the person to whom it was given is styled the legatee which every person is capable of being unless particularly disabled by the common law or statutes as traitors papists   and some others this bequest transfers an inchoate property to the legatee but the legacy is not perfect without the assent of the executor for if i have a general or pecuniary legacy of  00l or a specific one of a piece of plate i cannot in either case take it without the consent of the executory for in him all the chattels are vested 0 and it is his business first of all to see whether there is a sufficient fund left to pay the debts of the testator the rule of equity being that a man must be just before he is permitted to be generous or as bracton expresses the sense of our antient lawz de bonis defuncti primo dedueenda sunt ea quæ sunt necessitatis et postea quæ sunt utilitatis et ultimo quæ sunt voluntatis and in case of a deficiency of assets all the general legacies must abate proportionably in order to pay the debts      but a specific legacy of a piece of plate a horse or the like is not to abate at all or allow any thing by way of abatement unless there be not sufficient without ita       upon the same principle if the legatees had been paid their legacies they are afterwards bound to refund a ratable part in case debts come in more than sufficient to exhaust the residuum after the legacies paidb and this law is as old as bracton and fleta who tell usc si plura sint debita vel plus legatum fuerit ad quæ catalla defuncti non sufficiant fiat ubique defalcatio excepto regis privilegio if a legatee dies before the testator the legacy is a lost or lapsed legacy and shall sink into the residuum   and if a contingent legacy be left to any one as when he attains or if he attains the age of twentyone and he dies before that time it is a lapsed legacyd   but a legacy to one to be paid when he attains the age of twentyone years is a vested legacy an interest which commences in præsenti although it be solvendum in futuro and if the legatee dies before that age his representative shall receive it out of the testators personal estate at the same time that it would have become payable in case the legatee had lived       this distinction is borrowed from the civil lawe and its adoption in our courts is not so much owing to its intrinsic equity as to its having been before adopted by the ecclesiastical courts for since the chancery has a concurrent jurisdiction with them in regard to the recovery of legacies it was reasonable that there should be a conformity in their determinations and that the subject should have the same measure of justice in whatever court he suedf but if such legacies be charged upon a real estate in both cases they shall lapse for the benefit of the heirg   for with regard to devises affecting lands the ecclesiastical court hath no concurrent jurisdiction   and in case of a vested legacy due immediately and charged on land or money in the funds which yield an immediate profit      interest shall be payable thereon from the testators death   but if charged only on the personal estate which cannot be     immediately got in it shall carry interest only from the end of the year after the death of the testatorh       besides these formal legacies contained in a mans will and testament there is also permitted another deathbed disposition of property which is called a donation causa mortis and that is when a person in his last sickness apprehending his dissolution near delivers or causes to be delivered to another the possession of any personal goods under which have been included bonds and bills drawn by the deceased upon his banker to keep in case of his decease this gift if the donor dies needs not the assent of his executor yet it shall not prevail against creditors and is accompanied with this implied trust that if the donor lives the property thereof shall revert to himself being only given in contemplation of death or mortis causai   this method of donation might     have subsisted in a state of nature being always accompanied with delivery of actual possessionk and so far differs from a testamentary disposition but     seems to have been handed to us from the civil lawyersl who themselves borrowed it from the greeksm   when all the debts and particular legacies are discharged the surplus or residuum must be paid to the residuary legatee if any be appointed by the will and if there be none it was long a settled notion that it devolved to the executors own use by virtue of his executorshipn but whatever ground there might have been formerly for this opinion it seems now to be understoodo with this restriction that although where the executor had no legacy at all the residuum shall in general be his own yet wherever there is sufficient      on the face of a will by means of a competent legacy or otherwise to imply that the testator intended his executor should not have the residue the undevised surplus of the estate shall go to the next of kin 0 the     executor then standing upon exactly the same footing as an administrator concerning whom indeed there formerly was much debatep whether or no he could be compelled to make any distribution of the intestates estate for though after the administration was taken in effect from the ordinary and transferred to the relations of the deceased the spiritual court endeavoured to compel a distribution and took bonds of the administrator for that purpose they were prohibited by the temporal courts and the bonds declared void at lawq and the right of the husband not only to administer but also to enjoy exclusively the effects of his deceased wife depends still on this doctrine of the common law the statute of frauds declaring only that the statute of distributions does not extend to this case but now these controversies are quite at an end for by the statute        car ii c  0 explained by    car ii c  0 it is enacted that the surplusage of intestates estates except of femescovert which are left as at common lawr shall after the expiration of one full year from the death of the intestate be distributed in the following manner—onethird shall go to the widow of the intestate and the residue in equal proportions to his children or if dead to their representatives that is their lineal descendants if there are no children or legal representatives subsisting then a moiety shall go to the widow and a moiety to the next of kindred in equal degree and their representatives if no widow the whole shall go to the children if neither widow nor children the whole shall be distributed among the next of kin in equal degree and their representatives but no representatives are admitted among collaterals further than the children of the intestates brothers and sisterss the next of kindred here referred to are to be investigated by the same rules of consanguinity as those who are entitled to letters of administration of whom we have sufficiently spokent      and therefore by this statute the mother as well as the father succeeded to all the personal effects of their children who died intestate and without wife or issue in exclusion of the other sons and daughters the brothers and sisters of the deceased and so the law still remains with respect to the father but by statute   jac ii c    if the father be dead and any of the children die intestate without wife or issue in the lifetime of the mother she and each of the remaining children or their representatives shall divide his effects in equal portions       it is obvious to observe how near a resemblance this statute of distributions bears to our ancient english law de rationabili parte bonorum spoken of at the beginning of this chapteru and which sir edward cokew himself though     he doubted the generality of its restraint on the power of devising by will held to be universally binding in point of conscience at least upon the administrator or executor in the case of either a total or partial intestacy it also bears some resemblance to the roman law of succession ab intestatox which and because the act was also penned by an eminent civiliany has occasioned a notion that the parliament of england copied it from the roman prætor though indeed it is little more than a restoration with some refinements and regulations of our old constitutional law which prevailed as an established right and custom from the time of king canute downwards and many centuries before justinians laws were known or heard of in the western parts of europe so likewise there is another part of the statute of distributions where directions are given that no child of the intestate except his heiratlaw on whom he settled in his lifetime any estate in lands or pecuniary portion equal to the distributive shares of the other children shall have any part of the surplusage with their      brothers and sisters but if the estates so given them by way of advancement are not quite equivalent to the other shares the children so advanced shall now have so much as will make them equal this just and equitable provision hath been also said to be derived from the collatio bonorum of the imperial lawz which it certainly resembles in some points though it differs widely in others but it may not be amiss to observe that with regard to goods and chattels this is part of the antient custom of london of the province of york and of our sister kingdom of scotland and with regard to lands descending in coparcenary that it hath always been and still is the common law of england under the name of hotchpota before i quit this subject i must however acknowledge that the doctrine and limits of representation laid down in the statute of distributions seem to have been principally borrowed from the civil law whereby it will sometimes happen that personal estates are divided per capita and sometimes per stirpes whereas the common law knows no other rule of succession but that per stirpes onlyb they are divided per capita to every man an equal share when all the claimants claim in their own rights as in equal degree of kindred and not jure representationis in the right of another person as if the next of kin be the intestates three brothers a b and c here his effects are divided into three equal portions and distributed per capita one to each but if one of these brothers a had been dead leaving three children and another b leaving two then the distribution must have been per stirpes viz onethird to as three children another third to bs two children and the remaining third to c the surviving brother yet if c had also been dead without issue then as and bs five children being all in equal degree to the intestate would take in their own rights per capita viz each of them one fifth partc       the statute of distributions expressly excepts and reserves the customs of the city of london of the province of york      and of all other places having peculiar customs of distributing intestates effects so that though in those places the restraint of devising is removed by the statutes formerly mentionedd their antient customs remain in full force with respect to the estates of intestates i shall therefore conclude this chapter and with it the present book with a few remarks on those customs in the first place we may observe that in the city of londone and province of yorkf as well as in the kingdom of scotlandg and probably also in wales concerning which there is little to be gathered but from the statute      w iii c    the effects of the intestate after payment of his debts are in general divided according to the antient universal doctrine of the pars rationabilis if the deceased leaves a widow and children his substance deducting for the widow her apparel and the furniture of her bedchamber which in london is called the widows chamber is divided into three parts one of which belongs to the widow another to the children and the third to the administrator if only a widow or only children they shall respectively in either case take one moiety and the administrator the otherh if neither widow nor child the administrator shall have the wholei and this portion or dead mans part the administrator was wont to apply to his own usek till the statute   jac ii c    declared that the same should be subject to the statute of distributions so that if a man dies worth   00l personal estate leaving a widow and two children this estate shall be divided into eighteen parts whereof the widow shall have eight six by the custom and two by the statute and each of the children five three by the custom and two by the statute if he leaves a widow and one child she shall still have eight parts as before and the child shall have ten six by the custom and four by the statute if he leaves a widow and no child the widow shall have threefourths of the whole two by the custom and one by the sta     tute and the remaining fourth shall go by the statute to the next of kin it is also to be observed that if the wife be provided for by a jointure before marriage in bar of her customary part it puts her in a state of nonentity with regard to the custom onlyl but she shall be entitlted to her share of the dead mans part under the statute of distributions unless barred by special agreementm and if any of the children are advanced by the father in his lifetime with any sum of money not amounting to their full proportionable part they shall bring that portion into hotchpot with the rest of the brothers and sisters but not with the widow   before they are entitled to any benefit under the customn but if they are fully advanced the custom entitles them to no further dividendo     thus far in the main the customs of london and of york agree but besides certain other less material variations there are two principal points in which they considerably differ one is that in london the share of the children or orphanagepart is not fully vested in them till the age of twentyone before which they cannot dispose of it by testamentp and if they die under that age whether sole or married their share shall survive to the other children but after the age of twentyone it is free from any orphanagecustom and in case of intestacy shall fall under the statute of distributionsq the other that in the province of york the heir at common law who inherits any land either in fee or in tail is excluded from any filial portion or reasonable partr but notwithstanding these provincial variations the customs appear to be substantially one and the same and as a similar policy formerly prevailed in every part of the island we may fairly conclude the whole to be of british original or if derived from the roman law of successions to have been drawn from that fountain much earlier than the time of justinian from whose constitutions in many points    0 particularly in the advantages given to the widow it very considerably differs though it is not improbable that the resemblances which yet remain may be owing to the roman usages introduced in the time of claudius cæsar who established a colony in britain to instruct the natives in legal knowledges inculcated and diffused by papinian who presided at york as præfectus prætorio under the emperor severus and caracallat and continued by his successors till the final departure of the romans in the beginning of the fifth century after christ the end of the second book   0 appendix no i vetus carta feoffamenti sciant presentes et futuri quod ego willielmus premises  filius willielmi de segenho dedi concessi et hac

court by humanity is evidently meant classical learning—a meaning of the word which is now almost lost by disuse to characterize a law school as the nursery of sound literature and civil liberty is indeed a highlywrought eulogium of the legal profession—a tribute however which it is believed that its history shows to have been well merited in the time of jonson the inns of court were still in a very flourishing condition in the year      there were in term   0  out of term     there were four inns of court—grays inn lincolns inn the middle temple and the inner temple these had attached to them certain inns of chancery in all numbering eight cliffords inn clements inn and lions inn belonged to the inner temple new inn to the middle temple furnivals inn which has since ceased to exist and thavies inn to lincolns inn and staples inn and barnards inn to grays inn sir edward coke seems to consider the writ of henry iii mentioned in the text as intended to attack the memory of magna charta and the charter of the forest by silencing in an arbitrary and summary manner legal teachers who based upon these documents instruction in the laws of england it may be doubted whether the opinion of sir william blackstone that the lawyers were collected together at so early a period will bear examination of lincolns inn dugdale mentions a tradition as still current among the ancients that the professors of the law were brought to settle in that place by henry earl of lincoln about the beginning of edward iis time this was written more than seventy years after the nineteenth of henry iii there is an account of grays inn formerly the property of the lords gray of wilton as having been held by lease from them by students of the law in the time of king edward iii and dugdale gives a traditionary account that the temple having passed to the knights hospitallers in the reign of edward iii came to the lawyers by demise from them the word inns was anciently used to denote townhouses in which the nobility and gentry resided when they were in attendance at court and it is frequently employed by the old poets to denote a noble mansion the inns of court were in french termed hostells in all our latin records they are called hospitia while diversoria is the name applied to public lodginghouses which are now commonly known as inns the buildings originally purchased for the purposes of these legal societies having been at the time handsome private residences still retained in their new use the ancient names by which they were designated the middle and inner temple were formerly dwellings of the knights templars lincolns and grays inns anciently belonged to the earls of lincoln and gray so the names of the several inns of chancery are taken from the names of their original proprietors except new inn staples inn which belonged to the merchants of the staple and lions inn which was a common inn with the sign of a lion at a very early period holborn was a quiet suburban village of london watered by a little rivulet which descended to the river fleet with an extensive prospect of the adjacent country it was called old bourne from which it derived its modern name it was in and near this secluded and beautiful spot that the professors and practitioners of the common law of england established their chambers and university situated between the city of westminster the place of holding the kings courts on the one side and the city of london on the other they enjoyed the advantage of ready access to the one and plenty of provisions in the other a river separated them from the city flowing from battle bridge past the foot of holborn hill and joining the thames at blackfriars this river was called the fleet or swift river and gave their names to fleet street and fleet prison the inns of chancery were originally in fact what in later years they became only in name—preparatory seminaries for the study of the grounds and principles of the law such men as more coke and holt were chosen to deliver lectures they were governed by principals and ancients elected by the members exercising their authority in subordination to the benchers of the inns of court to which they respectively belonged the readings in time came to be attended with costly entertainments which eventually led to the suspension of these valuable exercises the inns of court were much celebrated for the magnificence of their revels the last of these took place in      in the inner temple in honour of mr talbot when he took leave of that house of which he was a bencher on having the great seal delivered to him something of the same kind was exhibited in lincolns inn in      on the occasion of the queens visit at the opening of the new hall when prince albert

successive copyists the writing now consists of a piece of legal jargon wholly unintelligible when after dinner grace has been said the student advances to the barristers table and commences reading from this paper upon which one of the senior barristers present makes him a bow takes the paper from him and tells him that it is quite sufficient with the payment of the necessary fees and taking certain oaths the student having kept his terms and performed his exercises receives his call to the bar the original institution of the inns of court nowhere precisely appears but it is certain that they are not corporations and have no charter from the crown they are voluntary societies which for ages have submitted to a government analogous to that of the seminaries of learning—lord mansfield

up to the vantageground—so my lord bacon calls it—of science instead of grovelling all their lives below in a mean but gainful application to all the little arts of chicane till this happen the profession of the law will scarce deserve to be ranked among the learned professions and whenever it happens one of the vantagegrounds to which men must climb is metaphysical and the other historical knowledge they must pry into the secret recesses of the human heart and become well acquainted with the whole moral world that they may discover the abstract reason of all laws and they must trace the laws of particular states—especially of their own—from the first rough sketches to the more perfect draughts—from the first causes or occasions that produced them through all the effects good and bad that they produced—bolingbroke study of history law said dr johnson is the science in which the greatest powers of the understanding are applied to the greatest number of facts and no one said sir james mackintosh who is acquainted with the variety and multiplicity of the subjects of jurisprudence and with the prodigious powers of discrimination employed upon them can doubt the truth of this observation the science of jurisprudence is the pride of the human intellect which with all its defects redundancies and errors is the collected reason of ages combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of human concerns one of the first and noblest of human sciences—a science which does more to quicken and invigorate the human understanding than all other kinds of human learning put together but it is not apt except in persons very happily born to open and liberalize the mind exactly in the same proportion—edmund burke there is not in my opinion in the whole compass of human affairs so noble a spectacle as that which is displayed in the progress of jurisprudence where we may contemplate the cautious and unwearied exertions of wise men through a long course of ages withdrawing every case as it arises from the dangerous power of discretion and subjecting it to inflexible rules extending the dominion of justice and reason and gradually contracting

in which english and international law also find place have for some years past been working with good results the evidence taken by the university commissioners is much in favour of the present system but they recommend a complete fusion of the studies of english civil and international law with a board of legal studies the faculty of law they say should embrace an examination of the principles upon which existing systems of laws are founded and investigations of the principles on which all laws ought to be founded and they are of opinion that the foundation of professional education should be laid at the university within the last few years some additional facilities for this study have been afforded in the metropolis two professorships of law have been established—the one at kings college the other at the london university where courses of lectures on various branches of the law are delivered law lectures are also regularly given at the incorporated law society it

as seminaries of legal learning a scheme which if not so comprehensive as the subject would admit is an admirable commencement has been adopted by the inns of court whereby readerships have been established on—  constitutional law and legal history   jurisprudence and the civil law   the law of real property   the common law and   equity a years attendance at the lectures of the readers is now compulsory on all candidates for the bar who had not by the first day of trinity term      kept twelve terms examinations are held on the subjects lectured upon and studentships and certificates of merit are conferred it is to be maturely considered however whether these examinations should not be made compulsory before any law degree is conferred—stewart l sir henry spelman in the preface to

 s of parliaments    t dr taylors pref to elem of civil law u de laud leg c      it is proposed to present a few considerations upon the proper mode of training for the practice of the profession of the law in this country they will be altogether of a practical character the bar in the united states is open to all who wish to enter it it is mostly under the regulation of the various courts and their rules have been framed upon the most liberal principles generally a certain period of study has been prescribed never it is believed exceeding three years in some states however even this restriction is not found the applicant for admission is examined as to his knowledge and qualifications either by the courts or by a committee of members of the bar the profession is the avenue to political honours and influence those who attain eminence in it are largely rewarded and with ordinary prudence cannot fail to accumulate a handsome competence hence the young and ambitious are found crowding into it there is a great—perhaps an overdue—haste in american youth to enter upon the active and stirring scenes of life hence it is undoubtedly true that many men are to be found in the ranks of the profession without adequate preparation very often the difficulties presented by the want of a suitable education are overcome by native energy application and perseverance but more commonly they prevent permanent success and confine the unlettered advocate to the lower walks of the profession which promise neither profit nor honour unless in cases of extraordinary enthusiasm and where there are evident marks of bright natural talents a young man without the advantages of education should be discouraged from commencing the study of the law not that a collegiate or classical course of training should be insisted on as essential—although it is doubtless of the highest importance classical studies are especially calculated to exercise the mental faculties in habits of close investigation and searching analysis as well as to form the taste upon models of the purest eloquence the orators and historians of greece and of rome are a school in which exalted patriotism hightoned moral feeling and a generous enthusiasm can be most successfully cultivated with a good english education however many a man has made a respectable figure at the bar lord campbell has said that he who is not a good lawyer before he comes to the bar will never be a good one after it it is no doubt highly necessary that the years of preparation should be years of earnest diligent study but it is entirely too much to say with us that a course of three years reading at so early a stage will make a good lawyer in truth the most important part of every lawyers education begins with his admission to practice he that ceases then to follow a close and systematical course of reading although he may succeed in acquiring a considerable amount of practical knowledge from the necessity he will be under of investigating different questions yet it will not be of that deeplaid character necessary to sustain him in every emergency it may be safe then to divide the period of a lawyers preparation into—first a course of two or three years reading before his admission and second one of five or seven years close and continued application after that event at the commencement of his studies in the office of his legal preceptor the cardinal maxim by which he should be governed in his reading should be non multa sed multum indeed it was an observation of lord mansfield that the quantity of professional reading absolutely necessary or even really useful to a lawyer was not so great as was usually imagined the commentaries of blackstone and of chancellor kent should be read and read again and again the elementary principles so well and elegantly presented and illustrated in these two justlycelebrated works should be rendered familiar they form too a general plan or outline of the science by which the student will be able to arrange and systematize all his subsequent acquisitions to these may be added a few books of a more practical cast such as tidds practice stephens on pleading greenleafs evidence stephens or leighs nisi prius mitford or storys equity pleading which with such reading of the local law of the state in which he purposes to settle as may be necessary make up the best part of officereading it will be better to have well mastered thus much than to have run over three times as many books hastily and superficially let the student often stop and examine himself upon what he has read it would be an excellent mode of proceeding for him after having read a lecture or chapter to lay aside the book and endeavour to commit the substance of it to writing trusting entirely to his memory for the matter and using his own language after having done this let him reperuse the section by which he will not only discern what parts have escaped his memory but the whole will be more certainly impressed upon his mind and become incorporated with it as if it had been originally his own work let him cultivate intercourse with others pursuing the same studies and converse frequently upon the subject of their reading the biographer of lordkeeper north has recorded of him that he fell into the way of putting cases as they call it which much improved him and he was most sensible of the benefit of discourse for i have observed him often say that after his days reading at his nights congress with his professional friends whatever the subject was he made it the subject of discourse in the company for said he i read many things which i am sensible i forgot but i found withal that if i had once talked over what i had read i never forgot that much of course will depend upon what may be termed the mental temperament of the student himself which no one can so well observe as his immediate preceptor and he will be governed accordingly in the selection of the works to be placed in his hands and his general course of training no lawyer does his duty who does not frequently examine his student—not merely as an important means of exciting him to attention and application but in order to acquire such an acquaintance with the character of his pupils mind—its quickness or slowness its concentrativeness or discursiveness—as to be able to form a judgment as to whether he requires the curb or the spur it is an inestimable advantage to a young man to have a judicious and experienced friend watching anxiously his progress and competent to direct him when if left to himself he will most probably wander in darkness and danger in regard to the more thorough and extended course of reading which may and ought to be prosecuted after admission to the bar the remarks of one of the most distinguished men who has ever graced the american bar whose own example has enforced and illustrated their value may be commended to the serious consideration of the student there are two very different methods of acquiring a knowledge of the laws of england says horace binney art edward tilghman encyclopedia americana vol xiv and by each of them men have succeeded in public estimation to an almost equal extent one of them which may be called the old way is a methodical study of the general system of law and of its grounds and reasons beginning with the fundamental law of estates and tenures and pursuing the derivative branches in logical succession and the collateral subjects in due order by which the student acquires a knowledge of principles that rule in all departments of the science and learns to feel as much as to know what is in harmony with the system and what not the other is to get an outline of the system by the aid of commentaries and to fill it up by desultory reading of treatises and reports according to the bent of the student without much shape or certainty in the knowledge so acquired until it is given by investigation in the courts of practice a good deal of law may be put together by a facile or flexible man in the second of these modes and the public are often satisfied but the profession itself knows the first by its fruits to be the most effectual way of making a great lawyer under this view the following course of reading may be pursued the whole subject is divided into heads and the order of proceeding is suggested all the books named may not be within the students reach some may be omitted or others may be substituted it may however be somewhat irksome to pursue any one branch for too long a period unvaried when that is found to be the case the last five heads may be adopted as collateral studies and pursued simultaneously with the first

impressed on his memory it is believed that the course thus sketched if steadily and laboriously pursued will make a very thorough lawyer there is certainly nothing in the plan beyond the reach of any young man with industry and application in a period of from five to seven years with a considerable allowance for the interruptions of business and relaxation he must have however certain fixed and regular hours for his lawstudies and he must not suffer the charms of a light literature to allure him aside the fruits of study cannot be gathered without its toil in the law a young man must be the architect of his own character as well as of his fortune the profession of the law says mr ritso is that of all others which imposes the most extensive obligations upon those who have had the confidence to make choice of it and indeed there is no other path of life in which the unassumed superiority of individual merit is more conspicuously distinguished according to the respective abilities of the parties the laurels that grow within these precincts are to be gathered with no vulgar hands they resist the unhallowed grasp like the golden branch with which the hero of the æneid threw open the adamantine gates that led to elysium—sharswood   this perhaps is the only sense in which the word law can be strictly used for in all cases where it is not applied to human conduct it may be considered as a metaphor and in every instance a more appropriate term may be found when it is used to express the operations of the deity or creator it comprehends ideas very different from those which are included in its signification when it is applied to man or his other creatures the volitions of the almighty are his laws he had only to will ϕως γενεσθω και εγενετι when we apply the word law to motion matter or the works of nature or of art we shall find in every case that with equal or greater propriety and perspicuity we might have used the words quality property or peculiarity—we say that it is a law of motion that a body put in motion in vacuo must forever go forward in a straight line with the same velocity that it is a law of nature that particles of matter shall attract each other with a force that varies inversely as the square of the distance from each other and mathematicians say that a series of numbers observes a certain law when each subsequent term bears a certain relation or proportion to the preceding term but in all these instances we might as well have used the word property or quality it being as much the property of all matter to move in a straight line or to gravitate as it is to be solid or extended and when we say that it is the law of a series that each term is the square or squareroot of the preceding term we mean nothing more than that such is its property or peculiarity and the word law is used in this sense in those cases only which are sanctioned by usage as it would be thought a harsh expression to say that it is a law that snow should be white or that fire should burn when a mechanic forms a clock he establishes a model of it either in fact or in his mind according to his pleasure but if he should resolve that the wheels of his clock should move contrary to the usual rotation of similar pieces of mechanism we could hardly with any propriety established by usage apply the term law to his scheme when law is applied to any other object than man it ceases to contain two of its essential ingredient ideas viz disobedience and punishment hooker in the beginning of his ecclesiastical polity like the learned judge has with incomparable eloquence interpreted law in its most general and comprehensive sense and most writers who treat law as a science begin with such an explanation but the editor though it may seem presumptuous to question such authority has thought it his duty to suggest these few observations upon the signification of the word law—christian it has been objected that law in its proper sense is confined to the conduct of intelligent beings it is to be observed however that we apply the term in the english language to any rule whatever which we conceive to have been established by a superior in this sense all the operations of nature may be considered as the result of certain rules laid down by the supreme being in creation in other words that every existence spiritual animal vegetable or mineral had impressed upon it certain rules of action they may be called qualities properties or peculiarities but considering them all as the work of an almighty creator it is perfectly accurate and most proper to call them laws by the use of this word we keep constantly in mind as we ought that the universe was not the result of a blind chance but the work of intelligence a perfectly correct as well as most general definition of the word law is the command of a superior in most languages there are two words—one expressive of law in its general or abstract and another in its concrete sense thus in latin jus expresses the former lex the latter in french droit and loi in german recht and gesetz the word right in english might be adopted for the abstract sense of law but it has not been usus non jus facit norma loquendi considering the word law as comprehending this general and abstract sense there is no objection to the text—sharswood   the laws of our moral being are the necessary relations sustained by us to our maker and to other beings the existence of a supreme being—a spirit infinite eternal omniscient omnipotent—is a first truth of moral science it may be assumed safely as an admitted truth having created us such as we are our relations to him and to one another arose not from his will but from those eternal principles of rectitude which were coeternal with his will erat enim ratio profecta a rerum natura et ad recti faciendum impellens et a delicto avocans quæ tum denique incepit lex esse non cum scripta est sed tum cum orta est orta autem simul est cum mente divina—cic de legg i ii s   the same may be affirmed of other than moral relations we may say without the slightest irreverence that having created things having extension god could not make two things both equal to a third which would not at the same time be equal to one another there is in like manner an inherent difference between right and wrong independently of the will of any being god himself cannot make right wrong or wrong right right and wrong are eternal as the deity they depend upon the relations of moral beings and even before such beings were created those relations existed in possibility though not in act the will of god existed coeternally with himself and that will infinitely perfect and incorrupt never could do else than choose the right and refuse the wrong right and wrong are not created existences but the moral qualities of created existences it may well be questioned then whether the learned commentator in starting with the assertion that the law of nature is the will of the creator has not assumed an erroneous principle as the foundation of his reasoning in his sense the law of nature denotes the rules of human action or conduct that is the precepts by which man the noblest of all sublunary beings a creature endowed with both reason and freewill is commanded to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his behaviour it is clear that this law respects entirely the question of what is right and wrong it is true that in willing to create moral beings our maker knew what their necessary relations both to himself and each other would be and in a secondary sense he may be said to have willed the existence of those relations but this is an entirely different thing from the idea that the rules of right and wrong resulting from those relations were simple creations of his will for that implies that he might have made them other than they are—sharswood a juris præcepta sunt hæc honeste vivere alterum non lædere suum cuique tribuere inst i i     it is rather remarkable that both harris in his translation of justinians institutes and the learned commentator whose profound learning and elegant taste in the classics no one will question should render in english honeste vivere to live honestly the language of the institutes is far too pure to admit of that interpretation and besides our idea of honesty is fully conveyed by the words suum cuique tribuere i should presume to think that honeste vivere signifies to live honourably or with decorum or bienséance and that this precept was intended to comprise that class of duties of which the violations are ruinous to society and not by immediate but remote consequences as drunkenness debauchery profaneness extravagance gaming c—christian   there is in every moral being a faculty or sense by which he is enabled to distinguish right from wrong there have been a great number of theories among those who have rejected the doctrine of a moral sense they have succeeded each man in showing every other theory but his own to be baseless the reductio ad absurdum of every other system which ingenuity has ever framed would alone seem to leave the advocates of a moral sense in possession of the field the appeal after all must be made to every mans consciousness and why not every other faculty is proved in the same way let any one attempt to demonstrate that there is in men a natural taste for beauty he will be met by precisely the same course of argument as that which attacks the existence of the moral sense or as it may well be termed the taste for moral beauty all men have it not in the same perfection in some it is undeveloped in some it is corrupted indeed the same objections may be urged against the perceptions of the palate or of any other natural sense that some men love the taste of tobacco by no means proves that there is not a natural faculty in all men which distinguishes between the qualities of sweet and bitter the commentator appears to have adopted the idea that utility is the standard of right and wrong in other words that we are determined in our judgment of the moral qualities of an action solely by a consideration of its effect on our happiness such a doctrine contradicts the common sense and feeling of mankind if a gross instance of ingratitude to a benefactor—of filial impiety—of marital cruelty—is presented to the mind no man stops to estimate its consequences before pronouncing judgment of condemnation or feeling a sense of detestation if a grovelling miser were robbed of his treasure by a philanthropist in order to devote every cent of it to the relief of suffering humanity nay though the result should be peace and joy to many families without one element of unhappiness to the sordid wretch whose property was thus wrested from him the common sense and feeling of mankind would condemn the act as wrong it would be right on the utilitarian scheme even if you give the widest scope to the idea of utility as archdeacon paley has done for even the precedent if we confine its authority as all precedents must be to the very case given would not be bad according to this view says the rev dr alexander unless a man is persuaded that he shall gain something by keeping his word he is under no obligation to do it even if god should clearly make known his will and lay upon him his command he is under no obligation to obey unless certain that he shall receive benefit by so doing this is indeed to make virtue a mercenary thing and reduce all motives to a level and as selflove or the desire of happiness is the only rational motive and all men possess this in a sufficient degree of strength the only conceivable difference between the good and the bad consists in the superior sagacity which the one has above the other to discern what will most contribute to happiness and if what we call vice or sin could be made to contribute to happiness then it would change its nature and become virtue—elements of moral science p    right and wrong indeed are words which are often employed in common speech in a much larger sense than is attached to them by moral science and it is necessary to distinguish this popular from their strictly philosophical meaning right in this popular sense is synonymous with expediency—fitness to an end in the strict sense of the word as a moral quality right is conformity to that rule of moral conduct which the conscience approves wrong that which it disapproves it is not the conscience but the understanding which is called into exercise when we judge of questions of expediency or utility—of the fitness of certain things or actions to certain ends that feeling of complacency which in its higher or lower degrees we term admiration or approbation must always accompany a judgment of moral right detestation or disapprobation a judgment of moral wrong—sharswood   mr justice coleridge remarks that he understands the author to mean by this merely that a human law against the law of nature has no binding force on the conscience and that if a man submits to the penalty of disobedience he stands acquitted and that in this sense the position seems unquestionable he subsequently states that the burden of proof and the moral responsibility in case of error lie on him who disobeys that is on him who sets up his own understanding of the divine law as a ground in conscience for refusing to submit to the lawfullyconstituted legislature of the country it appears to me however that in such a case the subject or citizen has only one of two alternatives revolution—an appeal to the ultimate power which exists in every society after he has tried all the ordinary forms of the constitution to obtain a repeal of the obnoxious law—or removal to another country i cannot agree that when a law decided to be constitutional is in full force its provisions can be conscientiously violated even though its penalty be submitted to it may be necessary to do so for a time and such necessity may afford a sufficient justification in foro conscientiæ i do not say that a mans circumstances and especially his relation to his family may not be such as to make this justification permanently a good one all i mean to say is that he ought not voluntarily to place himself or remain in such a position—sharswood b puffendorf l   c   compared with barbeyracs commentary c ff i       the law of nature or morality which teaches the duty towards ones neighbour would scarce be wanted in a solitary state where man is unconnected with man a state of nature to which the laws of nature or of morals more particularly refer must signify the state of men when they associate together previous to or independent of the institutions of regular government the ideal equality of men in such a state no more precludes the idea of a law than the supposed equality of subjects in a republic the superior who would prescribe and enforce the law in a state of nature would be the collective force of the wise and good as the superior in a perfect republic is a majority of the people or the power to which the majority delegate their authority—christian modern writers have agreed that the term international law is more proper than law of nations jus gentium is rather what adam smith has called natural jurisprudence which he says is a theory of the principles which ought to run through and to be the foundation of the laws of all nations the two phrases jus naturæ and jus gentium are used by the roman lawyers almost indiscriminately jus feciale more properly was employed to express among the romans what we mean by the law of nations they had a college of heralds by whose ministry the declaration of war was always announced to the enemy and by whom occasionally no doubt questions connected with the relation of states were considered the history of rome is a history of continual wars from numa to augustus the gates of the temple of janus were never closed hence most of the questions which arose must necessarily have been connected with a state of war on the other hand the definition of jus gentium by the digest is quod naturalis ratio inter omnes homines constituit idque apud omnes peræque custoditur vocaturque jus gentium—dig i   what is termed the law of nations was more accurately called the jus inter gentes—the law between or among nations—by dr zouch an english civilian distinguished in the celebrated controversy between the civil and common lawyers during the reign of charles ii as to the extent of the admiralty jurisdiction he suggested this term as more appropriate to express the real scope and object of the law an equivalent term in the french language was subsequently proposed by chancellor daguesseau as better adapted to express the idea properly annexed to that system of jurisprudence commonly called le droit des gens but which according to him ought to be called le droit entre les gens the term international law has since been advocated by mr bentham as well adapted to express in our language in a more significant manner that branch of jurisprudence which goes under the name of law of nations—a denomination he remarks so uncharacteristic that were it not for the force of custom it would rather seem to refer to internal or municipal jurisprudence the terms international law and droit international have now taken root in our legal nomenclature and are constantly used in all discussions connected with this important science—sharswood d inst i       though the learned judge treats this as a favourite definition yet when it is examined it will not perhaps appear so satisfactory as the definition of civil or municipal law or the law of the land cited above from justinians institutes viz quod quisque populus ipse sibi jus constituit id ipsius proprium civitatis est vocaturque jus civile quasi jus proprium ipsius civitatis a municipal law is completely expressed by the first branch of the definition a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state and the latter branch commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong must either be superfluous or convey a defective idea of a municipal law for if right and wrong are referred to the municipal law itself then whatever it commands is right and what it prohibits is wrong and the clause would be insignificant tautology but if right and wrong are to be referred to the law of nature then the definition will become deficient or erroneous for though the municipal law may seldom or never command what is wrong yet in ten thousand instances it forbids what is right—it forbids an unqualified person to kill a hare or a partridge it forbids a man to exercise a trade without having served seven years as an apprentice it forbids a man to keep a horse or a servant without paying the tax now all these acts were perfectly right before the prohibition of the municipal law the latter clause of this definition seems to have been taken from ciceros definition of a law of nature though perhaps it is there free from the objections here suggested lex est summa ratio insita à naturâ quæ jubet ea quæ facienda sunt prohibetque contraria—cic de leg lib i c   the description of law given by demosthenes is perhaps the most perfect and satisfactory that can either be found or conceived οί δὲ νόμοι τὸ δὶκαιον καὶ τὸ καλὸν καὶ τὸ συμφέρον βούλονται καὶ τοῦτο ζητοῦσι καὶ ἑπειδὰν εὑρεθῆ κοινὸν τοῦτο πρόϛαγμα ἀπεδείχθν πᾶσιν ὶσον καὶ ομοιον καὶ τοῦτ ἑϛι ·νόμος ᾢ πάντας προσήκει πείθεσθαι διὰ πολλὰ καὶ μάλισθ ὀτι πᾶς ἐϛι νόμος εὐρημα μὲν καὶ δῶρον θεῶν δόγμα δ ἀνθρώπον ϕρονίμων ἐπανόρθωμα δε των ἑκουσίων καὶ ἀκουσίων ἁμαρτνμάτων πόλεως δὲ συιθήκη κοινή· καθ ἣν πᾶσι προσήκει ζῇν τοῖς ἐν τῇ πόλει the design and object of the laws is to ascertain what is just honourable and expedient and when that is discovered it is proclaimed as a general ordinance equal and impartial to all this is the origin of law which for various reasons all are under an obligation to obey but especially because all law is the invention and gift of heaven the sentiment of wise men the correction of every offence and the general compact of the state to live in conformity with which is the duty of every individual in society—orat   cont aristogit—christian it has been justly observed that the last clause of this definition is surplusage if the meaning be that what the law commands is therefore right and what it prohibits wrong but mere law the command of a superior cannot per se annex the moral quality of right or wrong to the action in itself considered commanded or prohibited right or wrong are abstract moral qualities resulting necessarily from the relations of persons or things no law can make that right which is itself wrong the definition of cicero certainly avoids this objectionable feature of blackstones language—lex est summa ratio insita à naturâ quæ jubet ea quæ facienda sunt prohibetque contraria if the definition of the text were modified so as to conform to this idea it would be better—municipal law is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state commanding what is to be done and forbidding the contrary—sharswood   the act to confiscate the goods of titius would in latin be lex not jus in french loi not droit in english however it is called law public and private acts of the legislature are indiscriminately termed laws—sharswood e such laws among the romans were denominated privilegia or private laws of which cicero de leg      and in his oration pro domo    thus speaks vetant leges sacratæ vetant duodecim tabulæ leges privatis homimbus irrogari id enim est privilegium nemo unquam tulit nihil est crudelius nihil perniciosius nihil quod minus hæc civitas ferre possit  an ex post facto law may be either of a public or of a private nature and when we speak generally of an ex post facto law we perhaps always mean a law which comprehends the whole community the roman privilegia seem to correspond to our bills of attainder and bills of pains and penalties which though in their nature they are ex post facto laws yet are never called so—christian  0 many instances formerly occurred of acts of parliament taking effect prior to the passing thereof by legal relation from the first day of the session

provisions of such act that it is impossible they can have notice of the existence of the law until some time after it has been passed the code napoleon declared that laws were binding from the moment their promulgation could be known and that the promulgation should be considered as known in the department of the imperial residence one day after that promulgation and in each of the other

makes it greater than it was when it was committed or which changes the punishment and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed or which alters the legal rules of evidence and makes less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence sufficient in order to convict the offender falls within this definition ex post facto

is made to live in the society of other moral beings he cannot be contented in a state of solitude he would rather dwell in the midst of alarm than reign in a desert the commentator is right when he says that man was formed for society and as is demonstrated by the writers on this subject is neither capable of living alone nor indeed has the courage to do it but it is not consistent with this admission to say as he afterwards does that the only true and natural foundations of society are the wants and fears of individuals it may be fearlessly asserted that a state of solitude would be unnatural and unsuited to a man if he had no wants and no fears he confounds in this passage society and government it is true that the wants and fears of individuals in society tend to government or as he after wards expresses it government results of course as necessary to preserve and keep society in order but it would be more philosophical to go one step further back to that principle in human nature which makes the wants and fears of men in society tend necessarily to government that principle is that strong as the social feelings are the individual or selfish using the word in a sense not necessarily bad are still stronger each man in consequence looks more to his own interest and happiness than those of others and conflicts must take place—universal discord and confusion destructive of the social state and the ends for which it is ordained there must be a controlling power somewhere lodged and wherever or whatever it is that is government it having been shown that government is a necessary relation of man from his natural constitution it follows that government is right the moral government of the supreme being over the universe of matter and mind has this same moral quality it is therefore in a secondary sense that all government—and of course human government—may be said to be of divine ordination in the creation of moral beings with social natures this relation of government resulted as necessarily as the equality of the three angles of a triangle to two right angles it is in this sense we are to receive the declaration that the powers that be are ordained of god—rom xiii   writers have amused themselves with supposing an original compact in every society the nearest approach to such a thing in history is to be found in the original settlement of the united states the different colonies were constituted under charters from the crown of great britain and the original adventurers as well as those who succeeded may without much violence be considered as having either expressly or tacitly become parties to a compact of society founded upon the terms set forth in those charters each colony was a separate state or nation they all agreed in recognising the king of great britain as their supreme executive magistrate and the power of the british parliament to extend over them in certain respects but in the main their local laws were to be made by them through their representative assemblies at the revolution they threw off their dependence upon the british crown and declared themselves free and independent states the declaration of independence was the joint and several act of the colonies and its effect was to constitute each separate colony a free and independent state so they themselves considered for as they had done before they continued to act by a congress of states each state by its delegates having one vote in the congress and when subsequently they entered into articles of confederation it was declared expressly each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power jurisdiction and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the united states in congress assembled the fundamental principle announced to the world in the declaration of independence was that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish their form of government and institute a new one laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness this may be treated as the established doctrine of this country nor is it inconsistent with any thing before advanced in these notes for while government is a moral relation necessarily resulting from the nature of men and therefore of divine ordination the particular form of government is evidently of human contrivance the great majority of governments have been the result of force or fraud yet even these may be considered as resting upon the tacit consent or acquiescence of the governed if they have the physical power they are competent to overthrow it nor are other nations justified in interfering in such domestic conflicts it is to be remarked that in the freest nations—even in the republics which compose the united states—the consent of the entire body of the people has never been expressly obtained the people comprehend all the men women and children of every age and class a certain number of the men have assumed to act in the name of all the community the qualifications of electors or voters was in general settled by the colonial charters and so continued until altered subsequently by the authority of the same body it was settled too that the acts of the majority of such body of electors were binding on the whole number very plainly then it is essential to the american doctrine to hold that every citizen shall have a right at any time to expatriate himself it is well known that it is settled to the contrary in the english courts nemo potest exuere patriam but how can the consent of the governed be in any sense implied if the citizen is coerced to remain a member of the state through all the changes which its form of government may undergo whether with or without his approbation it is clear that in any such change he may remove himself and his property to another country if he chooses and should be allowed a reasonable time in which to make his election this course was adopted at the period of the american revolution all persons whether natives or inhabitants were considered entitled to make their choice either to remain subjects of the british crown or to become citizens of one or other of the united states this choice was necessarily to be made within a reasonable time in some cases that time was pointed out by express acts of the legislature and the fact of abiding within the state after its assumed independence or after some other specified period was declared to be an election to become a citizen that was the course in massachusetts new york new jersey and pennsylvania in other states no special laws were passed but each case was left to be decided upon its own circumstances according to the voluntary acts and conduct of the party—sharswood    the sovereignty or supreme power in every state resides ultimately in the body of the people blackstone supposes the jura summi imperii or the right of sovereignty to reside in those hands in which the exercise of the power of making laws is placed our simple and more reasonable idea is that the government is a mere agency established by the people for the exercise of those powers which reside in them the powers of government are not in strictness granted but delegated powers as all delegated powers are they are trust powers and may be revoked it results that no portion of sovereignty resides in government a man makes no grant of his estate when he constitutes an attorney to manage it the sovereignty—the jura summi imperii—resides in the body of the state or nation by whose consent expressed or implied a form of government was at one time established as the organ to make known its sovereign will this sovereignty is indivisible and can be lost only in one way—by a voluntary or forced subjection to or merger with some other state or people that act of the people which constitutes the form of government we call the constitution it may be a general unlimited delegation of all the power of the people to certain prescribed functionaries this is the case with the english constitution the king lords and commons are vested with unlimited power they can change at any time the established form of the government and have done so in many instances as in the change of the succession to the throne the powers and organization of the lords and house of commons what is popularly termed the english constitution are certain principles according to which the government has been organized and which according to the most liberal view forms an implied restriction upon the omnipotence of the king lords and commons yet it is certain that if parliament were to pass a law clearly inconsistent with those principles no court in england would venture to pronounce it void and if it could not be repealed by the force of the popular will by the same power which made it it would have to be submitted to as the law of the land unless the people chose to resort to a revolution revolution means nothing more nor less than a peaceable or forcible change by a people of their constitution the constitutions of our american republics have always been written the charters which prescribed the forms of government were so those adopted by the several states at the period of the revolution were all so they not only organized the several departments—the legislative executive and judicial—but by various bills of rights as well as express restrictions prescribed limitations to the power of the government in other words certain of the powers of sovereignty they refused to delegate and as to others provided that they should only be exercised in a prescribed manner it results that the provisions of the constitution emanating directly from the people are the expression of their permanent will and no act of the government inconsistent with it of any validity the courts will pronounce such acts invalid null and void it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is those who apply the rule to particular cases must of necessity expound and interpret that rule if two laws conflict with each other the courts must decide on the operation of each so if a law be in opposition to the constitution if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law disregarding the constitution or conformably to the constitution disregarding the law the court must determine which of the conflicting rules governs the case this is of the essence of judicial duty if then the courts are to regard the constitution and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature the constitution and not such ordinary act must govern the case to which they both apply those then who controvert the principle that the constitution is to be considered in court as a paramount law are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution and see only the law this doctrine must subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions it would declare that an act which according to the principles and theory of our government is entirely void is yet in practice completely obligatory it would declare that if the legislature shall do what is expressly forbidden such act notwithstanding the express prohibition is in reality effectual it would be giving to the legislature a practical and real omnipotence with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits it is prescribing limits and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure—cj marshall in marbury vs madison   cranch     in general in our state constitutions the right of suffrage is almost universally extended to all free white male citizens and the principle is to give effect to the will of the numerical majority of the voters yet the states are not pure but representative democracies the legislative functions are vested in two separate bodies differently constituted—a senate and a house—whose concurrence is required to the passage of laws and a qualified veto is generally allowed to the executive but as the representatives of the people in the legislatures are elected by separate districts it may so happen if there are large majorities for some of the representatives while those of different views are chosen by small majorities that either or both branches may not truly represent the views of a majority of all the voters while the bare numerical majority may be safely intrusted with the election of the executive magistrate and in general directly or indirectly with the disposition of the offices of trust and profit it has long been a prevailing opinion that something more than a bare numerical majority should be required in the passage of laws stability is of the highest importance in regard to measures of financial and jurisprudential policy and where parties are pretty nearly equally divided a sudden gust of popular excitement—a flying camp of voters easily swayed by passion or interest from one side to another—what is still worse a small neutral party with one idea ready to make its terms with either of the others—will often change the politics of a state so frequently as to be very injurious to the best interests of the commonwealth the difficulty is and has been felt to be how to arrange such a system which while not denying to the numerical majority its legitimate influence will operate to afford such a check upon it as to secure the rights and interests of the minority perhaps the adoption of a different basis for the two branches as of territory for the senate and of population for the lower house comes nearer practicability than any other plan besides the constitutions of the several states there is also the constitution of the united states with paramount authority over the people of all the states by that constitution certain specified powers were delegated to a general or federal government—all powers not delegated being reserved to the states or to the people the special powers thus delegated are principally such as concern the foreign relations of the country the rights of war and peace the regulation of foreign and domestic commerce and other objects most appropriately assigned to the general government the government invested with the exercise of these powers is distributed into legislative executive and judicial departments the legislative is divided into two branches—a senate composed of two members from each state elected by the legislature thereof and a house composed of representatives from each state in proportion to their respective numbers determined by adding to the whole number of free persons including those bound to service for a term of years and excluding indians not taxed threefifths of all other persons the voters in each state are such persons as by the constitution thereof are the electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature the executive power is vested in a president who is chosen by electors chosen in each state as its legislature may prescribe—each state being entitled to as many electors as it has senators and representatives he has a qualified veto upon the acts of the legislature the judicial power is vested in a supreme court and such inferior courts as may be established by law—the judges receiving their appointment from the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate and holding their office by the tenure of good behaviour it is unnecessary to proceed with further details on this subject the student must be referred to the instrument itself with which he should make himself familiar at an early stage of his professional studies and it would be well worth his while to commit it to memory so as to have its very words at all times at command—sharswood f in his fragments de rep l   g cunclas nationes et urbes populus aut primores aut unguli regunt

time any one of the three should become subservient to the views of either of the other branches then assuredly the constitution is at an end for it would be difficult to contend that in the times of henry viii and elizabeth the two houses of parliament were not subservient to the crown or that before the reform act the house of lords had not the ascendency or that since that act the house of commons have not had it indeed it does not seem easy to name any eventful period of our constitutional history when the exact equilibrium of power referred to by blackstone existed that this supposed theory of our constitution is now denied by political writers of different parties is at any rate in disputable—stewart h on government part   reversesection     i see page    k locke hum und b ii c

it is an important question and deserves a more extensive discussion than can conveniently be introduced into a note the solution of it may not only affect the quiet of the minds of conscientious men but may be the foundation of arguments and decisions in every branch of the law to form a true judgment upon this subject it is necessary to take into consideration the nature of moral and positive laws the principle of both is the same—viz utility or the general happiness and true interests of mankind atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater et æqui but the necessity of one set of laws is seen prior to experience of the other posterior a moral rule is such that every mans reason if not perverted dictates it to him as soon as he associates with other men it is universal and must be the same in every part of the world do not kill do not steal do not violate promises must be equally obligatory in england lapland turkey and china but a positive law is discovered by experience to be useful and necessary only to men in certain districts or under peculiar circumstances it is said that it is a capital crime in holland to kill a stork because that animal destroys the vermin which would undermine the dykes or banks upon which the existence of the country depends this may be a wise law in holland but the life of a stork in england would be of no more value than that of a sparrow and such a law would be useless and cruel in this country by the laws of nature and reason every man is permitted to build his house in any manner he pleases but from the experience of the destructive effects of fire in london the legislature with great wisdom enacted that all partywalls should be of a certain thickness and it is somewhat surprising that they did not extend this provident act to all other great towns    geo iii c    it was also discovered by experience that dreadful consequences ensued when seafaring people who returned from distant countries infected with the plague were permitted immediately to come on shore and mix with the healthy inhabitants it was therefore a wise and merciful law though restrictive of natural right and liberty which compelled such persons to be purified from all contagion by performing quarantine book iv     he who by the breach of these positive laws introduces conflagration and pestilence is surely guilty of a much greater crime than he is who deprives another of his purse or his horse the laws against smuggling are entirely juris positivi but the criminality of actions can only be measured by their consequences and he who saves a sum of money by evading the payment of a tax does exactly the same injury to society as he who steals so much from the treasury and is therefore guilty of as great immorality or as great an act of dishonesty or smuggling has been compared to that species of fraud which a man would practise who should join with his friends in ordering a dinner at a tavern and after the festivity and gratifications of the day should steal away and leave his companions to pay his share of the reckoning punishments or penalties are never intended as an equivalent or a composition for the commission of the offence but they are that degree of pain or inconvenience which is supposed to be sufficient to deter men from introducing that greater degree of inconvenience which would result to the community from the general permission of that act which the law prohibits it is no recompense to a mans country for the consequences of an illegal act that he should afterwards be whipped or should stand in the pillory or lie in a jail but in positive laws as in moral rules it is equally false that omnia peccata paria sunt if there are laws such as the gamelaws which in the public opinion produce little benefit or no salutary effect to society a conscientious man will feel perhaps no further regard for the observance of them than from the consideration that his example may encourage others to violate those laws which are certainly beneficial to the community indeed the last sentence of the learned judge upon this subject is an answer to his own doctrine for the disobedience of any law in existence must be presumed to involve in it either public mischief or private injury it is related of socrates that he made a promise with himself to observe the laws of his country but this is nothing more than what every good man ought both to promise and perform and he ought to promise still further that he will exert all his power to compel others to obey them as the chief design of established government is the prevention of crimes and the enforcement of the moral duties of man obedience to that government necessarily becomes one of the highest of moral obligations and the principle of moral and positive laws being precisely the same they become so blended that the discrimination between them is frequently difficult or impracticable or as the author of the doctor and student has expressed it with beautiful simplicity in every law positive well made is somewhat of the law of reason and of the law of god and to discern the law of god and the law of reason from the law positive is very hard   dial c   an eloquent modern divine has also said let the great general duty of submission to civil authority be engraven on our hearts wrought into the very habit of the mind and made a part of our elementary morality halls sermon oct   0 —christian the morality of this position of the learned commentator has been well questioned its soundness as a legal principle though it once had sway in the courts has been since repudiated with all the qualifications which have been cautiously annexed to it in the text—namely that the thing forbidden or enjoined is wholly a matter of indifference and the penalty inflicted an adequate compensation for the civil inconvenience supposed to arise from the offence—it must be admitted to be fraught with practical danger to society there is a moral obligation resting on every individual to obey the laws of that community in which he lives the breach of any known law is a violation of that obligation if the laws be so multiplied that the citizen cannot be expected to know or understand them then although in the eye of the law he may not be excused—legis ignorantia neminem excusat—yet it is different in foro conscientiæ this is the answer to the suggestion that such laws would be a snare to the conscience but if the subject knows or ought to know the law if he had exercised ordinary diligence he has no right to set up his own judgment as to the indifference of the action which the legislature has prohibited or enjoined every penalty implies a prohibition even if not expressed it is now well settled

equipoise ought to turn the scale but if the rule of law is clear and explicit it is in vain to insist upon inconveniences nor can it be true that nothing which is inconvenient is lawful for that

is apprehended extracts the whole negation with which he would reverse the maxim in the text mr sedgwick contends on the other hand that sir william blackstone urges the doctrine too far and sets up a distinction between legal precedents and laws which however sound in itself does not aid the argument it is intended to enforce a law he says is a public statute solemnly framed by the legislative and confirmed by the executive power the decrees and determinations of the magistrates are not rigorously speaking laws legal precedents ought therefore not despotically to govern but discreetly to guide with laws it is otherwise to them the judge in his adjudications must conform c now it is evident that our author is speaking of the common law and his commentators must so understand him which common law is as absolute as the parliamentary statutes and must be as rigidly observed by the judicature assuming that the legal precedent or the statute is absurd and unjust the only question is by what authority shall it be abrogated mr sedgwick points to the judges on the bench and professor christian maintains the sole and supreme right of the legislature to exercise this function the spirit and practice of the constitution is with him and it is well for the interests of public justice that they are so in the multitude of counsels there is wisdom and the business of legislation even upon the substitution of a wholesome law in the place of an absurd or unjust precedent may well employ the highest wisdom in the state there may be a difference of opinion as to what is absurd and unjust for instance the law of primogeniture has fallen under that censure from the lips of men whose station in society recommend even their hasty notions to the respect of their contemporaries it would be difficult to reconcile the preference of the firstborn to the exclusion of all the other offspring of the same family with the law of nature or the law of god yet no judge would dare to treat this rule of law as absurd or unjust and substitute an equal division of the patrimony among all the children upon the question being brought before him had he such power given him by the constitution his fellows might exercise it also and it is no overstrained conjecture to say that fluctuating and conflicting adjudications would be the consequence producing much more mischief than can ensue from the enforcement of any precedent or rule of law however absurd or unjust till the legislature provides the proper remedy so it being a rule of law that a person born in england owes a natural allegiance

confirmed it as to declare frequently at nisi prius that he who disregards this salutary rule is answerable in damages for all the consequences the action in which this rule is applied viz for negligently driving a carriage by which any one is injured is as ancient as the common law but the uniform determination of the judges that the nonobservance of this rule is negligence is of modern

our courts merchants ought to take their law from the courts and not the courts from merchants and when the law is found inconvenient for the purposes of extended commerce application ought to be made

settled rule or principle of law the sources of the mercantile law are mainly the roman law the various codes of modern european nations and the writings of general jurists but it is not to be denied that these questions were originally treated in england as matters of custom and were referred to the decision of a jury of merchants after one point of such custom was ascertained by the verdict of a jury it was not considered proper to submit the same question to another jury but it was thereafter judicially noticed and applied by the court before the time of lord mansfield says mr j buller we find that in courts of law all the evidence in mercantile cases was thrown together they were left generally to a jury and they produced no established principle from that time we all know the great study has been to find out some certain general principles which shall be known to all mankind not only to rule the particular case then under consideration but to serve as a guide for the future most

pleading—viz acts concerning the king the queen and the prince those concerning all prelates nobles and great officers those concerning the whole spirituality and those which concern all officers in

specified to illustrate the general bearing and application of the principle of strict construction by far the most important question which has ever been agitated has been in regard to the constitution of the united states two schools of constitutional law—the national and staterights school—maintain different doctrines upon this subject the former have always contended that the delegations of power to the federal government ought to receive a large and liberal interpretation and that at all events wherever a general object was within the scope of the powers specified congress ought to be considered as invested with a large discretion as to the means to be employed for the purpose of giving effect to the power and especially that there existed no limitation upon their right to appropriate the public money but their own judgment of what would conduce to the general welfare on the other hand the staterights school zealously contend that the government being conceded to be one of special limited powers such a principle of construction as that assumed on the other side in effect destroys all limitation that any thing and every thing can be reached under the power of appropriating money for the general welfare that congress can employ no means except such as are necessary as well as proper to the end and have no right to assume a substantive power not granted as incidental non nobis tantas componcre lites—sharswood  0 these are generally called remedial statutes and it is a fundamental rule of construction that penal statutes shall be construed strictly and remedial statutes shall be construed liberally it was one of the laws of the twelve tables of rome that whenever there was a question between liberty and slavery the presumption should be on the side of liberty this excellent principle our law has adopted in the construction of penal statutes for whenever any ambiguity arises in a statute introducing a new penalty or punishment the

the judges in such cases may frequently raise and solve difficulties contrary to the intention of the legislature yet no further inconvenience can result than that the law remains as it was before the statute and it is more consonant to principles of liberty that the judge should acquit whom the legislator intended to punish than that he should punish whom the legislator intended to discharge with impunity but remedial statutes must be construed according to the spirit for in giving relief against fraud or in the furtherance and extension of natural right and justice the judge may safely go beyond even that which existed in the minds of those who framed the law—christian    and therefore it has been held that the same words in a statute will bear different interpretations according to the nature of the suit or prosecution instituted upon them as by the   ann c    the statute against gaming if any person shall lose at any time or sitting  0l and shall pay it to the winner he may recover it back within three months and if the loser does not within that time any other person may sue for it and treble the value besides so where an action was brought to recover back fourteen guineas which had been won and paid after a continuance at play except an interruption during dinner the court held the statute was remedial as far as it prevented the effects of gaming without inflicting a penalty and therefore in this action they considered it one time or sitting but they said if an action had been brought by a common informer for the penalty they would have construed it strictly in favour of the defendant and would have held that the money had been lost at two sittings   bl rep     —christian i   rep       some kinds of statutes are held entitled to receive a liberal

but the statute of rutland as it is called in vaughan p  00 is the same as the statutum walliæ mr barrington in his observations on the ancient statutes p    tells us that the statutum walliæ bears date apud rothelanum what is now called rhuydland in flintshire though edward says that terra walliæ prius regi jure feodali subjecta yet mr barrington assures us that the feudal law was then unknown in wales and that there are at present in north wales and it is believed in south wales no copyhold tenures and scarcely an instance of what we call manerial rights but the property is entirely free and allodial edward however was a conqueror and he had a right to make use of his own words in the preamble to his law ib   —christian b  0 edw i—the territory of wales before subjected with its inhabitants to the king by the feudal law is erected into a principality and as an integral part of england annexed to and united with the crown c    edw i d   inst       the laws in scotland concerning the tenures of land and of consequence the constitution of parliaments and the royal prerogatives were founded upon the same feudal principles as the laws respecting these subjects in england it is said that the feudal polity was established first in england and was afterwards introduced into scotland in imitation of the english government but it continued in its original form much longer in scotland than it did in england and the changes in the scotch government probably owing to the circumstance that they are more recent are far more distinctly marked and defined than they are in the history of the english constitution and perhaps the progress of the scotch parliaments affords a clearer elucidation of the obscure and ambiguous points in the history of the representation and constitution of our country than any arguments or authorities that have yet been adduced but a particular discussior of this subject would far exceed the limits of a note and will be reserved for a future occasion but for an account of the parliament of scotland before the union and the laws relative to the election of the representative peers and commoners of scotland i shall refer the studious reader to mr wights valuable inquiry into the rise and progress of parliaments chiefly in scotland quarto ed it is supposed that we owe the lower house of parliament in england to the accidental circumstance that the barons and the representatives of the counties and boroughs had not a room large enough to contain them all but in scotland the three estates assembled always in one house had one common president and deliberated jointly upon all matters that came before them whether of a judicial or of a legislative nature wight    in england the lords spiritual were always styled one of the three estates of the realm but there is no authority that they ever voted in a body distinct from the lords temporal in the scotch parliament the three estates were   the bishops abbots and other prelates who had a seat in parliament as in england on account of their benefices or rather lands which they held in capite ie immediately of the crown   the barons and the commissioners of shires who were the representatives of the smaller barons or the free tenants of the king   the burgesses or the representatives of the royal boroughs craig assures us nihil ratum esse nihil legis vim habere nisi quod omnium trium ordinum consensu conjuncto constitutum est ita tamen ut unius cujusque ordinis per se major pars consentiens pro toto ordine sufficiat scio hodie controverti an duo ordines dissentiente tertio quasi major pars leges condere possint cujus partem negantem boni omnes et quicunque de hac re scripserunt pertinacissimè tuentur alioqui quo ordines in eversionem tertii possint consentire de feudis lib i dieg   s    but some writers have since presumed to controvert this doctrine wight    it is strange that a great fundamental point which was likely to occur frequently should remain a subject of doubt and controversy but we should now be inclined to think that a majority of one of the estates could not have resisted a majority of each of the other two as it cannot easily be supposed that a majority of the spiritual lords would have consented to those statutes which from the year      to the year    0 were enacted for their impoverishment and finally for their annihilation at the time of the union the scotch parliament consisted only of the other two estates with regard to laws concerning contracts and commerce and perhaps also crimes the law of scotland is in a great degree conformable to the civil law and this probably was owing to their frequent alliances and connections with france and the continent where the civil law chiefly prevailed—christian   by the   th article it is agreed that all laws and statutes in either kingdom so far as they are contrary to these articles shall cease and become void from the time of edw iv till the reign of ch ii both inclusive our kings used frequently to grant by their charter only a right to unrepresented towns of sending members to parliament the last time this prerogative was exercised was in the  0 ch ii who gave this privilege to newark and it is remarkable that it was also the first time that the legality of this power was questioned in the house of commons but it was then acknowledged by a majority of     to    comm jour    march       but notwithstanding it is a general rule in our law that the king can never be deprived of his prerogatives but by the clear and express words of an act of parliament yet it has been thought from this last article in the act of union that this prerogative of the crown is virtually abrogated as the exercise of it would necessarily destroy the proportion of the representatives for the two kingdoms see   doug el cases  0 the preface to glanv rep and simeons law of elect    it was also agreed that the mode of the election of the peers and the commons should be settled by an act passed in the parliament of scotland which was afterwards recited ratified and made part of the act of union and by that statute it was enacted that of the    commoners  0 should be elected by the shires and    by the boroughs that the city of edinburgh should elect one and that the other royal boroughs should be divided into fourteen districts and that each district should return one it was also provided that no person should elect or be elected one of the    but who would have been capable of electing or of being elected a representative of a shire or a borough to the parliament of scotland hence the eldest son of any scotch peer cannot be elected one of the    representatives for by the law of scotland prior to the union the eldest son of a scotch peer was incapable of sitting in the scotch parliament wight     there seems to be no satisfactory reason for this restriction which would not equally extend to the exclusion of all the other sons of a peer neither can such eldest son be entitled to be enrolled and vote as a freeholder for any commissioner of a shire though otherwise qualified as was lately determined by the house of lords in the case of lord daer march         but the eldest sons of scotch peers may represent any place in england as many do   hats prec    the two statutes   ann c   and    geo ii c  0 requiring knights of shires and members for boroughs to have respectively  00l and  00l a year are expressly confined to england but a commissioner of a shire must be a freeholder and it is a general rule that none can be elected but those who can elect wight     and till the contrary was determined by a committee of the house of commons in the case of wigtown in        doug     it was supposed that it was necessary that every representative of a borough should be admitted a burgess of one of the boroughs which he represented wight  0  it still holds generally true in shires in scotland that the qualifications of the electors and elected are the same or that eligibility and a right to elect are convertible terms upon some future occasion i shall endeavour to prove that in the origin of representation they were universally the same in england—christian   since the union the following orders have been made in the house of lords respecting the peerage of scotland queen anne in the seventh year of her reign had created james duke of queensbury duke of dover with remainder in tail to his second son then earl of solway in scotland and upon the   st of january   0   it was resolved by the lords that a peer of scotland claiming to sit in the house of peers by virtue of a patent passed under the great seal of great britain and who now sits in the parliament of great britain had no right to vote in the election of the sixteen peers who are to represent the peers of scotland in parliament the duke of hamilton having been created duke of brandon it was resolved by the lords on the  0th of december      that no patent of honour granted to any peer of great britain who was a peer of scotland at the time of the union should entitle him to sit in parliament notwithstanding this resolution gave great offence to the scotch peerage and to the queen and her ministry yet a few years afterwards when the duke of dover died leaving the earl of solway the next in remainder an infant who upon his coming of age petitioned the king for a writ of summons as duke of dover the question was again argued on the   th december      and the claim as before disallowed see the argument   p wms     but in      the duke of hamilton claimed to sit as duke of brandon and the question being referred to the judges they were unanimously of opinion that the peers of scotland are not disabled from receiving subsequently to the union a patent of peerage of great britain with all the privileges incident thereto upon which the lords certified to the king that the writ of summons ought to be allowed to the duke of brandon who now enjoys a seat as a british peer  th june      but there never was any objection to an english peers taking a scotch peerage by descent and therefore before the last decision when it was wished to confer an english title upon a noble family of scotland the eldest son of the scotch peer was created in his fathers lifetime an english peer and the creation was not affected by the annexation by inheritance of the scotch peerage on the   th of february      it was resolved that the earl of abercorn and the duke of queensbury who had been chosen of the number of the sixteen peers of scotland having been created peers of great britain thereby ceased to sit in that house as representatives of the peerage see the argument in ann reg for      p    at the election occasioned by the last resolution the dukes of queensbury and gordon had given their votes as peers of scotland contrary to the resolution of   0  in consequence of which it was resolved   th may      that a copy of that resolution should be transmitted to the lord register of scotland as a rule for his future proceeding in cases of election the duke of queensbury and marquis of abercorn had tendered their votes at the last general election and their votes were rejected but notwithstanding the former resolutions on   d may      it was resolved that if duly tendered they ought to have been counted—christian e it may justly be doubted whether even such an infringement though a manifest breach of good faith unless done upon the most pressing necessity would of itself dissolve the union for the bare idea of a state without a power somewhere vested to alter every part of its laws is the height of political absurdity the truth seems to be that in such an incorporate union which is well distinguished by a very learned prelate from a fœderate alliance where such an infringement would certainly rescind the compact the two contracting states are totally annihilated without any power of a revival and a third arises from their conjunction in which all the rights of sovereignty and particularly that of legislation must of necessity reside see warburtons alliance     but the wanton or imprudent exertion of this right would probably raise a very alarming ferment in the minds of individuals and therefore it is hinted above that such an attempt might endanger though by no means destroy the union to illustrate this matter a little farther an act of parliament to repeal or alter the act of uniformity in england or to establish episcopacy in scotland would doubtless in point of authority be sufficiently valid and binding and notwithstanding such an act the union would continue unbroken nay each of these measures might be safely and honourably pursued if respectively agreeable to the sentiments of the english church or the kirk in scotland but it should seem neither prudent nor perhaps consistent with good faith to venture upon either of those steps by a spontaneous exertion of the inherent powers of parliament or at the instance of mere individuals so sacred indeed are the laws above mentioned for protecting each church and the english liturgy esteemed that in the regency acts both of      and      the regents are expressly disabled from assenting to the repeal or alteration of either these or the act of settlement f hale hist c l       sid

pursuance of his majestys most gracious recommendation to the two houses of parliament in great britain and ireland respectively to consider of such measures as might best tend to strengthen and consolidate the connection between the two kingdoms the two houses of parliament in each country resolved that in order to promote and secure the essential interests of great britain and ireland and to consolidate the strength power and resources of the british empire it was advisable to concur in such measures as should best tend to unite the two kingdoms into one kingdom on such terms and conditions as should be established by the acts of the respective parliaments in the two countries and in furtherance of that resolution the two houses of each parliament agreed upon eight articles which by an address of the respective houses of parliament were laid before his majesty for his consideration and his majesty having approved of the same and having recommended it to his parliaments in great britain and ireland to give full effect to them they were ratified by an act passed in the parliament of great britain on the  d of july   00 art i that the kingdom of great britain and ireland shall on the first day of january   0  and forever after be united into one kingdom by the name of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and that the royal style and titles of the imperial crown and the ensigns armorial flags and banners shall be such as should be appointed by his majestys royal proclamation art ii that the succession to the imperial crown shall continue

of lords and one hundred commoners—two for each county two for the city of dublin and two for the city of cork one for trinity college and one for each of the thirtyone most considerable cities and boroughs—shall be the number to sit in the house of commons on the part of ireland that questions respecting the rotation or election of the spiritual or temporal peers shall be decided by the house of lords and in the case of an equality of votes in the election of a temporal peer the clerk of the parliament shall determine the election by drawing one of the names from a glass that a peer of ireland not elected one of the twentyeight may sit in the house of commons but whilst he continues a member of the house of commons he shall not be entitled to the privilege of peerage nor capable of being elected one of the twentyeight nor of voting at such election and he shall be sued and indicted for any offence as a commoner that as often as three of the peerages of ireland existing at the time of the union shall become extinct the king may create one peer of ireland and when the peers of ireland are reduced to one hundred by extinction or otherwise exclusive of those who shall hold any peerage of great britain subsisting at the time of the union or created of the united kingdom since the union the king may then create one peer of ireland for every peerage that becomes extinct or as often as any one of them is created a peer of the united kingdom so that the king may always keep up the number of one hundred irish peers over and above those who have an hereditary seat in the house of lords that questions respecting the election of the members of the house of commons returned for ireland shall be tried in the same manner as questions respecting the elections for places in great

those for counties cities and boroughs in england unless some other provision be afterwards made until an act shall be passed in the parliament of the united kingdom providing in what cases persons holding offices and places of profit under the crown of ireland shall be incapable of sitting in the house of commons not more than twenty such persons shall be capable of sitting and if more than twenty such persons shall be returned from ireland then the seats of those above twenty shall be vacated who have last accepted their offices or places that all the lords of parliament on the part of ireland spiritual and temporal sitting in the house of lords shall have the same rights and privileges respectively as the peers of great britain and that all the lords spiritual and temporal of ireland shall have rank and precedency next and immediately after all the persons holding peerages of the like order and degree in great britain subsisting at the time of the union and that all peerages hereafter created of ireland or of the united kingdom of the same degree shall have precedency according to the dates of their creations and that all the peers of ireland except those who are

excepted art v that the churches of england and ireland be united into one protestantepiscopal church to be called the united church of england and ireland that the doctrine and worship shall be the same and that the continuance and preservation of the united church as the established church of england and ireland shall be deemed an essential and fundamental part of the union and that in like manner the church of scotland shall remain the same as is now established by law and by the acts of union of england and scotland art vi the subjects of great britain and ireland shall be entitled to

to the other shall cease but that the importation of certain articles therein enumerated shall be subject to such countervailing duties as are specified in the act art vii the sinkingfunds and the interest of the national debt of each country shall be defrayed by each separately and for the space of twenty years after the union the contribution of great britain and ireland towards the public expenditure in each year shall be in the proportion of fifteen to two subject to future regulations art viii all the laws and courts of each kingdom shall remain the same as they are now established subject to such alterations by the united parliament as circumstances may require but that all writs of error and appeals shall be decided by the house of lords of the united kingdom except appeals from the court of admiralty in ireland which shall be decided by a court of delegates appointed by the court of chancery in ireland the statute then recites an act passed in the parliament of ireland by which the rotation of the four spiritual lords for each sessions is fixed and it also directs the time and mode of electing the twentyeight temporal peers for life and it provides that sixtyfour county members shall be elected two for each county two for the city of dublin two for the city of cork one for trinity college dublin and one for each of thirtyone cities and towns which are there specified which are the only places in ireland to be represented in future one of the two members of each of those places was chosen by lot unless the other withdrew his name to sit in the first parliament but at the next elections one member only will be returned an irish peer is now entitled to every privilege except that of sitting in the house of lords unless he chooses to waive it in

general had no allowance or authority there but this was an error the claim of england to the soil was made by her in virtue of discovery not conquest or cession the aborigines were considered but as mere occupants not sovereign proprietors and the argument for the justice of taking possession and driving out the natives was rested upon the ground that a few wandering hordes of savages had no right to the exclusive possession and enjoyment of the vast and fertile regions which were opened for the improvement and progress of civilized man by the discovery of the new world on the discovery of this immense continent said c j marshall in johnson vs mcintosh   wheaton     the great nations of europe were eager to appropriate to themselves so much of it as they could respectively acquire its vast extent offered an ample field to the ambition and enterprise of all and the character and religion of its inhabitants afforded an apology for considering them as a people over whom the superior genius of europe might claim an ascendency the potentates of the old world found no difficulty in convincing themselves that they made ample compensation to the inhabitants of the new by bestowing on them civilization and christianity in exchange for unlimited independence but as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object it was necessary in order to avoid conflicting settlements and consequent war with each other to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition which they all asserted should be regulated as between themselves this principle was that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects or by whose authority it was made against all other european governments which title might be consummated by possession the exclusion of all other europeans necessarily gave to the nation making the discovery the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives and establishing settlements upon it it was a right with which no europeans could interfere it was a right which all asserted for themselves and to the assertion of which by others all assented those relations which were to exist between the discoverer and the natives were to be regulated by themselves the rights thus acquired being exclusive no other power could interpose between them in the establishment of these relations the rights of the original inhabitants were in no instance entirely disregarded but were necessarily to a considerable extent impaired they were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it and to use it according to their own discretion but their rights to complete sovereignty as independent nations were necessarily diminished and their power to dispose of the soil at their own will to whomsoever they pleased was denied by the original fundamental principle that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it it follows then that the true principle as regards the british colonies in this country which subsequently became the united states is that which the learned commentator has recognised to be the rule of new settlements—that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by english subjects all the english laws then in being which are the birthright of every subject are immediately there in force but this must be understood with very many and very great restrictions such colonists carry with them only so much of the english law as is applicable to their own situation and the condition of an infant colony such for instance as the general rules of inheritance and of protection from personal injuries the artificial refinements and distinctions incident to the property of a great and commercial people the laws of police and revenue such especially as are enforced by penalties the mode of maintenance for the established clergy the jurisdiction of spiritual courts and a multitude of other provisions are neither necessary nor convenient for them and therefore are not in force this expresses accurately and fully the wellsettled and repeatedly recognised doctrine of the american courts upon the subject of the extension of the english common law and statutes to this country our ancestors brought with them only such parts of the laws of england as were adapted to their new condition and we may add as quite important such only as were conformable to their principles the original settlers of this country belonged to a stock of men whose history exhibited in a remarkable manner the ascendency of moral and religious principles and who were deeply imbued with notions of the right of men to live under governments of their own choice all the great safeguards of political liberty which were consecrated in england about that period or subsequently by the bill of rights and act of settlement were received and held by them as fundamental to all free government not only so but their ideas on religious freedom on the administration of criminal law and on the process and pleading in courts were simple just and humane there never was an order of provincial nobility nor with one or two unimportant exceptions an established clergy in any of the colonies thus not only in regard to the common law but as to the statutes in force at the time of their settlement some parts were adopted some entirely rejected and some adopted with important modifications some british statutes passed subsequent to that date were in some cases silently adopted without express legislation the lawyers of the old colonies having either been educated in england or deriving their ideas from english books adopted and introduced into general practice and understanding such improvements as they found to be convenient equally false is the doctrine asserted that these colonies were subject to the control of the parliament the colonies were never represented in that body and although the charters were derived from the crown and all admitted a common allegiance to the same sovereign it did not therefore follow that they were subject to the legislative authority of the english people the great principle successfully maintained by the american revolution was that taxation and representation are inseparable and although in the early part of the struggle the americans were ready to concede the power provided it was used merely for the purpose of regulation and not for revenue before the struggle closed all such distinctions were repudiated it was clearly seen and argued that no such power over the fortunes and industry of the people of the colonies could with safety be trusted to a legislature at so great a distance in which they had no voice which could feel no sympathy for them and was without that accurate and intimate acquaintance with their character pursuits and resources which is necessary to the wise and impartial exercise of such a power—sharswood    of the

the attainder of the pretended prince of wales but it is observable that in the same act the duchy of cornwall is also vested in king henry vii and his heirs which could never be intended in any event to be separated from the inheritance of the crown and indeed it seems to have been understood very early after the statute of henry vii that the duchy of lancaster was by no means thereby made a separate inheritance from the rest of the royal patrmony since it descended with the crown to the halfblood in the instances of queen mary and queen elizabeth which it could not have done as the

or of any particular state it has been often doubted whether the united states have any constitutional power to acquire new territory however louisiana was purchased from france florida from spain and a very extensive territory was acquired by treaty from mexico the northwestern territory acquired previous to the adoption of the federal constitution by cession from virginia was regulated by an ordinance for the government of the territory of the united states northwest of the river ohio adopted by the old congress july         territorial governments have from time to time been organized out of the other territories of the united states the character and extent of the power of congress over the territories have been the subject of repeated and excited discussion both in and out of congress on this as on most other questions connected with the authority of the federal government the national and staterights schools have differed the former hold that under the constitution congress have absolute and despotic power over the territories that whatever they have the power to do they have the right to do if in their judgment it will conduce to the general welfare hence they construe the power to dispose of and make all needful regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states as the same in effect as the power to exercise legislation in all cases whatsoever the staterights school on the contrary hold that the clause in the constitution about the territories relates to them only as property and gives no right to congress to govern them that their right to government springs from their acquisition of them by cession and is not therefore absolute territory acquired under the right to declare war and make treaties belongs to the states as states and congress can only legislate in conformity to the principles of the constitution their power is limited by the limitations of the constitution they have the authority to maintain peace and order and to establish tribunals for the administration of criminal and civil justice according to the law of the land as it existed at the time of the cession but they can no more change the law of the land in a territory than they can in a state they cannot regulate private property or interfere with private rights in short the law of the ceded territory on all subjects not within the delegated powers of congress in the states must continue until changed by the only legitimate authority when the people of such territory with the authority of congress form a sovereign state—sharswood a    philipp    b l   c     the distinction between private wrongs and public wrongs is more intelligible and more accurately limited by the nature of the subjects than the distinction between the rights of things and the rights of persons for all rights whatever must be the rights of certain persons to certain things every right is annexed to a certain character or relation which each individual bears in society the rights of kings lords judges husbands fathers heirs purchasers and occupants are all dependent upon the respective characters of the claimants these rights might again be divided into rights to possess certain things and the rights to do certain actions this latter class of rights constitute powers and authority but the distinction of rights of persons and rights of things in the first two books of the commentaries seems to have no other difference than the antithesis of the expression and that too resting upon a solecism for the expression rights of things or a right of a horse is contrary to the idiom of the english language we say invariably a right to a thing the distinction intended by the learned judge in the first two books appears in a great degree to be that of the rights of persons in public stations and the rights of persons in private relations but as the order of legal subjects is in a great measure arbitrary and does not admit of that mathematical arrangement where one proposition generates another it perhaps would be difficult to discover any method more satisfactory than that which the learned judge has pursued and which was first suggested by lord c j hale see hales analysis of the law—christian   this distinction seems to convey a doctrine that can hardly bear examination or be reconciled with sound law and morality the circumstance of publication as evidence of shameless profligacy and hardened depravity may alter the nature of the punishment but cannot alter the intrinsic criminality of the vicious act whatever is pernicious to society as an example must necessarily be vicious and destructive in itself what is ruinous and criminal to repeat and follow must also be ruinous and criminal to commence human laws prohibit everywhere the guilty action but punishment can only be the consequence of detection—christian   it is truly observed by the commentator that the absolute rights of individuals though occupying less space in codes of law than their relative rights or rights of property are nevertheless by far the most important the great end of society is to secure the wealth and happiness of its members and the vast majority of mankind depending upon their daily labour for their daily bread have the most direct and immediate interest in their life limbs liberty and reputation it is true that the hope of acquiring property and of thus bettering our condition pervades all classes and no country can prosper nor be the seat of a contented people where the fruits of industry and frugality are not fully secured to the possessor and the relations of men and the enjoyment of their property regulated by wise and equal laws impartially administered in popular forms of government such as prevail in the united states where the people govern themselves by agents or representatives chosen at short intervals personal liberty the elective and other political franchises liberty of conscience of speech and of the press and the right of the people peaceably to assemble to consider and discuss their grievances are rights which the people naturally cherish with jealousy and which are able to protect themselves in a great measure from their own democratic affinities practically there is however not much difference between wresting from a man by force or fraud or governmental exaction the few dollars the product or savings of his industry for any period of time and depriving him of his liberty or chaining him to a log to work for another during the same period hence we ought not to undervalue those guards which have been provided for the protection of the rights of property these are as important parts of our liberties and should be maintained with as vigilant an eye as any other the constitution of the united states and the constitutions of the several states are accompanied with bills of rights which are intended to declare and set forth the restrictions which the people in their sovereign capacity have imposed upon their agents—the various governments established by these constitutions but as the persons composing the different branches of these governments are chosen directly or indirectly by a majority of the people the provisions of these bills of rights are really restrictions imposed upon these majorities they constitute the security of the individual members of society against the acts of the majority the great bulwark of the reserved rights protected by these restrictions is the judiciary department they have the unquestioned power of declaring any act of the government in any of its departments which infringes any of these rights to be utterly null and void that department spreads the broad and impregnable shield of its protection over the life limbs liberty reputation and property of the citizen when invaded even by the will of the majority our bills of rights are therefore not mere enunciations of abstract principles but solemn enactments by the people themselves guarded by a sufficient sanction the bill of rights which accompanies the federal constitution is mainly to be found in the amendments to that instrument it was strongly urged by those who favoured the adoption of that instrument as it was proposed that inasmuch as the government established by it was in all respects a limited one—that it could exercise no powers except such as were expressly granted or necessarily implied—there was no occasion of any bill of rights but the states were not satisfied with this reasoning they feared that as the means of carrying into effect the granted powers were open to the discretion of government they might still unless expressly restricted invade those rights which ought not in any event or by any construction to be submitted to the power of government while they proceeded therefore to ratify the constitution as proposed unconditionally it was in the confidence that such amendments would be adopted as would relieve their fears in this particular this was accordingly done the amendments were proposed at the first session of the first congress of the united states which was begun and held at the city of new york on the  th of march      and were adopted by the requisite number of states it must be remembered that the limitations of power contained in these amendments do not apply to the state governments the people of the respective states are left to create such restrictions on the exercise of the power of their particular governments as they may think proper and restrictions by

liberty which have hitherto been communicated to the world though declamation and eloquence in all ages have exhausted their stores upon this favourite theme yet reason has made so little progress in ascertaining the nature and boundaries of liberty that there are very few authors indeed either of this or of any other country which can furnish the studious and serious reader with a clear and consistent account of this idol of mankind i shall here briefly subjoin the different notions conveyed by the word liberty which even by the most eminent writers and orators are generally confounded together the libertas quidlibet faciendi or the liberty of doing every thing which a mans passions urge him to attempt or his strength enables him to effect is savage ferocity it is the liberty of a tiger and not the liberty of a man moral or natural liberty in the words of burlamaqui ch   reversesection    is the right which nature gives to all mankind of disposing of their persons and property after the manner they judge most consonant to their happiness on condition of their acting within the limits of the law of nature and that they do not any way abuse it to the prejudice of any other men this is frequently confounded and even by the learned judge in this very section with savage liberty civil liberty is well defined by our author to be that of a member of society and is no other than natural liberty so far restrained by human laws and no farther as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of the public mr paley begins his excellent chapter upon civil liberty with the following definition—civil liberty is the not being restrained by any law but what conduces in a greater degree to the public welfare b vi c   the archbishop of york has defined civil or legal liberty to be that which consists in a freedom from all restraints except such as established law imposes for the good of the community to which the partial good of each individual is obliged to give place a sermon preached feb         p    all these three definitions of civil liberty are clear distinct and rational and it is probable they were intended to convey exactly the same ideas but i am inclined to think that the definition given by the learned judge is the most perfect as there are many restraints by natural law which though the established law does not enforce yet it does not vacate and remove in the definition of civil liberty it ought to be understood or rather expressed that the restraints introduced by the law should be equal to all or as much so as the nature of things will admit political liberty may be defined to be the security with which from the constitution form and nature of the established government the subjects enjoy civil liberty no ideas or definitions are more distinguishable than those of civil and political liberty yet they are generally confounded and the latter cannot yet claim an appropriate name the learned judge uses political and civil liberty indiscriminately but it would perhaps be convenient uniformly to use those terms in the respective senses here suggested or to have some fixed specific denominations of ideas which in their nature are so widely different the last species of liberty has probably more than the rest engaged the attention of mankind and particularly of the people of england civil liberty which is nothing more than the impartial administration of equal and expedient laws they have long enjoyed nearly to as great an extent as can be expected under any human establishment but some who are zealous to perpetuate these inestimable blessings of civil liberty fancy that our political liberty may be augmented by reforms or what they deem improvements in the constitution of the government men of such opinions and dispositions there will be and perhaps it is to be wished that there should be in all times but before any serious experiment is made we ought to be convinced by little less than mathematical demonstration that we shall not sacrifice substance to form the end to the means or exchange present possession for future prospects it is true that civil liberty may exist in perfection under an absolute monarch according to the wellknown verse—   fallitur egregiè quisquis sub principe credit   servitium nunquam libertas gratior extat   quam sub rege pio   —claud   but what security can the subjects have for the virtues of his successor civil liberty can only be secure where the king has no power to do wrong yet all the prerogatives to do good under such a king with two houses of parliament the people of england have a firm reliance that they will retain and transmit the blessings of civil and political liberty to the latest posterity there is another common notion of liberty which is nothing more than a freedom from confinement this is a part of civil liberty but it being the most important part as a man in a jail can have the exercise and enjoyment of few rights it is κατ εξοχην called liberty but where imprisonment is necessary for the ends of public justice or the safety of the community it is perfectly consistent with civil liberty for mr paley has well observed that it is not the rigor but the inexpediency of laws and acts of authority which makes them tyrannical b vi c   this is agreeable to that notion of civil liberty entertained by tacitus one who was well acquainted with the principles of human nature and human governments when he says gothones regnantur paulò jam adductius quam cæteræ germanorum gentes nondum tamen supra libertatem de mor ger c    it is very surprising that the learned commentator should cite with approbation p   and     and that montesquieu should adopt b xi c    that absurd definition of liberty given in justinians institutes—facultas ejus quod cuique facere libet nisi quod vi aut jure prohibetur the liberty here defined implies that every one is permitted to do whatever is not forbidden by an existing law and perhaps whatever is not forbidden to all the word vi seems to refer to a restraint against law in every country and under all circumstances the subjects possess the liberty described by this definition when an innocent negro is seized and chained or is driven to his daily toil by a merciless master he still retains this species of liberty or that little power of action of which force and barbarous laws have not bereft him but we must not have recourse to a system of laws in which it is a fundamental principle quod principi placuit legis habet rigorem for correct notions of liberty so far the editor thought it proper to suggest to the student the different significations of the word liberty a word which it is of the utmost importance to mankind that they should clearly comprehend for though a genuine spirit of liberty is the noblest principle that can animate the heart of man yet liberty in all times has been the clamour of men of profligate lives and desperate fortunes falsò libertatis vocabulum obtendi ab iis qui privatim degeneres in publicum exitiosi nihil spei nisi per discordias habeant tac    ann c    and the first sentence of our hookers ecclesiastical polity contains no less truth and eloquence—he that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they ought to be shall never want attentive and favourable hearers the editor cannot but cherish even a confident hope that they who acquire the most intimate acquaintance with the laws and the constitution will always be the most convinced that to be free is to live in a country where the laws are just expedient and impartially administered and where the subjects have perfect security that they will ever continue so and allowing for some slight and perhaps inevitable imperfections that to be free is to be born and to live under the english constitution hanc retinete quæso quirites quam vobis tanquam hæreditatem majores vestri reliquerunt cic   phil—christian g

island captured by his majestys arms from the united states in time of war and after notice given to the officers commanding on the station that they were runaway slaves the officer carried them to and left them at a british colony—held that case would not lie in this country against the officers for harbouring and detaining such negroes even though by the lex loci whence they escaped slavery was permitted—chitty   lord camden concluded his judgment in the case of general warrants in the same words—one word more for ourselves we are no advocates for libels all governments must set their faces against them and whenever they come before us and a jury we shall set our faces against them and if juries do not prevent them they may prove fatal to liberty destroy government and introduce anarchy but tyranny is better than anarchy and the worst government better than none at all   wils    —christian   civil liberty the great end of all human society and government is that state in which each individual has the power to pursue his own happiness according to his own views of his interests and the dictates of his conscience unrestrained except by equal just and impartial laws laws are therefore the just and necessary limits of natural liberty political liberty on the other hand is that state in which the individual enjoys civil liberty with security a security as the experience of history shows only to be attained by the force of public opinion formed and influenced by an untrammelled press and by the legislators being at stated intervals chosen by the people and from the people upon whom their enactments are to operate the particular form which may assign to the government its denomination in political science may be and often is important to this end but not of the essence of political liberty it follows too from this definition that some classes or orders of men in a country may enjoy a higher degree of political liberty than others while some indeed may be entirely deprived of it the value of any form of government says mr palgrave depends upon the protection which through the law it affords to the individual the same sentiment has been well expressed by william penn—any government is free to the people under it whatever be the frame where the laws rule and the people are a party to those laws and more than this is tyranny oligarchy and confusion it is certainly true that law in its turn may be a tyrant whether enacted by the will of one man or of a majority of the people laws may justly restrain all classes of actions whose tendencies are to impair individual security whether those actions are abstractly right or wrong in themselves useful or noxious in particular instances the converse of the proposition is true whenever laws attempt more than is necessary to secure alike to every man weak or strong rich or poor ignorant or instructed the right the moral power of seeking his own happiness in his own way they invade that natural liberty of which they ought only to be the bulwark to this security it is certainly necessary that violence fraud and crime should be prevented and as the most efficient means of prevention punished we may go further and say punished without regard to the preventive effects of punishment considering the civil ruler in this respect as the swordbearer of the deity and bound to enforce his moral law nay we may still advance a step and hold that such injuries in a perfect system should in every instance be compensated either by the community directly or by its force applied to the offender to the security of which we speak it is further necessary that general rules should be established and promulgated and tribunals erected whose wisdom independence and impartiality should be as carefully provided for as possible to determine controversies between men with power to enforce the execution of their judgments it may be that the means of intercourse with other members of the society inhabiting the same territory and with other states and countries for the mutual interchange of kind offices the products of labour the works of genius and learning and the discoveries of science should be provided for that public institutions should be founded for the care of the old sick and impotent the forced employment of the idle and imprudent and for the education of the young whose education otherwise would be neglected perhaps in the progress of society it may be found that some of these subjects important as they appear to be and undoubtedly are may be safely left to take care of themselves and that the assumption by government of the imperfect obligations of individuals is never the part of a wise policy there are indeed many subjects in regard to which we may well hesitate in deciding whether or not they fall within the legitimate province of government this however may be safely said that there is not much danger of erring upon the side of too little law it is not in the making of laws but in their stern and impartial execution that there is danger of failure few laws well executed are better than many laws slumbering on the statutebook these are snares to the unwary weapons of fraud and injustice in the hands of the astute reducing government itself to a condition of odium and weakness the true strength stability and glory of every government rest upon the intelligent loyalty of its subjects the world is notoriously too much governed legislators almost invariably aim at accomplishing too much representative democracies so far from being exempt from this vice are from their nature peculiarly liable to it annual legislatures increase the evil the members fall into the common mistake that their commission is to act not merely to decide whether action is necessary they would be blamed and ridiculed if they adjourned without some important act of legislation hence the annual volumes of our acts of assembly are fearfully growing in bulk it is not merely of the extent of local legislation or of the constantly recurring changes in the most general subjects of interest—finance revenue banking and pauperism—that there is reason to complain but scarce a session of the legislature passes without rash and illconsidered alterations in the civil code vitally affecting private rights and relations such laws are very frequently urged by men having causes pending who dare not boldly ask that a law should be made for their particular case but who do not hesitate to impose upon the legislature by plausible arguments the adoption of some general rule which by a retrospective construction will have the same operation it is a most monstrous practice which lawyers are bound by the true spirit of their oath of office and by a comprehensive view of their duty to the constitution and laws which they bear so large a part in administering to discountenance and prevent it is to be feared that too often it is the counsel of the party who recommends and cunningly frames the bill which when enacted into a law is legislatively to decide the cause these bills are sometimes appropriately called makes it is time that a resort to such a measure should be regarded in public estimation as a flagrant case of professional infidelity and misconduct it has become a favourite maxim that it is the great duty of government to promote the happiness of the people the phrase may be interpreted so as to mean well but it is a very inaccurate and unhappy one it is the inalienable right of the people to pursue their own happiness and the true and only true object of government is to secure them this right the happiness of the people is the happiness of the individuals who compose the mass speaking now with reference to those objects which human laws can reach and influence he is the happy man who sees his condition in life constantly but gradually improving even sudden changes of fortune from worse to better hold no comparison with this laws which open the door to the sudden creation of large fortunes by speculation have no tendency to promote the happiness of the people at large often alas not even the happiness of those for whose benefit they are made on the contrary in so far as they operate as they mostly do directly or indirectly to transfer property from the masses to the favoured few they contract the general limits of private comfort and independence the intellectual moral and religious capabilities enter largely into the account they too must be in the process of gradual improvement to satisfy the longings of a rational soul—one of the best signs that it is destined to an immortal existence and growth it is certainly true in the broad sense of the word that the wealth of a community is not necessarily the weal of the community a political institution says mr austin may further the weal of the community though it checks the growth of its wealth a political institution which quickens the growth of its wealth may hinder the advancement of its weal yet the wealth of individuals the aggregate of which is the wealth of the state is notwithstanding one great source of physical intellectual and moral advancement the stimulus and reward of effort and enterprise government can protect and promote it but in one way—by equal and just laws and the wise and impartial administration of them it usurps functions which do not belong to it and functions which it is not competent to use well when it undertakes to interpose by directing the pursuits of industry or encouraging its employment in any particular manner all that a government takes out of the pocket of individuals in the shape of taxes direct or indirect for any other than its appropriate and legitimate purposes is an invasion of their right to the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labour of mind or body the power of taxation in the legislature is in fact a part of the eminent domain—a power that must necessarily be reposed in the discretion of every government to furnish the very means for its own existence the unwise and even corrupt exercise of it is undoubtedly to be submitted to by the good citizen but no effort should be spared in any state to procure the repeal of all such laws and to reduce government from a complicated to a simple machine a few general objects steadily kept in view and strictly adhered to

after the representation of the commons was established the duration and intermissions of parliament were short but for several reigns preceding the revolution both had become extended to such a

plebis sua lege injuriæ faciendæ potestatem ademit auxilii ferendi reliquit de ll     r stat    car ii c  0   these observations have been termed by mr reeve in his fourth letter entitled thoughts on the english government a fabulous invention contrived in order to round and finish more completely his mythological account of three coequal and coordinate powers in the legislature but the truth and propriety of the learned commentators doctrine is admirably elucidated by the following extract from a work of considerable merit— this security is sometimes called the balance of the constitution and the political equilibrium which this phrase denotes consists in two contrivances a balance of power and a balance of interest by a balance of power is meant that there is no power possessed by one part of the legislature the abuse or excess of which is not checked by some antagonist power residing in another part thus the power of the two houses of parliament to frame laws is checked by the kings negative that if laws subversive of real government should obtain the consent of parliament the reigning prince by interposing his prerogative may save the necessary rights and authority of his station on the other hand the arbitrary application of this negative is checked by the privilege which parliament possesses of refusing supplies of money to the exigencies of the kings administration the constitutional maxim that the king can do no wrong is balanced by another maxim not less constitutional that the illegal commands of the king do not justify those who assist or concur in carrying them into execution and by a second rule subsidiary to this that the acts of the crown acquire not any legal force until authenticated by the subscription of some of its great officers the wisdom of this contrivance is worthy of observation as the king could not be punished without a civil war the constitution exempts his person from trial or account but lest this impunity should encourage a licentious exercise of dominion various obstacles are opposed to the private will of the sovereign when directed to illegal objects the pleasure of the crown must be announced with certain solemnities and attended by certain officers of state in some cases the royal order must be signified by a secretary of state in others it must pass under the privyseal and in many under the great seal and when the kings command is regularly published no mischief can be achieved by it without the ministry and compliance of those to whom it is directed now all who either concur in an illegal order by authenticating its publication with their seal or subscription or who in any manner assist in carrying it into execution subject themselves to prosecution and punishment for the part they have taken and are not permitted to plead or produce the command of the king in justification of their obedience but further the power of the crown to direct the military force of the kingdom is balanced by the annual necessity of resorting to parliament for the maintenance and government of that force the power of the king to declare war is checked by the privilege of the house of commons to grant or withhold the supplies by which the war must be carried on the kings choice of his ministers is controlled by the obligation he is under of appointing those men to offices in the state who are found capable of managing the affairs of his government with the two houses of parliament this consideration imposes such a necessity upon the crown as hath in a great measure subdued the idea of favouritism insomuch that it is become no uncommon spectacle in this country to see men promoted by the king to the highest offices and richest preferments which he has in his power to bestow who have been distinguished by their opposition to his personal inclinations by the balance of interest which accompanies and gives efficacy to the balance of power is meant this that the respective interests of the three estates of the empire are so disposed and adjusted that whichever of the three shall attempt any encroachment the other two will unite in resisting it if the king should endeavour to extend his authority by contracting the power and privileges of the commons the house of lords would see their own dignity endangered by every advance which the crown made to independency upon the resolutions of parliament the admission of arbitrary power is no less formidable to the grandeur of the aristocracy than it is fatal to the liberty of the republic that is it would reduce the nobility from the hereditary share they possess in the national councils in which their real greatness consists to the being made a part of the empty pageantry of a despotic court on the other hand if the house of commons should intrench upon the distinct province or usurp the established prerogative of the crown the house of lords would receive an instant alarm from every new stretch of popular power in every contest in which the king may be engaged with the representative body in defence of his established share of authority he will find a sure ally in the collective power of the nobility and attachment to the monarchy from which they derive their own distinction the allurement of a court in the habits and with the sentiments of which they have been brought up their hatred of equality and of all levelling pretensions which may ultimately affect the privileges or even the existence of their order in short every principle and every prejudice which are wont to actuate human conduct will determine their choice to the side and support of the crown lastly if the nobles themselves should attempt to revive the superiorities which their ancestors exercised under the feudal constitution the king and the people would alike remember how the one had been insulted and the other enslaved by that barbarous tyranny they would forget the natural opposition of their views and inclinations when they saw themselves threatened with a return of domination which was odious and intolerable to both—chitty by the constitution of the united states the president shall from time to time give to

that most of its excesses are to be traced to the same cause in the constitution of the united states and in all the state constitutions without exception the legislature is divided into two

absolute and without control in the ordinary course of administration the validity of their acts may be examined by the judiciary if they are not within the scope of or if they violate any of the provisions of the constitution they are pronounced and treated as null and void but over and beyond this there is a power of amendment of the constitution reserved in most if not all instances and the mode in which it shall be exercised is prescribed so that the most fundamental changes may be effected without revolution indeed it is the settled doctrine that without any such reservation the people of a state have the inherent and inalienable right to change their form of government as to the constitution of the united states it is equally clear that there is no such inherent power it can only be peaceably and constitutionally changed in the mode prescribed unless indeed by the unanimous consent of all the states composing the union in every case in which a change may take place not under some existing provision though it may be peaceable it may nevertheless be properly termed revolutionary applying that word to any change of fundamental law effected without the sanction of the existing constitution the constitution of pennsylvania of    0 contained no provision for its own amendment by an act of the legislature the question was at several times submitted to the people at the polls whether a convention should be called to amend that constitution after having failed in this form which was supposed to vest too absolute a power in a convention the question submitted and finally answered in the affirmative by a majority was that a convention should be called to submit its proceedings to a vote of the people this was done and the amendments proposed submitted to the people and adopted by them among the amendments thus submitted and adopted was one providing a mode in which future amendments might be proposed by the legislature and submitted to the people at the polls it is to be observed however that the amendments were submitted to the body of electors who had been ascertained by the previous constitution and laws it was not then fully a revolutionary proceeding as the former constitution was considered so far in force as to govern upon this important point the decision was acquiesced in and the amendments of      went peaceably into operation as part of the fundamental law of the state a more difficult and intricate question arose in rhode island when the separation from the mothercountry took place rhode island did not like the other states adopt a new constitution but continued the form of government established by the charter of charles ii in      making only such alterations by acts of the legislature as were necessary to adapt it to their condition and rights as an independent state in this form of government no mode of proceeding was pointed out by which amendments might be made it authorized the legislature to prescribe the qualifications of voters and in the exercise of this power they had confined the right of suffrage to freeholders many of the citizens became dissatisfied with the charter government and particularly with the restrictions upon the right of suffrage memorials were addressed to the legislature upon this subject urging the justice and expediency of a more liberal rule but they failed to produce the desired effect voluntary meetings were held and a convention assembled the convention framed a constitution in which the right of suffrage was extended to every male citizen of twentyone years who had resided in the state for one year and in the town in which he offered to vote for six months next preceding the election the convention also prescribed the manner in which this constitution should be submitted to the decision of the people permitting every one to vote on that question who was an american citizen twentyone years old and who had a permanent residence or home in the state and directing the votes to be returned to the convention upon the return of the votes the convention declared that the constitution was adopted and ratified by a majority of the people of the state and was the paramount law and constitution of rhode island elections were accordingly held under it and the legislature under it assembled at providence may        the charter government set itself in opposition to these proceedings it is unnecessary to trace the history of the contest the charter government at its session in january      had taken measures to call a convention by which a new constitution was formed submitted to the people and ratified by them at the polls the times and places at which the votes were to be given the persons who were to receive and return them and the qualifications of the voters having all been previously authorized and provided for by law passed by the charter government this new constitution went into operation in may      at which time the old charter government formally surrendered all its powers and this constitution has continued ever since to be the admitted and established fundamental law of rhode island in all probability the result of this contest would have been different if the charter government had not by the timely concession of a convention yielded to the popular demand and thus secured on their side all those friends of peace and order who having thus obtained the substance of their wishes refused to contend forcibly and by revolution for a mere abstraction an action orought against an officer of the charter government after the adoption of the revolutionary constitution for an arrest raised the question of the legality of the authority under which he acted it was carried by writ of error to the supreme court of the united states that tribunal refused to decide the question holding that it was not a judicial question but rested solely with the political power of the state if the question arise between two different governments organized under different constitutions the courts of which are to decide the question judicial power presupposes an established government capable of enacting laws and enforcing their execution and of appointing judges to expound and administer them the acceptance of the judicial office is a recognition of the authority of the government from which it is derived and if the authority of that government is annulled and overthrown the power of its courts and other offices is annulled with it and if a state court should enter upon the inquiry proposed and should come to the conclusion that the government under which it acted had been put aside and displaced by an opposing government it would cease to be a court and be incapable of pronouncing a judicial decision upon the question it undertook to try if it decides at all as a court it necessarily affirms the existence and authority of the government under which it is exercising judicial power so far

plain and obvious construction would be that wherever a freeholder has an estate which would yield him  0s before these taxes are paid or for which he would receive a rent of  0s if he paid the taxes himself he would have a right to vote yet a committee has decided that when a tenant paid a rent less than  0s but paid parochial taxes which added to the rent amounted to more than  0s the landlord had no right to vote a strange decision   lud     two committees have held that the interest of a mortgage is a charge which if it reduces the value under  0s takes away the vote—though there is an

purposes it would be highly unreasonable and absurd to suppose though it has been so contended that it extends to every case where a person fairly and without any particular view to an election purchases a part of a greater estate it is part of the freeholders oath that the estate has not been granted to him fraudulently on purpose to qualify him to give his vote the one vote i presume was intended for the part retained by the grantor for if the whole had been granted out thus fraudulently no vote at all could have been given for it see this subject treated fully in mr heywoods law of elect    it cannot i should think be considered a fraudulent grant under any statute if a person should purchase an estate merely for the sake of the vote if he buys it absolutely and without any reservation or secret agreement between the grantor and himself but it never has been supposed that this statute extends to cases which arise from operation of law as devises descents c as if an

intended to prevent fraud and confusion by having a ready proof of the existence of the estate of the voter and some measure of its value but it is itself perhaps a greater evil than it was intended to remove for an omission or irregularity in the assessment operates as a disfranchisement every freeholder who wishes to preserve the important privilege of voting must carefully examine every year the assessment when it is stuck upon the churchdoor to see that he is duly assessed and if he is not he may appeal to the commissioners and he may any time afterwards apply to the clerk of the peace

referred to by the learned judge says that this rate of wages hath been time out of mind and that it is expressed in many records and for example refers to one in    edw iii where this allowance is made to one of the knights for the county of middlesex but mr prynnes fourth register of parliamentary writs is confined almost entirely to the investigation of this subject and contains a very particular chronological history of the writ de expensis militum civium et burgensium which was framed to enforce the payment of these wages mr prynne is of opinion that these wages had no other origin than that principle of natural equity and justice qui sentit commodum debet sentire et onus p   and mr prynne further informs us that the first writs of this kind extant in our records are coeval with our kings first writs of summons to elect and send knights citizens and burgesses to parliament both of them being first invented issued and recorded together in    hen iii before which there are no memorials nor evidences of either of those writs in our historians or records p   the first writs direct the sheriff to levy from the community ie the electors of the county and to pay the knights rationabiles expensas suas in veniendo ad dictum parliamentum ibidem morando et exinde ad propria redeundo and when the writs of summons were renewed in the   d of edw i these writs issued again in the same form at the end of the parliament and were continued in the same manner till the    edw ii when mr prynne finds the memorable writs which first reduced the expense of the representatives to a certain sum by the day viz  s a day for every knight and  s for every citizen and burgess and they specified also the number of days for which this allowance was to be made being more or less according to the distance between the place of meeting in parliament and the members residence when this sum was first ascertained in the writ the parliament was held at york and therefore the members for yorkshire were only allowed their wages for the number of days the parliament actually sat being supposed to incur no expense in returning to their respective homes but at the same time the members for the distant counties had a proportionate allowance in addition though from this time the number of days and a certain sum are specifically expressed in the writ yet mr prynne finds a few instances after this where the allowance is a less sum and in one where one of the county members had but  s a day because he was not in fact a knight but with those few exceptions the sum and form continued with little or no variation mr prynne conjectures with great appearance of reason that the members at that time enjoyed the privilege of parliament only for the number of days for which they were allowed wages that being considered a sufficient time for their return to their respective dwellings p    but this allowance from its nature and origin did not preclude any other specific engagement or contract between the member and his constituents and the editor of glanvilles reports has given in the preface p    the copy of a curious agreement between john strange the member for dunwich and his electors in the   edw iv      in which the member covenants whether the parliament hold long time or short or whether it fortune to be prorogued that he will take for his wages only a cade and half a barrel of herrings to be delivered by christmas in scotland the representation of the shires was introduced or confirmed by the authority of the legislature in the

it is said that andrew marvell who was member for hull in the parliament after the restoration was the last person in this country that received wages from his constituents two shillings a day the allowance to a burgess was so considerable a sum in ancient times that there are many instances where boroughs petitioned to be excused from sending members to parliament representing that they were engaged in building bridges or other public works and therefore unable to bear such an extraordinary expense pryn on   inst    and it is somewhat remarkable that from the    edw iii and uniformly

these acts enact that the candidate offending against these statutes shall be disabled and incapacitated to serve in that parliament for such county c the obvious meaning of these words and of the rest of the statutes is that treating vacates that election only and that the candidate is no way disqualified from being reelected and sitting upon a second return see the second case of norwich        lud     though the contrary was determined in the case of honiton      ib     but after the general election in      the return of one of the members for the borough of southwark was declared void by a committee because it was proved that he had treated during the election upon that vacancy he offered himself again a candidate and having a majority of votes was returned as duly elected but upon the petition of the other candidate the next committee determined that the sitting member was ineligible and that the petitioner ought to have been returned and he took his seat accordingly it has been supposed that the payment of travelling expenses and a compensation for loss of time were not treating or bribery within this or any other statute and a bill passed the house of commons to subject such cases to the penalties imposed by   geo ii c    upon persons guilty of bribery but this bill was rejected in the house of lords by the opposition of lord mansfield who strenuously maintained that the bill was superfluous that such conduct by the laws in being was clearly illegal and subject in a court of law to the penalties of bribery   lud    indeed it is so repugnant both to the letter and spirit of these statutes that it is surprising that such a notion and practice should ever have prevailed and that though it is certainly to be regretted that any elector should be prevented by his poverty from exercising a valuable privilege yet it probably would be a much greater injury to the country at large if it were deprived of the services of all gentlemen of moderate fortune by the legalizing of such a practice even with the most equitable restrictions not to mention the door that it might open to the grossest impurity and corruption—christian however the    geo iii c     s   provides that nothing in that act contained shall extend or be construed to extend to any money paid or agreed to be paid to or by any person for any legal expense bona fide incurred at or concerning any election and lord ellenborough and mr baron thompson have held at nisi prius that a reasonable compensation for the loss of time and travelling expenses is not illegal   peckw    —chitty in the sessions of   0  mr tierney brought in a bill to prevent the candidates from conveying the electors at their expense that excellent bill was opposed by mr fox who argued that it would be injurious to the popular part of the government by reducing the number of electors but surely the popular part of the government sustains an infinitely greater loss from the diminution of the number of the eligible for many by the present practice are totally precluded from serving their country in parliament whom the resident electors those who are best acquainted with their merits would think the fittest objects of their choice if an innkeeper furnishes provisions to the voters contrary to the   w iii c   though at the express request or order of one of the candidates he cannot afterwards maintain an action against that candidate as courts of justice will not enforce the performance of a contract made in direct violation of the general law of the country   bos  pull    —christian and according to the judgment of eyre ch j in that case and the decision in lofhouse vs wharton   camb   0 the acts made no difference between resident and nonresident voters and the candidate cannot legally defray the travelling or other expenses of voters—chitty d in like manner the julian law de ambitu inflicted fines and infamy upon all who were guilty of corruption at elections but if the person guilty convicted another offender he was restored to his credit again ff            this is enacted by   geo ii c    explained and enlarged by   geo ii c    and    geo ii c    but these statutes do not create any incapacity of sitting in the house that depends solely upon the treating act mentioned in the note ante     n  0 it has been held that it is bribery if a candidate gives an elector money to vote for him though he afterwards votes for another   burr      and it has been decided that such vote will not be available to the person to whom it may afterwards be given gratuitously but the propriety of that decision has been questioned by respectable authority   doug     besides the penalties imposed by the legislature bribery is a crime at common law and punishable by indictment or information though the court of kings bench will not in ordinary cases grant an information within two years the time within which an action may be brought for the penalties under the statute   burr           but this rule does not affect a prosecution by an indictment or by an information by the attorneygeneral who in one case was ordered by the house to prosecute two gentlemen who had procured themselves to be returned by bribery they were convicted and sentenced by the court of kings bench to pay each a fine of  000 marks and to be imprisoned six months   doug     in an action for bribery a person may be a witness to prove the bribery although he admits that he intends to avail himself of the conviction in that action to protect himself as the first discoverer in an action brought against him for the same offence   east   0—christian    lord mansfield observed upon this that there could be no fine set in the house of commons it must have been in the starchamber   burr      but the journals of the commons on the day referred to by the learned judge expressly state that it is ordered by this house that a fine of twenty pounds be assessed upon the corporation for their said lewd and slanderous attempt e   inst    hale of parl     com jour  0 and    may         the legislature has exerted its utmost energies especially of late years but in effectually to check these dangerous and demoralizing courses at length in the year      all existing statutes on the subject were repealed and other provisions substituted together with an entirely new mode of conducting elections by an act entitled the corrupt practices and prevention act this statute defines carefully and comprehensively what constitutes bribery treating and undue influence imposes serious penalties totally prohibits acts formerly found to be modes of exercising corrupt influence and strictly limits legitimate expenses requiring them to be paid only through an officer called the election auditor whose accounts are to be published and finally disables a candidate declared by an electioncommittee guilty by himself or his agents of bribery treating or undue influence from being elected or sitting in the house of commons for the place where the offence was committed during the parliament then in existence        vict c  0 —warren    all electors are

this and from other authorities it follows that a duke of cornwall is born of full age or is subject to no minority with respect to his enjoyment of the possessions annexed to the dukedom this is a strange species of inheritance and perhaps is the only mode of descent which depends upon the authority of a statute in the princes case reported by lord coke the question was whether the original grant to edward the black prince who was created in the   th of ed iii duke of cornwall and who was the first duke in england after the duke of normandy had the authority of parliament or was an honour conferred by the kings charter alone if the latter the limitation would have been void as nothing less than the power of parliament can alter the established rules of descent but

necessarily coexisting with an intention to subvert the rule and government established in the country it is a purpose to destroy and depose him in whom the supreme power rule and government under

all intents constructions and purposes whatever that in case any person or persons shall sue forth or prosecute any such writ or process such person or persons and all attorneys or solicitors

secretary of state and by such secretary transmitted to the marshal of the district in which congress shall reside who shall upon receipt thereof affix the same in some public place in his office whereto all persons may resort and take copies without fee or reward it is observable that while both the english and american statutes prohibit process of arrest of the person or attachment of the goods neither of them forbids that of summons so familiar to both codes it is unnecessary to suppose that this material omission was unintentional it may be remarks mr c j ingersoll   american law mag  0  that the summons was deemed a harmless measure against persons not resident according to legal fiction when proceeded against against whom therefore judgment would be of no avail there and no more available as the foundation of fresh suits against them elsewhere as the commencement of an action to lead to any profitable results summons is incompatible with privilege it is agreed however on all hands that the privilege does not rest on the statute but on the law of nations the statute only adding certain penalties to secure its observance a minister is therefore as much privileged from the service of a summons as any other writ it is laid down however by many eminent writers that the exemption from the jurisdiction of the local tribunals and authorities does not apply to the contentious jurisdiction which may be conferred on those tribunals by the minister voluntarily making himself a party to a suit at law hence perhaps it was that in the constitution and laws of the united states jurisdiction is conferred on the federal courts in all suits brought by ambassadors or other public ministers and also in such suits and proceedings against ambassadors or other public ministers as a court of law can have or exercise consistently with the law of nations const u s art iii s   act of sept           story    the exemption extends to the goods and chattels of a public minister but not to real property possessed by an ambassador in his private capacity nor does it extend to stock in trade according to bynkershoek if on petition a sovereign will not compel his ambassador to satisfy his creditors their remedy is by suit in the courts of his own country or by action in rem where he possesses property not privileged and the law allows that form of proceeding the act of congress however expressly prohibits attachment of goods and chattels without drawing any distinction between such as are or are not privileged and as to debts due the minister and real property though not within the statute so far as penalty is concerned it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they are within the intent and spirit so far as illegality is concerned in      a controversy arose between prussia and the united states in regard to the right of a landlord to seize the goods of a public minister for the rent of a house which he had leased the act of congress of    0 expressly prohibits such distress as regards foreign ministers in this country therefore as long as this law exists there would be no question but of course that act is in that respect merely expressive of the sense of its framers and though it could be decidedly urged against us cannot be pleaded in our favour as evidence of what is the law of nations the proprietor of the house in which the united states minister at berlin resided claimed the right under an article of the prussian code of detaining the goods of the minister found on the premises at the expiration of his lease in order to secure the payment of damages alleged to be due on account of injuries done to the house during the contract the prussian government contended that the general exemption under international law of the personal property of foreign ministers from the local jurisdiction did not extend to this case where the right of detention was created by the contract itself and by the legal effect given to it by the local law of course the principle of this decision includes the case of distress for rent the controversy in question was terminated as between the parties by the proprietor of the house restoring the effects which had been detained on the payment of a reasonable compensation for the injury done to the premises the correspondence terminated however without either party yielding its opinions so that

commissions to private persons fitting out such ships which are thence called privateers the prizes captured by such vessels are divided according to the contract entered into between the owners and the master and crew of the privateer but the crown has still the prerogative of releasing any prize captured by such ships at any time previously to condemnation letters of marque as these commissions are called are valid only during the war and may be vacated either by express revocation or by the misconduct of the parties as for example by their cruelty the conference which met at paris in      after the war with russia closed its labours by recommending to the established governments of the world the entire abolition of the system of privateering and that in time of war neutral flags and neutral goods should be inviolable the conference was of opinion that the abolition of privateering and the acknowledgment of neutral rights were alike desirable and necessary for improving our system of war and bringing it into harmony with the ideas and principles of modern civilization this proclaimed opinion of several of the great powers of europe may therefore lead ere long to treaties by which the prerogative of the crown in issuing letters of marque will become merely matter of history—kerr the government of the united states did not respond favourably to this proposal of the conference of paris the secretary of state william l marcy proposed however what would still more bring the system of war into harmony with the ideas and principles of modern civilization and at the

of equity for a demand for which the defendant cannot be arrested in an action at law upon the affidavit made that there is reason to apprehend that he will leave the kingdom before the conclusion of

contained at different periods from the conquest till the  0th year of edw iii a pound sterling was actually a pound troyweight of silver which was divided into twenty shillings so if ten pounds at that time were the price of a horse the same quantity of silver was paid for it as is now given if its price is thirty pounds this therefore is one great cause of the apparent difference in the prices of commodities in ancient and modern times about the year      edward iii coined twentytwo shillings out of a pound and five years afterwards he coined twentyfive shillings out of the same quantity henry v in the beginning of his reign divided the pound into thirty shillings and then of consequence the shilling was double the weight of a shilling at present henry vii increased the number to forty which was the standard number till the beginning of the reign of elizabeth she then coined a pound sterling of silver into sixtytwo shillings and now by    geo iii c    the pound troy of standard silver eleven ounces two pennyweights fine c may be coined into sixtysix shillings see money in the index to humes hist dr adam smith at the end of his first volume has given tables specifying the average prices of wheat for five hundred and fifty years back and has reduced for each year the money of that time into the money of the present day but in his calculation he has called the pound since elizabeths time sixty shillings taking it at that rate we may easily find the equivalent in modern money of any sum in ancient time if we know the number of shillings which weighed a pound by this simple rule as the number of shillings in a pound at that time is to sixty so is any sum at that time to its equivalent at present as for instance in the time of henry v as thirty shillings are to sixty shillings now so ten pounds then were equal to twenty pounds of present money the increase in the quantity of the precious metals does not necessarily increase the price of articles of commerce for if the quantities of these articles are augmented in the same proportion as the quantity of money it is clear there will be the same use demand or price for money as before and no effect will be produced in the price of commodities if gold and silver could have been kept in the country the immense increase of paper currency or substitution of paper for coin would have diminished its value and have increased the prices of labour and commodities far beyond the effect that has been produced by the discovery of the mines in america the effect they have produced is general and extended to the whole world but the increase of our paper has only a tendency to lessen the value of money at home which never can take place to any great degree as it will naturally seek a better market or be carried where more will be given for it and by the substitution of a cheaper medium of commerce the difference in value is added to the capital or to the real strength of the nation gold and silver form an insignificant part of the real wealth of a commercial country the whole quantity of specie in the country has been estimated at about twenty millions only—much less than

by the kings precept which valuation was so far as it extended over the province of canterbury finished in      and as to york also in the following year the whole being under the direction of john bishop of winton and oliver bishop of lincoln in      a third taxation entitled nova taxatio was made but this only extended over some part of the province of york it became necessary chiefly in consequence of the scottish invasion of the border counties which rendered the clergy of those districts unable to pay tenths and firstfruits according to the higher valuation it was made by virtue of royal mandate directed to the bishop of carlisle—hargrave n numb xviii      when the firstfruits and tenths were transferred to the crown of england by    hen viii c   at the same time it was enacted that commissioners should be appointed in every diocese who should certify the value of every ecclesiastical benefice and preferment in the respective dioceses and according to this valuation the firstfruits and tenths were to be collected and paid in future this valor beneficiorum is what is commonly called the kings books a transcript of which is given in ectons thesaurus and bacons liber regis—christian   the archbishops and bishops have four years allowed for the payment and shall pay one quarter every year if they live so long upon the bishopric but other dignitaries in the church pay theirs in the same manner as rectors and vicars—christian   after queen anne had appropriated the revenue arising from the payment of firstfruits and tenths to the augmentation of small livings it was considered a proper extension of this principle to exempt the smaller livings from the encumbrance of those demands and for that end the bishops of every diocese were directed to inquire and certify into the exchequer what livings did not exceed  0l a year according to the improved value at that time and it was further provided that such livings should be discharged from those dues in future—christian o   anne c      anne c      geo i st   c  0   geo i c  0   these trustees were erected into a corporation and have authority to make rules and orders for the distribution of this fund the principal rules they have established are that the sum to be allowed for each augmentation shall be  00l to be laid out in land which shall be annexed forever to the living and they shall make this donation first to all livings not exceeding  0l a year then to all livings not above  0l and so in order whilst any remain under  0l a year but when any private benefactor will advance  00l the trustees will give another  00l for the advancement of any living not above   l a year though it should not belong to that class of livings which are then augmenting   burn ec l   0 though this was a splendid instance of royal munificence yet its operation is slow and inconsiderable for the number of livings certified to be under  0l a year was no less than      of which      did not exceed  0l a year each and      between  0l and  0l a year and the rest between  0l and  0l so that there were      benefices in this country which had less than   l a year each upon an average dr burn calculates that from the fund alone it will require     years from the year      when it commenced before all these livings can be raised to  0l and if private benefactors should contribute half as much as the fund which is very improbable it will require     years but even taking this supposition to have been true ever since the establishment it will follow that the wretched pittance from each of      livings both from the royal bounty and private benefaction cannot upon an average have yet been augmented  l a year   burn e l     dr burn in this calculation computes the clear amount of the bounty to make fiftyfive augmentations daily that is at   000l a year but sir john sinclair hist rev   part     says that this branch of the revenue amounted to about   000l per annum and on the  st of january      the governors of that charity possessed besides from savings and private benefactions the sum of     00l of old south sea annuities and     l of cash in the hands of their treasurer the state of that fund has of late years been carefully concealed but it probably yields at present from forty to fifty thousand pounds per annum this conjecture must certainly be very wide of the truth of the case for the source of this fund is fixed and permanent except the variation depending upon the contingency of vacancies which will be more or fewer in different years and what object can the commissioners have in the accumulation of this fund for that accumulation can only arise by depriving the poor clergy of the assistance which was intended them and to enrich the successor at the expense of the wretched incumbent of the present day the condition of the poor clergy in this country certainly requires some further national provision neither learning religion nor good morals can secure poverty from contempt in the minds of the vulgar the immense inequality in the revenues of the ministers of the gospel not always resulting from piety and merit naturally excites discontent and prejudices against the present establishment of the church if the whole of the profits and emoluments of every benefice for one year were appropriated to this purpose an effect would be produced in twenty or thirty years which will require  00 by the present plan this was what was originally understood by the firstfruits and what actually within the last  00 years was paid and carried out of the kingdom to support the superstition and folly of popery if upon any promotion to a benefice it was provided that there should be no vacancy or cession of former preferment till the end of the year who could complain it would certainly soon yield a supply which would communicate both comfort and respectability to the indigent clergy—christian p   anne st   c   q in like manner by the civil law the

000l granted by parliament to the american loyalists as a compensation for their loss of property brief exam  0—chitty the capital of the national debt funded and unfunded amounted at the close of the year      to upwards of seven hundred and seventyfive millions and the interest and the charges of management to upwards of twentyseven millions and a half—kerr    it is a very erroneous notion indeed to suppose that the property of the kingdom is increased by national debts contracted in consequence of the expenses of war on the contrary the principal of the debt is the exact amount of the property which the nation has lost from its capital forever the american war cost the nation     millions sterling and the effect is precisely the same as if so much of its wealth and treasure in corn cattle cloth ammunition coin c had been collected together and thrown into the sea besides the loss accuring from the destruction of many of its most productive hands when this property is consumed it never can be retrieved though industry and care may acquire and accumulate new stores such a supply by no mode of taxation that has yet been devised could be collected at once without exhausting the patience and endurance of the people but by the method of funding the subjects are induced to suppose that their suffering consists only in the payment of the yearly interest of this immense waste the ruin is completed before the interest commences and that is paid by the nation to the nation and returns back to its former channel and circulation like the balls in a tenniscourt however they may be tossed from one side to the other their sum and quantity within the court continue the same the extravagance of individuals naturally suggested the system of funding public debts when a man cannot satisfy the immediate demands of his creditor it is an obvious expedient to give him a promissory note to pay him at a future day with interest for the time and if this is an assignable note so that the creditor may be enabled to persuade another to advance him the principal and to stand in his place it is exactly similar to the debts or securities of government except that in general they are not payable at any definite time all debts when no effects remain both in public and private are certain evidence of the waste and consumption of so much property which nothing can restore though frugality and industry may alleviate the future consequences when a debt is contracted a man is not richer for paying it if he owes one hundred pounds and pay interest for it he is in no degree richer by calling in one hundred pounds from which he receives the same interest and therewith discharges the debt but probably if he does so he will feel himself more comfortable and independent and will find his credit higher if his occasions should oblige him to borrow in future so it is with governments when the debt is contracted and the money spent the mischief is done the discharge of the debt can add nothing or little comparatively immediately to the stock or capital of the nation but yet these important consequences may be expected from it viz from the abolition of taxes upon candles soap salt beer and upon a melancholy catalogue of the necessary articles of life taxes which take from those who have nothing to spare the price of labour would be lowered manufactures would flourish with renewed vigour the minds of the people would be cheered and the nation would again have credit and spirit to meet its most formidable enemies and to repel and resent both injury and insult all the nations of europe have learned from such dearbought experience that poverty and misery are the inevitable consequences of war as to give us reason to hope that the lives and property of mankind will not in future be dissipated with the profusion and wantonness of former times—christian m see page        the last is certainly a serious and unanswerable objection to the increase of the national debt but the three first objections made by the learned judge do not seem to be very satisfactory it is not clear that it is an evil that things should grow nominally dear in proportion to the increase of specie or the medium of commerce for they will still retain their relative or comparative values with each other dr adam smith has ably shown the benefit which a country derives from substituting any cheap article for gold and silver the consequence is that the precious metals do not become of less value or if so it is but in a small degree but they are carried to a foreign market and bring back an increase of capital to the country if one million pounds worth of paper or shells would answer as well to settle accounts go to market and would serve all the purposes of gold and silver whilst these preserved their price abroad and if the coin of this country at present amount to thirty millions we should gain what was equivalent to twentynine millions by the substitution but the paper security created by the national debt is little used in payments or as a medium of commerce like bills of exchange as to the second objection foreigners can only take away the interest of money which they have actually brought into the country and which it must be presumed our merchants are deriving as great a benefit from and probably much greater with regard to the third objection i cannot think it sound discretion ever to raise an invidious distinction between those who pay and those who receive the taxes and to treat the latter with contempt it cannot be supposed that property will ever be accumulated by idleness and indolence and he surely deserves the best of his country who in disposing of the fruits of his industry prefers the funds to any other security for without such confidence the nation would soon be reduced to a state of bankruptcy and ruin—christian    by the    geo iii c    parliament vested one million annually in commissioners for the reduction of the national debt and the act provided that when the annual million should be increased by the interest of the stock purchased to four millions the dividends should no longer be paid upon the redeemed stock and that the sinking fund should no longer accumulate and by the    geo iii c    when the dividends should amount to three millions exclusive of the annual grant there should be no further accumulation and it was provided that upon all future loans which were not to be paid off within fortyfive years one per cent should be annually appropriated to their reduction by the    geo iii c    an additional grant of  00000l was made for the same purpose which has since been annually renewed the    geo iii c    repeals so much of the    geo iii and    geo iii as fixed a limit to the accumulation of the sinking fund and consolidates the funds provided by each act and states that by the accumulation of that joint fund the whole national debt may be redeemed in fortyfive years on the  st of february   0  the commissioners by these funds had redeemed of the national debt        0 l and from the dividends and the annual allowance from the statutes above referred to they had an annual income for the further reduction of        l—christian such was the state of the sinking fund in   0  when mr christian published his edition of blackstones commentaries there is a fallacy however in the history of this fund which must not pass unnoticed in the absence of information to the contrary it would be presumed that this fund was a real surplus annually paid into the treasury beyond the amount necessary for the public expenditure that while the nation like an honest man was paying off its old debts like a prudent one it was not involving itself still deeper in new ones to meet these arrangements but such has not been the fact for during the whole of the late war a larger sum of money than the amount of the sinking fund was borrowed annually to meet the public expenses at a much higher rate of interest than the sinking fund produced hence it has been contended that this muchcommended financial expedient has been detrimental instead of beneficial to the public inasmuch as the national debt is now larger notwithstanding the amount redeemed than it would have been had the sinking fund been annually applied to the public service by which means the amount of the yearly loans might have been reduced to the extent of the sum thus applied without attempting to deny the truth of this reasoning its force may be in some measure obviated by the considerations that the sinking fund enabled the commissioners to a certain extent to keep up the price of the stocks by purchasing largely whenever they were depressed and thus preserving the credit of the country which enabled the government to negotiate their loans upon better terms than they could otherwise have obtained besides it preserved the assurance which was given when the sinking fund was first established that means would be prosecuted for the ultimate liquidation of the debt since the peace of      those means have not been diverted or rendered ineffectual as they were before and we may now look to a real reduction from year to year in the national debt by the operation of the sinking fund—chitty n stat   geo iii c   o see page     p lord clar continuation     q com jour   sept    0

and an officer of the court administers an oath to them in old french that they will nominate no one from favour partiality or any improper motive this done the same officer having the list of the counties in alphabetical order and of those who were nominated the year preceding reads over the three names and the last of the three he pronounces to be the present sheriff but where there has been a pocketsheriff he reads the three names upon the list and then declares who is the present sheriff if any of the ministry or judges has an objection to the names he then mentions it and another gentleman is nominated in his room if no objection is made some one rises and says to the two gentlemen i know no objection and i recommend a b esq in the room of the present sheriff another officer has a paper with a number of names given him by the clerk of assize for each county which paper generally contains the names of the gentlemen upon the former list and also of gentlemen who are likely to be nominated and whilst the three are nominated he prefixes     or   to their names according to the order in which they are placed which for greater certainty he afterwards reads over twice

vacant yet the former statute   edw ii st   leaves the number indefinite viz sheriffs shall be assigned by the chancellor c and if such a statute had passed in the course of those eleven years it is probable that it would have been referred to by subsequent statutes i should conceive that the practice originated from the consideration that as the king was to confirm the nomination by his patent it was more convenient and respectful to present three to him than only one and though this proceeding did not exactly correspond with the directions of the statute yet it was not contrary to its spirit or in strictness to its letter and therefore the judges might perhaps think themselves warranted in saying that the three persons were chosen according to the tenor of the statute—christian   in the king vs woodrow   t r     an information was granted against a person so refusing and the reason assigned was because the vacancy of the office occasioned a stop of public justice it should

born abroad whose father and grandfather by the fathers side were naturalborn subjects at common law unless the father or paternal grandfather through whom the claim is made was at the time of the birth of such children liable in case of his return into this country to the penalties of treason or felony or was in the actual service of any foreign prince then at enmity with the crown of england

michael foster observes that the wellknown maxim which the writers upon our law have adopted and applied to this case nemo potest exuere patriam comprehendeth the whole doctrine of natural allegiance fost     and this is exemplified by a strong instance in the report which that learned judge has given of æneas macdonalds case he was a native of great britain but had received his education from his early infancy in france had spent his riper years in a profitable employment in that kingdom and had accepted a commission in the service of the french king acting under that commission he was taken in arms against the king of england for which he was indicted and convicted of high treason but was pardoned upon condition of his leaving the kingdom and continuing abroad during his life ib    this is certainly an extreme case and we should have reason to think our law deficient in justice and humanity if we could discover any intermediate general limit to which the law could be relaxed consistently with sound policy or the public safety—christian the writers on public law have spoken rather loosely but generally in favour of the right of a subject or citizen to abandon his native country unless there be some positive restraint by law or he is at the time in possession of a public trust or unless his country be in distress or at war or stands in need of his assistance it is plain that any exceptions destroy the rule especially such as those just mentioned it amounts to saying that when a society has no reason the removal of a member ought not to be opposed cicero regarded it as one of the firmest foundations of roman liberty that the roman citizen had the privilege to stay or renounce his residence at pleasure but this is different from the unqualified right of expatriation the question has been frequently discussed in the courts of the united states and though never expressly decided chancellor kent from a historical review of these discussions concludes that the better opinion is that a citizen cannot renounce his allegiance without permission to be declared by law and that as there is no existing legislative regulation in the case the rule of the english common law—nemo potest exuere patriam—remains unaltered   kents com     judge patterson expressed the opinion that though the legislature of a particular state should by law specify the lawful causes of expatriation and prescribe the manner in which it might be effected the emigration could only affect the local allegiance of the party and would not draw after it a renunciation of the higher allegiance due to the united states   dallas     professor tucker takes an entirely different view and has come to a different conclusion tuckers blackstone appendix note k there are practical difficulties which in all probability will ever prevent any legislative action however as for all commercial purposes even in time of war the national character is determined exclusively by domicil without regard either to natural or acquired allegiance and as it would offend the sense of humanity of enlightened nations at present to treat as criminals persons who by the silent acquiescence and therefore the presumed consent of the country of their birth had removed their fortunes and assumed new duties of obedience in other countries if even they should be taken in arms against their native country the question is not of immediate practical moment though great britain has never formally yet she has really in fact abandoned her once asserted right to impress her native subjects on board of foreign merchantmen the right of visitation and search of public national armed vessels for that purpose was never asserted in case however of revolutions it is recognised as law—at least in this country—that persons dissatisfied with the change have a right to remove with their effects provided that right be exercised within a reasonable time the sound and prevailing doctrine now is that by the treaty of peace of      great britain and the united states became respectively entitled as against each other to the allegiance of all persons who were at the time adhering to the governments respectively and that those persons became aliens in respect to the government to which they did not adhere of course all persons born in the united states had the right to adhere or not to the new government as they might elect there is this difference between the decisions of the english and american courts—a difference which seems naturally to result from their different national positions in reference to the question the former adopt the date of the definitive treaty of peace by which the independence of the united states was acknowledged viz sept        as the period when the change took

indelible stain upon the powers concerned in it the czarina sent several of her subjects with large sums of money into poland to purchase all the estates that offered for sale at the same time

power of naturalization was exclusively in congress they are not however aliens and the power granted to congress to establish a uniform rule of naturalization is by the wellunderstood meaning of the

the colonial communities and never amalgamated with them in social connections or in government but although they were uncivilized they were yet a free and independent people associated together in nations or tribes and governed by their own laws many of these political communities were situated in territories to which the white race claimed the ultimate right of dominion but that claim was acknowledged to be subject to the right of the indians to occupy it as long as they thought proper and neither the english nor colonial governments claimed or exercised any dominion over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied nor claimed the right to the possession of the territory until the tribe or nation consented to cede it these indian governments were regarded and treated as foreign governments as much as if an ocean had separated the red man from the white and their freedom has constantly been acknowledged from the time of the first emigration to the english colonies to the present day by the different governments which succeeded each other treaties have been negotiated with them and their alliance sought for in war and the people who compose these indian political communities have always been treated as foreigners not living under our government it is true that the course of events has brought the indian tribes within the limits of the united states under subjection to the white race and it has been found necessary for their sake as well as our own to regard them as in a state of pupilage and to legislate to a certain extent over them and the territory they occupy but they may without doubt like the subjects of any other foreign government be naturalized by the authority of congress and become citizens of a state and of the united states and if an individual should leave his nation or tribe and take up his abode among the white population he would be entitled to all the rights and privileges which would belong to an emigrant from any other

there is an endowment he may recover all that is contained in it and he may still retain what he and his predecessors have enjoyed by prescription though not expressed in it for such a prescription amounts to evidence of another consistent endowment these endowments frequently invest the vicar with some part of the great tithes therefore the words rectorial and vicarial tithes have no definite

preceding page and note must necessarily have an appropriator over him or a sinecure rector who in some books is considered and called an appropriator of benefices some have never been appropriated consequently in those there can be no vicar and the incumbent is rector and entitled to all the dues of the church some were appropriated to secular ecclesiastical corporations which appropriations still exist except perhaps some few which may have been dissolved others were appropriated to the houses of the regular clergy all which appropriations at the dissolution of monasteries were transferred to the crown and in the hands of the king or his grantees are now called impropriations but in some appropriated churches no perpetual vicar has ever been endowed in that case the

temporal nobility consisted only of earls and barons and by whatever right the earls and the mitred clergy before that time might have attended the great council of the nation it abundantly appears that they afterwards sat in the feudal parliament in the character of barons it has been truly said that for some time after the conquest wealth was the only nobility as there was little personal property at that time and a right to a seat in parliament was entirely territorial or depended upon the tenure of landed property ever since the conquest it is true that all land is held either immediately or mediately of the king that is either of the king himself or of a tenant of the king or it might be after two or more subinfeudations and it was also a general principle in the feudal system that every tenant of land or landowner had both a right and obligation to attend the court of his immediate superior hence every tenant in capite—ie the tenant of the king—was at the same time entitled and bound to attend the kings court or parliament being the great court baron of the nation it will not be necessary here to enlarge further upon the original principles of the feudal system and upon the origin of peerage but we will briefly abridge the account which selden has given in the second part of his titles of honour c   beginning at the   th section being perhaps the clearest and most satisfactory that can be found he divides the time from the conquest into three periods   from the conquest to the latter end of the reign of king john   from that time to the   th of richard ii   from that period to the time he is writing which may now be extended to the present time in the first period all who held any quantity of land of the king had without distinction a right to be summoned to parliament and this right being confined solely to the kings tenants of consequence all the peers of parliament during that period sat by virtue of tenure and a writ of summons in the beginning of the second period that is in the last year of the reign of king john a distinction very important in its consequences for it eventually produced the lower house of parliament was introduced viz a division of these tenants into greater and lesser barons for king john in his magna charta declares faciemus summoneri archiepiscopos episcopos abbates comites et majores barones regni sigillatim per literas nostras et præterea faciemus summoneri in generali per vicecomites et ballivos nostros omnes alios qui in capite tenent de nobis ad certum diem c see bl mag ch joh p    it does not appear that it ever was ascertained what constituted a greater baron and it probably was left to the kings discretion to determine and no great inconvenience could have resulted from its remaining indefinite for those who had not the honour of the kings letter would have what in effect was equivalent a general summons from the sheriff but in this second period tenure began to be disregarded and persons were summoned to the parliament by writ who held no lands of the king this continued to be the case till the   th of ric ii when the practice of creating peers by letterspatent first commenced in that year john de beauchamp steward of the household to ric ii was created by patent lord beauchamp baron of kidderminster in tail male and since that time peerages have been created both by writ and patent without any regard to tenure or estate the kings prerogative of creating peers by patent may seem a great innovation or a violation of the original principles of the system yet it is one of those great changes which are produced at the first by a gentle deviation from the former practice for though this prerogative was not granted to the king by the express authority of parliament yet it was obtained by its acquiescence for i have been assured by mr townshend the windsor herald a gentleman well acquainted with this subject that patents of nobility in ancient times generally stated either that the patent was granted by the assent of parliament or if granted in the vacation they stated such special reasons why the peer was created as it might be presumed would afterwards meet with the approbation of the parliament see further comyns dig dignity c  —christian   lords of manors who had granted to others by subinfeudation part of that estate

necessarily create unequal rights but it is said that all men are equal because they have an equal right to justice or to the possession of their rights this is an insignificant selfevident truth which no one ever denied and it amounts to nothing more than to the identical proposition that all men have equal rights to their rights for when different men have perfect and absolute rights to unequal things they are certainly equal with regard to the perfection of their rights or the justice that is due to their respective claims this is the only sense in which equality can be applied to mankind in the most perfect republic that can be conceived in theory the proposition is false and mischievous the father and child the master and servant the judge and prisoner the general and common soldier the representative and constituent must be eternally unequal and have unequal rights and where every office is elective the most virtuous and the best qualified to discharge the duties of any

the government of soldiers their support and punishment when guilty of offences have been frequently the subject of amelioration still the praise bestowed upon them by mr tytler has more of the spirit of a partisan than of an impartial critic he says the principles of military law are as certain determinate and immutable as are the principles of the common and statute law which regulate the civil classes of society the mutiny act and the articles of war which contain the rules of discipline are framed by the legislature and enforced by penalties appropriated to every offence or the penalties are left in certain cases where the offence is either mitigated or aggravated beyond its ordinary standard by attendant circumstances to the decision of a courtmartial—chitty there is a great distinction though often lost sight of between military and martial law the former affecting the troops or forces only to which its terms expressly apply equally in peace and war by previously defined regulations the latter extending to all the inhabitants of the district where it is in force being wholly arbitrary and emanating entirely from a state of intestine commotion or actual war—warren by the fifth amendment of the constitution of the united states it is declared that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a

service of a subaltern who shall have succeeded in establishing charges of moment against his superior officer which dismission in general takes place thus a colonel beaufoy was after a trial by a general court martial or after a court of inquiry held upon him upon charges preferred against him by a subaltern officer dismissed the subaltern was in no wise an accessory to the offences comprised in the charges preferred against colonel beaufoy and was otherwise a meritorious officer yet at the moment of the promulgation of the sentence of dismissal against his colonel it was intimated to the subaltern that his majesty had no further occasion for his services this it was said at the time was as it should be looking at the good of the service—chitty e   inst       this regret of the learned commentator is somewhat gratuitous in its object and mistaken in its source the servitude to which the soldier is reduced in this country has most if not all of the alleviations which are compatible with good discipline and due subordination and although the binding obligations of the military law are renewed every year yet the regulations are neither so complex or numerous as to render an observance of them difficult while the annual revision of the legislature is a guarantee against their being capricious or unjust in one respect it would seem that the soldier has the advantage of the

is alluded to in the text it may be sufficient to quote from the opinion of c j marshall upon the subject of the slavetrade as presenting alike sound and moderate views  0 wheat   0—that it is contrary to the law of nature will scarcely be denied that every man has a natural right to the fruits of his own labour is generally admitted and that no other person can rightfully deprive him of those fruits and appropriate them against his will seems to be the necessary result of this admission but from the earliest times war has existed and war confers rights in which all have acquiesced among the most enlightened nations of antiquity one of these was that the victor might enslave the vanquished this which was the usage of all could not be pronounced repugnant to the law of nations which is certainly to be tried by the test of general usage that which has received the assent of all must be the law of all slavery then has its origin in force but as the world has agreed that it is a legitimate result of force the state of things which is thus produced by general consent cannot be pronounced unlawful as to the abstract morality of property in the service of a man no matter how originally acquired wherever it is sanctioned by law it is perhaps sufficient to observe that power or property in itself has no moral quality is neither right nor wrong it is the use or abuse of it which alone attaches responsibility in a moral point of view to the possessor the expediency of the law permitting one or another species of power or property is another and entirely different question depending upon other and different principles no other view consists with the moral and political code of the old testament or with the practical teachings of the new testament on this subject the laws of the southern states remarks chancellor kent are doubtless as just and mild as is deemed by those governments to be compatible with the public safety or with the existence and preservation of that species of property and yet in contemplation of their laws slaves are considered in some respects though not in criminal prosecutions as things or property rather than persons and are vendible as personal property they cannot take property by descent or purchase and all they hold belongs to the master they cannot make lawful contracts and they are deprived of civil rights they are assets in the hands of executors for the payment of debts and cannot be emancipated by will or otherwise to the prejudice of creditors their condition is more analogous to that of the slaves of the ancients than to that of the villeins of feudal times both in respect to the degradation of the slaves and the full dominion and power of the master the statute regulations follow the principles of the civil law in relation to slaves and are extremely severe but the master has no power over life or limb slaves are still regarded as human beings under moral responsibility as to crimes and the

authorized to act for his master only in some particular instance his power is limited and circumscribed a general servant or agent is one who is expressly or impliedly authorized by his master to

he is sought to be rendered liable thus if a master engage a servant to take care of the goods and the servant sell them the selling of the goods being totally unconnected with the object for which the servant had them the sale would not bind the master so where the chaise of the master had been broken by the negligence of his servant and the servant desired the coachmaker who had never been

all the decisions thus first during cohabitation it may be presumed that the husband authorizes his wife to contract for all necessaries suitable to his degree and no misconduct of hers during cohabitation not even adultery which he must therefore be supposed to be ignorant of or to have forgiven can have any tendency to destroy that presumption of authority but if that presumption be removed either by the unreasonable expensiveness of the goods furnished or by direct warning the liability falls to the ground secondly cohabitation may cease either by consent the fault of the husband or of the wife in the first case if there be an agreement for a separate allowance to the wife and that allowance be paid it operates as notice that she is to be dealt with on her own credit and the husband is discharged if there be no allowance agreed on or none paid then it must be presumed that she has still his authority to contract for her necessaries and he remains liable in the second case in which it is improbable that any allowance should be made the husband is said to send his wife into the world with general credit for her reasonable expenses this is upon the general principle that no one shall avail himself of his own wrong by the common law the husband is bound to maintain his wife and when he turns her from his house he does not thereby discharge himself of that liability which still remaining is a ground for presuming an authority from him to her to contract for reasonable necessaries against this presumption no general notice not to deal with her shall be allowed to prevail but where there is an express notice to any particular individual that person cannot sue upon contracts afterwards entered into with her in the last case there is no ground for the presumption of authority the law does not oblige a husband to maintain an adulteress who has eloped from him and whose situation has thus become public and therefore it will not be inferred that

i am not so much in love with my subject as to be inclined to leave it in possession of a glory which it may not justly deserve in addition to what has been observed in this chapter by the learned commentator i shall here state some of the principal differences in the english law respecting the two sexes and i shall leave it to the reader to determine on which side is the balance and how far this compliment is supported by truth husband and wife in the language of the law are styled baron and feme the word baron or lord attributes to the husband not a very courteous superiority but we might be inclined to think this merely an unmeaning technical phrase if we did not recollect that if the baron kills his feme it is the same as if he had killed a stranger or any other person but if the feme kills her baron it is regarded by the laws as a much more atrocious crime as she not only breaks through the restraints of humanity and conjugal affection but throws off all subjection to the authority of her husband and therefore the law denominates her crime a species of treason and condemns her to the same punishment as if she had killed the king and for every species of treason though in petit treason the punishment of men was only to be drawn and hanged till the  0 geo iii c    the sentence of women was to be drawn and burnt alive   book  0  by the common law all women were denied the benefit of clergy and till the      w and m c   they received sentence of death and might have been executed for the first offence in simple larceny bigamy manslaughter c however learned they were merely because their sex precluded the possibility of their taking holy orders though a man who could read was for the same crime subject only to burning in the hand and a few months imprisonment   book     these are the principal distinctions in criminal matters now let us see how the account stands with regard to civil rights intestate personal property is equally divided between males and females but a son though younger than all his sisters is heir to the whole of real property a womans personal property by marriage becomes absolutely her husbands which at his death he may leave entirely away from her but if he dies without will she is entitled to onethird of his personal property if he has children if not to onehalf in the province of york to fourninths or threefourths by the marriage the husband is absolutely master of the profits of the wifes lands during the coverture and if he has had a living child and survives the wife he retains the whole of those lands if they are estates of inheritance during his life but the wife is entitled only to dower or onethird if she survives out of the husbands estates of inheritance but this she has whether she has had a child or not but a husband can be tenant by the curtesy of the trust estates of the wife though the wife cannot be endowed of the trust estates of the husband   p wms     with regard to the property of women there is taxation without representation for they pay taxes without having the liberty of voting for representatives and indeed there seems at present no substantial reason why single women should be denied this privilege though the chastity of women is protected from violence yet a parent can have no reparation by our law from the seducer of his daughters virtue but by stating that she is his servant and that by the consequences of the seduction he is deprived of the benefit of her labour or where the seducer at the same time is a trespasser upon the close or premises of the parent but when by such forced circumstances the law can take cognizance of the offence juries disregard the pretended injury and give damages commensurate to the wounded feelings of a parent female virtue by the temporal law is perfectly exposed to the slanders of malignity and falsehood for any one may proclaim in conversation that the purest maid or the chastest matron is the most meretricious and incontinent of women with impunity or free from the animadversions of the temporal courts thus female honour which is dearer to the sex than their lives is left by the common law to be the sport of an

an express contract or one implied from particular facts a father cannot be sued for the price of necessaries provided for his infant son yet very slight circumstances will suffice to justify a jury in finding a contract on his part in a late case where a parent was sought to be charged for regimentals furnished to his son the lord chief justice left it as a question for the jury to consider whether they could infer that the order was given by the assent and with the authority of the father he said that a father would not be bound by the contract of his son unless either an actual authority were proved or circumstances appeared from which such an authority might be implied were it otherwise a father who had an imprudent son might be prejudiced to an indefinite extent and it was therefore necessary that some proof should be given that the order of a son was made by the authority of his father the question therefore for the consideration of the jury was whether under the circumstances of the particular case there was sufficient to convince them that the defendant had invested his son with such authority he had placed his son at the military college at harlow and had paid his expenses while he remained there the son it appeared then obtained a commission in the army and having found his way to london at a considerable distance from his fathers residence had ordered regimentals and other articles suitable to his equipment for the east indies if it had appeared in evidence that the defendant had supplied his son with money for this purpose or that he had ordered these articles to be furnished elsewhere either of those circumstances the learned judge observed might have rebutted the presumption of any authority from the defendant to order them from the plaintiff nothing however of this nature had been proved and since the articles were necessary for the son and suitable to that station in which the defendant had placed him it was for the jury to say whether they were not satisfied that an authority had been given by the defendant the jury found in the affirmative   stark r     so where a man marries a widow who has children by her former husband who are received by the second husband into and held out by him to the world as forming part of his own family he will be liable to pay third persons for necessaries furnished for them per lord ellenborough   east    but where a parent allows his child a reasonable sum for his expenses he will not be liable even for necessaries ordered by such child   esp r     and where a tradesman has furnished a young man with clothes to an extravagant extent he cannot sue the father for any part of his demand   esp rep    nor is the infant liable for any part of the articles   bla r      and it should seem as in the cases of husband and wife or principal and agent if the credit be given solely to the child the parent will not in any case be liable but although in a particular case credit may have been given to a minor and not to his parent yet the latter may be responsible in a case of fraud thus where the goods were supplied to a minor on a fraudulent representation by his father that he

by natural infirmity or from the length of time elapsed since his death are grounds on which the illegitimacy of the child may be founded and therefore where it was proved that the husband had only access one fortnight before the birth of a child it was held to be illegitimate but the court said that in the case where the parents have married so recently before the birth of the child that it

and fonblanques treat of equity b    p   ch   s   the guardianship to which it is practically the most important to attend is that by testament of which a sufficiently accurate outline is drawn in the text i will mention only one or two circumstances that seem to have been omitted in the first place the statute empowers fathers only to make the appointment this was probably an unintentional omission but the consequence is that where a mother is the surviving parent the children upon her death will be left to find guardians according to the provisions of the common law in this case where none other can be found the jurisdiction of the chancellor arises on the part of the crown to protect the infant subject and he will delegate the care to some proper person as to the origin of this jurisdiction see vol   p     the effect of the appointment by testament is rather more extensive than the text implies because the statute annexes to the office the custody and management of the infants real and personal estate and empowers the guardian to bring all such actions relating thereto as a guardian in socage might on the other hand this appointment as stated in the text does not so far supersede the general duty and power of the chancellor as delegate of the crown to protect infants but that he may interfere in cases of gross misconduct or legal incapacity such as that of lunacy or bankruptcy to control or even to remove him—coleridge the jurisdiction of the court of chancery whatever may have been its origin is non firmly established and beyond the reach of controversy—it being a settled maxim that the sovereign is the universal guardian of all the infants in the kingdom this court therefore will appoint a suitable guardian for an infant where there is no other or no other who will or can act for if there are testamentary guardians the court has no jurisdiction to do so it will also in general abstain from interference unless the infant has property—not from any want of jurisdiction but from the want of means to exercise its authority with effect when however guardians are appointed and their nomination is entirely a matter of discretion they are treated as officers of the court and held responsible accordingly the court of chancery will not only remove guardians appointed by its own authority but it will also remove guardians at the common law and even testamentary or statute guardians whenever sufficient cause can be shown for so doing for guardianship is always looked upon by the courts of equity as a delegated trust for the benefit of the infant and in case therefore any guardian abuses his trust the court will check and punish him nay sometimes will proceed to the removal of him and appoint another in his stead the court will sometimes also require security to be given by the guardian and on the other hand will assist him in the performance of his duties as well in obtaining the custody of the person of the ward as otherwise the jurisdiction of the court of chancery extends to the care of the person of the infant so far as is necessary for his protection and education and to the care of his property for its management and preservation and proper application for his maintenance it is upon the former ground that the court interferes with the ordinary rights of parents as guardians by nature or by nurture for whenever a father is guilty of gross ill treatment of or cruelty to his children or is in constant habits of drunkenness and blasphemy or low and gross debauchery or professes atheistical or irreligious principles or his domestic associations are such as tend to the corruption and contamination of his children the court will interfere and deprive him of the custody of the infants appointing at the same time a suitable person to act as guardian and superintend their education and this interference may be obtained on the petition of the infant himself or of any of his friends or relatives nay a mere stranger may at any time set the machinery of the court in motion in most instances however its jurisdiction arises from a suit being actually pending relative to the person or property of the infant and in such cases although not under the care of any guardian appointed by the court the infant is treated as a ward and a ward in chancery is in all cases under the special protection of the court for no act can be done affecting the minors person property or estate unless under its express or implicit direction every act done without such direction being considered a contempt exposing the offender to be attached and imprisoned thus it is a contempt to conceal or withdraw the person of the infant from the proper custody or to disobey any order of the court relative to its maintenance or education or to marry the infant without the approbation of the court for the court in approving a person to be guardian usually gives him express direction how to exercise the powers which it has conferred prescribes the residence and settles a scheme for the education of the infant and regulates if necessary his choice of a profession or trade approves or prohibits the minors marriage and performs all the other duties of guardians by nature or for nurture with respect to the property of the ward the court not only superintends its management during the owners minority but directs a proper settlement on the marriage of its ward and this protection is not always removed upon the minors attaining twentyone but is for some purposes continued afterwards especially with regard to the marriage of female wards in these and other respects therefore guardians appointed by the court of chancery have extensive delegated powers—this species of guardianship being one far more capable of adaptation to the various requirements of modern society the intentions of testators the wants and wishes of the infants themselves and the different kinds of property which may call for administrative care than all or any of the other guardianships known to the law—kerr   this rule that the guardian is compellable to account only when the infant comes of age or until she marries is applicable only to testamentary or other guardians not in socage and exists only in a court of law for under the general protection afforded to infants by the court of chancery an infant may in that court by his prochein amy call his guardian to account even during his minority   vern       p wms       ves    guardians in scoage are by the common law accountable to the infant either when he comes to the age of fourteen or at any time after as he thinks fit co litt    the guardian in his account shall have allowance of all reasonable expenses if he is robbed of the rents and profits of the land without his default or negligence he shall be discharged thereof in his account for he is in the nature of a bailiff or servant to the infant and undertakes no otherwise than for his

of serious and welldisposed men can rely upon with confidence and satisfaction mr locke says that the labour of a mans body and the work of his hands we may say are properly his whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in he hath mixed his labour with and joined to it something that is his own and thereby makes it his property on govt c   but this

upon it that right still adheres to all that remains of the substance whatever changes it may have undergone if i had no right before it is clear that i have none after and we have not advanced a single step by this demonstration the account of grotius and puffendorf who maintain that the origin and inviolability of property are founded upon a tacit promise or compact and therefore we cannot invade anothers property without a violation of a promise or a breach of good faith seems equally or more superfluous and inconclusive there appears to be just the same necessity to call in the aid of a promise to account for or enforce every other moral obligation and to say that men are bound not to beat or murder each other because they have promised not to do so men are bound to fulfil their contracts and engagements because society could not otherwise exist men are bound to refrain from anothers property because likewise society could not otherwise exist nothing therefore is gained by resolving one obligation into the other but how or when then does property commence i conceive no better answer can be given than by occupancy or when any thing is separated for private use from the common stores of nature this is agreeable to the reason and sentiments of mankind prior to all civil establishments when an untutored indian has set before him the fruit which he has plucked from the tree that protects him from the heat of the sun and the shell of water raised from the fountain that springs at his feet—if he is driven by any daring intruder from this repast so easy to be replaced he instantly feels and resents the violation of that law of property which nature herself has written upon the hearts of all mankind—christian   all the writers on international law concur in the doctrine that actual occupancy is essential to perfect the title to land newly discovered and vacant puff l   c   vat l   c    grotius l   c   it is important to remark that so far at least as regards land the first discoverer and occupant acquires no title to himself but to the nation to which he belongs or under whose flag he sails all private property in land is derived from the sovereign of the country either directly or remotely among the aboriginal inhabitants of north america there was no private property in land but the territory or huntinggrounds belonged to the tribe who alone had the power to dispose of them in the confederacy of the six nations this power was vested in the general councilfire so that the separate tribes had no right to sell or transfer something like this is discoverable in the earliest accounts we have of the laws of the savage inhabitants of ancient europe property in land was first in the nation or tribe and the right of the individual occupant was merely usufructuary and temporary   kents com   0—sharswood i see book i p       upon whatever principle the right of property is founded the power of giving and transferring seems to follow as a natural consequence if the hunter and the fisherman exchange the produce of their toils no one ever disputed the validity of the contract or the continuance of the original title this does not seem to be aptly explained by occupancy for it cannot be said that in such a case there is ever a vacancy of possession—christian k it is principally to prevent any vacancy of possession that the civil law considers father and son as one person so that upon the death of either the inheritance does not so properly descend as continue in the hands of the survivor ff           i cannot agree with the learned commentator that the permanent right of property vested in the ancestor himself that is for his life is not a natural but merely a civil right i have endeavoured to show note   that the notion of property is universal and is suggested to the mind of man by reason and nature prior to all positive institutions and civilized refinements if the laws of the land were suspended we should be under the same moral and natural obligation to refrain from invading each others property as from attacking and assaulting each others persons i am obliged also to differ from the learned judge and all writers upon general law who maintain that children have no better claim by nature to succeed to the property of their deceased parents than strangers and that the preference given to them originates solely in political establishments i know no other criterion by which we can determine any rule or obligation to be founded in nature than its universality and by inquiring whether it is not and has not been in all countries and ages agreeable to the feelings affections and reason of mankind the affection of parents towards their children is the most powerful and universal principle which nature has planted in the human breast and it cannot be conceived even in the most savage state that any one is so destitute of that affection and of reason who would not revolt at the position that a stranger has as good a right as his children to the property of the deceased parent hæredes successoresque sui cuique liberi seems not to have been confined to the woods of germany but to be one of the first laws in the code of nature though positive institutions may have thought it prudent to leave the parent the full disposition of his property after his death or to regulate the shares of the

father could succeed as immediate heir to his son a contrary doctrine however is clearly established it has been held that the father may be immediate heir to his son as the secondcousin of the son when a father would be entitled to be heir as cousin to the son if he did not sustain the relation of father he is not excluded merely on the ground that he is the father suppose then two cousins to intermarry and that there is issue of that marriage a son who purchases lands and dies in inquiring for the heir to the son it is a decisive objection to the claim of the father that he is the father

land structure thereon fixtures thereto and rights issuing out of annexed to or exercisable within land there may be a personal estate in a thing real as a term of years a mortgage c real estate is such an interest not held as merely collateral to a debt or personal duty in a thing real as is of uncertain duration and which by possibility may last for life there cannot be a real estate in a thing personal sir richard pepper arden in buckeridge vs ingram   ves jr     has given a definition of real property which has been followed by the supreme court of pennsylvania in the case of measons estate   watts     wherever a perpetual inheritance is granted which arises out of land or is in any degree connected with it or as it is emphatically expressed by lord coke exercisable within it it is that sort of property which the law denominates real property this definition though true as far as it goes is yet not entirely accurate there is certainly no reason for confining it to the case of a perpetual inheritance surely an estate for life in land is real estate it is not every interest in it which is a chattel real is personal estate it will not do to substitute interests for an indefinite or uncertain duration for the words perpetual inheritance without more because the estates of tenants by statute merchant statute staple and elegit though of this character are chattels and not freeholds a mortgage though giving an interest in real estate even in feesimple and which may by proceedings at law or in equity be converted into an absolute indefeasible estate is nothing for all practical purposes but a chattel it is to be remarked however that these instances are all cases in which the estates are held as mere security for debts and follow the nature of the debts to which they are accessory when the owner of land has by his will or by a trust directed that it shall be sold for money courts of equity which always consider that as actually done which ought to be done will treat the land so directed to be sold as money and so vice versa money directed to be laid out in land will in equity be considered as land an interest in realty by being mingled in an undistinguished mass of property held in common with personalty may have the latter character impressed upon it thus shares of stock in a bank or other corporation are personal estate without reference to the nature of the subjects in which these shares give an interest this is the general doctrine of american law   kent   0 n in england shares in companies associated for the purpose of

be qualified or varied by the tenor or express terms of the feudal donation wright l of ten    fealty and homage are sometimes confounded but they do not necessarily imply the same thing fealty was a solemn oath made by the vassal of fidelity and attachment to his lord homage was merely an acknowledgment of tenure unless it was performed as homagium ligeum that indeed did in strictness include allegiance as a subject and could not be renounced but homagium non ligeum contained a saving or exception of faith due to other lords and the homager might at any time free himself from feudal dependence by renouncing the land with which he had been invested du fresne gloss voc hominium legius et fidelitas mr hargrave in note   to co litt    a says in some countries on the continent of

respects distinct fealty was sometimes done where homage was not due and lord coke himself tells us   inst     a fealty may remain where homage is extinct so wright l of ten    in note informs us that it appears not only from the concurrent testimony of all our most authentic antient historians whom he cites but likewise from britton bracton the mirror and fleta that homage and fealty were really with us distinct though generally concomitant engagements and that homage he of course means homagium non ligeum was merely a declaration of the homagers consent to become the military tenant of certain of the lords lands or tenements the short result appears to be that whilst the tie of homage subsisted fealty though acknowledged by a distinct oath was consequential thereto but that the converse did not hold as fealty might be due where homage was not the manner of doing homage and fealty is prescribed by the act of    edw ii st   which enactment abundantly proves the distinct nature of the two acknowledgments at that time—chitty h feud l   t    j wright     mr hallams account of the origin of the feudal system is different from that in the text his idea is that the first division of lands was allodial but that the sovereign gradually granting out his lands as beneficia with the mutual obligation of protection and defence the allodial proprietor soon found his condition an insecure one in the state of society which then existed and willingly came under the obligation of rendering feudal services in exchange for the powerful protection of the sovereign mr hallam mentions a custom says mr justice coleridge which as occasioned by the same state of society certainly adds some credit to this theory i mean the custom of commendation this was a kind of personal feudism the lord was bound to protect the person and his lands who so commended himself to him for which he received a stipulated sum of money called salvamentum the vassal performed homage but the connection had no reference to land was not always burdened with the condition of military service and seems to have been capable of dissolution at the pleasure of the vassal this judicious annotator gives his assent to mr hallams account and adds it is not surprising however that english lawyers should have adopted an opposite theory because in england the system as a whole was introduced at once by a powerful and politic sovereign who made it—what they assert it always was—a great political measure of military defence william received the fealty not only of his own vassals—those who held of him in chief—but of their vassals also and thenceforward the oath of fealty to a subject in england was accompanied with the reservation to be found in littletons precedent given in s    salve la foy que jeo

acted in every thing as absolute master over the natives whose interest and affections he totally disregarded and if there was an interval when he assumed the appearance of a legal sovereign the period was very short and was nothing but a temporary sacrifice which he as has been the case with most conquerors was obliged to make of his inclinations to present policy scarce any of those revolutions which both in history and in common language have always been denominated conquests appear equally violent or were attended with so sudden an alteration both of power and property the normans and other foreigners who followed the standard of william having totally subdued the natives pushed the right of conquest to the utmost extremity against them except the former conquest of england by the saxons themselves who were induced by peculiar circumstances to proceed even to the extermination of the natives it would be difficult to find in all history a revolution more destructive or attended with a more complete subjection of the inhabitants contumely seems to have been wantonly added to oppression and the natives were universally reduced to such a state of meanness and poverty that the english name became a term of reproach and several generations elapsed before one family of saxon pedigree was raised to any considerable honours if these facts do not

have answered for example the widow of the last tenant could not bring her writ of lower against him on the other hand he had not all the established rights of a guardian against the heir and therefore if he tendered her a marriage during the two years and she contracted a marriage elsewhere there lay no forfeiture of the value of the marriage against her it is necessary also to make

fourteen and the performance of the service by the husband were not the sole reasons for limiting his wardship to that age because by law she might marry at twelve and if she had so done and her

to the crown will appear from the two following instances collected among others by lord lyttleton hist hen ii   vol     john earl of lincoln gave henry the third  000 marks to have the marriage of richard de clare for the benefit of matilda his eldest daughter and simon de montford gave the same king  0000 marks to have the custody of the lands and heir of gilbert de unfranville with the heirs marriage—a sum equivalent to a hundred thousand pounds at present in this case the estate must have been large the minor young and the alliance honourable for as mr hargrave informs us who has well described this species of guardianship the guardian in chivalry was not accountable for the profits made of the infants lands during the wardship but received them for his own private emolument subject only to the bare maintenance of the infant and this guardianship being deemed more an interest for the profit of the guardian than a trust for the benefit of the ward was salable and transferable like the ordinary subjects of property to the best bidder and if not disposed of was transmissible to the lords personal representatives thus the custody of the infants person as well as the care of his estate might devolve upon the most perfect stranger to the infant—one prompted by every pecuniary motive to abuse the delicate and important trust of education without any ties of blood or regard to counteract the temptations of interest or any sufficient authority to restrain him from yielding to their influence co litt    n    one cannot read this without astonishment that such should continue to be the condition of the country till the year    0 which from the extermination of these feudal oppressions ought to be regarded as a memorable era in the history of our law and liberty—christian g cap     0 our author has the high authority of lord coke in support of his opinion that the right of the tenants of common persons to aliene their lands without a license was recognised by magna carta   inst    a   inst     0  this recognition however is not distinctly expressed in the charter and the construction of lord coke and of blackstone has been repudiated as a forced one in itself and as being inconsistent with any reasonable interpretation of the statute of quia emptores dalrymples hist of feud prop  0 bacons l of eng     wrights law of ten     sullivans lect    —chitty h    edw i c   i   inst    k ibid       this is not quite correctly stated the chapter of magna carta was made in restraint of a practice which tenants had got into of aliening a part or whole of their fees to hold of themselves and it enacts that for the future no man shall aliene more of his land than that of the residue of the services due to the lord for the whole fee may be sufficiently answered the construction of this was see sir m wright p     that the part allowed to be aliened was to be holden of the alienor and not of the lord indeed upon feudal principles the services of the feoffee naturally resulted to his feoffor the tenure was of him and there were good feudal reasons for not violating those principles so long as the part aliened was held of the alienor no new tenant was obtruded on the lord and as the lords seignory was originally reserved over the whole land he might still distrein over the whole or in any part though aliened for the whole undivided services while the feudal system was more strictly regarded with reference to its proper objects these advantages counterbalanced the disadvantages in respect of pecuniary fruits which flowed from the practice of subinfeudation but which in their turn as the system grew more lax prevailed and gave occasion to the statute of quia emptores the policy of this statute was contrary to that of the chapter of magna carta above cited it was found see post p    that the process of alienation with the tenure reserved to the alienor very sensibly diminished the value of the lords escheat marriage and wardship because they operated beneficially to him only on the portion of land reserved and not on that granted out while the alienor derived all these fruits as they arose from the portion so granted out it was then thought by the lords better to submit to the inconvenience of new tenants being obtruded on them without their consent which was grown to be imaginary only than for the sake of retaining a nominal tenant to lose the substantial fruits of the tenure it was now too late to restrain alienation entirely and therefore the only course which remained was that adopted—to permit it in whole or in part with a reservation only of the tenure to the next immediate lord   inst  0  by the same services and customs by which it had been before held by the alienor with respect to the question of forfeiture it is curious that lord coke should be cited apparently in support of the opinion that alienation by the tenants in capite without license involved a forfeiture for at   inst    stating both opinions he declares his own to be in the negative and as sir m wright thinks p     erroneously this gives me occasion to say that it is of the utmost importance in discussing any point relating to the feudal system to determine the time which is spoken of thus according to feudal principles and while those principles were strictly maintained alienation without license must have involved forfeiture for the tenant of course could not have compelled the lord to receive the homage and fealty of a new tenant and by his own act he had renounced his own holding but it is obvious that there was always a struggle in the advancing spirit of the age to loosen the bonds of feudal tenure and it may not be possible to fix the period at which the practice of alienation became too strong for the law and being first winked at was finally legalized under the statute   eliz c    the fines in both cases were to be paid by the alienee—coleridge    by the statute of    geo iii c     it is enacted that no attainder for felony after the passing of the act except in cases of high treason petit treason or murder shall extend to the disinheriting of any heir or to the prejudice of the right or title of any other person than the offender during his natural life only and that it shall be lawful to the person to whom the right or interest of or in any lands tenements or hereditaments after the death of such offender would have appertained if no such attainder had been to enter into the same—chitty l co litt    m feud l   t    n   inst        mr hargrave note   to co

instances in which it was not to be done to the king in person this may explain why he who held by grand serjeanty paid no escuage the devout attachment to the lords person which was so much fostered by the feudal system is in none of its minor consequences more conspicuous than in the nature of the personal services which the haughtiest barons were proud to render to their lord paramount to be

appears to be that they still exist the principles of the feudal system in truth underlie all the doctrines of the common law in regard to real estate and wherever that law is recognised recourse must be had to feudal principles to understand and carry out the common law the necessity of words of limitation in deeds—the distinction between words of limitation and words of purchase—the principle that the freehold shall never be in abeyance that a remainder must vest during the continuance of a particular estate or eo instanti that it determines that the heir cannot take as a purchaser an estate the freehold of which by the same deed is vested in the ancestor—and many more rules and principles of very great practical importance and meeting us at every turn in the american as well as

military tenure were not left as suggested by the learned judge in the preceding page to the arbitrary calls of the lord for though it was uncertain when the king would go to war yet the tenant was certain that he could only be compelled to serve forty days in the year the service therefore was as certain in its extent as that of socage and the sokeman likewise could not know beforehand when he would be called upon to plough the land or to perform other servile offices for the lord the milites are everywhere distinguished from the sokemanni and the wisdom of the feudal polity appears in no view more strongly than in this—viz that whilst it secured a powerful army of warriors it was not improvident of the culture of the lands and the domestic concerns of the country but honour was the invigorating principle of that system and it cannot be imagined that those who never grasped a sword nor buckled on a coat of mail should enjoy privileges and distinctions denied to the barons and milites the companions of their sovereign the sokemanni were indebted only to their own meanness and insignificance for their peculiar immunities the king or lord had the profits of the military tenants estate during his nonage in order to retain a substitute with accoutrements and in a state suitable to the condition of his tenant at the same time he took care that the minor was instructed in the martial accomplishments of the age but they disdained to superintend the education of the sokemanni and as they had nothing to apprehend from their opposition and could expect no accession of strength from their connections their marriages therefore were an object of indifference to them hence when the age of chivalry was gone and nothing but its slavery remained by no uncommon vicissitude

tenure exactly the same with our copyhold estates and likewise a complete state of villenage but the last editor of doug rep observes this is by no means a conclusive argument all villenage may not have been done away with throughout a country but a partial mitigation of that state may have taken place and in those instances the privileged villeins may hold by tenure resembling our copyhold whilst at the same time others less favoured may remain in a state of pure villenage it is highly improbable that in our own country all villeins were at once elevated into the rank of copyholders indeed we have every reason to be assured that the contrary was the fact lord loughboroughs doubts therefore cannot shake our authors statement in the text above which is supported by all our best lawwriters on the subject and is confirmed by the evidence of history which furnishes distinct examples of the change of villein tenure into copyhold—chitty g commonwealth b   c  0    the last claim

expressed the court it was said must abide by the words of the act which confine its operation to cases of descent or surrender to the use of a will and do not apply to a title under a deed therefore to a bill by a lord praying a discovery in aid of an action under the statute for recovery of fines alleged to be due a demurrer was allowed lord kensington vs mansell    ves   0 however as the

of the will as the same would have been if a surrender to the use of the will had been made the statute of geo i is in this respect enlarged and it is evident the lastnamed statute materially qualifies the statement in the text that the lord is the legal guardian this authority of the lord must be by virtue of a special custom in a manor for by the    car ii c    s   and   a father may appoint a guardian by his will as to the copyholds of his child and though this custom is not abolished in terms nor can be said to be taken away by implication in this statute yet where the custom does not exist in a manor the better opinion is that the statute will operate and even where the custom prevails mr watkins thinks the father may by this statute appoint a guardian of the person of his child if not of his copyhold property see   watk on copyh  0   0 —chitty    there is some obscurity as to this point but i imagine the account given of it in the text cannot be the correct one as the tenure clearly savoured more of socage than chivalry the lord without a special custom warranting it cannot well be supposed to be the guardian but the nearest relation to whom the inheritance cannot descend and accordingly in   rolles abr tit garde p pl   it is laid down by the court that if a copyhold descend to an infant within the age of fourteen his prochein amy to whom the land cannot descend shall have the custody of it as he would of a freehold unless there be a custom appointing it to another if there be such a custom that will still operate and is not affected by the statute of car ii see ante p    but the present question is who shall now be guardian where there is no custom whether though the statute will not operate to defeat a custom it shall take place in the absence of any custom mr watkins is of opinion that it will and even where there is a custom he thinks that the father by will under the statute may appoint a guardian of the body of his child it is desirable that the law should be as he states it but i am not aware that any decision to that effect has taken place see   watk on copyholds  0 —coleridge    as in the case where the lord is not bound to renew

estates known by the denomination of tenantright are peculiar to the northern parts of england in which borderservices against scotland were anciently performed before the union of england and scotland under the same sovereign and although these appear to have many qualities and incidents which do not properly belong to villenage tenure either pure or privileged and out of one or other of these species of villenage all copyhold is derived and also have some which savour more of military service by escuage uncertain—which according to litt s    is knights service and although they seem to want some of the characteristic qualities and circumstances which are considered as distinguishing this species of tenure viz the being holden at the will of the lord and also the usual evidence of title by copy of courtroll and are alienable also contrary to the usual mode by which copyholds are aliened viz by deed and admittance thereon if indeed they could be immemorially aliened at all by the particular species of deed stated in the case viz a bargain and sale and which at common law would only have transferred the user i say notwithstanding all these anomalous circumstances it seems to be now so far settled in courts of law that these customary tenantright estates are not freehold but that they in effect fall within the same consideration as copyholds that the quality of their

limited in contingency by way of use or by devise the inheritance in the mean time if not otherwise disposed of remains in the grantor and his heirs or in the heirs of the testator until the contingency happens to take it out of them fearne cont rem      th edit but although as mr fearne observes different opinions have prevailed in respect to the admission of this doctrine in conveyances at common law id     yet he adduces arguments and authorities which render the doctrine as unquestionable in this case as in the two former of uses and devises if therefore in the instance put by the learned judge john should determine his estate either by his death or by a feoffment in fee which amounts to a forfeiture in the lifetime of richard under which circumstances the remainder never could

success the doctrine of abeyance the editor may venture to observe with respect to the two last instances though they are collected from the text of littleton that there hardly seems any necessity to resort to abeyance or to the clouds to explain the residence of the inheritance or of the freehold in the first case the whole feesimple is conveyed to a sole corporation the parson and his successors but if any interest is not conveyed it still remains as in the former note in the grantor and his heirs to whom upon the dissolution of the corporation the estate will revert see   book     and in the second case the freehold seems in fact from the moment of the death of the parson to rest and abide in the successor who is brought into view and notice by the institution and induction for after induction he can recover all the rights of the church which accrued from the death of the predecessor—christian the case put of the glebe during the vacancy of the church is not perhaps easy of solution that which mr christian proposed in a note on this passage is not entirely satisfactory he would place the freehold in the future successor who is to be brought into view and notice by institution and induction but if it is in him it is not there usefully for either of the purposes for which alone the law requires it to be in any one the services are not performed and there is no one to answer the præcipe of a stranger the same objection indeed applies if we place it in the heir of the founder or the ordinary perhaps it may be thought not unreasonable to admit this to be an exception to the general rule an estate altogether is the creature of legal reasoning to be moulded raised or extinguished accordingly and it may be fairly argued that as the freehold can exist in no one to any useful legal purpose during the vacancy of the church it may not exist at all this is a conjecture hazarded with great diffidence but which may be allowed in a question of more curiosity

possessed and enjoyed by them alike was held in loveacres vs blight cowp     to carry the fee for the testator had charged the estate with the payment of an annuity which negatived the idea that by the word freely he only meant to give the estate free of encumbrances the free enjoyment therefore it was held must mean free from all limitations but if the testator had not put any charge on the estate this would not have been the necessary construction nor would so extended a meaning have been given to those words against the heir in any case where it was not certain that the testator meant more than that his devisee should possess and enjoy the estate free from all charges or free from impeachment of waste goodright vs barron    east     thus if a man devises all his freehold estate to

freehold indispensable to its validity in order therefore to continue to the parent or other prior taker a control of the same general description the act provides that when under the same settlement

manner prescribed in the act is allowed to be effectual even without the consent of the protector so far as regards the barring of himself and his issue even subsequently to the passing of this act

he could not bring about a vacancy at any time that he pleased the position which follows respecting the husband of an idiot has been questioned lord cokes argument as well as that in plowden is that the titles of the tenant by curtesy and of the king begin at one instant the office which finds her an idiot having relation back to her first seisin and then that the title of the king shall be

same assumption and the king took the custody of the lands as of lands of which the idiot had been seised f n b     but the same conclusion may be rested upon the principle that there can have been no valid marriage with an idiot—a principle which it is the more remarkable that the author should have overlooked here as only three pages later he makes use of it to exclude the wife of an idiot from dower in vol   p  0  an idiot is defined to be one who hath had no understanding from his nativity if that definition be correct there can be no question but that such a person could never contract a valid marriage but i imagine that a person born sane might from external injury or internal disease gradually aggravated be reduced to idiotcy as opposed to lunacy or madness if such a case would come within the legal notion of idiocy still a marriage contracted while the person was sane and seisin then had with issue ought on principle to entitle the husband to curtesy because in such a case no one of the principles of exclusion would apply the husbands title would be prior to the kings there would have been sufficient seisin and the marriage would not have been invalid—coleridge in

by mere act of law and under the latter to consider first descent and then escheat and such other titles not being by descent as yet like titles by descent accrue by mere act of law so we learn from lord coke   inst   b that if an alien purchases lands he cannot hold them the king is entitled to them though in such case the king plainly takes neither by purchase according to mr hargraves explanation nor by descent again   inst   b lord coke says a purchase is when one cometh to lands by conveyance or title and disseisins abatements intrusions usurpations and such like estates gained by wrong are not purchases and it is equally clear they are not acquisitions by descent and in   inst    b lord coke gives other instances of titles which in strictness if we admit mr hargraves

millions this calculation is right in numbers but is founded on a false supposition as is evident from the results one of which is to give a man a greater number of ancestors all living at one time than the whole population of the earth another would be that each man now living instead of being descended from noah and his wife alone might claim to have had at that time an almost indefinite number of relatives intermarriages among relatives are one check on this incredible increase of relatives this is noticed afterwards by blackstone as to collateral relatives k this will swell more considerably than the former calculation for here though the first term is but i the denominator is   that is there is one kinsman a brother in the first degree who makes together with the propositus the two descendants from the first couple of ancestors and in every other degree the number of kindred must be the quadruple of those in the degree which immediately precedes it for since each couple of ancestors has two descendants who increase in a duplicate ratio it will follow that the ratio in which all the descendants increase downwards must be double to that in which the ancestors increase upwards but we have seen that the ancestors increase upwards in a duplicate ratio therefore the descendants must increase downwards in a double duplicate that is in a quadruple ratio  collateral

       0        0     this calculation may also be formed by a more compendious process—viz by squaring the couples or half the number of ancestors at any given degree which will furnish us with the number of kindred we have in the same degree at equal distance with ourselves from the common stock besides those at unequal distances thus in the tenth lineal degree the number of ancestors is  0   its half or the couples amount to     the number of kindred in the tenth collateral degree amounts therefore to        or the square of     and if we will be at the trouble to recollect the state of the several families within our own knowledge and observe how far they agree with this account—that is whether on an average every man has not one brother or sister four first cousins sixteen second cousins and so on—we shall find that the present calculation is very far from being overcharged   the learned judges reasoning is just and correct and that the collateral relations are quadrupled in each generation may be thus demonstrated as we are supposed upon an average to have one brother or sister the two children by the fathers brother or sister will make two cousins and the mothers brother or sister will produce two more—in all four for the same reason my father and mother must each have had four cousins and their children are my second cousins so i have eight second cousins by my father and eight by my mother—together sixteen and thus again i shall have thirtytwo third cousins on my fathers side and thirtytwo on my mothers—in all sixtyfour hence it follows that each preceding number in the series must be multiplied by twice two or four this immense increase of the numbers depends upon the supposition that no one marries a relation but to avoid such a connection it will very soon be necessary to leave the kingdom how these two tables of consanguinity may be reduced by the intermarriage of relations will appear from the following simple case if two men and two women were put upon an uninhabited island and became two married couple if they had only two children each a male and female who respectively intermarried and in like manner produced two children who are thus continued ad infinitum it is clear that there would never be more than four persons in each generation and if the parents lived to see their greatgrandchildren the whole number would never be more than sixteen and thus the families might be perpetuated without any incestuous connection—christian l decretal        and   m co litt    n see the table of consanguinity annexed wherein all the degrees of collateral kindred to the propositus are computed so far as the tenth of the civilians and the seventh of the canonists inclusive—the former being distinguished by the numeral letters the latter by the common cyphers   the difference of the computation by the civil and canon laws may be expressed shortly thus the civilians take the sum of the degrees in both lines to the common ancestor the canonists take only the number of degrees in the longest line hence when the canon law prohibits all marriages between persons related to each other within the seventh degree this would restrain all marriages within the fourteenth degree of the civil law in the  st book     n it is observed that all marriages are prohibited between persons who are related to each other within the third degree according to the computation of the civil law this affords a solution to the vulgar paradox that first cousins may marry and second cousins cannot for first cousins and all cousins may marry by the civil law and neither first nor second cousins can marry by the canon law but all the prohibitions of the canon law might have been dispensed with it is said that the canonlaw computation has been adopted by the law of england yet i do not know a single instance in which we have occasion to refer to it but the civillaw computation is of great importance in ascertaining who are entitled

c   h hale h c l         i bracton l   c  0 reversesection      the following historical observations and legal deductions relating to the doctrine of representations are extracted from dalrymple on feuds— the right of representation was more slowly introduced into the collateral than into the descending line in the original law of nature representation must be unknown those who are nearest in blood to a man will be conceived to be nearest connected with him afterwards it is observed to be a hardship that children bred up in a suitable rank to that of their father and with a prospect of succeeding to his rights should be cut off at once from that rank and that prospect it comes to be observed as a further hardship that a woman who has married one seemingly her equal should by his untimely death lose not only her husband but see her children reduced to beggary these considerations introduced the right of representation in the descending line but the same considerations did not occur in the collateral line the children of a brother or cousin have not the prospect of succeeding to their uncles or cousins estates because it is always to be supposed every man is to have children of his own it is therefore no hardship upon them to be removed by another uncle or another cousin from a succession which they could have no reasonable expectation of enjoying the steps by which the right of representation in private successions came into the collateral line in great britain or even in any other country in europe are extremely difficult to be traced and perhaps are not very certain when they are traced therefore we must supply them by the progress of the same representation in public successions in these last successions it is plain that representation was originally unknown from the histories of modern europe it appears that when succession was permitted amongst collaterals the nearest of blood took to the exclusion of representation in the time of edward i though representation in the descending line was tolerably well established throughout europe yet the point was so doubtful in the collateral line that upon the death of margaret of norway and the dispute for her succession between her cousins bruce and baliol not only the eighty scotch commissioners named by the candidates and the twentyfour english named by king edward were long doubtful but all europe was doubtful which side ought to prevail the precise question in the end put by the king to the commissioners was whether the more remote by one degree in succession coming from the elder sister ought to exclude the nearer by a degree coming from the second sister and on the answer importing that representation should take place judgment was given for baliol the scotch writers of those days were positive this judgment was wrong the english writers of the same period were as positive that it was right these different opinions may be accounted for in england at that time representation in collateral succession was beginning to take place and this advance of their own nation the english made the measure of their opinion the scotch on the other hand at the same period had not arrived at the same length this species of representation was unknown to them and therefore they disapproved of the judgment solemn as this decision was yet even in england a century afterwards the right of representation in this line was so far from being complete that it was the same doubt that gave rise to the disputes between the houses of york and lancaster and involved the kingdom in civil war on the abdication of richard the second the two persons claiming the right to the crown were his two cousins the duke of lancaster son of john of gaunt who was fourth son to edward the third and the earl of march grandson to lionel duke of clarence who was third son of the same prince and the discussions related to the rights of these persons and whether representation in collateral successions ought to prevail even in later times and when the law was better understood it was on the same ground that upon the death of henry the third of france the league set up the cardinal of bourbon as heir to the crown in opposition to his nephew the king of navarre this last prince was son of the elder branch to the cardinal but the cardinal being one step nearer to the common stock it was asserted that nearness of blood and not representation took place in collateral succession for many ages it has now been fixed in private successions that representation in the collateral line shall take place and although of late in europe there has scarce been any such dispute in public successions as to give room for either example to prevail yet the example of those private successions and the now riveted notions of mankind in favour of representation will probably prevent it from being ever made again the subject of dispute see dalrymple on feuds ch   s   p

should here be noticed that though it is necessary that a person who would succeed must show himself to be of the blood of the first purchasor yet where the persons who inherit succeed or derive title to the inheritance by virtue of remote and intermediate descents from the purchasor it will be sufficient if they are related by halfblood only to the purchasor or to such other remote and intermediate ancestors who were formerly and intermediately seised of the inheritance in the regular course of descent from the purchasor provided according to the rule which follows they are the worthiest legal relatives of the whole blood to the person last seised rob inh    for example see post p    —chitty k co litt       to be of the blood of geoffrey is either to be immediately descended from him or to be descended from the same couple of common ancestors two persons are consanguinei or are of the blood that is whole blood of each other who are descended from the same two ancestors the heir and ancestor must not only have two common ancestors with the original purchaser of the estate but must have two common ancestors with each other and therefore if the son purchases lands and dies without issue and it descends to any heir on the part of the father if the line of the father should afterwards become extinct it cannot pass to the line of the mother hales hist c l        e iii    and for the same reason if it should descend to the line of any female it can never afterwards upon failure of that line be transmitted to the line of any other female for according to the next

alston vs wells doug     and in the late case of langley vs sneyd   simons  stu rep    where an infant died seised of an equitable estate descending ex parte maternâ the legal estate being vested in trustees his incapacity to call for a conveyance of the legal estate by which the course of descent might have been broken was held to be a sufficient reason to induce a court of equity to consider the case as if such a conveyance had actually been made it not being according to the terms of the trust any part of the express duty of the trustees to execute such conveyance—chitty    hence the expression heir at law must always be used with a reference to a specific estate for if an only child has taken by descent an estate from his father and another from his mother upon his death without issue these estates will descend to two different persons so also if his two grandfathers and two grandmothers had each an estate which descended to his father and mother whom i suppose also to be only children then as before these four estates will descend to four different heirs—christian o domat part   pr p m    edw iv    q abr t descent   r ibid    s h c l        with reference to this and

through whom the estate descended when lord hale speaks of the nearest collateral relation of the whole blood of the person last seised and of the blood of the first purchasor he means the latter branch of the expression as a qualification and not an addition to the first branch that the collateral heir of the whole blood must claim through the ancestor from whom the estate descended and thus be of the blood of the first purchasor per leach vicechancellor hawkins vs shewen   sim  stu rep     which case and the pedigree annexed to the same deserve attention on account of the qualification required for the heir to be of the blood of the first purchasor or acquirer of the estate it may not unfrequently happen that the person upon whom the inheritance devolves in a regular and legal course of descent or succession is not as independently of and laying aside this qualification heir or next of kin to the person last seised of it either in the paternal or maternal line it appears that littleton and his commentator lord coke ten s   fo    b have laid down a different doctrine touching the necessity of the person who inherits being always heir or the worthiest and nearest relative to the person last seised but it is conceived that the rules must be taken together in a connected view and as such the rule will stand thus—that the person or persons who inherit and upon whom the law casts the inheritance upon the death of the person seised must always be the worthiest and nearest of such of the relatives of the whole blood of the person last seised as are of the blood and consanguinity of the purchasor and such as are not incapacitated by the first rule of descent rob inh      —chitty    this is only true in the paternal line for when the paternal and maternal lines are both admitted to the inheritance the most remote collateral kinsman ex parte paternô will inherit before the nearest ex parte maternâ see p     post—christian    it is suggested by mr christian in his edition of blackstone that the true and only way of ascertaining an heir at law in any line or branch is by the representation of brothers or sisters in each generation and that the introduction of the computation of kindred either by the canon or civil law into a treatise upon descents may perplex and can never assist for if we refer this sixth rule either to the civil or canon law it will in many instances be erroneous it is certain that a greatgrandson of the fathers brother will inherit before a son of the grandfathers brother yet the latter is the next collateral kinsman according to both the canon and civil law computation for the former is in the fourth degree by the canon and the sixth by the civil law the latter is in the third by the canon and the fifth by the civil but in the descent of real property the former must be preferred the doctrine of consanguinity as laid down by blackstone has however been thus vindicated by the author of the recent treatise of descents— mr christian asserts that this introduction of the computation of kindred into a treatise of descent may perplex but can never assist but it may be asked by what means are we to ascertain and determine who is nearest to a person deceased—whether his uncle or his brother or any other of his relations we have no rule which directs that a brother can inherit before an uncle but merely that on failure of lineal descendants or issue of the person last seised the inheritance shall descend to his collateral relations canon   and then follows this sixth rule which designates which of these collateral relations shall be preferred namely the next collateral kinsman of the whole blood and who it will be asked is the next collateral kinsman unless we can have recourse to the degrees of consanguinity as pointed out by the canon law in order to ascertain this fact we have no rule by which we can determine what collateral relative is entitled to the inheritance but mr christian further asserts that this computation of the sixth rule of descents if referred either to the civil or canon law will in many instances be erroneous for a grandson of the fathers brother will inherit before a son of the grandfathers brother yet the latter is the next collateral kinsman mr cs assertion is founded on a mistaken view of the rules of descent and on a disregard of their connection one with another for if we refer to the fifth canon which intimates that the descent in the collateral line is subject to the second third and fourth rules of descent we shall find that the lineal descendants of any person deceased shall represent their ancestor and stand in the same place as the person himself would have done had he been living and again by the exposition of lord coke of the word next we shall find that it must be understood in a double sense namely next jure representationis and next jure propinquitatis that is by right of representation and by right of propinquity and that littleton in his position that the next collateral cousin shall inherit meaneth of the right of representation for legally in course of descents he is next of blood inheritable co litt  0 b and therefore though on the face of the table of consanguinity the greatgrandson of the fathers brother does appear to be more degrees removed than the son of the grandfathers brother yet inasmuch as he represents his lineal ancestor the uncle of the deceased he is one degree nearer than the son of the grandfathers brother who represents only the greatuncle of the deceased but again mr c disavows this doctrine of representation of blood and proposes that the rule is only true in the paternal line for when the paternal and maternal lines are both admitted to the inheritance that is when the deceased was the purchaser of the estate and it therefore is a feudum novum to be held ut antiquum the most remote collateral kinsman ex parte paternâ will inherit before the nearest ex parte maternâ mr c again falls into the same error and seems to disregard the subsequent rules of descent by which the kindred derived from the blood of the male ancestors however remote are admitted before those from the blood of the female however near the rule therefore may stand good and unexceptionable in this form—that the collateral kinsman who is either by representation or in his own personal right nearest to the deceased shall be admitted and succeed to the inheritance on failure of his lineal descendants the rules of descent must be taken together in a connected view nor can we in many instances state any one of the canons of descent as a positive rule without such connection the one with another thus for instance as in the direct descending line by the first canon taken by itself all the children so by the fifth rule all the collateral relatives of any person deceased would be entitled to an equal share of the inheritance but these are subsequently explained the one to mean the male issue and of them the eldest in preference to the females and the latter the next collateral either in his own right or by representation in the male line in preference to the female see h

be said for it than this viz that if the halfblood were universally admitted to inherit an estate might pass out of one family into another between whom there was no union of blood as where a son inherits an estate from his father and his mother marries again and has a child by her second husband if this child could inherit from his halfbrother it would acquire the estate of the first husband to whom it is not related by blood and in order to avoid this inconvenience the halfblood is universally excluded but surely nothing can be more cruel or contrary to our notions of propriety and consistency than to give the estate to a distant relation or to the lord in preference to a halfbrother either when it has descended from the common parent or when the halfbrother has himself acquired it a case was determined in the common pleas a few years ago under the following circumstances—a father died intestate leaving two daughters by his first wife and his second wife pregnant who was delivered of a son this infant lived only a few weeks and it was held that as the mother had resided upon one of the fathers estates and had received rent for others after the fathers death she being the guardian in socage of the infant this amounted to a legal seisin in him and of consequence his two sisters could not inherit and the estate descended perhaps to a remote relation   wils     and in a late case where a father died leaving two daughters by different mothers the mother of the youngest entered upon the premises and the eldest daughter died it was held that the mother being guardian in socage to the youngest and having a right to enter for her own daughter the entry of the mother was also an entry for the coparcener the halfsister which created a seisin in her and therefore upon

difference between contingencies which import a present interest of which the future enjoyment is contingent and mere possibilities which import no such present interest namely that the former may be released in certain cases and are generally descendible and devisable but not so the latter suppose for instance lands are limited by executory devise to a in fee but if a should die before the age of twentyone then to c in fee this is a kind of possibility or contingency which may be released or devised or may pass to the heir or executor because there is a present interest although the enjoyment of it is future and contingent but where there is no such present interest as the hope of succession which the heir has from his ancestor in general this being but a mere or naked possibility cannot be released or devised c fearne     secondly contingencies or possibilities which may be released or devised c are also assignable in equity upon the same principle for an assignment operates by way of agreement or contract which the court considers as the engagement of the one to transfer and make good a right and interest to the other as where a possessed of a term of  000 years devised it to b

judgment in the case of collingwood vs pace   ventr     where he says though an alien may take by purchase by his own contract that which he cannot retain against the king yet the law will not enable him by act of his own to transfer by hereditary descent or to take by an act in law for the law quæ nihil frustra which does nothing in vain will not give an inheritance or freehold by act in law for

first which will be valid upon being confirmed by the dean and chapter for it is of no consequence to the successor how long the old lease has to run at the period of making the new one as the term of the latter commences from its date and both are thus running out at the same time and if the first expire the next year the second will expire twenty years after as there is not at any period an interest of more than twentyone years in lease but there cannot be two leases in the same way running for lives at the same time nor one lease for lives and another for years they must be both of the latter description or they cannot coexist or concur in conferring an interest upon the lessee if the second lease be granted to any other than the lessee in the first the lessor may lose his remedy by

such high estimation is right in the eye of the law that the law preserveth it from death and destruction trodden down it may be but never trodden out co litt     a and this consideration explains the distinction between a release by extinguishment and a release that passes a right under the latter the relessee has the same right which his relessor had and that only by the former the relessor puts an end as against all the world to some hereditament different from that which the relessee has and which cannot exist with it in the same person releases says littleton which enure by way of extinguishment against all persons are where he to whom the release is made cannot have that which to him is released as if there be lord and tenant and the lord release to the tenant all the right which he hath in the seigniory or all the right which he hath in the land c this release goeth by way of extinguishment against all persons because that the tenant cannot have service to receive of himself in the same manner it is of a release made to the tenant of the land of a rentcharge or common of pasture c because the tenant cannot have that which to him is released c so such releases shall enure by way of extinguishment in all ways sects       0 there is this distinction between an extinguishment and the passing of a right a right cannot be passed by release to one who has merely a right it must be to him who has the estate and yet privity is no element in such a release but the contrary on the other hand a release by way of extinguishment may be made to one who has privity but no estate thus a lord may release his seigniorial rights to his tenant after he has been disseised but a rentcharge as distinguished from a rentservice can only be released to the actual tenant because the charge is only on the land and implies no personal privity co litt     a—sweet p co litt        mr ritso objects strongly to this explanation of releases first because it does not point out the proper distinction between a release per mitter le droit and a release per extinguisher le droit—viz that in the former case the release can but in the latter that it cannot hold out every other for example a release per mitter le droit is where the releasee can hold out every other the release of the disseisee to the disseisor is of this description and so it is if a disseised by b and c releases to b for b shall now hold out c in the same manner as if a had regularly entered upon b anc c as he might have lawfully done and then made a separate feoffment to b but if a is disseised by b who enfeoffs c and d and afterwards a releases to one of them this is a release per extinguisher le droit of a for the benefit of the two feoffees equally for the one to whom the release is made cannot hold out the other upon the same principle if the disseisee releases to the lessee of the disseisor this also is a release per extinguisher le droit of the disseisee and of which the reversioner as well as the lessee shall have advantage for they have both of them but one estate in law and therefore the confirmation of the particular estate is equally the confirmation of the reversion and so it is if a patron is usurped upon by two and afterwards releases to one of them it operates by way of extinguishment for the benefit of both equally because the admission and institution are quasi a legal adjudication of the title secondly because the releases which are here described per mitter le droit and by way of entry and feoffment are not exactly different species of releases but only one and the same species differing no otherwise than in circumstance for every release which operates by way of entry and feoffment is in fact a release per mitter le droit and if the disseisee releases whether to one disseisor alone or to one of two disseisors it operates equally in both cases per mitter and vester le droit of the disseisce and by way of entry and feoffment that is to say the releasee has the same title in both cases as if the disseisee had actually revested his former estate by his entry and afterwards made a feoffment with livery of seisin to the releasee and he shall now hold out every other and thirdly because there is another distinct species of release of which no notice whatever is here taken—namely a release per extinguisher le estate as from the grantee of a rentcharge to the owner of the land or a release of the services from the lord to the tenant or a release of common of pasture c co litt   0 a  0  b if the lord sells the

by collateral covenants which do not run with the land as if a lessee covenants for himself executors and administrators concerning a thing not in existence as to build a wall upon the premises the assignee will not be bound but the assignee will be bound if the lessee has covenanted for himself and assigns where the lessee covenants for himself his executors and administrators to reside upon

should be no aftermade defeasance allowed of a recognizance or of a judgment or of any other executory conveyance of record which are all equally solemn with a feoffment lord coke expressly tells us that there can be no aftermade defeasance of a feoffment because it is an executed conveyance in contradistinction to those which are executory co litt  0  a in the case of a feoffment the estate in

remain to be completed by a further act still to be done—viz the process of execution and consequently till that is had they may of course be defeated or discharged at any time and so it is of all

an equitable estate indeed without any written defeasance at all when an absolute deed is shown to have been originally made to the grantee only as a security for loan of money or in other words was

by fine feoffment or other conveyance operating by transmutation of possession and uses raised by covenant for upon the first if no uses were expressed it is equity that assigns the feoffor to have

will do well to peruse the whole and not rest satisfied with the following extracts mr sugden says shifting secondary and springing uses are frequently confounded with each other and with future or contingent uses they may perhaps be thus classed  st shifting or secondary uses which take effect in derogation of some other estate and are either limited expressly by the deed or are authorized to be created by some person named in the deed  dly springing uses confining this class to uses limited to arise on a future event where no preceding use is limited and which do not take effect in derogation of any other interest than that which results to the grantor or remains in him in the mean time  dly future or contingent uses are properly uses to take effect as remainders for instance a use to the first unborn son of a after a previous limitation to him for life or for years determinable on his life is a future or contingent use but yet does not answer the notion of either a shifting or a springing use contingent uses naturally arose after the statute of    hen viii in imitation of contingent remainders the first class—that is shifting or secondary uses—are at this day so common that they pass without observation in every marriage settlement the first use is to the owner in fee until marriage and after the marriage to other uses here the owner in the first instance takes the fee which upon the marriage ceases and the new use arises but a shifting use cannot be limited on a shifting use and shifting uses must be confined within such limits as are not to tend to a perpetuity see ante chap    but a shifting use may be created after an estatetail to take effect at any period however remote because the tenant in tail for the timebeing may by a recovery defeat the shifting use as to the second class or springing uses before the statute of hen viii there was no mischief in an independent original springing use to commence at a distant period because the legal estate remained in the trustee after the statute too the use was held to result to or remain in the person creating the future use according to the mode of conveyance adopted till the springing use arose this resulting use the statute executed so that the estate remained in the settler till the period when the use was to rise which might be at any time within the limits allowed by law in case of an executory devise when springing uses are raised by conveyances not operating by transmutation of possession as such conveyances have only an equitable effect until the statute and use meet a springing use may be limited by them at once but where the conveyance is one which does operate by transmutation of possession as a feoffment fine recovery or lease and release two objects must be attended to first to convey the estate according to the rules of common law secondly to raise the use out of the seisin created by the conveyance now the common law does not admit of a freehold being limited to commence in futuro see ante p     as to the third class or future or contingent uses where an estate is limited previously to a future use and the future use is limited by way of remainder it will be subject to the rules of common law and if the previous estate is not sufficient to support it will be void see ante p     future uses have been countenanced and springing uses restrained by what is now a firm rule of law—namely that if such a construction can be put upon a limitation in use as that it may take effect by way of remainder it shall never take effect as a springing use

trustees should from time to time pay the rents and profits to a or to such person as she by any writing under her hand as well during coverture as being sole should appoint without the intermeddling of her husband who he willed should have no benefit or disposal thereof and as to the inheritance of the premises in trust for such person and for such estates as a by her will or other writing under her hand should appoint and for want of such appointment in trust for her and her heirs the question was whether this was a use executed by the statute or a bare trust for the wife and the court held it to be a trust only and not a use executed by the statute   vern     and again in a late case where a devise was to trustees and their heirs upon trust to permit a married woman to receive the rents and profits during her life for her own sole and separate use notwithstanding her coverture and without being in any wise subject to the debts or control of her then or aftertaken husband and her receipt alone to be a sufficient discharge with remainder over it was held that the legal estate was vested in the trustees for it being the intention of the testator to secure to the wife a separate allowance free from the control of her husband it was essentially necessary that the trustees should take the estate with the use executed in order to effectuate that intention otherwise the husband should be entitled to receive the profits and defeat the very object which the testator had in view   term rep     see also   east       east   so where lands were devised to trustees and their heirs in trust to pay out of the rents and profits several legacies and annuities and to pay all the residue of the rents and profits to c a married woman during her life for her separate use or as she should direct and after her death the trustees to stand seised to the use of the heirs of her body with remainders over it was held by lord king that the use was executed in the trustees during the life of c who had only a trustestate in the surplus of the rents and profits for life with a contingent remainder to the heirs of her body and that her eldest son would take as a purchasor for by the subsequent words viz that the trustees should stand seised to the use of the heirs of the body of c the use was executed in the persons entitled to take by virtue thereof and therefore there being only a trustestate in c and a use executed in the heirs of her body these different interests could not unite and incorporate together so as to create an estatetail by operation of law in c and he took a difference between the principal case and that of broughton vs langley   lutw       ld raym     for there it was to permit a to receive the rents and profits for life but in the principal case it was a trust to pay over the rents and profits to another and therefore the estate must remain in the trustees to perform the will   vin     pl      eq ca abr         and this decree was affirmed in the house of lords   bro c p     see   bos  pul     so where lands were devised to trustees and their heirs in trust to pay out of the rents and profits after deducting rates taxes and repairs the residue to c s for life and after his decease to the use of the heirs male of the body of c s with remainder over it was held by lord thurlow that the use was executed in the trustees during the life of c s who had only a trustestate for life and the remainder in tail was a legal estate which could not unite and incorporate together and c s could not suffer a valid recovery for in order to make a good tenant to the præcipe there must either be a legal estate for life and a legal remainder in tail or an equitable estate for life with an equitable remainder in tail   bro c c    and also where lands were devised to trustees and their heirs in trust that they should out of the rents and profits or by sale or mortgage of the whole or so much of the estate as should be necessary raise a sum sufficient to pay the testators debts and legacies and afterwards in trust and to the use of t b for life with several remainders over the question was whether the legal estate vested in the trustees lord hardwicke was of opinion that the devise to the trustees and their heirs carried the whole fee to them and therefore the estate for life as well as the estates in remainder were merely trustestates in equity that part of the trust was to sell the whole or a sufficient part of the estate for the payment of debts and legacies which would carry a fee by construction though the word heirs were omitted in the devise as in   eq ca abr     for the trustees must have a fee in the whole estate to enable them to sell because it being uncertain what they may sell no purchasor could otherwise be safe that the only doubt he had was on the case of lords say and seal vs lady jones before lord king and affirmed in the house of lords as to that point but on examination that case differed in a material part and taking together all the clauses of that will it only amounted to a devise to trustees and their heirs during anothers life upon which a legal remainder might be properly limited   vez     s c   atk       0 and it was taken for granted in   vez     that a devise to trustees and their heirs in trust to pay the rents and profits to another vested the legal estate in the trustees for in general the distinction is that where the limitation to trustees and their heirs is in trust to receive the rents and profits and pay them over to a for life c this use to a is not executed by the statute but the legal estate is vested in the trustees to enable them to perform the will but where the limitation is to trustees and their heirs in trust to permit and suffer a to receive the rents and profits for his life c the use is executed in a unless it be necessary the use should be executed in the trustees to enable them to perform the trust as in the case of harton vs harton above mentioned so in taunt  0  the devise being to trustees and their heirs in trust to pay unto or permit and suffer the testators niece to have receive and take the rents and profits for her life it was held that the use was executed in the niece because the words to permit c came last and in a will the last words shall prevail see   eq ca abr     as where lands were devised to trustees and their heirs to the intent and purpose to permit a to receive the rents and profits for his life and after that the trustees should stand seised to the use of the heirs of the body of a with a proviso that a with the consent of the trustees might make a jointure on his wife it was held that this was a use executed in a and not a trustestate for it would have been a plain trust at common law and what was a trust of a freehold of inheritance at common law is executed by the statute which mentions the word trust as well as use and the case in   vent     adjudged to the contrary upon this point was denied to be law   lutw         s c   ld raym       salk     and the same distinction was taken by lord kenyon in the case of doe on the demise of woolley vs pickard

sufficient distinctness explain the difference between droiturel and tortious conveyances droiturel conveyances are of the right only and not of the possession and are either primary or secondary of the first description are all original conveyances of things which lie only in grant and not in livery and of which no visible possession can be delivered as advowsons rents commons reversions and other incorporeal hereditaments those of the second class are where there is already such subsisting privity of estate between the parties that any further delivery of possession would be vain and nugatory as in the case of release confirmation and surrender conveyances which are thus made can be evidently no other than droiturel—that is to say they cannot enure to pass more than may be innocently or rightfully conveyed for the transfer of a right becomes a mere nullity when exercised beyond the subsisting right to transfer nemo potest plus juris ad alium transferre quam ipse habet on the other hand all original or primary conveyances which are wrongfully made of things in livery as of lands or tenements of which the corporal possession is made over by the act of livery of seisin without any reference to the right are said to be tortious thus if a tenant in tail leases to c for life remainder to d in fee the discontinuance is in fee for both estates are created by one and the same livery but if a having leased to c for his life had afterwards granted the reversion to d in fee the discontinuance would have been then for life only and not in fee for the reversion lies in grant and not in livery and so it is of a bargain and sale enrolled a lease and release a covenant to stand seised and the like they are all of them droiturel or innocent conveyances because they operate upon the right only and not by transmutation of the possession and consequently can convey no more than may be rightfully and lawfully conveyed co litt     b  0  b again if tenant in tail

reversion into possession but if he suffers a recovery in the like case it operates to defeat the reversion as for example b was tenant in tail by descent with reversion to himself in fee of certain lands of which a his ancestor had granted leases with covenants for further renewal now in the first place although the tenant in tail is empowered under the enabling statute    hen viii c    to grant leases for twentyone years or three lives pursuant to the directions of the statute he has plainly no power either by the statute or by the common law to bind the issue in tail to a further renewal and consequently whatever covenants a might have made to that effect they would not be binding upon the heir in respect of the estatetail secondly with respect to the reversion in fee which also descended at the same time from a to b this was hereditas infructuosa as long as the estatetail subsisted and although the covenants of the ancestor are said to descend as an onus upon the heir whether he inherits any estate or not yet they lie dormant and are not compulsory until he has assets by descent from or through that same ancestor but a reversion or a remainder expectant upon an estatetail is not assets because it is always in the power of the tenant in tail in possession to bar it at his pleasure let us then suppose that under these circumstances b levies a fine with proclamations under the statute   hen vii c    and    hen viii c    which is said to be the mode usually resorted to in such cases when there are no intervening remainders for the sake of quieting the possession or in order to prepare for making a new settlement now by the operation of the fine in the first instance the conusor takes a feesimple qualified determinable upon the death and failure of issue of the tenant in tail and which is afterwards reconveyed by the deed to lead the uses of the fine to b himself who consequently becomes tenant of the feesimple qualified together with the old reversion to himself in feesimple absolute but it is a maxim in law that when two estates in succession are vested in the same person the less estate always merges in the greater and though an estatetail does not merge because of the statute de donis which would otherwise be of no effect there is no such exception with respect to the qualified or base fee extracted out of the estatetail and which therefore instantly merges in the old reversion in feesimple and consequently the hereditas infructuosa being now reduced into possession the heir has assets by descent from the same ancestor who entered into the covenants and is of course bound by those covenants and so it was adjudged in the case of kellow vs rawdon carth     the reversion in fee expectant upon an estatetail in possession was not assets but no sooner was the estatetail become extinct and the reversion vested in possession in the heir by the operation of the fine than it thereupon became assets and liable to all the encumbrances of the ancestor we have here then the principle upon which the fine operates to let the reversion into possession and to make the heir chargeable in such case in respect of assets descended who was not so before but in the case of a recovery it is otherwise why because the estate conveyed by the recovery is that of feesimple absolute of which the recoveror acquires seisin not by compromise as in the case of a fine but by adjudication of an adverse possession grounded upon an older and better title and consequently the operation of the recovery is to defeat the reversion together with all the mesne estates and encumbrances precisely in the same manner as if the recoveror had actually recovered in a really adverse suit ritsos introd  0 —sharswood o see statute    hen

fine is supposed by blackstone to be binding upon the feme coverte because she is privately examined as to her voluntary consent but if that were indeed the principal reason any other mode of conveyance to which the same form of private examination were superadded would be as binding as a fine it seems that the fine is binding in such case because it is the conclusion of a real action commenced by original writ—without which preliminary even at this day a fine would be a nullity in the ancient practice the recovery of the estate of the wife in a real action was held to be binding notwithstanding the coverture upon the same principle the fine is held to be binding in the present instance because of the supposed depending of a real action of which the fine is an amicable composition by agreement and not because of the form of private examination which is only a circumstance in the mode of levying the fine and a merely secondary incident introduced to prevent

double voucher— in the case of a recovery with single voucher supposing the præcipe upon which the recovery is grounded to be brought immediately against the tenant in tail himself who appears and vouches over the common vouchee to warranty it is then the estatetail of which he is actually seised at the time which is defeated and consequently remainders and reversions together with all latent droits and interests are not barred secondly if the tenant in tail levies a fine—as he usually does—preparatory to the recovery now the estatetail being thus divested by the operation of the fine the recovery which is had thereon is no longer of the old feetail but of the new feesimple which has been extracted out of it in this case however as well as in the former a sufficient recovery cannot be had with single voucher but only with double voucher at least though not exactly for the same reason for in the former case in which the recoveree or tenant to the præcipe was actually seised at the time of an estatetail the recovery was necessarily of that estate and nothing more but in the latter case in which the estatetail was previously divested or discontinued by the fine and turned to a droit the recoveree or tenant to the præcipe had a feesimple the recovery of which is good against him by way of estoppel co litt     a but upon his death may be avoided by the issue by defeating the discontinuance under which it was created as for example when the tenant in tail levies a fine it operates in the first instance as a discontinuance suppose then the estate created under the discontinuance to be immediately reconveyed to the tenant in tail himself who thereupon suffers a recovery now it is clear that this recovery is not of the estatetail but of the estate created under the discontinuance by the same rule then if the heir in tail defeats the discontinuance which he may well do by action though not by entry the discontinuance being defeated the tortious fee simple which the discontinuance gave rise to is necessarily determined and consequently the recovery avoided co litt     a but when the tenant in tail is brought in as vouchee to the warranty as in the case of a recovery with double voucher the heir is then barred by warranty and so are all they in remainder or reversion for the law always supposes upon a principle of equity that the first vouchee recovers other lands of equal value against the second vouchee which descend in the same course of inheritance as the estate passed by the recovery would have descended upon this presumption of law which is uniformly admitted in order to give effect to common recoveries the warranty of the ancestor not only binds the heir and bars every latent right and interest he may have in the lands recovered but also defeats at the same time the remainders over but where the ancestor has entered into no such warranty with double voucher there is evidently no bar to the heir so as to preclude him from his latent droit in tail which is above the recovery and so in all cases where there are several and distinct estates passed by the recovery it is necessary that the parties should be all severally vouched to warranty in order to insure a good title ritso introd  0 —sharswood d dr and st b   dial    e of com recov          fines and recoveries are now considered as mere forms of

lawreform was communicated to the legislature among the many acts passed at the commencement of that reign having this object in view none has been found more successful in operation or has obtained greater credit as a triumph of legislative skill than the fines and recoveries act      w iv c    of which i shall now proceed to give an account the first enactment is that after the   st of december      no fine shall be levied or recovery suffered except when the preliminary procedings necessary for these purposes had been before that day actually commenced the statute next provides for the fulfilment of covenants entered into previous to the day specified for the levying of fines and suffering recoveries and by a legislative fiat heals all errors and defects in those already completed thus drying up at once a prolific source of doubts and difficulties which formerly encumbered the titles of estates it also declares that all warranties of lands made by tenants in tail after december   st      shall be absolutely void against the issue in tail and those in remainder the ground being thus as it were cleared a general enabling clause follows enacting that after the   st december      the day named for the cessation of fines and recoveries every actual tenant in tail whether in possession remainder contingency or otherwise shall have full power to dispose of the lands entailed either for a feesimple absolute or any less estate as against all persons claiming either under the entail or in remainder or reversion including the crown saving the rights of all persons having estates prior to the estatetail so disposed of and all others except those against whom the disposition is by the act authorized to be made a similar power of disposition as against remaindermen or reversioners is given to the tenant in tail whose estate has been converted into a base fee so as to enlarge such base fee into a feesimple absolute thus is the tenant in tail whether actual or one whose estate has been converted into a base fee placed in most respects on a par with the tenant in feesimple as far as disposing power is concerned but his power as we shall now see is attended with certain limitations for where there is in existence any estate for years determinable on the dropping of a life or lives or any greater estate not being an estate for years prior to the estatetail and created by the same settlement as created the entail the consent of the owner of such prior estate or the first of such owners if more than one is made necessary to enable the tenant in tail unless he be entitled to the immediate reversion expectant upon his own estatetail to make a complete disposition of the fee without such consent he can but bar his own estatetail converting it into a base fee and cannot bar those in remainder the person whose consent is thus made requisite is called by the act the protector of the settlement and he is endowed with the most absolute discrecion as to giving or refusing his consent he is not bound by any agreement which he may have entered into to withhold his consent nor is his office to be treated as a trust so that no court of equity can control or interfere with him whether to restrain or compel his consent under the old system of recoveries a check similar to that which is now secured by the office of protector arose from the necessity of obtaining the concurrence of the person entitled to the immediate freehold prior to the estatetail in order to make a tenant to the præcipe or writ of entry this was found to operate in restraint of imprudent alienation and to favour the retention of estates in one family through a succession of generations the new plan has this advantage over the old the owner of the prior estate is now only a consenting not a conveying party he may therefore concur in barring the estate without affecting the powers or interests incident to his own estate and without letting in the encumbrances of the remainderman which in some cases was a consequence of the old system having imparted a general disposing power under such conditions as we have seen to the tenant in tail the statute next enacts that the disposition shall be effected by some one of the assurances not being a will by which the same disposition might have been made if the tenant in tail had been tenant in feesimple but such disposition except the land be of copyhold tenure must be made or evidenced by deed and no disposition resting merely in contract notwithstanding it be evidenced by deed shall be good under the act either at law or in equity in this respect therefore as under the old law the heir in tail and remainderman are more favoured than the heiratlaw of tenant in feesimple whom the ancestors contract binds and whom he may bar by his will no assurance will have any operation under the act except a lease at rackrent for less than twentyone years unless enrolled in chancery within six calendar months

separate consenting deed must be likewise enrolled at or before the time when the other deed is enrolled a tenant in tail of lands held by copy of courtroll if his estate be a legal one and not merely an estate in equity must dispose of his lands by surrender in the usual way if however his estate be but an equitable one he may dispose of it either by surrender or by deed and if by deed such deed must be entered on the courtrolls as must also the deed by which the protector if there be one consents to the disposition but if the disposition be made by surrender the protector may give his consent to the person taking the surrender the statute further enables the commissioners of bankruptcy to dispose by deed of the lands of a bankrupt tenant in tail to as large an extent as the bankrupt himself might have done one of the purposes to which fines were formerly applied was to pass the estates and interests of married women which could not on account of the incapacity arising from coverture have been otherwise effectually bound the act therefore provides that it shall be lawful for every married woman in every case except that of being tenant in tail which is otherwise provided for by the act as we have already seen by deed to dispose of lands of any tenure and money subject to be invested in the purchase of lands and to dispose of release surrender or extinguish any estate which she alone or she and her husband in her right may have in any such lands or money and to release and extinguish any power which she may have over such lands or money as effectually as

apart from her husband as to her knowledge of the deed and whether she voluntarily and freely consents to it—a ceremony which as we have previously seen was used when a married woman was cognizor in a fine if the disposition intended to be made be of lands of copyhold tenure to which the married woman is entitled for an estate at law it must be done by way of surrender into the hands of the lord an equitable estate in copyhold may be disposed of in the same way or by deed whenever it is done by surrender the married woman is to be separately examined by the person taking the surrender as to the voluntary nature of the act such are briefly the provisions of this important statute by which estatestail may now be absolutely alienated or barred and converted into estates in fee and by which the interests of married women may be passed that which was formerly effected by a series of tedious forms with perpetual danger of errors or omissions which might vitiate the whole transaction is now accomplished by a simple deed the same in form as that by which any other owner might convey his interest or in cases of copyhold tenure by surrender—the only additional requisites being that these acts be done with the consent of certain proper parties who are clearly defined that the deed be enrolled and in the case of a married woman that it be acknowledged by her in the manner prescribed by
