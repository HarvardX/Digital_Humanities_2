vulgar rhyme gracefully great and terribly sublime trolling in fulltoned melody along with all the clattering clang of modern song i would hail the progress of those blissful days when fair philosophys meridian rays shall brighten natures face shall drive the moles of blinking error to their secret holes disperse the darkness of primaeval night and bid a new creation rise to light

renovation of the world under the benign influence of french freedom has been long foretold by prophets of every description by some who manufacture verses others who manufacture cotton by maudling mrss and mincing misses by enlightened lawyers and more enlightened physicians but by none more fully expected more ardently longed for than by dr beddoes and a gentleman of pembroke college oxford to whom dr beddoes addresses a late elaborate work  appellation his  dear giddy the great dr assures us that not only science in general will shortly advance toward perfection but that in particular a new medicine will arise from the ashes of the old with healing in its wings how this revolution is to be effected we are informed in the dedication of his observations on calculus etc p   we are just beginning to catch a glimpse of the laws of animal nature and now when the human mind seems in so many countries  be roused from that torpor by which it has so long been benumbed we may reasonably indulge the expectation of a rapid progress in this the most beneficial of all the sciences an infinitely small portion of genius has hitherto been exerted to diminish the sum of our painful sensations and the force of society has been exclusively at the disposal of despots and juntos the great artificers of human evil should an entire change in these two respects any where take place every member of society might soon expect to experience in his own person the consequence of so happy an innovation and should the example be generally  there is no improvement in the condition of the world for which we might not  from the bloodless rivalship of nations but we are told that the same influence of liberty and genius will not only in other respects effect equal wonders but produce greater blessings we know exclaims this egregious chemist that vegetables are capable of forming oils either exactly the same as those of animals or very nearly resembling them thus we have the suet of the croton sebiferum the butter of the phoenix dactylifera and of the butyrum cacao when from a more intimate acquaintance with them we shall be better able to apply the laws of organic bodies to the accommodation as well as preservation of life may we not by regulating the vegetable functions teach our woods and hedges to supply us with butter and tallow observations on calculus etc p  0  no more the lazy ox shall gormandize and swell with fattening grass his monstrous size no more trot round and round the groaning field but tons of beef our loaded thickets yield the patient dairymaid no more shall learn with tedious toil to whirl the frothy churn but from the hedges shall her dairy fill as pounds of butter in big drops distill the sottish jews who in a god believed and sometimes blessings oftener plagues received shouted a miracle when on the ground their boasted bread the greedy grumblers found by no dry crusts shall infidels be fed our soil producing butter to our bread see reverend thames who god of rivers reigns and winds meandring through our richest plains to treat the cits that many a sixpence give once in a week like gentlemen to live resign his majesty of mud and stream over strawberry beds in deluges of cream see tallow candles tip the modest thorn candles of wax the prouder elm adorn see the dull clown survey with stupid stare where leaves once grew now periwigs of hair while fluids which a wondrous change betray ooze from the vernal bud the summer spray differing from animals alone in name as botanists already half exclaim see plants susceptible of joy and woe feel all we feel and know whatever we know view them like us inclined to watch or sleep like us to smile and ah like us to weep like us behold them glow with warm desire and catch from beautys glance celestial fire then oh ye fair if through the shady grove musing on absent lovers you should rove and there with tempting step all heedless brush too near some wanton metamorphosd bush or only hear perchance the western breeze steal murmuring through the animated trees beware beware lest to your cost you find the bushes dangerous dangerous too the wind lest ah too late with shame and grief you feel what your fictitious pads would ill conceal while plants turn animals man happy man if this supposition were just might not some means be discovered to protract the period of youth and vigor indefinitely whether true or false and even though we should never be able to restore new excitability to the system there can be no doubt of the immediate practicability of prolonging life considerably and what is much more desirable of maintaining a firmer state of health observations on calculus etc p  0  nor however remote medicine may be at present from such perfection do i see any reason to doubt that by taking advantage of various and continual accessions as they accrue to science the same power may be acquired over living as is at present exercised over some inanimate bodies and that not only the cure and prevention of diseases but the art of protracting the fairest season of life and rendering health more vigorous will one day half realize the dream of alchemy beddoess

constant fill dr beddoes in a little tract addressed to the author of this epistle entertains us with a long history of how he made himself very lean very fair his complexion having been before of an uniform brown very pretty and very consumptive by the use of a certain cosmetic called oxygenous air and how he afterward cured himself of the said leanness and consumption at his friends quaker reynoldss in colnbrook dale by a diet in which butter and cream bore the largest proportions see pages  0             and    who if excess of oxygene create symptoms which lean consumption indicate a sure specific can procure with ease rich cream and butter from his herd of trees or if he find excess of to prevent our sailors from growing fat and afterward falling into the scurvy of which obesity we are informed is the first symptom dr beddoes proposes that the jolly tars should eat their food raw observations p  0 hydrogene his body load with fat his mind with spleen true health and vigor to

red recent raw now rise my muse and warm with rapture dart from men to manners fancy to the heart transporting sight to view the sons of pride their little heads with shame and sorrow hide ranks and distinctions cease all reeking lie in the mean muck of low equality favorites of freedom sons of frisky france who never learnt like british bears to dance and while their premiers humdrum bagpipes sound led by the nose jog growling round and round but more like monkeys airy light and gay pleased on your masters head to skip and play ye pious atheists moralists who deem the christians heaven and hell an idle dream delighted to deride all vulgar fears of beelzebubs black claws cropped tail and ears with manly scorn and dignity to tread on prostrate superstitions hoary head who foes to power despotic dare defy the king of kings that bugbear of the sky dreading for present crimes no future rod selfpraise your worship vanity your god oh how my eyes with tears ecstatic fill what new felt transports through my bosom thrill when i behold you with gigantic blow the pigmy pride of royalty lay low with pikes and guns this moral dogma teach  virtue consists in nudity of breech soon shall we view no more the glittering things bestarrd begarterd and befooled by kings the pretty twinklers that so sweetly shone and deemed their lovely luster all their own no more the despot view whose mighty nods shook nature and proclaimed him god of gods drunk with applause who raised his rolling eyes and seemed whenever he moved to tread the skies despised detested all shall wing their flight and sink no more to rise in endless night armed with a bristled end and glittering awl behold a minor monarch in his stall no circling gold his royal brow surrounds a yard of room his sphere of action bounds his sole ambition and his prime pursuit with skill a shoe to patch to stitch a boot nor deem his fate severe the time may come when many a pious king in christendom dashed from his throne and made dame fortunes fool shall envy little capets cobbling stool mark with the peer and prince the  canting priest forbidden on his countrys fat to feast it is a law of human nature the less of ecclesiastical influence the less of deadly animosity among men  it is reasonable to presume that the majority of french priests in england partake of the spirit of their brethren and to a large portion of the popish priesthood christianity is believed upon good grounds to be as much foolishness as it was to the greeks their faith in the advantages of the immense emoluments which those reverend robbers their predecessors had extorted from superstitious barbarians never suffered any abatement hence probably that conduct to which their sufferings are to be imputed  through all the calumny that has been vomited forth against the french the most injured and most enlightened people upon earth it is easy to discern some advantages which the nation owes to liberty  tithes the accursed relic of popery have been abolished  france is purged not only from ecclesiastical drones which consumed the sweetest honey of the hive but also from the monstrous debauchery of the richer and the beggarly insolence of the poorer noblesse  dr beddoess admirable reasons for believing the friends of liberty in france not to be the authors or abettors of the crimes committed in that country humbly addressed to those who from time to time constitute themselves judges and jury upon affairs public and private and without admitting any testimony but the gross lies of beldame rumor damn their neighbors individually and the rest of the world by the lump the celebrated hand bill circulated in shropshire which eventually occasioned his resignation of the chemical chair in the university of oxford  while peace looks down sweet smiling on the swains and untaxd plenty crowns the fruitful plains no more that lazy lubbard shall we pay with phiz so farcical to preach and pray no more behold that harpy of the land lay on our largest sheaves his greedy hand with bigotrys black banner wide unfurled fright into gothic ignorance the world but truth and light shall come with hostile rage to drive the holy vandal off the stage see tithes expire and ancient slavery fail proud superstition turn her vanquished tail no zealous minister the church befriend but all her sorceries
