a new test of the church of englands loyalty or whiggish loyalty and church loyalty compared  a new test of the church of englands loyalty in all the unhappy contentions among parties and factions in this brangling nation the champions of the church of england as they would have themselves called have laid it down as the distinguishing mark of their hiearchy that it is her practice and has been derived from her very constitution as well as doctrine to six in all her members principles of unshaken loyalty to her prince entire and undisputed obedience to all her commands and an abhorrence of the very thoughts of those hellish principles that it can be lawful on any account whatsoever to resist the established power of their kings  t would be endless to quote the reverend dr b  ge who from the text in the  resist not the powers etc for whatsoever powers are be ordained of god whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of god tells us that if the king should by his royal command execute the greatest violence upon either our penson or estate our duty was to submit by prayers and tears first to god almighty to turn the wrath of his vicegerent from his servant and by humble entreaty to beg his majestys grace and pardon but to lift up the hand against the lords anointed or resist the evil of punishment he thought sit to inflict this were a crime unpardonable either before god or man and a crime says the reverend doctor which we bless god the very principles of our ever loyal mother the church of england abhors and detests let incendiaries phanaticks and bloody peacebreaking whigs says another learned divine nourish the viprous principles of treason and rebellion and let them meet the due reward of their factious doings in the resentments of a righteous but provoked nation but god be praised our mother the church of england has always brought up her sons in an unspotted loyalty and obedience none have been found lifting up their hands against their sovereign or possessing the rights of the anointed of god etc  the very being and life the original and principles of the church of england says another  0th of january sermon is loyalty and fidelity to god as the immediate supreme and to the king as the lively image of divine authority whose power is immediately derived from holds of and is accountable to none but to god himself    to avoid prolixity of quotation the reader is desired to accept of these as sufficient proofs of what i lay down upon this condition nevertheless that besides the general appeal which i might make to the memory of most men i oblige my self upon demand to produce ten thousand fair quotations out of the writings of our late modern authors since the restoration wherein the doctrines of nonresistance of princes passive obedience and the divine authority of the kingly power is owned and declared to be an essential part of the profession and practice of the church of england and upon this foot which i hold to be sufficient i think i cannot be censured if i take it for granted  now as this too much divided nation has always been composed of two contending parties those parties have been distinguished as in like cases by names of contempt and though they have often changed them on either side as cavalier and roundhead royalists and rebels malignants and phanaticks tories and whigs yet the division has always been barely the church and the dissenter and there it continues to this day  as the church of england party have boasted of their own loyalty so they have branded the dissenter with rebellion and faction not only in their nature but in their very principles they have laid it down in their writings and sermons and multitudes of their ignorant hearers believe it that the very doctrine of the dissenter is made up of principles in their own nature tending to confusion and rebellion they wont be content that we should own there may be men among all parties of bad designs and who would on all occasions embroil their native country but it must be woven with the very articles of faith and that it is the religion of a dissenter to disturb government kill kings and oppose laws  the phanatical enemies of our king and church says the learned dr p  n drink in rebellion as water it is the very substance of their schismatical doctrine to overwhelm and destroy and commonwealths and confusions are the doctrines they preach  he that lays out one groat with a dissenter says the worthy sir roger in one of his famous observators contributes just so much as the profits of that groat amounts to in trade toward the subversion of the monarchy and erecting a commonwealth for the very nature and tendency of their profession is destructive of kingly power and the government of the nation  this has been the opinion of the church of england both of themselves on one hand and of the dissenters on the other hand i should be glad if i could only say it has been for we find it is still too much their opinion  let no man say that the author of these sheets is either widening or keeping unheald the breaches of this nation for if i can make it appear that there is really no occasion of such unnatural divisions and that neither the extraordinary opinion of themselves nor the contempt of their neighbors as to the matter of loyalty is a becoming principle no nor a rational one neither for that as to loyalty passive obedience nonresistance etc there is really no great difference between one side or other i go as far toward healing the breach as any man for there can be no better way to end the strife on both sides than to prove that neither side has any just cause to contend  to examine the matter on both sides seems very useful at this time in order to reconcile parties and to settle the universal character of the nation  the government of england is a limited monarchy composed of king lords and commons each have their several their separate and conjunctive powers which acting in concert make the harmony of the constitution i shall not invade the province of those learned gentlemen who have undertaken to set forth the branches of the constitution in all their powers limitations and prerogatives it is enough to say the constitution is known the government is confined by laws the crown limited by statutes and the peoples right confirmed by concession of ages  to this government all distinction of names set apart i am of the opinion all parties have in their turns been equally loyal i was going to say equally disloyal and if i were to use the language of late times it would be a very proper way of speaking  affirming without demonstrating is an absurd way of arguing and therefore it will be needful to come to particulars and to examine the several acts and deeds of both parties when the kingly prerogative has shocked or clashd with the people  in order to this it is needful to examine the date of the difference and so to enter a little into history  our first reformation from popery was in the days of king edward the vi i call it the first because twas under him that the whole nation and the government embraced the protestant reformed religion this protestant religion was established by that zealous king and by his parliament backed with the force of laws and confirmed by all the sanction of authority it was capable of and here it began to be called the church of england  some enquiring christians were for making farther steps and carrying on the reformation to a higher degree and if that good reforming king had lived his zeal and integrity was such that there was no doubt he would have gone on to perfect every thing he had begun as new light or more knowledge had increased but the return of popery under queen mary put a stop to the work in general and went very far toward overturning the whole structure of the reformation  queen elizabeth restored it again but as she was a zealous protestant queen yet she was not for subjecting the reformation to any amendment not that she believed it perfect but she was a politic princess surrounded with enemies that were not to be dallyd with and she was loath to suppose such defects in the reformation as were alleged because twas to lessen the reputation of it and consequently her interest in the world  those who insisted upon the further reformation were then called puritans because they set up for greater purity of worship and they separated themselves from the established church because as they said their consciences informed them that they could serve god more agreeable to his will  i shall not meddle with the arguments made use of on both sides either to defend or expose this principle it is sufficient to acquaint my reader that this is the true original of the dissenters we are now to examine a little further back before this reformation there was no such thing as church of england it was then the church of rome that was the established national church  the protestants under the titles of lollards wickliffians hussites etc what did they do did they as our modern people say every body should confirm to what the government commanded no the present church of england party were the dissenters the schismatics and phanaticks in the days of king henry viii were persecuted for not coming to church many of them put to death and always treated with scorn and contempt as enemies to the government broachers of new opinions and contemners of authority as in the case of that famous protomartyr of christs church john lambert and others  in the next ages these come to have the power in their hands and forgetting that they had found it righteous in the sight of god to obey god rather than man they treat those whose consciences oblige them to dissent from them with the same contempt which themselves had received from the roman government  thus far they are upon even terms as to obedience to their superiors  the dissenters have the first occasion after this to show their submission under extraordinary pressures queen elizabeth discountenanced them continually and as good a queen as she was put some of them to death king james i hunted them quite out of the kingdom made thousands of them fly into holland and germany and at last to new england  during the long reign of these two princes we find no charge of treason or rebellion upon them they bore the displeasure of their princes with patience and passive obedience if i may be allowed that ridiculous phrase being persecuted in one city they fled to another they bore illegal prosecutions and things contrary to their right as english men but never took up arms against their prince  under the reign of king charles i the case altered the king and parliament fell out about matters of civil right and invasion of the liberty and properties of the people the puritans or dissenters call them what we please fell in unanimously with the parliament  and here it is worthy remark that the first difference between the king and the english parliament did not respect religion but civil property nor were the majority of the house of puritans but true church protestants and english men who stood upon the rights of the people as english men and none were more zealous in the first disputes than the lord digby sir thomas wentworth and such as were afterward deep sufferers for the king  but the parliament finding the puritan party stuck close to their cause they also came over to them when things came to a rupture and so the war begun on the score of right invasion of liberty breach of he laws private leagues and male administration a game we have seen played over again by the very same church of england that have exclaimed so much against it so damned it and so damned themselves by oaths declarations tests and god knows what against it  it is allowed here the puritan broke through his loyalty and his former obedience and fought his way to the liberty he demanded well the war ended to his advantage he subdued his sovereign and brought him to the block to the astonishment of the whole world  i wont dispute here which or which party did or did not do it but to give the enemy all just advantage i am willing to grant it in the largest sense that the dissenters or phanaticks or whigs call them as you please did embrue their hands in the blood of the lords anointed put to death that blessed martyr king charles the i whom a learned divine in a sermon on the  0th of january before the parliament compares both in the manner of his sufferings and the people by whom to our savior and the jews and boldly runs on in the blasphemous parallel to show that the indignities and sufferings of king charles exceed those of jesus christ  i think i have granted as largely as a fair adversary can desire for i have yielded for peacesake to several things which i could fairly disprove  nor shall i return to a repitition of the ill usage the dissenters have received from the contrary party on this account for above  0 years the constant reproaches they and their children after them have met with from those gentlemen who on all occasions have as i hinted before particularly taken care to extol their own unshaken fidelity to their prince till at last an occasion presents to touch them in the same most sensible part their right and property and alas their loyalty what became of it truly the faithful passively obedient vnshakenly loyal church returned to the original nature of their neighbors and did the same thing exactly which the whigs the factious rebellious whigs had done before  no that is false says a disciple of dr sherlocks we did not kill our king we did not dip our hands in royal blood nor hurt the lords anointed  no that is true but the lords anointed may thank himself for that for my part i think the difference only lies here the whigs in    to    took up arms against their king and having conquered him and taken him prisoner cut off his head because they had him the church of england took arms against their king in    and did not cut off his head because they had him not king charles lost his life because he did not run away and his son king james saved his life because he did run away  it is such a jest such a banter to say we did take up arms but we did not kill him bless us kill our king we would not have hurt a hair of his head why every bullet shot at the battle of the boyne was a killing the king for if you did not twas because you could not hit him  if a highwayman fires at you upon the road when he is taken and brought upon his trial our learned recorder before he pronounces sentence of death barangues him in this manner and besides all this sir you are plainly guilty of murder for you not only assaulted this honest man in order to take away his money but you endeavored to murder him for you shot at him in order to kill him and the intention of murder is equally criminal in the eyes of god with the act it self  now who did we shoot at at the boyne it is true king james generally stood out of the way but who did we shoot at what was our orders to sight against both small and great and not against the king of israel had your bullets commission to show their loyalty and not to touch the lords anointed if he had charged in the first squadrons of his horse had you not killed him if you could i think this need no further proof  nay if arguments may be allowed to have equal weight on both sides the whigs have been the honester of the two for they never professed any such blind absolute and undisputed obedience to princes as the others have done  it has always been their opinion that government was originally contrived by the consent and for the mutual benefit of the parties governed that the people have an original native right to their property the liberty of their persons and possessions unless forefaulted to the laws that they cannot be divested of this right but by their own consent and that all invasion of this right is destructive of the constitution and dissolves the compact of government and obedience  they have always declared that they understand their allegiance to their governors to be supposing they govern them according to the laws of the land and that if princes break this bond of government the nature of it is inverted and the constitution ceases of course  buchanan in scotland algernoon sidney in england have set their names and the latter his blood to this doctrine and the author of the trueborn englishman is worth quoting in the case the governments ungirt when justice dies and constitutions are nonentities the nations all a mob there is no such thing as lords or commons parliament or king a great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies till laws revive and mutual contract ties a chaos free to choose for their own share what case of government they please to wear if to a king they do the reigns commit all men are bound in conscience to submit but then that king must by his oath assent to postulatas of the government which if he breaks he cuts off the entail and power retreats to its original trueborn englishman p     this has been the avowed doctrine of the dissenters and is indeed the true sense of the constitution it self pursuant to this doctrine they thought they had a right to oppose violence with force believing that when kings break coronation oaths the solemn compact with their people and encroach upon their civil rights contrary to the laws of the land by which they are sworn to rule they cease to be the lords anointed any longer the sanction of their office is vanished and they become tyrants and enemies of mankind and may be treated accordingly  now it is no wonder to find people of these principles vigorously withstanding their governors when they tread upon the tender fore places of the constitution it is nothing but what they all along pretended to and declared to be their opinion  but to find the church of englandmen whose loyalty has been the subject of a thousand learned authors and numberless sermons whose character and mark of distinction has been chosen more for her steady adherence and fidelity to her prince than to god almighty whose obedience to her monarchs has been declared to be inviolate and immovable and who pretends to be famous through the whole world for their faithfulness to kings for her as soon as ever the king did but as it were seem to aim at crushing her authority as soon as he did but begin to call her clergy to an account and clap up her golden candlesticks for disobedience for her to winch and kick fly to foreign princes for protection and rise in arms against her prince o pelin o brady o sherlock o hominem o mores  where is the worthy dr b  ges loyalty now his immovable loyalty that after all his absolute submission is so far from being a martyr to his own doctrine that he could not lose a small benefice for it  where is the famous dr s  k who having stood out long in his old antiquated doctrine of passive obedience and confirmed the faith of his suffering brethren by strong and wonderful arguments at last at the powerful instigation of a wife and a good sallary has sold all his loyalty for a mess of pottage solving his honesty with the wretched distinction of a power de facto and a power de jure as if the church of englands credit could be saved by such an impotent shift or as if he could make amends to the prebendary for his helping him to sacrifice his brethren to father his conversion upon reading honest dr overall whose doctrine it is well known the doctor knew before but that he was loath dr south should have the honor of bringing him over to such old phanatick principles  behold the loyalty of the church of england now let us examine their conscience as to taking oaths and if i do not bring them to be all vvhigs and fortyonemen or else prove them all perjured then i do nothing  the clergy all the magistrates and officers of the household of the civil or military government were members of the church of england otherwise they could not be employed the sacramental test has done the dissenters this kindness that it is plain all the managing hands in the kingdom were disciples of the church and as an additional circumstance the oath of allegiance which they took and which was god be praised of their own making bound them to that same absolute blind obedience which they professed and confined it to the king his heirs and successors  if this oath be considered literally i am content to be silenced when one fair argument can be brought to evade it the declaration followed it wherein they detest and abhor that devilish doctrine that it is lawful on any pretense whatsoever mark the emphasis to take up arms against the king this equal to an oath is declared in the presence of god and the particulars being material to our purpose are as follows i a b do declare and believe that it is not lawful upon any pretense whatsoever to take up arms against the king and that i do abhor that traitorous position of taking arms by his authority against those that are commissioned by him  so help me god  notwithstanding this you have taken up arms against deposed and as far as you were able put to death your lawful king the very king you swore allegiance to  now pray gentlemen give commission to some worthy champion of your churchs loyalty to bring you fairly off of your oath and declaration if you can and till you do be not angry with us for making one of these conclusions from the premises and you shall choose for your selves  first that this doctrine of absolute passive and nonresistant obedience is an absurdity in it self contradictory to the nature of government and allegiance and politically introduced by state engines into the church of england to abuse her and betray her members into unforeseen mischiefs and inconveniences  or secondly that the members of the church of england are all apostates from the very fundamental doctrine of their church perjured in the sight of god and man notorious hypocrites and deceivers who having sworn obedience without reserve to their prince are become traitors rebels and murderers of the lords anointed and their lawful sovereign and not having the fear of god before their eyes have deposed and traitorously dethroned their rightful king god almightys vicegerent accountable to no earthly power supreme under god absolute and from divine institution undoubted sole lord of them and their country  or lastly that they only are the true church of england who according to their avowed profession have firmly adhered to their king in all his sufferings and solitude have never blackened their consciences nor gone back from their obedience forgotten their oaths nor fullied their reputation with the horrid crimes of treason and rebellion as they think it to be  now as a fair disputant i am willing the respondent shall choose which of these three consequences he will stand by in behalf of the church of englands loyalty but if they would take the advice of a friend to the honest part of them i would recommend the first conclusion to be fittest for them for the following reason    because since humane infallibility is and with good reason disowned by the church of england both for her self and every body else it can be no diminution to her reputation when she has found her self mistaken and imposed upon to acknowledge her error a wise man will always own rather than defend a mistake    because it is my opinion that their way is hedged up against any other pretense evasion or reservation and therefore it is with me the only thing that charity can say for them and must remain so till i find something else said that is more to the purpose  but the mischief of all is that if this be honestly acknowledged as is doubtless most true that the church of england was mistaken and imposed upon to espouse a senseless absurd principle contrary to the nature of government and allegiance etc why then they come over to this consequence  that government and allegiance are both conditional and oaths of subjects are always to be considered in a constructive sense with conditions of protection and the like a thing which is without question the real meaning of all oaths of allegiance otherwise subjects may be put under an absolute necessity of perjury or state martyrdom by often swearing what may be impossible for them to perform  the town of aeth in flanders has been about   times and the town of rhinebergh in gueldre about    times taken and retaken and as often as new masters had possession of the place so often the poor inhabitants have sworn to their new lords what can the meaning of such an oath be but that they will be faithful to them so long as they keep possession of the place twoud be ridiculous to imagine the imposers of the oath required any more  if our zealous churchmen worded an oath contrary to the very nature of swearing allegiance let them answer for it who first made it then took it then broke it but the nature of the thing can leave room for no other suggestion that i know of  till then some further argument is produced it must rest here that the church of england was mistaken imposed upon etc that she finds when the laws are broken the right of the people invaded the root of the government struck at church and state undermined and dispotick tyranny at the door the native right of the people is superior and they may assume a power to right themselves  and so we are brought back to whiggism and    and gentlemen there is no remedy for it help it if you can  where now is the difference between church loyalty and whiggish loyalty roundhead or cavalier churchman or dissenter whig or tory all are alike they are pleased when legally governed quarrelsome and unruly if oppressed and will defend themselves if assaulted though it be by their kings or any body else  why then is the difference kept up methinks they might all be friends together for they are all alike the dissenters have been in their times as loyal and the church of england in their time as disloyal as one another vice versa the dissenters have been as disloyal and the churchmen as loyal as one another upon the same occasion they have been both sufferers and have submited to the government ay and to the oppressions and persecutions of their superiors and sovereigns and again upon the like occasions they have both of them been rebels if their own language may so far be used they have both of them in their turn taken arms against and deposed their rightful and lawful kings  so that in my opinion with a latitude to all that think otherwise to think as they please the church of england and their neighbors the dissenters have nothing to quarrel with one another about as to loyalty as to other matters i have nothing to say to them nor shall not mingle it with this discourse  nor do i think i am writing a satyr against the church of england nor is it at all intended to be so and to stop all pretenses that way i take the freedom to say here has been no crime the church of england has been in the right of it not in taking arms but the error was in espousing crying up and pretending to a blind absolute obedience to princes be their commands never so absolute tyrannical or illegal this neither the doctrine nor practice of the church of england nor of any church or people in the christian world ever pretended to and therefore the fault lay in those people who being themselves members of the church of england suffered themselves to be deluded by stateministers to foster a tenent upon the church which her original constitution never pretended to and then call it the doctrine of the church of england  the first beginning of their pretended doctrine was found in manwarings and sibthorps libels in the days of king charles i cajoling the king and then to please him endeavoring to wheedle the people into a belief of the divine right of kingly government and affirming that the king was not obliged by the laws in the administration of the government  upon this preposterous foundation they built the illegitimate structure of absolute undisputed obedience for if kingly power were once proved to be immediately derived from divine authority absolute obedience would be a consequence no body could dispute since the same obedience without reserve would be due to the delegated power as to the power delegating  and though this is a point easily enough confuted yet being willing to keep the present dispute within as small a compass as we can i think our argument has nothing at all to do with it  whether government be of divine original or not seems not the question here for if it be not so then as before the church of england have been mistaken and imposed upon and if it be so then the church of england has trampled underfoot their own doctrine turned rebels to god and apostates from the faith they have professed have sacrilegiously and traitorously taken up arms against their prince assaulted the lords anointed resisted the powers which are the ordinance of god deposed their lawful sovereign broken their allegiance and consequently are a parcel of perjured rebels every jot as bad as the worst roundhead regicide and rebel of the year forty one  what more or less can be said i profess i know not and am in great expectation of something new in the matter for i cannot find in all the writings i have met with any thing to contradict it  the bringing government and obedience to the proper circumstances of mutual compact between king and people seems to me to be the only method to unravel this skein of entangld principles the nature of government has made it the necessary consequence of all argument relating to power and i could give instances in all the nations in the world that some time or other even the right of succession to government which must be as sacred as the power has been interrupted and limited by the people in case of tyranny and illegal governing and every nation and this among the rest have often times deposed their princes for the preservation of the state when either incapacity for government tyrannical usurpation or other maladministration has been the case  but this i think also needless here every one that is versed in history can read the numerous examples in the roman grecian and persian histories even sacred histories where kings were more particularly of divine right than any where are full of them the histories of spain portugal france lombardy the empires of germany and muscovy even the papal chair have suffered convulsions and revolutions the deposing and displacing their sovereigns when the peoples good which is and ever was the soul the center the end and the cause of all government came to be in the dispute  but to return to the principles of the two parties we are now discoursing of the whigs as before have always asserted this to be their notion of government and governors and the church of england however some among them have topt an empty notion upon them have all along and now at last once for all owned it by their practice  that kings when they descend to tyranny dissolve the bond and leave the subject free true born eng man page    the act for the further limitation of the crown past in the last parliament and the right of the people therein declared and recognized i would ask my opponent whose act and deed it was will they say it was a whiggish act made by a phanatical house of commons i dare say there was not ten dissenters in the house let them descend with us into particulars let them draw out a black list of members who in that loyal honest english parliament gave their hands to the last settlement and declaration of right and let us tell nos and put a brand upon the phanaticks among them  will they tell us it was a phanatical parliament that set the crown upon the queens head i hope they will own her majesty and their lordships the bishops are part of the church of england for if the head and the principle members are not we know not who are  will they tell us that sir e s sir b s sir j b mr h  y sir c  r m   and a hundred more of that side were whigs and commonwealth men  how comes it to pass in england that no papist can inherit divine right ought to supercede all precautions and the young prince of savoy not the house of hannover ought to reign with a non obstante to all humane limitation if all was from heaven where are our rightlinemen now why truly the reason is plain the church of england people of england a church of england parliament of england have thought fit to declare that for the good of the people to which all right of succession to power must give way because from them all power it self does derive and by the voice of that people in which authority sufficient is legally grounded it is unanimously agreed that we will not have a papist to reign over us  all this is too plain to admit of a dispute and now to me it seems preposterous why any men should keep up the distinction between parties as to loyalty when indeed there is no manner of difference in the case  i have talked several times of bearing suffering being persecuted and oppressed as the dissenters in their time have been more than enough and again in their turn the church of england have been persecuted too for as i noted before they were once the schismatics the whigs and the dissenters now i think it is not very foreign to my argument to examine whether of the two behaved themselves under their sufferings with the greatest submission who showed most absolute obedience to their superiors and who first or oftnest rebelled against their lawful sovereign  the protestants under henry viii were the first dissenters they were kept under persecuted and put to death as rebels and schismatics now upon due search it will be sound that under the protection of two protestant queens wives of king henry viii they had more than once formed such interest at court and in the kingdom as to begin to be formidable to the popish powers then reigning and the fall of the lord cromwell was thought a necessary policy in king henry to prevent the plots of the phanatical church of england heretics a long account of which may be read in the life of that prince  king edward the vi a zealous and pious prince made no scruple for the propagation of the protestant church of england of which he was the glorious founder to set aside the lawful and undisputed succession of his own sisters to establish the crown in the lady jane gray who he knew would carry on the work of reformation  there is an instance of the zeal for succession in the right line in the first protestant head that ever the church of england had  after this the gospellers that is the church of england protestants of suffolk having some sense of injury done to the princess mary and willing to have the succession go on in the right line provided they could both preserve their religion and loyalty too capitulate with her and promise to stand by her provided she would promise to preserve and make no alteration in their established church of england  here the church of england men owned the liberty of their religion to be superior to their loyalty to her and that they had a right to submit or not to submit as their liberty was or was not secure and accordingly conditioned with her before they would acknowledge her to be their queen  and we see how heaven punished them for venturing on the word of a prince when their religion and liberty was at stake  in this queens time the church having been again suppressed and popery erected sir thomas wyatt an honest church of england protestant with a very good body of men took up arms against their lawful prince for breaking her word in defense of their dear religion established by blessed king edward which were the very words of the manifesto they published the londoners with  00 men sent by the queen against them thought it no treachery to desert their lawful popish queen and go over to their protestant church of england brethren  we have nothing to do with the justification of this fact it is sufficient that so it was and that these were protestants of the church of england in the first and purest part of their principles and let them justify the fact if they please  queen elizabeth succeeds and then the church of england shone in its meridian glory and then grew up some who aiming as i said before at a further reformation and the church refusing to hearken to it formed a new party of dissenters and those were called puritans and since that phanaticks  now i challenge the defender of this cause to tell me one dissoyal act one plot against the government one disturbance of the civil peace among these dissenters from the beginning of this queen which was their own beginning to the reign of king charles i which was a continued term of  0 years and yet during this time they suffered all manner of indignities reproaches finings imprisonings banishment confiscations and corporal punishments  so that hitherto the passive obedience of the dissenters has far exceeded that of the church of england these had but five years oppression under queen mary and in that five years they once capitulated with their sovereign to make her queen upon conditions and once took arms against her after she was queen and by that i must always understand that if they did not depose and destroy her it was because they could not and if they had done it no doubt they had cause sufficient to justify them before god and man the puritans after this suffered all that their too cruel brethen of the church of england laid upon them during three tedious reigns before they so much as made the least offer at doing themselves justice and for  0 years together exercised that passive obedience which they never pretended to  a last they took arms and when they did they did it to purpose carried all before them subdued monarchy cut off their kings head and all that  after the restoration things began to return to their old chae and  0 years more the dissenters endured another egyptian servitude were persecuted plundered indicted imprisoned plagued with impositions stigmatized with a thousand reproaches their meeting houses demolished their estates confiscated their persons excommunicated and anathamatisd sworn into plots they never heard of and into crimes they never committed dragged to goals gibbets and scaffolds pand the like all this while passive obedience if there were any such thing was found among them more than any where else for here was no rebellions no insurrection nor breaking of the peace by the dissenters notwithstanding all these oppositions  after this comes king james the second to the crown and he turned the scale and together with invasion of liberty falls upon the church begins to rifle her of her trophies for no essentials had been touched and how long did she bear it not  0 years not 0 years no not so many months  what did she do truly nothing but what she ought to have done defend her liberty and religion by force against unjust invasion and tyranny nothing but what all the nations in the world have done and would do again if they could  the only error we charge upon the church of england was setting up pretenses of what they really would not practice crying up themselves for fools when we knew they were wiser men calling themselves humble slaves but when the trial came proving stubborn refractory libertymongers even as bad as the worst whig or phanatick of them all  for the future then if a humble moderator might be permited to give advice to the gentlemen of the church of england it should be in these short and friendly terms  pray gentlemen never be imposed upon to pretend to more loyalty and more slavish principles than you intend to practice  never pretend to more obedience than your sovereign requires our late king who i am not ashamed to show as a pattern for future ages required and her present majesty without affront to her majestys authority it may be said requires no further obedience from the people of england than the laws of england requires  to govern according to law is a full satisfaction to the people and to obey according to law is a full satisfaction to the sovereign the laws are the test both of the royal authority and of
