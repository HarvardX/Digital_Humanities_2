a new method of curing the apoplexy  with an appendix containing some observations upon the use and abuse of physic  by john catherwood m d  juvatque novos decerpere flores  lucret london printed by j darby for w tailor at the ship in paternoster row j brown without temple bar and edward simon at the black bull in cornhill mdccxv  to the college of physicians the following discourse of arteriotomy and the misapplication of medicines being a subject of no little moment to the welfare of mankind i submit it entirely to your severest censure as being the best judges both of the nature and force of my arguments i ask no favor for if i am wrong favor to me would be cruelty to the rest of the world and if i am right then certainly you who do justice to every body will not deny it to  gentlemen your most humble and most obedient servant john catherwood  preface a man who offers to the world any thing not before known or not generally understood must expect to meet with two sorts of adversaries who will not fail to assault him tho they are as inconsistent with each other as with the truth that is to say some people will deny the invention as either not practicable or not useful whilst others at the same time who are convinced of the worth of it will tell you that it was long before known and practiced and that you must not challenge to your self the glory thus our immortal harvey when he happily discovered the circulation of the blood was attacked on both sides and tho i will not pretend to compare what i here offer with his noble discovery yet it will not he despised when it is considered that the circulation of the blood is a speculation not so immediately useful as what you have in the following sheets which is to rescue men in the agony of death  they who say the opening an artery is not to be practiced but in extraordinary cases own it to be a remedy when all others fail but at the same time would not have it practiced till all remedies are too late  they who say this is an operation used of old will not i hope quarrel with me for preferring the antiquity of truth before the novelty of error at least i will not quarrel with them being much more intent upon doing service to mankind than acquiring reputation to my self  they who alledg that evacuation by an artery makes a greater expense of spirits than by a vein will find themselves so fully confuted in the following treatise that i need say nothing more here in short i take the great and sacred rule of physic to be the observation of nature and her dictates quo natura tendit now i would ask my adversaries to produce one instance where nature ever relieved her self by a vein and if there he no instance of it then to use that vessel is to cross nature thus we see that the vast quantity of blood which often issues from the nose as well as the great discharge by the piles as they are vulgarly called is still arterial blood but the most notable instance is the menstruous blood in women which sometimes flows from em in streams to an unknown quantity and is discharged from the arteries in the uterus and vagina whereas should it proceed from the veins it would be impossible for em to subsist under it  it is plain therefore that the doctrine i advance is agreeable to the dictates of nature and if nature be for me i dont much care who is against me  a new method of curing apoplexies and other distempers of the head notwithstanding the various treatises that have been writ by learned and ingenious men as well ancient as modern on this subject which have been handled with the greatest accurateness as to the theory yet for the method of treating it through the whole course particularly at its first appearance i find nothing writ more foreign from the purpose for by bleeding out of the veins and other usual methods of practice they prey upon and exhaust the animal spirits and confirm the distemper rather than relieve the patient  but not to detain the reader with the measures others have taken and still persist in i shall only offer my own thoughts and the method by which for some years past i have found such happy success as well in flanders as elsewhere confirmed by a few observations therefore without any further introduction i shall just describe this disease and proceed  it is then an apoplexy when the body is suddenly deprived of the chief animal faculties as well internal as external and all voluntary motion so that the animal spirits are either denied a passage from the brain or an entrance into it the ventricles or pores of the brain being either compressed from a contusion or obstructed from a plethora poisons medicines endued with a narcotic faculty which so alter the blood lymph and other fluids as to render em unfit to pass freely through the arteries of the brain whereby through the violent impetus of of the heart the blood is so wedged in that it causes a stagnation and oftentimes polypuses are formed in the carotids sinuss and vertebral arteries so that all the spirits indulgent nature can rally to support the fabric are detached to the muscles of the thorax to perform respiration without which the patient is inevitably lost  now since the brain is the seat of this disease twill not be at all improper to take notice of its structure as well as its use before i proceed any farther there are then two substances which constitute the brain viz the cinericious being the exterior called the cortical the inner from its whiteness and softness the medullary the former of which according to malpigius is nothing but a gland of the conglomerate kind or a heap of small oval glands contiguous with each other to each of which is affixed an artery that brings the blood by the means of which glands the matter constituting the animal spirits is secernd from its purer and subtler parts from hence the veins carry back the refluent blood that is unfit for generating of spirits and then the nerve or root of a nerve in which as in an excretory duct of a gland the spirits just now perfected are carried into the medullary substance as a storehouse or magazine and from thence through the whole nervous system for the benefit of conveying sense and motion to the animal economy  now since not only the cortical substance of the brain but the medullary also and even the nerves themselves are interspersed with an infinite number of excessive small blood vessels whatever causes an obstruction in them or makes em too turgid causes an apoplexy in some degree or other by pressing on the nerves and so preventing the circulation of their fluid  to diminish then the quantity of blood from the veins is what all have had immediate recourse to as their chief refuge and asylum either from the frontal jugular cephalic or mediana for a revulsion whereas that is now exploded the laws of circulation not admitting it and if this did not answer their expectation the patient was given over as in a desperate case according to this of hippocrates speaking of an apoplexy venae sectio ni juvet occidet or this of celsus to the same purpose sanguinis detractio vel occidit vel liberat which is enough to convince us how prejudicial such evacuations from the veins were found and how uncertain the practice was observed to be even by the ancients tho for want of a better it has unhappily been persisted in to this present time  twas indeed in many cases frequently used by the ancients but now become so much in vogue that it is ordered almost on all occasions except in cachectic persons or those grown hydropical by impoverished blood diseases contracted by hunger fatigue etc  let the obstruction be where it will tho at the fingers end opening a vein must relieve it i cannot indeed wonder that the ancients did it being in a manner strangers to anatomy and knowing nothing of the circulation of the blood but since by the indefatigable industry of the moderns that part of learning is arrived to such perfection i admire there is not more notice taken of the inconveniences that attend phlebotomy but it is past over as an operation to be attempted by any person at any season regard being only had to the strength of the patient touching of the nerve tendon or its aponeurosis  but if by an obstruction apoplexies or any distemper incident to the head is caused to make a more copious evacuation and speedy derivation the discharge must be made by opening the jugulars which operation falls so far short of their intention that it proves far more dismal in its consequences by so much the more effectually confirming the obstruction by how much the nearer the ligatures approach the part affected  experienced surgeons indeed will use no ligature round the neck for fear of suffocation in apoplexies and squinanceys but only let a standerby compress the jugular on the contrary side with his thumb and fix their own just below the place where they design their aperture but too many use ligatures and either apply the middle of the fillet behind the neck the two ends being brought before and twisted or turn one end over one clavicle and under the contrary axilla and so the two ends are brought before and fastened both which are very pernicious particularly the latter which by pressing on the axillary vein stops the refluent blood by which besides confirming the obstruction as before mentioned syncopes palpitations tremors and the like are caused for whatever thwarts or crosses the circular progress of the blood produces these effects  but even bleeding in the arm the tediousness of the operation is such and the advantage that can be expected from it so small i can by no means be reconciled to for first the ligature must be strained in order to cause the veins to swell for the more commodious introducing the lancet which perhaps after all requires the surgeons frictions to force the blood to the intended incision and this is not sufficient but often there must be hot clothes and the arm plunged in hot water and then when the aperture is made by the misapplication of the bandage the skin relaxes the orifice closes and obstructs its passage and when the impetuosity of the blood abates the ligature is again slackened that as much blood may pass into that part by the arteries as will suffice for the intended evacuation during which time the obstruction is confirming for the blood in the veins steers an easy course from narrower passages to broader channels through their soft tunicles quite different from those of the arteries whose coats being elastic particularly in the large trunks give a velocity to the blood which if intercepted causes the blood to be so turgid in the capillary vessels of the brain even to extravasate and obstructs the spirits in the sensorium commune the first course of all nervous distempers as palsies cramps convulsions apoplexies emaciations and insensible decays without any visible cause that it would even pose persons of the best judgment to account for it as also that chronical distemper the hydrocephalus or watery humor in the head which proceeds from extravasated lymph occasioned by the compression of the lymphatics  what has been said will be sufficient to convince any unprejudiced person of the inconveniences that attend phlebotomy if we reflect on the first rise of this operation twill not much heighten our esteem of it pliny in his natural history tells a whimsical story of the hyppopotamus or seahorse who when he finds himself heavy or indisposed seeks out the sharpest pointed thorn with which he pricks a certain vein of the leg and after a quantity of blood is drawn stops the wound with mud a very poor precedent that we are obliged to have recourse to for this operation  but all the proposed ends will be answered by opening an artery tho i am well assured this hypothesis will be exploded by the greatest part of the faculty it being not only what is uncommon but also their being unacquainted how the operation is to be performed and the hazard of attempting it will occasion the following objections to render this method trifling and inconsiderable  some fancy with celsus that an artery once cut by reason of its systole and diastole from the solution of its fibers cannot again consolidate and grow together but forms a thrombus  others have had stupidity enough to affirm that those vessels must be past through with a needle and thread in order to reunite them  again there are those who will allow of it in some cases yet own that they contract retire within the flesh are cicatrized there and so cease from their office of conveying blood to that part  there are also some that after they have been prevailed upon to acknowledge the possibility of their reunion yet still object against the inconveniences of bandages which must necessarily be continued for several days  but when these objections have been answered by ocular demonstration they will undertake to prove that the blood in the arteries and that of the veins does not in the least differ in their component parts and that both being continued tubes it matters not out of which the evacuation is made whereas there is no greater difference between the fluid contained in the lympheducts and nerves than between that in the veins and arteries that of the arteries being of a more lively florid scarlet color more subtle and spiritous and the vehicle that conveys the alimentary or nutritious particles which in their progressive motion press upon those glands whose pores are adapted to admit of such juices as serve either for accretion nutrition or reparation whereas the venal being only the refuse of those secretions returns to the heart that so by filling its coronary vessels and ventricles it may be enabled to perform its motion of contraction and dilatation which if its reflux be intercepted by bandages it must necessarily be deprived of and consequently such effects are produced as before mentioned so that this objection is as trifling and frivolous as the rest  these being so easily answered another unanswerable objection is started viz that that branch which we durst attempt to draw blood from is so small as not to admit of a plentiful discharge  but the most powerful argument to answer all these objections is demonstration i have used this method in all cases where diminishing the quantity of blood is required whether in apoplexies quinancies inflammations of the lungs pleurisies asthmas in all sorts of fevers whether intermitting continual or malignant without the least mischievous accident attending it but this precaution must be used that it be such an artery as immediately passes over a bone which are none but those of the head and of these the temporal artery is the principal it being the most considerable branch of the carotid which passing over the os temporale admits of a double compress this may be opened with less danger and with far greater success than any vein and i have frequently seen it run with as continued a stream as from the arm  by this time there is no room to doubt but the chief difficulties are removed and because so few are accustomed to this operation i shall just mention how it is performed which is thus press your finger on the vessel above the place where you design your aperture and your thumb on the said vessel beneath to keep the skin smooth and the vessel from rolling then introduce your lancet raising up its point to cut through the vessels and teguments but not by punction as too many do in opening the veins by which means you may make as plentiful a discharge as you please without being liable to the aforementioned inconveniences that attend phlebotomy  after which you have nothing else to do than to place your thumb on the orifice and press it against the os temporale so that if a thrombus should arise it is soon dispersed and in a few minutes the lips of the orifice will unite this done you may either use a pledgit of lint with a plaster or if you please the compress with the circular bandage which is sufficient without the least occasion of styptics  this aperture gives an immediate check to the impetuous velocity of the ascending blood which by the systole or contraction of the heart is projected to the head by the carotids and vertebral arteries and by means of their semilunary valves prevent its return to the heart by the same vessels so that in an instant it relieves the patient without preventing the blood lymph and nervous fluid from performing their circular tour which by ligatures must necessarily be intercepted  suppose several springs send out as many rivulets which after various turnings and windings unite and form a river which is received in a basin wherein an engine is fixed which with its repeated projectile force throws the water into several tubes in order to be conveyed to and supply all parts of a city now should there be an obstruction in the pipes the engineer may as well expect to remove it by diverting and diminishing the water in the rivulets by a different current as a physician may expect to remove an obstruction in the arteries by ordering bleeding out of the veins  but there is no occasion to introduce similies to prove what is so very obvious  it is the part of a physician to assist nature by observing nicely the various steps she takes to repulse the enemy natura curat morbos says celsus the dogmatist that can reason learnedly on a disease but has not thoroughly considered the nature of it and the method of cure falls far short of a mere empyric who practices only by experience without any foundation of learning so that it is not the being a learned philosopher an accurate anatomist that entitles a man to be a great physician that successful practitioner dr radcliff never pretended to any of these qualifications nay took a pleasure to disown his knowledge in them but who in his time so happy to strike at the root of a distemper  the father of physic hippocrates when the art was in its infancy especially that part of it anatomy how ignorant was he of some parts of learning that the moderns glory in and value themselves upon as appears from the confused account he gives that the veins take their rise from the liver and speaking of an artery he means the aspera arteria and then calls the ureters veins and makes a jumble of nerves veins and arteries but then who so great and successful a practitioner ever before or since  tho i am not unsensible that several authors have touched on this subject yet what first induced me to the opinion of arteriotomy was that i dont remember ever to have read or heard of women liable to apoplexies unless from poisons opiates or mismanagement of some foregoing distemper for however authors differ in their several hypotheses laid down to account for the periodical purgations of women whether this menstruous blood offends in quantity or quality it matters not to my present purpose but whenever this effervescence is raised whether natural periodical or provoked by emenagogues it occasions an aperture of the mouths of the vaginal arteries and not of the veins  the haemorroides or piles by some vicious ferment irritating the tender fibers of the arteries by them is discharged incredible quantities of blood borellus relates a story of a certain tailor who lost ten pounds by those vessels and yet recovered  how many instances have we had of profuse haemorrhagies of the nose bartholin mentions one who bled forty eight pound in three days without the loss of life it is well known that bleeding at the nose removes obstructions and pains of the head whether proceeding from an ebullition or redundancy of blood and whence is this discharge but by an anastomosis or spontaneous disjoining of the capillary arteries occasioned by a convulsive contraction of the coats of a larger artery which must necessarily give an extraordinary distention to the next till the blood can be no longer contained but bursts out with impetuosity even to pounds whereas a few ounces discharged by the veins has thrown the patient into faintings swoonings and occasioned even death it self  now since indulgent nature is so clear in her dictates points out an exact method how we may free her from the insults of the common enemy diseases it is unreasonable we should not fall in with her measures  by this time i hope any unprejudiced reader will be reconciled to arteriotomy and not be byasd by custom to prefer that of phlebotomy  phlebotomy preceding the next intention is exhibiting emetics which from observation i shall prove to be so far from relieving the patient that it proves very pernicious  for before the vomit is administered it is easy to suppose to what a degree the glands of the brain are filtrated and perhaps the sanguiferous vessels and lymphatics burst this extravasated blood and lymph discharged into the sinuss of the brain and there coagulated and lodged what relief can possibly be expected from an emetick which is diametrically opposite to their former intention of bleeding out of the jugulars for in this there is some color of reason to expect the removal of the obstruction from that there is no room to hope for any thing but a confirmation of the distemper nor truly in any other disease unless when the principal seat is in the stomach and intestines to discharge the morbific matter collected in the primae viae then an emetic is not altogether unseasonable tho even then other measures may be taken less hazardous and equally advantageous but in this case vomits are as contrary to true practice as this operation to nature the fibers of the stomach being so disposed as to discharge its contents through the intestines but by these irritating vomits the diaphragm intercostals and muscles of the lower belly are so stimulated that by means of their violent contraction they force em through the oesophagus for what with the violent convulsive motion of the abovesaid muscles together with the quickness of the organs of respiration the blood is precipitately hurried and projected to the brain with that force as to increase the extravasation how then it is possible reasonably to expect relief from it i cannot conjecture an ancient physician speaking of an apoplexy and its cure lays down this as a rule vomitoria fugienda ne suffocationis periculum augeatur et caput repleatur nay in his purgatives he would not allow the least quantity of antimony it being also endued with a vomiting faculty antimonium non convenit cum vomitum simul moveat such sort of irritating medicines being sufficient of themselves to produce apoplexies  and i for my part verily believe that were the bills of mortality nicely examined into and the causes of those casualties strictly inquired after they would be found more owing to the irregular administration of improper medicines than to any peccant matter in the fluids or any external cause whatever  what i have said i shall only confirm with two or three observations and that as concisely as possible  obs   there was one mr roach of bristol who for a long time had labored under an asthma attended with a violent cough till almost suffocated but after he had expectorated this viscid phlegm was relieved but the disease increasing and despairing of relief he applied himself to me informed me he had been so afflicted for many years that at spring and fall he had very severe fits of the gout so that what with one and the other he was rendered incapable of prosecuting any business i exhibited medicines of a warm attenuating kind to disentangle and carry off the vicious matter promote expectoration fortify the stomach and lungs which effectually completed the cure after which he could endure the fatigue either of walking or riding was able to dispatch his affairs with his usual alacrity and pleasure but since my removal from bristol his old indisposition returning afresh he had immediate recourse to his former chipinpottage doctor that safe physician that never did him any good nor hurt till he prescribed that innocent harmless vomit that extolled indian root ipecacoanna which he had no sooner taken with a draught of carduus tea but presently he complained of a dizziness and that every thing appeared to him to have a circular motion which he had no sooner said but he dropped down dead  some may imagine that this accident was not owing entirely to the emetic but a plethora and had bleeding preceded in order to have emptied the vessels the patient might have been saved which objection tho i could answer with several instances i shall only mention one  obs   mr snow a broker of about seventy years of age being on the exchange was taken with a violent fit of an apoplexy and fell down as dead but by means of cordials after some time began a little to recover by which time a surgeon came and took away about sixteen ounces of blood from the arm i being accidentally introduced by a friend who desired my advice prevented his taking away a greater quantity but ordered that he might be carried home in a chair which motion contributed mightily to a free and uninterrupted circulation insomuch that he began to have a regular pulse i advised that this motion might be continued finding a natural warmth all over his body which with administering comfortable draughts would be sufficient to answer our end but a certain apothecary coming whose advice was more prevalent with the patients friends administered a vomit under the pretense of a cordial this not immediately operating in less than half a quarter of an hour was about to repeat it which he confidently affirmed would answer his end and to confirm his assertion assured his friends he was that moment come from a gentleman taken after the same manner and relieved by the same method but they had only his own word for it to which i could give but very little credit this poor unhappy gentleman however was lost by this treatment  i could enumerate instances of this kind from my own observation of the ill effects of vomits whether bleeding had preceded or been omitted i shall give one to show that it is safer to rely on nature it self to observe its various steps and endeavor to assist her only with refreshing cardiac draughts than to have recourse to physicians unacquainted with the nature of this disease as too many are tho from persons of such penetrating judgment ready wit and bright parts greater things might be expected  obs   william whittington esquire of stapleton near bristol now high sheriff of the county of gloucester near eighty years of age returning home alone from the city on a gentle pad was seized with an apoplectic fit fell back on his horse his legs stiff and extended and to all appearance dead but being overtaken by some returning from a neighboring market who took care to convey him to an adjacent alehouse where they poured brandy down his throat as also a glass or two of canary by which method together with repeated frictions all over his body he came to himself was sent home in his own chariot where he no sooner came but jocosely called for his staff of life and support of old age meaning a bit of bread and a glass of canary the next day he took a gentle cordial purging draught and without the use of any other medicines recovered only never mist the returning fit twice a year which increased in its violence spring and fall till a violent fever followed the last which he not expecting to conquer sent for me and having before observed what seemed to be most advantageous and by what method nature was most relieved without cramming him with medicines i advised him to nothing but to drink old canary as a ptisan by which alone he was perfectly recovered and ever since has been freed from those kind of fits  not only phlebotomy unseasonable use of emetics but cathartics also if not well adapted to the disease may prove very prejudicial to the patient other diseases mismanaged may and often do terminate in an apoplexy  obs   an inhabitant of bristol that kept a public house on the castlegreen laboring under a dropsy in the abdomen accompanied with an asthma and jaundice being rather the effects than cause of the disease employs a limb of the law that is dwindled to an insignificant branch of physic who assumes the title of doctor tho he is much better qualified for a jackpudding having a genius peculiarly adapted to mimic and attempts to ape that great practitioner dr radcliff in his prognostics assuring his patients that by such a time they need not despair of their being perfectly relieved which generally happens according to his predictions for he seldom fails of curing ing em of all distempers having no less than aescalapius for a precedent who thought it not worth while to attempt prolonging the lives of those that were enfeebled and exhausted lest they should live to beget children as infirm as themselves and so be rendered unfit members for any society he without a long demur pronounces the poor hydropical patient to be in a fair way of recovery gives him great hopes to expect a cure in a few days prescribes your gummy resinous cathartics which rendered the crasis of the blood more unfit for assimilating its serum by weakening digestion and producing crudities which brought on a complete apoplexy that in six hours time after the dose was administered carried off the patient in the place of which had he evacuated the serum by proper remedies prevented its farther increase by fortifying and corroborating the stomach restored and strengthened the crasis of the blood dislodged the viscous matter that adhered to the plicae or folds of the stomach by warm attenuating stomachical specifics the poor unfortunate man might have now been in perfect health  others again mightily rely on the use of clysters and such as are of a sharp acrid irritating nature to relieve those affections of the head epilepsys lethargys palsys apoplexys and the like revulsionis ergo but this method of deriving humors from one place to its opposite is now laid aside as before hinted for in this case the intestines themselves are paralytically affected and will scarce retain a clyster if at that time injected if it does remain it only affects the inteslines and primae viae and is not the least serviceable in averting vapors from the head  cupping and scarifying is wonderfully in vogue with some for the above reasons of revulsion and derivation but the attraction of the cuppingglass has so little effect the number who use them so few and those so inconsiderable it is scarce worth while to spend time to confute such erroneous methods  the next thing that comes to be considered is blisters which too many mightily rely on without reflecting on the ill effects they have in some cases and on some constitutions especially those of a scorbutic habit of body in extreme hot constitutions when for the want of serum the blood boils in old persons whose balsamic particles of the blood are for the most part exhausted and too great a quantity of corrosive serum is left to such the application of blisters does more hurt than good for by the too great action of the caustic salts that enter the pores and insinuate themselves into the mass of blood the parts are so stimulated as to cause violent stranguries voiding of bloody urine forcing also substances of matter resembling fat so large as would be thought incredible to pass through so narrow a passage as that of the vrethra now since the inconvenience that necessarily attends such methods is so great and the advantage that may reasonably be expected from em so small they are fitter for the practice of empirics and scaramouches than regular physicians but i would not tire the readers patience with a long and tedious discourse and shall therefore only add a few more observations and conclude  obs   a cornish man of about thirty six years of age who had been very much addicted to those violent exercises of cudgelling wrestling hurling for which that county during the time of their revels is very remarkable quitting his employ for the more immediate service of his queen and country goes for flanders but being unacquainted with the fatigue of several marches and unaccustomed to take up with such slender fare was seized with a slow lingering fever which terminated in a deprivation of the use of his limbs after which manner he continued in the hospital during the whole campaign at the breaking up of which he was committed to the surgeons care of the respective regiment till the opening of the next campaign and then was again received into the hospital in a much worse condition than when he left it being perfectly emaciated having crusty ulcers on the backs of his hands and on his shinbones resembling venereal nodes the bones also carious several absesses formed on the head with fiery botches or carbuncles occasioned by the sharp caustic lixivious salts with which the blood abounded he fell under my care but all means proving ineffectual he died in a few days i indeed suspected his case at first to be venereal but being a person bearing a good character and protesting he had been at no time conversant with women i thought it would be requisite to endeavor to discover from what cause those direful effects arose in order thereto i first resolved to examine the brain and had no sooner made my incision on the scalp but i perceived the cranium to be foul and carious which in taking it off i found had reached not only the inner lamina but also both meninges and even the cortical substance of the brain in performing which notwithstanding there issued a vast quantity of serum yet in the third ventricle by the glandula pinealis was lodged near a pint of lymph and that so very viscous and ropy as to be denied the least passage in the infundibulum was also an incredible quantity of viscid serum much thicker than the first and the glandula pituitaria filtrated like a cancerated gland this discovery contributed mightily to my satisfaction and twas very evident that the train of this poor fellows misfortunes proceeded not from any venereal cause but from those falls and bruises he had formerly received which when nature was indulged the spirits buoyed up the fibers firm and elastic each part could better perform its function and so prevent the ensuing disease but when reduced to mean diet and scanty allowance exposed to heats and colds inseparable concomitants of a military life the spirits flag and become languid the fibers lose their wonted elasticity and become lax the blood loses its tone in short the whole animal economy is so disordered that the vigorous attack of a disease meets with a very feeble repulse for by these severe shocks the lymphatics and sanguiferous vessels being frequently broke the extravasated blood and lymph is discharged into the sinuss of the brain where it coagulates and becomes so viscous as not to be able to pass those narrow canals but lie congested there and is not only the source of dreadful symptoms but the cause of death it self  obs   a certain gentlewoman of ghent in flanders accompanying her spouse to batavia of which he was major commandant till his decease in her return from thence was taken very ill for which indisposition the surgeon of the vessel advised her to the use of the cold bath but whether owing to his ignorance or her neglect she omitted emerging her head she was no sooner got out of the bath but immediately her head and face was so swollen as to deprive her both of sight speech and the use of all her limbs at her arrival at amsterdam consultations were held by the best physicians concerning her case with very good success as to the abating the swelling of her head and recovery of speech but as for retrieving the use of her limbs she found no manner of benefit but remained void of all sense and motion thus despairing of help she returned to ghent and applied her self to the physicians of the french hospital who were then in that garrison but with as little advantage as the former in this condition was she for some years confined to her bed and reduced to a mere skeleton the bones of the carpus and metacarpus those of the tarsus and metatarsus being distorted to a deformity nay the very phalanges of the fingers and toes were dislocated by the contraction of the tendons she then had recourse to the town physicians but neither their inunctions of penetrating oils camphorated spirits their aromatics or volatile sudorifics to correct and discharge this peccant matter that intercepted the nervous fluid nor their decoctions of the woods fomentations or hot baths availed any thing of she entertained no longer hopes of being relieved  but after that memorable battle at ramillies on may      0  the victory being obtained over the duke of bavaria by that victorious general his grace the duke of marlborough which occasioned the speedy reduction of all the netherlands the british hospital removed to ghent and i accidentally took lodgings under the roof of this miserable gentlewoman who being informed i belonged to that hospital was very importunate with me to use my utmost endeavors to remove her indisposition  her case being very uncommon and the success precarious i could not promise much to raise her expectations yet being unwilling to discourage her i took my leave with an assurance of considering her case and get the opinion of other physicians whom i consulted but their concluding that twas a perfect atrophy dissuaded me from attempting that which was so improbable of being accomplished  my last observation suggested to me that this numbness and deadness proceeded from the obstruction of the nervous fluid occasioned by the viscous glutinous matter lodged in the sinuss of the brain which if it could be diluted by the power of medicine so as to be carried off by its proper vessels i then thought i might expect success so communicating my thoughts of her case and the method i designed to prosecute for the cure to the ingenious dr laurence then physician general to her majestys forces in flanders he approved of my method as the most probable to recover my patient and establish my character  this encouraged me to undertake the cure what flushed me more with hopes of success was that in a short time her menstrua flowed which before during the whole time of her illness were totally suppressed after which in three weeks time she was capable with the assistance of anothers arm to walk to church and by degrees acquired her former health and strength to the great surprise of all that knew her deplorable case in a short time after she was married and delivered of a strong and healthy child  this confirmed me in the opinion that let a chronical case be never so intricate it is in the power of medicines if rightly applied to remove it supposing there is not too great a petrefaction or loss of substance in the parts affected for the truth of which i could produce several instances were it not a digression from my present design  obs   a robust young fellow at the siege of brussels anno dom   0  receiving a shot through the metatarsus after the wound was well digested suppuration promoted and he in a fair way of recovery only complaining mightily for want of sleep the physician in his tour of visits ordered him a gentle hypnotic draught but the apothecarys man in distributing the medicines gave him also to the quantity of seven grains of laudanum mistakes of which kind in the british hospital are seldom or ever known the next morning to my surprise i found him dead the nurse informed me what pills he had taken how jocose pleasant and merrily disposed he was that he sung very cheerfully and a short while after dozed away  the next day in opening his head to see what discovery i could make i no sooner reached the meninges but i found some of the vessels distended to a prodigious degree others burst from whence issued an incredible quantity of blood and from the sinuss came as near as i could judge to the quantity of three quarts that was extravasated  here is an instance of an apoplexy from laudanum which convinces me that its narcotic or hypnotic faculty proceeded neither from an occult quality or intense coldness either by coagulating or environing the particles of blood or spirits and so preventing their motion for since by a chemical analysis we find it gives a copious quantity of fetid oil and volatile spirit it plainly consutes that assertion of its being cold but on the contrary it dissolves the texture of the blood renders the humors more fluid hurries the spirits into disorderly motions and the heart by its repeated systole projects the blood with too great a velocity to the brain  indeed when the opium begins first of all to insinuate it self it rarifies the arterial blood this being rarefied the spirits then not so much fettered with bloody particles are in a greater quantity and with more ease secernd by the glands of the brain and conveyed in a greater copia by the nerves through all parts of the body which produces that passion of the mind joy but when by this rarefaction the arteries are so distended as to compress the nerves and retard the circulation of their fluid comatose distempers must there necessarily be produced hence it is that administering opium in the beginning of fevers the smallpox and the like where the blood is already in too great a ferment instead of answering the intention of composing the patient throws him into deliriums and even madness it self hurries him headlong and distracted out of the world  obs   mr kilbraith a merchant of bristol about forty five years of age laboring for many years under a hypocondriac melancholy continued under the physicians hands for a long time but was so far from reaping the least benefit from their prescriptions that he daily declined and lost his appetite nay the very sight and smell of meats were so offensive as to create a nausea till at length he had contracted a complication of diseases then he committed himself to my care who in a short time had the good fortune to be the instrument of his recovery  some time after having an affair at the bath and there meeting with a gentleman of his acquaintance he was prevailed upon to bathe himself but what with sweating the vitriolic sulphurous or bituminous effluvia of the waters he became faint heavy and rendered almost lethargic however relying too much on the strength of nature he neglected the use of means till one night being taken with a contraction of the nerves and soon after seized with a few convulsive paroxysms i was sent for the morning following and advised him to air and exercise himself with gentle riding he no sooner attempted to rise and placed his feet on the cold floor but was immediately seized with a violent fit of an apoplexy and in a moment became cold stiff and to all appearance lifeless at this surprising accident the whole family ran out to rally some of the neighborhood to their assistance left me alone where i accidentally found a small bottle of spirits of hartshorn which i poured down his throat and at their return i desired he might have a friction all over his body which proved so successful that i soon perceived a pulsation and respiration i then took sixteen ounces of blood from the temporal artery and in less time than ever i observed from the arm after which i prescribed what i thought proper for his case other physicians who were also sent for came and to my face approved of my method of treating him but after my departure they ridiculed it as mischievous and hurtful saying twas the only way to draw the distemper to and confirm it in the head whether ignorance or malice had the ascendant or whether equal parts of both contributed to furnish their upper rooms it matters not but my affairs obliging me to go a few miles from thence i desired the surgeon if he was threatened with a returning fit to introduce his lancet into the same orifice and take such a quantity as might be requisite but at the attack of the next fit these judicious gentlemen prevented the surgeon and dissuaded the friends by amusing them with the dangerous consequence that must necessarily accrue till the blood flew impetuously out of the mouth and nose and then when twas too late they consented however after this second discharge he immediately recovered his sense and speech at my return his friends informed me what had happened and that twas owing to those physicians that they had not strictly observed my method at which being about to leave him i was prevailed upon by his importuning me so earnestly to tarry i was entirely of the opinion that the vessels of the brain were burst but however i desired a consultation with dr bave of bath and acquainted him with my proceedings which he approved of and gave him my opinion of the desperateness of his case which he also feared but the other physicians tho their companies and opinions were desired yet thought fit as they had sneaked off to abscond who being too conscious to themselves of the irreparable prejudice they had already done giving only this shuffling trifling excuse that truly dr bave was so singular as to consult with none but such as had been educated at oxford whereas that ingenious as well as ingenuous gentleman who is a credit to the university where educated an advantage to the town where he resides and to such that have recourse there for the benefit of the waters regards the qualifications of a physician more than the place where qualified after some medicines prescribed the doctor returns without entertaining the least hopes of his recovery but the patient resting well that night his former physicians concluded then he was in a fair way of doing well i took liberty to inform em how great strangers they were to his present case and that when they were in the greatest expectations of his being out of danger that then they would have most reason to fear his being snatched away which happened accordingly for the very ensuing night whilst jocose and merry with his friends he was seized of a sudden and had just time allowed him to bequeath his soul to god that gave it and so expired snorting and discharging a vast quantity of livid blood from his nostrils  this to me is an evident proof that this gentleman was entirely lost by this neglect the disease being too violent and too sudden to be conquered by internal medicines whereas had the artery been opened as i ordered it might have prevented the returning fit  obs   mr jeffrey pinnel a very considerable man of the city of bristol returning from morningservice and reflecting on the manifold mercies bounteous heaven had bestowed on him particularly acknowledged the large share of that inestimable jewel health which from his infancy he had enjoyed without the least interval of sickness and that notwithstanding he was so much advanced in years he could discern no sensible alteration as to his good habit of body but in the mean time inclining his head with a design to buckle his shoe he fell down as dead on the floor which being a stone pavement made a considerable contusion on his forhead he was immediately lifted up and what with frictions and cardiac draughts was recruited to that degree that in the space of three hours he became very sensible and amongst several physicians that were mentioned to him he was pleased to send for me informed me of his manner of being seized that he was then very costive and had a suppression of urine but the pulse being not very irregular i deferred opening the artery so at that time i prescribed only laxatives and diuretics and took my leave desiring him to acquaint me at the first appearance of the returning fit which happened the following morning at four a clock at which time the fit was so exceeding severe that he was almost suffocated and his face discolored like one strangled the artery being then turgid and quick as it always is in those cases i immediately took away about sixteen ounces which i had no sooner done but he asked me what i was doing i ordered him to be raised out of his bed being there too much confined and conveyed into a more airy room which occasioned him to make water very plentifully but after a strict enquiry i found that the concussion given the brain and the symptoms attending it were such that the vessels must necessarily be broke and that there was but small hope left to expect his recovery which i freely told his friends they being very pressing with me to give my real sentiments and desirous of a consultation which for their satisfaction i approved of so they sent for dr  at four in the morning who notwithstanding he had given his word of honor to be immediately there yet after his usual way kept em in expectation till eleven at which time assuming his usual haughty air to insinuate himself into the opinion of the vulgar he enters but being informed who was above in order for a consultation this brazen oracle turns on his heel and pronounces these words with this i consult and none else pointing to his breast the thorax being equally as well furnished with brain as the cranium but tho he was mightily reflected on for this imperious air it is every persons duty to judge charitably and put the most favorable construction that twill bear i for my part would impute it to an innate modesty being conscious of his ignorance in that case and that offering his opinion would be but exposing himself without the lead service accruing to the patient galen and hippocrates suiting no more his genius than cook or littleton but not to harp too long on such an untunable string i will wave this heartily wishing for the benefit of those unfortunate distempered persons that fall under his care that for the future he may have better success than from his knowledge in the faculty of physic can reasonably be expected  i continued in the use of proper means but for the reasons before mentioned could not expect his recovery for tho to appearance he was much better yet the next day about eleven in the forenoon he fell into a cold clammy sweat and for the space of almost an hour shorted excessively foamed at the mouth and expired  some perhaps may say this might have as well been omitted as inserted the patient dying but this may serve to confirm my assertion that arteriotomy is so much preferable to phlebotomy there being no parallel instance that ever the latter had so speedy an effect to recall the senses  the two following observations tho i formerly published them in a latin dissertation on this subject which is annexed to this treatise yet for the benefit of those who are not so well acquainted with that language being so remarkable i could not omit giving them a place here in the english tongue  obs  0 a certain person of about forty years of age who had lived luxuriously in his youth being reduced to poverty and from a thriving tradesman become a private sentinel went to bed in perfect health but the next morning was found dead i resolved to open and examine his head and had no sooner sawn through the cranium and reached the meninges but the blood sprung out from those torn vessels with that violence as if an amputation had been performed on the leg or arm of a living person which had it been timely discharged by opening the artery his life might have been preserved  obs    a young fellow about thirty who had been sickly for a considerable time but when on the recovery i asked him how he did he told me he was tolerably well but in a quarter of an hours time news was brought me that he was dead i immediately went to him discovered a small respiration and could just perceive a pulsation in the temporal arteries which i opened on each side and after having bled very freely he presently began to discourse with me two hours after i took more blood from the same orifices and a third time a considerable quantity by which means with the use of warm comfortable medicines he perfectly recovered  thus during the time of my being in flanders as there were many cases of this nature offered so i never neglected embracing all opportunities by them which more and more confirmed me in the opinion of arteriotomy  obs    i shall only add one instance more of the mismanagement of diseases and the irregular administration of medicines and conclude twas on the famous william penn esquire who being of a plethoric habit of body and lethargic was one day seized with convulsions at his table and falterd in his speech immediately their family physician was sent for who took the usual method of treating him till at length it terminated in an intermitting fever which was so ill managed that twas six weeks before he could be removed to his country house being at bristol six months after he was seized with another fit of the same kind but much more severe a learned physician was then employed who scorning to jog on in the old beaten lane packhorse like was more pompous in his prescriptions as appeared by ordering his antilethargic or famous cephalic powder which by virtue of an occult quality could it but have insinuated it self into every crevice of the cranium would have worked wonders but these circumforaneous scouts wanting the parole could not pass the ports of the os crebriforme being so well guarded with nerves veins arteries and so closely lined with membranes so that this specific powder not answering expectation this worthy gentleman left him who after some moderate days journeys arrived at his country seat at ruscomb near reading where he was seized with a third fit their physician was then sent for from london who prosecuted his former method only with this difference that he ordered cupping scarifying and then applying the strongest epispastics this barbarous treatment caused dismal stranguries and the little urine he made was with great pain and much difficulty and of a bloody tincture intermixed with coagulated matter resembling lumps of fat so large that twould be thought incredible to pass the vrethra by this severity tho entirely owing to a good constitution he was not killed yet it confirmed a hydrocephalus or dropsy in his head which caused a sensible decay through all parts of his body deprived him of his speech and the use of his senses and in this desponding state the doctor left him  all which misfortunes might have been prevented by bleeding in the artery at the first appearance of the disease and falling in with my measures before mentioned  i was then sent for and succeeded so well that in a few days he was apparently better so i left him to the care of his apothecary and in about ten days time paying him a second visit i found him quite another man he had reassumed his wonted briskness and alacrity and thus continued for some months in a very good state of health till this unhappy accident having two fontinels betwixt the scapulas on one of which a protuberance rose like a boil which threw him into a violent fever this tumor increased to a prodigious size extending it self from the lower angle of the scapula all over the clavicle my being sent for to bristol to visit an ancient lady who had formerly been my patient and best benefactrix obliged him to make use of the former physician and a metropolitan surgeon but a friend of mr penn being very importunate with me i waited on him with all expedition found they had applied cataplasms in order to bring it to suppuration and had attempted to lay the abscess open but through fear had only scratched the teguments i then took the probe and introduced it eight or nine inches and made a deep incision from whence a considerable quantity of pus discharged it self then i ordered a digestive to destroy whatever fungus might remain main by which means he was immediately freed from the fever without the least occasion of being crambd with febrifuge draughts powders and boluss that lay so plentifully prepared for him so i left him to the care of a surgeon in reading an ingenious man who completed the cure effectually and now he enjoys as large a measure of health as ever  this operation of arteriotomy that the generality are so timorous and cautious of attempting i have not only performed and ordered for adults but even on infants themselves one particularly who fell under my care was the child of a distempered parent who as soon as born was attended with convulsions and at six weeks old was seized with one so violent that none had the least room to hope for life but at the taking away a small quantity of blood from the artery the child was in an instant relieved looked cheerful pleasant and immediately took the breast which for some time before the fit he had refused and so with the use of proper medicines perfectly recoverd  this treatise i dont doubt but will meet with some who will approve of it as well as other prejudiced persons that will be as ready to contemn and condemn it but what i have writ was entirely owing to a sense of my duty to my fellow creatures without either consulting the applause of the former or valuing in the least the malicious censures of the latter   si quid novisti rectius istis candidus imperti si non his utere mecum finis appendix my bookseller having assured me that a book without an appendix is like a play without an epilogue i immediately addressed my self to write one but the difficulty was to fix on the argument among so many as offered themselves to my thoughts at first i resolved to demonstrate that the animalcula did not enter the vterus till they had impregnated one of the ova in the ovaria and when there maturated fall from thence into the tubae fallopianae and lastly into the womb then i thought i would expose as the practice deserves the use of oils syrups and diuretics in distempers of the stone and confirm my opinion by undoubted observations showing that such applications generate the stone but never dissolve or carry it off and instead of syrups oleaginous and tartarous liquids to recommend the use of malt liquors and at the same time to show that gravel is not producd from any deficiency in the kidneys but a disorder in the bowels arising from indigestion at another time i thought it would be no unuseful thing to the town to demonstrate that the consumptions which we frequently meet with arise not from any tendency in nature but from the mischievous effects of improper and illapplyd medicines in venereal cases  while i was thus in suspense a book casually fell into my hands of observations on bezoarstones with a vindication of sugars etc in which i saw there was copious matter to remark upon but finding in it a letter from dr cook of bristol which extols this new chalk medicine above all others i shall confine my self to that part of the book and show the world by a few observations how little this medicine deserves the praises given it  obs   mrs paget the wife of a noted man in bristol had for many years been afflicted with the cholick and stone but small ones and at some seasons of the year more violent than others under this misfortune she applied to dr cook and his underlings who in vain used their celebrated medicine with their laudanum doses till she was brought upon a rack and continud so for six or seven months i being sent for and being apprizd how she had been used gave her some things of a warm attenuating nature by the help of which she discharged vast quantities of a hard compact substance that was generated in her stomach with much choler and bile afterward she had an evacuation downwards of great numbers of stones that were hardened in the bowels occasioned by this chalk mixing it self with the flame in the stomach by which means they were lapifyd by the heat of the liver as chalk will be before the fire when mixed with water upon the second application many more came away some smaller and some greater the third time she discharged one as large as a big walnut which i have now by me and which shows where it was fastened to the ductus bilearius and the furrows made by the peristaltic motion of the guts and by pricking of it you bring out the very chalk as appears from mixing it with water that gives a color like other chalk from that moment she was relieved from all complaints and falling asleep for some hours she waked perfectly refreshed i used some things which i thought proper to recover the tone of her stomach etc she now enjoys a good state of health and has continued well ever since  obs   mr cooper undersheriff of bristol taking a cold and thereupon falling into vomiting with pains in his bowels sent for dr cook who ordered him the abovementioned neverfailing medicine in powder with a composing draught which was so far from relieving the patient that he awakd after two hours sleep with great oppressions and continual reaching and when upon a repetition of the medicine he grew worse i was called when i came and found him in cold sweats and continual vomitings i looked to see what had been given him and found half a dozen papers of this medicine and a vial of cooling julep with the powder at the bottom his case being past remedy i took my leave of him and he died the next morning  the following observation will show how much the doctor himself depends on the infallibility of his inestimable medicine as he calls it  obs   mrs hannah alton daughter to the alderman of that name in bristol had a springague of which i cured her but by eating unripe fruit and taking cold she fell into an intermitting fever with a cough in which case some officious friends as such are never wanting prevailed with her to put her self into the hands of dr cook and some of his understrappers well enough known in the city who giving her  secundum consuetudinem but not secundum artem chalk milk and laudanum draughts the distemper gained strength as how could it do otherwise and the abused patient threw up great quantities of chalk and curdled milk together the cause instead of the cure of her disease these symptoms puzzled the poor doctor and he had no other way to save his own credit but by recommending her to dr slare then at the bath whom he highly extolled on this occasion dr slare continues in the former method only adds bathwaters to the plaistring but the compactness of the substance before formd in the stomach being too firm for the waters to disentangle in order to expectorate they were forced down through the pyloris by the weight of the waters which relaxed that orifice of the stomach to such a degree that it could no more contract it self add to this that the continual defluxion of that sharp corrosive matter that had so long been pent in among the folds of the stomach inflamed both it and the guts so greatly that she fell into continual purgings till she expired the doctors had now no way left to excuse themselves but by charging all upon the bathwaters which god knows were very innocent of this poor ladys death but the noblest medicines are hurtful when ill applied and the greatest blessings are fatal when they pass through unskilful hands  obs   alderman stephens his lady of bristol having been in an ill state of health for many years and used diverse physicians but especially dr cook when she found her self growing worse sen for me when i came i found her reaching and very much convulsed what she brought up was hard substances not properly pleghm but somewhat wrapped in pleghm her vomiting had followd her for some years past and would continue with very little intermission for three weeks at a time upon enquiry what she had principally took i found it was the pouders and composing draught hereupon i prescribed her some proper things to disintangle the preternatural substances generated in the stomach which had their effect the convulsions soon abated and after voiding a number of worms and particularly one of half a yard long and as sharp at both ends as a needle the convulsion and the stone both left her by proper prescriptions afterward i cured her of one of the most complicated distempers that i have ever met with in my practice  obs   mr prankaras wife of bristol being attended with cholick pains was disciplined by dr cook in the old manner with chalk medicines and composing draughts when i came to her from the country where i then was and found the course she was in it being the evening i prescribed nothing but coming the next morning found her dead upon discourse with her mother i perceived the doctor had been there again after me and repeated his medicine which in a few hours threw her into such convulsions as ended in death  obs   mr davis of bristols wife being ill of a complication of distempers had at length by the care of dr cooks creatures a fixed pain in her back in so much that if she slipped her foot by accident against any thing she would fall down as dead with the agony of the pain i being sent for took the same method which i used with mrs paget that is i disentangled a vast many little stones that had petrified in her bowels and upon the ductus bilearius which was no sooner effected than she recovered and did well and was afterward delivered of a brave boy tho she never had a child before  by this observation it appears how easily the misapplication of medicines destroy the constitution and the chief faculties of procreation from whence i am of opinion that there is neither man nor woman but who is qualified to procreate or might be made so of which i could produce instances more than a few if it were proper  obs   captain scots wife of bristol being an infirm woman for many years and being treated in the same manner as the persons beforementioned was at length thrown into a jaundice and scurvy with a deprivation of her limbs and a continual strangury in which deplorable state she continued for seven years and then fell into a dropsy all over her body it was then i was called and by taking methods suitable to the dictates of nature as i have always done and by the grace of god ever shall she was so wonderfully relieved as to be able to walk a mile to her dinner who could not before move out of her chamber i followed these happy beginnings with such prescriptions as brought her to a perfect state of health so that she has been several times since at london upon the whole matter i would observe that the fault lies not in the medicines so much as in the unskilful applications of them and particularly i affirm that i have made use of the bezoar and gascoin powder with admirable success and have found it to be the best of cordials until therefore dr slare gives a few instances of the pernicious effects of the bezoar stone and gascoin powder for the many i have produced of his admired chalk and many more that i can i hope he will allow me at least i shall allow my self to prefer the former  i have now only one observation more to show how different effects arise from the same medicine at different times  obs   captain james grant of brigadier grants regiment had a fever and ague after the battle of mons to a violent degree and received no benefit from the bark but had his ague for six hours in twelve at length being brought in a litter to brussels he fell under my care i gave him some things proper to disentangle and carry off the load of matter which oppressed his stomach and then waited for the return of his fit which as i expected was more moderate than before after this i prescribed the bark and told him with some assurance that his fit should return no more which tho he did not in the least believe yet he found it to be true thus it is plain that it is of no consequence that a medicine be a good one unless it is applied in a proper case in a due manner and when the patient is fitly prepared and disposed to receive it if the instrument of music be never so well in tune yet there will be no harmony when the strings are touched by an ignorant hand when some animals play upon organs there must needs be hideous music and to be sincere i am very much afraid that this is honest dr slares case of whom and of my readers i take leave for the present having first presented the public with the only thing valuable in his book his recommendation of malt drink and dr cooks letter which so highly applauds this miraculous medicine  the consideration of grass for beasts leads me to corn namely the staff of life for human kind of the four grains wheat rye barley oats of each of these bread may be made very wholesome and good it is true if you chew and eat any of these they do not give so signal a sweet to our taste as what is really contained in them and will soon be made to exert that sweetness for example if you do but wet any of these corns in common water you will stir up some active inherent principles which will ferment and swell the grain and make it to grow as the malsters call it this gives them notice of spreading it abroad to dry which may be done in the sun but for convenience is performed on a kiln by the admission of heat from the fire made beneath it this is now called malt if you eat a grain or two you will discern it to be sweet if you boil it in water after it has been powdered or ground it will give a sweet tincture commonly called wort you may boil it to the consistence of a syrup and this product of corn somewhat agrees with mellossus which if it be spread upon bread it adds considerable nourishment to your bread and would be esteemed a good banquet and pleasant entertainment did we not abound with so many other more refined and dainty sweets and easier to come at thus mellossus is commonly given to schoolboys with their bread nor can i think it bad food for children because more mischief may be due totheir new spungy or dowy and not well baked bread than to the indian sweet it is this sweet decoction of malt that makes your great variety of fine ales and beer much more wholesome more pleasant and fit for english bodies than your admired wines whether rhenish french or florence for these do abound with gritty tartarous matter very apt to lodge in the kidneys and lay the foundation of the most intolerable distemper in the world the stone or if they be so happy to escape that the gout will make an attack on the joints of the toes or fingers of a potent drinker and tear and swell the tender parts and sometimes mercifully thrust out those tophi or stones into the extreme parts which otherwise would probably have been cast upon the too sensible and passive kidneys but none could ever charge our soft and balsamic ale with breeding any sort of sandy or tartarous matter in the barrel and i think not in the body i cannot forbear mentioning an observation of my good friend dr cyprianus who told me long since he had cut above fourteen hundred persons for the stone but never observed that he cut any alehouse keepers but many vintners he always advised his patients that feared the stone or were concerned with that excruciating disease to drink soft ale the newer the better for he condemns most or all four juices as apt to breed the stone or increase it  dr john cook of bristol to dr frederick slare at bach dear sir january          i received your kind letter and the manuscript of which i cannot give an adequate encomium it is an impartial trial and condemnation of bezoar by the laws of chemistry reason and experience oh how useful might our profession be rendered to the poor as well as to the rich if all the chargeable part of our materia medica was thus examined fairly and whatever appeared insipid inodorous unactive and indissolvable in mild menstruums and very gentle heats should be judged unworthy to be depended on for the cure of diseases the reformation of the errors and cheats of the materialists would be a very great advantage to mankind who are too often in as much danger from the true terra damnata of medicine as from those diseases which quiet and abstinence do frequently cure i have now for near thirty years past used the sal absynthii and the creta you mention with wonderful success in distempers of the stomach and bowels and in fevers but i always thought bezoar and pearl fitter for a ladys closet or neck than for a cordial unless for a profuse and wanton cleopatra all the precious gems should be sent back to the jewellers leafgold to the gilders nay i could for my part also return the musk and ambergreese to the perfumers the allwise and merciful creator and preserver of the universe has supplied poor unworthy mortals with the most efficacious medicines to be had in most countries upon easy terms nay most endemic distempers have very proper remedies to be gotten cheap in the same region but to return to your most accurate analysis of this false tho celebrated and precious antidote i will read it over once or twice more for it will afford still fresh delight to me who can scarce forbear interceding with you that the respublica medica may be made happy in the sight of these most useful discoveries for all say bonum quo communius eo melius and this being a dear imposture it must be for the public good to detect it i hope you will pardon this freedom which your favors and friendship does encourage me to use i must beg a sight also of your obsertions made on and the cures performed by the bathwaters which together with this excellent discourse shall be carefully returned with a due sense of gratitude by  sir your most obliged and faithful friend john cook  finis
