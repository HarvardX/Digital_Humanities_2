newbery  m dcc xcii  an essay on the life and genius of samuel johnson lld when the works of a great writer who has bequeathed to posterity a lasting legacy are presented to the world it is naturally expected that some account of his life should accompany the edition the reader wishes to know as much as possible of the author the circumstances that attended him the features of his private character his conversation and the means by which he rose to eminence become the favorite objects of enquiry curiosity is excited and the admirer of his works is eager to know his private opinions his course of study the particularities of his conduct and above all whether he pursued the wisdom which he recommends and practiced the virtue which his writings inspire a principle of gratitude is awakened in every generous mind for the entertainment and instruction which genius and diligence have provided for the world men of refined and sensible tempers are ready to pay their tribute of praise and even to form a posthumous friendship with the author  in reviewing the life of such a writer there is besides a rule of justice to which the public have an undoubted claim fond admiration and partial friendship should not be suffered to represent his virtues with exaggeration nor should malignity be allowed under a specious disguise to magnify mere defects the usual failings of human nature into vice or gross deformity the lights and shades of the character should be given and if this be done with a strict regard to truth a just estimate of dr johnson will afford a lesson perhaps as valuable as the moral doctrine that speaks with energy in every page of his works  the present writer enjoyed the conversation and friendship of that excellent man more than thirty years he thought it an honor to be so connected and to this hour he reflects on his loss with regret but regret he knows has secret bribes by which the judgment may be influenced and partial affection may be carried beyond the bounds of truth in the present case however nothing needs to be disguised and exaggerated praise is unnecessary it is an observation of the younger pliny in his epistle to his friend of tacitus that history ought never to magnify matters of fact because worthy actions require nothing but the truth nam nec historia debet egredi veritatem et honest factis veritas sufficit this rule the present biographer promises shall guide his pen throughout the following narrative  it may be said the death of dr johnson kept the public mind in agitation beyond all former example no literary character ever excited so much attention and when the press has teemed with anecdotes apophthegms essays and publications of every kind what occasion now for a new tract on the same threadbare subject the plain truth shall be the answer the proprietors of johnsons works thought the life which they prefixed to their former edition too unwieldy for republication the prodigious variety of foreign matter introduced into that performance seemed to overload the memory of dr johnson and in the account of his own life to leave him hardly visible they wished to have a more concise and for that reason perhaps a more satisfactory account such as may exhibit a just picture of the man and keep him the principal figure in the fore ground of his own picture to comply with that request is the design of this essay which the writer undertakes with a trembling hand he has no discoveries no secret anecdotes no occasional controversy no sudden flashes of wit and humor no private conversation and no new facts to embellish his work every thing has been gleaned dr johnson said of himself i am not uncandid nor severe i sometimes say more than i mean in jest and people are apt to think me serious boswells life of johnson vol ii p      the exercise of that privilege which is enjoyed by every man in society has not been allowed to him his fame has given importance even to trifles and the zeal of his friends has brought every thing to light what should be related and what should not has been published without distinction dicenda tacenda locuti every thing that fell from him has been caught with eagerness by his admirers who as he says in one of his letters have acted with the diligence of spies upon his conduct to some of them the following lines in mallets poem on verbal criticism are not inapplicable  such that grave bird in northern seas is found whose name a dutchman only knows to sound wherever the king of fish moves on before this humble friend attends from shore to shore with eye still earnest and with bill inclined he picks up what his patron drops behind with those choice cates his palate to regale and is the careful tibbald of a whale after so many essays and volumes of johnsoniana what remains for the present writer perhaps what has not been attempted a short yet full a faithful yet temperate history of dr johnson  samuel johnson was born at lichfield september     0  o s this appears in a note to johnsons diary prefixed to the first of his prayers after the alteration of the style he kept his birthday on the   th of september and it is accordingly marked september     his father michael johnson was a bookseller in that city a man of large athletic make and violent passions wrongheaded positive and at times afflicted with a degree of melancholy little short of madness his mother was sister to dr ford a practicing physician and father or cornellus ford generally known by the name of parson ford the same who is represented near the punchbowl in hogarths midnight modern conversation in the life of fanton johnson says that his abilities instead or furnishing convivial merriment to the voluptuous and dissolute might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the wife being chaplain to the earl of chesterfield he wished to attend that nobleman on his embassy to the hague colley cibber has recorded the anecdote you should go said the witty peer if to your many vices you would add one more pray my lord what is that hypocrisy my dear doctor johnson had a younger brother named nathaniel who died at the age of twentyseven or twentyeight michael johnson the father was chosen in the year      under bailiff of lichfield and in the year      he served the office of the senior bailiff he had a brother of the name of andrew who for some years kept the ring at smithfield appropriated to wrestlers and boxers our author used to say that he was never thrown or conquered michael the father died december      at the age of seventysix his mother at eightynine of a gradual decay in the year      of the family nothing more can be related worthy of notice johnson did not delight in talking of his relations there is little pleasure he said to mrs piozzi in relating the anecdotes of beggary  johnson derived from his parents or from an unwholesome nurse the distemper called the kings evil the jacobites at that time believed in the efficacy of the royal touch and accordingly mrs johnson presented her son when two years old before queen anne who for the first time performed that office and communicated to her young patient all the healing virtue in her power he was afterward cut for that scrophulous humor and the under part of his face was seamed and disfigured by the operation it is supposed that this disease deprived him of the sight of his left eye and also impaired his hearing at eight years old he was placed under mr hawkins at the free school at lichfield where he was not remarkable for diligence or regular application whatever he read his tenacious memory made his own in the fields with his schoolfellows he talked more to himself than with his companions in      when he was about sixteen years old he went on a visit to his cousin cornelius ford who detained him for some months and in the mean time assisted him in the classics the general direction for his studies which he then received he related to mrs piozzi obtain says ford some general principles of every science he who can talk only on one subject or act only in one department is seldom wanted and perhaps never wished for while the man of general knowledge can often benefit and always please this advice johnson seems to have pursued with a good inclination his reading was always desultory seldom resting on any particular author but rambling from one book to another and by hasty snatches hoarding up a variety of knowledge it may be proper in this place to mention another general rule laid down by ford for johnsons future conduct you will make your way the more easily in the world as you are contented to dispute no mans claim to conversationexcellence they will therefore more willingly allow your pretensions as a writer but says mrs piozzi the features of peculiarity which mark a character to all succeeding generations are slow in coming to their growth that ingenious lady adds with her usual vivacity can one on such an occasion forbear recollecting the predictions of boileaus father who said stroking the head of the young satirist this little man has too much wit but he will never speak ill of any one  on johnsons return from cornelius ford mr hunter then master of the free school at lichfield refused to receive him again on that foundation at this distance of time what his reasons were it is vain to enquire but to refuse assistance to a lad of promising genius must be pronounced harsh and illiberal it did not however stop the progress of the young students education he was placed at another school at stourbridge in worcestershire under the care of mr wentworth having gone through the rudiments of classic literature he returned to his fathers house and was probably intended for the trade of a bookseller he has been heard to say that he could ind a book at the end of two years being than about nineteen he went to assist the studies of a young gentleman of the name of corbet to the university of oxford and on the   st of october      both were entered of pembroke college corbet as a gentlemancommoner and johnson as a commoner the college tutor mr jordan was a man of no genius and johnson it seems showed an early contempt of mean abilities in one or two instances behaving with insolence to that gentleman of his general conduct at the university there are no particulars that merit attention except the translation of popes messiah which was a college exercise imposed upon him as a talk by mr jordan corbet left the university in about two years and johnsons salary ceased he was by consequence straitened in his circumstances but he still remained at college mr jordan the tutor went off to a living and was succeeded by dr adams who afterward became head of the college and was esteemed through life for his learning his talents and his amiable character johnson grew more regular in his attendance ethics theology and classic literature were his favorite studies he discovered notwithstanding early symptoms of that wandering dispostion of mind which adhered to him to the end of his life his reading was by sits and starts undirected to any particular science general philology agreeably to his cousin fords advice was the object of his ambition he received at that time an early impression of piety and a taste for the best authors ancient and modern it may notwithstanding be questioned whether except his bible he ever read a book entirely through late in life if any man praised a book in his presence he was sure to ask did you read it through if the answer was in the affirmative he did not seem willing to believe it he continued at the university till the want of pecuniary supplies obliged him to quit the place he obtained however the assistance of a friend and returning in a short time was able to complete a residence of three years the history of his exploits at oxford he used to say was best known to dr tailor and dr adams wonders are told of his memory and indeed all who knew him late in life can witness that he retained that faculty in the greatest vigor  from the university johnson returned to lichfield his father died soon after december      and the whole receipt out of his effects as appeared by a memorandum in the sons handwriting dated   th june      was no more than twenty pounds the entry of this is remarkable for his early resolution to preserve through life a fair and upright character      junii    undecim aureos deposui quo die quidquid ante matris sunus quod serum sit precor de paternis bonis sperare licet viginti scilicet libras accepi usque adeo mihi mea fortuna singenda est interea et ne paupertate vires animi languescant ne in flagitia egestas adigat cavendum  in this exigence determined that poverty should neither depress his spirit nor warp his integrity he became undermaster of a grammar school at market bosworth in leicestershire that resource however did not last long disgusted by the pride of sir wolstan dixie the patron of that little seminary he left the place in discontent and ever after spoke of it with abhorrence in      he went on a visit to mr hector who had been his schoolfellow and was then a surgeon at birmingham lodging at the house of warren a bookseller at that place johnson translated a voyage to abyssinia written by jerome lobo a portugueze missionary this was the first literary work from the pen of dr johnson his friend hector was occasionally his amanuensis the work was probably undertaken at the desire of warren the bookseller and was printed at birmingham but it appears in the literary magazine or history of the works of the learned for march      that it was published by bettesworth and hitch paternoster row it contains a narrative of the endeavors of a company of missionaries to convert the people of abyssinia to the church of rome in the preface to this work johnson observes that the portoguese traveller contrary to the general view of his countrymen has amused his readers with no romantic absurdities or incredible fictions he appears by his modest and unaffected narration to have described things as he saw them to have copied nature from the life and to have consulted his senses not his imagination he meets with no basilisles that destroy with their eyes his crocodiles devour their prey without tears and his cataracts fall from the rock without deafening the neighboring inhabitants the reader will here find no regions cursed with irremediable barrenness or blessed with spontaneous fecundity no perpetual gloom or unceasing sunshine nor are the nations here described either void of all sense of humanity or consummate in all private and social virtues here are no hottentots without religion polity or articulate language no chinese perfectly polite and completely skilled in all sciences he will discover what will always be discovered by a diligent and impartial enquirer that wherever human nature is to be found there is a mixture of vice and virtue a contest of passion and reason and that the creator does not appear partial in his distributions but has balanced in most countries their particular inconveniences by particular favors we have here an early specimen of johnsons manner the vein of thinking and the frame of the sentences are manifestly his we see the infant hercules the translation of lobos narrative has been reprinted lately in a separate volume with some other tracts of dr johnsons and therefore forms no part of this edition but a compendious account of so interesting a work as father lobos discovery of the head of the nile will not it is imagined be unacceptable to the reader  father lobo the portuguese missionary embarked in      in the same fleet with the count vidigueira who was appointed by the king of portugal viceroy of the indies they arrived at goa and in january      father lobo set out on the mission to abyssinia two of the jesuits sent on the same commission were murdered in their attempt to penetrate into that empire lobo had better success he surmounted all difficulties and made his way into the heart of the country then follows a description of abyssinia formerly the largest empire of which we have an account in history it extended from the red sea to the kingdom of congo and from egypt to the indian sea containing no less than forty provinces at the time of lobos mission it was not much larger than spain consisting then but of five kingdoms of which part was entirely subject to the emperor and part paid him a tribute as an acknowledgement the provinces were inhabited by moors pagans jews and christians the last was in lobos time the established and reigning religion the diversity of people and religion is the reason why the kingdom was under different forms of government with laws and customs extremely various some of the people neither sowed their lands nor improved them by any kind of culture living upon milk and flesh and like the arabs encamping without any fettled habitation in some places they practiced no rites of worship though they believed that in the regions above there dwells a being that governs the world this deity they call in their language oul the christianity professed by the people in some parts is so corrupted with superstitions errors and heresies and so mingled with ceremonies borrowed from the jews that little besides the name of christianity is to be found among them the abyssins cannot properly be said to have either cities or houses they live in tents or cottages made of straw or clay very rarely building with stone their villages or towns consist of these huts yet even of such villages they have but few because the grandees the viceroys and the emperor himself are always in camp that they may be prepared upon the most sudden alarm to meet every emergence in a country which is engaged every year either in foreign wars or intestine commotions ethiopia produces very near the same kinds of provision as portugal though by the extreme laziness of the inhabitants in a much less quantity what the ancients imagined of the torrid zone being a part of the world uninhabitable is so far from being true that the climate is very temperate the blacks have better features than in other countries and are not without wit and ingenuity their apprehension is quick and their judgment sound there are in this climate two harvests in the year one in winter which lasts through the months of july august and september the other in the spring they have in the greatest plenty raisins peaches pomegranates sugarcanes and some figs most of these are ripe about lent which the abyssins keep with great strictness the animals of the country are the lion the elephant the rhinoceros the unicorn horses mules oxen and cows without number they have a very particular custom which obliges every man that has a thousand cows to save every year one days milk of all his herd and make a bath with it for his relations this they do so many days in each year as they have thousands of cattle so that to express how rich a man is they tell you he bathes so many times  of the river nile which has furnished so much controversy we have a full and clear description it is called by the natives abavi the father of water it rises in sacala a province of the kingdom of goiama the most fertile and agreeable part of the abyssinian dominions on the eastern side of the country on the declivity of a mountain whose descent is so easy that it seems a beautiful plain is that source of the nile which has been sought after at so much expense and labor this spring or rather these two springs are two holes each about two feet diameter a stones cast distant from each other one of them is about five feet and a half in depth lobo was not able to sink his plummet lower perhaps because it was stopped by roots the whole place being full of trees a line of ten feet did not reach the bottom of the other these springs are supposed by the abyssins to be the vents of a great subterraneous lake at a small distance to the south is a village called guix through which you ascend to the top of the mountain where there is a little hill which the idolatrous agaci hold in great veneration their priest calls them together to this place once a year and every one sacrifices a cow or more according to the different degrees of wealth and devotion hence we have sufficient proof that these nations always paid adoration to the deity of this famous river  as to the course of the nile its waters after their first rise run toward the east about the length of a musket shot then turning northward continue hidden in the grass and weeds for about a quarter of a league when they reappear amongst a quantity of rocks the nile from its source proceeds with so inconsiderable a current that it is in danger of being dried up by the hot season but soon receiving an increase from the gemma the keltu the bransa and the other smaller rivers it expands to such a breadth in the plains of boad which is not above three days journey from its source that a musketball will scarcely fly from one bank to the other here it begins to run northward winding however a little to the east for the space of nine or ten leagues and then enters the somuchtalkedof lake of dambia flowing with such violent rapidity that its waters may be distinguished through the whole passage which is no less than six leagues here begins the greatness of the nile fifteen miles further in the land of alata it rushes precipitately from the top of a high rock and forms one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world lobo says he passed under it without being wet and resting himself for the sake of the coolness was charmed with a thousand delightful rainbows which the sunbeams painted on the water in all their shining and lively colors this mr bruce the late traveller avers to be a downright falsehood he says a deep pool of water reaches to the very foot of the rock and allowing that there was a seat or bench which there is not in the middle of the pool it is absolutely impossible by any exertion of human strength to have arrived at it but it may be asked can mr bruce say what was the face of the country in the year      when lobo saw the magnificent sight which he has described mr bruces pool of water may have been formed since and lobo perhaps was content to sit down without a bench  the fall of this mighty stream from so great a height makes a noise that may be heard at a considerable distance but it was not found that the neighboring inhabitants were deaf after the cataract the nile collects its scattered stream among the rocks which are so near each other that in lobos time a bridge of beams on which the whole imperial army passed was laid over them sultan sequed has since built a stone bridge of one arch in the same place for which purpose he procured masons from india here the river alters its course and passes through various kingdoms such as amhara olaca choaa damot and the kingdom of goiama and after various windings returns within a short days journey of its spring to pursue it through all its mazes and accompany it round the kingdom of goiama is a journey of twentynine days from abyssinia the river passes into the countries of fazulo and ombarca two vast regions little known inhabited by nations entirely different from the abyssins their hair like that of the other blacks in those regions is short and curled in the year      rassela christos lieutenant general to sultan sequed entered those kingdoms in a hostile manner but not being able to get intelligence returned without attempting any thing as the empire of abyssinia terminates at these descents lobo followed the course of the nile no farther leaving it to range over barbarous kingdoms and convey wealth and plenty into egypt which owes to the annual inundations of this river its envied fertility after comparing this description with that lately given by mr bruce the reader will judge whether lobo is to lose the honor of having been at the head of the nile near two centuries before any other european traveller  lobo knows nothing of the nile in the rest of its passage except that it receives great increase from many other rivers has several cataracts like that already described and that few fish are to be found in it that scarcity is to be attributed to the riverhorse and the crocodile which destroy the weaker inhabitants of the river something likewise must be imputed to the cataracts where fish cannot fall without being killed lobo adds that neither he nor any with whom he conversed about the crocodile ever saw him weep and therefore all that has been said about his tears must be ranked among the fables invented for the amusement of children  as to the causes of the inundations of the nile lobo observes that many an idle hypothesis has been framed some theorists ascribe it to the high winds that stop the current and force the water above its banks others pretend a subterraneous communication between the ocean and the nile and that the sea when violently agitated swells the river many are of opinion that this mighty flood proceeds from the melting of the snow on the mountains of aethiopia but so much snow and such prodigious heat are never met with in the same region lobo never saw snow in abyssinia except on mount semen in the kingdom of tigre very remote from the nile and on namara which is indeed not far distant but where there never falls snow enough to wet when dissolved the foot of the mountain to the immense labors of the portuguese mankind is indebted for the knowledge of the real cause of these inundations so great and so regular by them we are informed that abyssinia where the nile rises is full of mountains and in its natural situation is much higher than egypt that in the winter from june to september no day is without rain that the nile receives in its course all the rivers brooks and torrents that fall from those mountains and by necessary consequence swelling above its banks fills the plains of egypt with inundations which come regularly about the month of july or three weeks after the beginning of the rainy season in aethiopia the different degrees of this flood are such certain indications of the fruitfulness or sterility of the ensuing year that it is publicly proclaimed at cairo how much the water has gained during the night  such is the account of the nile and its inundations which it is hoped will not be deemed an improper or tedious digression especially as the whole is an extract from johnsons translation he is all the time the actor in the scene and in his own words relates the story having finished this work he returned in february      to his native city and in the month of august following published proposals for printing by subscription the latin poems of politian with the history of latin poetry from the era of petrarch to the time of politian and also the life of politian to be added by the editor samuel johnson the book to be printed in thirty octavo sheets price five shillings it is to be regretted that this project failed for want of encouragement johnson it seems differed from boileau voltaire and dalembert who have taken upon them to proscribe all modern efforts to write with elegance in a dead language for a decision pronounced in so high a tone no good reason can be assigned the interests of learning require that the diction of greece and rome should be cultivated with care and he who can write a language with correctness will be most likely to understand its idiom its grammar and its peculiar graces of style what man of taste would willingly forego the pleasure of reading vida fracastorius sannazaro sirada and others down to the late elegant productions of bishop lowth the history which johnson proposed to himself would beyond all question have been a valuable addition to the history of letters but his project failed his next expedient was to offer his assistance to cave the original projector of the gentlemans magazine for this purpose he sent his proposals in a letter offering on reasonable terms occasionally to fill some pages with poems and inscriptions never printed before with fugitive pieces that deserved to be revived and critical remarks on authors ancient and modern cave agreed to retain him as a correspondent and contributor to the magazine what the conditions were cannot now be known but certainly they were not sufficient to hinder johnson from casting his eyes about him in quest of other employment accordingly in      he made overtures to the reverend mr budworth master of a grammar school at brerewood in staffordshire to become his assistant this proposition did not succeed mr budworth apprehended that the involuntary motions to which johnsons nerves were subject might make him an object of ridicule with his scholars and by consequence lessen their respect for their master another mode of advancing himself presented itself about this time mrs porter the widow of a mercer in birmingham admired his talents it is said that she had about eight hundred pounds and that sum to a person in johnsons circumstances was an affluent fortune a marriage took place and to turn his wifes money to the best advantage he projected the scheme of an academy for education gilbert walmsley at that time register of the ecclesiastical court of the bishop of lichfield was distinguished by his erudition and the politeness of his manners he was the friend of johnson and by his weight and influence endeavored to promote his interest the celebrated garrick whose father captain garrick lived at lichfield was placed in the new seminary of education by that gentlemans advice garrick was then about eighteen years old an accession of seven or eight pupils was the most that could be obtained though notice was given by a public advertisement see the gentlemans magazine for      p      that at edial near lichfield in staffordshire young gentlemen are boarded and taught the latin and greek languages by samuel johnson  the undertaking proved abortive johnson having now abandoned all hopes of promoting his fortune in the country determined to become an adventurer in the world at large his young pupil garrick had formed the same resolution and accordingly in march      they arrived in london together two such candidates for same perhaps never before that day entered the metropolis together their stock of money was soon exhaussted in his visionary project of an academy johnson had probably wasted his wifes substance and garricks father had little more than his halfpay the two fellowtravellers had the world before them and each was to choose his road to fortune and to fame they brought with them genius and powers of mind peculiarly formed by nature for the different vocations to which each of them felt himself inclined they acted from the impulse of young minds even then meditating great things and with courage anticipating success their friend mr walmsley by a letter to the rev mr colson who it seems was a great mathematician exerted his good offices in their favor he gave notice of their intended journey davy garrick he said will be with you next week and johnson to try his fate with a tragedy and to get himself employed in some translation either from the latin or french johnson is a very good scholar and a poet and i have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedywriter if it should be in your way i doubt not but you will be ready to recommend and assist your countrymen of mr walmsleys merit and the excellence of his character johnson has left a beautiful testimonial at the end of the life of edward smith it is reasonable to conclude that a mathematician absorbed in abstract speculations was not able to find a sphere of action for two men who were to be the architects of their own fortune in three or four years afterward garrick came forth with talents that astonished the public he began his career at goodmansfields and there monstratus fatis vespasianus he chose a lucrative profession and consequently soon emerged from all his difficulties johnson was left to toil in the humble walks of literature a tragedy as appears by walmsleys letter was the whole of his stock this most probably was irene but if then finished it was doomed to wait for a more happy period it was offered to fleetwood and rejected johnson looked round him for employment having while he remained in the country corresponded with cave under a feigned name he now thought it time to make himself known to a man whom he considered as a patron of literature cave had announced by public advertisement a prize of fifty pounds for the best poem on life death judgment heaven and hell and this circumstance diffused an idea of his liberality johnson became connected with him in business and in a close and intimate acquaintance of caves character it is unnecessary to say any thing in this place as johnson was afterward the biographer of his first and most useful patron to be engaged in the translation of some important book was still the object which johnson had in view for this purpose he proposed to give the history of the council of trent with copious notes then lately added to a french edition twelve sheets of this work were printed for which johnson received fortynine pounds as appears by his receipt in the possession of mr nichols the compiler of that entertaining and useful work the gentlemans magazine johnsons translation was never completed a like design was offered to the public under the patronage of dr zachary pearce and by that contention both attempts were frustrated johnson had been commended by pope for the translation of the messiah into latin verse but he knew no approach to so eminent a man with one however who was connected with pope he became acquainted at st johns gate and that person was no other than the wellknown richard savage whose life was afterward written by johnson with great elegance and a depth of moral reflection savage was a man of considerable talents his address his various accomplishments and above all the peculiarity of his misfortunes recommended him to johnsons notice they became united in the closest intimacy both had great parts and they were equally under the pressure of want sympathy joined them in a league of friendship johnson has been often heard to relate that he and savage walked round grosvenorsquare till four in the morning in the course of their conversation reforming the world dethroning princes establishing new forms of government and giving laws to the several states of europe till fatigued at length with their legislative office they began to feel the want of refreshment but could not muster up more than four pence halfpenny savage it is true had many vices but vice could never strike its roots in a mind like johnsons seasoned early with religion and the principles of moral rectitude his first prayer was composed in the year      he had not at that time renounced the use of wine and no doubt occasionally enjoyed his friend and his bottle the love of late hours which followed him through life was perhaps originally contracted in company with savage however that may be their connection was not of long duration in the year      savage was reduced to the last distress mr pope in a letter to him expressed his concern for the miserable withdrawing of his pension after the death of the queen and gave him hopes that in a short time he should find himself supplied with a competence without any dependence on those little creatures whom we are pleased to call the great the scheme proposed to him was that he should retire to swansea in wales and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a year to be raised by subscription pope was to pay twenty pounds this plan though finally established took more than a year before it was carried into execution in the mean time the intended retreat of savage called to johnsons mind the third satire of juvenal in which that poet takes leave of a friend who was withdrawing himself from all the vices of rome struck with this idea he wrote that wellknown poem called london the first lines manifestly point to savage  though grief and fondness in my breast rebel when injured thales bids the town farewell yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend i praise the hermit but regret the friend reserved at length from vice and london far to breathe in distant fields a purer air and fixed or cambrias solitary shore give to st david one true briton more johnson at that time lodged at greenwich he there fixes the scene and takes leave of his friend who he says in his life parted from him with tears in his eyes the poem when finished was offered to cave it happened however that the late mr dodsley was the purchaser at the price of ten guineas it was published      and pope we are told said the author whoever he is will not be long concealed alluding to the passage in terence ubi ubi est diu celari non potest notwithstanding that prediction it does not appear that besides the copymoney any advantage accrued to the author of a poem written with the elegance and energy of pope johnson in august      went with all the same of his poetry to offer himself a candidate for the mastership of the school at appleby in leicestershire the statutes of the place required that the person chosen should be a master of arts to remove this objection the late lord gower was induced to write to a friend in order to obtain for johnson a masters degree in the university of dublin by the recommendation of dr swift the letter was printed in one of the magazines and is as follows  sir mr samuel johnson author of london a satire and some other poetical pieces is a native of this county and much respected by some worthy gentlemen in the neighborhood who are trustees of a charityschool now vacant the certain salary of which is sixty pounds per year of which they are desirous to make him master but unfortunately he is not capable of receiving their bounty which would make him happy for life by not being a master of arts which by the statutes of the school the master of it must be  now these gentlemen do me the honor to think that i have interest enough in you to prevail upon you to write to dean swift to persuade the university of dublin to send a diploma to me constituting this poor man master of arts in their university they highly extol the mans learning and probity and will not be persuaded that the university will make any difficulty of conferring such a favor upon a stranger if he is recommended by the dean they say he is not afraid of the strictest examination though he is of so long a journey and yet he will venture it if the dean thinks it necessary choosing rather to die upon the road than to be starved to death in translating for booksellers which has been his only subsistence for some time past  i fear there is more difficulty in this affair than these goodnatured gentlemen apprehend especially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the   th of next month if you see this matter in the same light that it appears to me i hope you will burn this and pardon me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing but if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favor asked i am sure your humanity and propensity to relieve merit in distress will incline you to serve the poor man without my adding any more to the trouble i have already given you than assuring you that i am with great truth sir  your faithful humble servant gower trentham aug  st  this scheme miscarried there is reason to think that swift declined to meddle in the business and to that circumstance johnsons known dislike of swift has been often imputed  it is mortifying to pursue a man of merit through all his difficulties and yet this narrative must be through many following years the history of genius and virtue struggling with adversity having lost the school at appleby johnson was thrown back on the metropolis bred to no profession without relations friends or interest he was condemned to drudgery in the service of cave his only patron in november      was published a translation of crousazs examen of popes essay on man containing a succinct view of the system of the fatalists and a confutation of their opinions with an illustration of the doctrine of free will and an enquiry what view mr pope might have in touching upon the leibnitzian philosophy and fatalism by mr crousaz professor or philosophy and mathematics at lausanne this translation has been generally thought a production of johnsons pen but it is now known that mrs elizabeth carter has acknowledged it to be one of her early performances it is certain however that johnson was eager to promote the publication he considered the foreign philosopher as a man zealous in the cause of religion and with him he was willing to join against the system of the fatalists and the doctrine of leibnitz it is well known that warburton wrote a vindication of mr pope but there is reason to think that johnson conceived an early prejudice against the essay on man and what once took root in a mind like his was not easily eradicated his letter to cave on this subject is still extant and may well justify sir john hawkins who inferred that johnson was the translator of crousaz the conclusion of the letter is remarkable i am yours impransus if by that latin word was meant that he had not dined because he wanted the means who can read it even at this hour without an aching heart  with a mind naturally vigorous and quickened by necessity johnson formed a multiplicity of projects but most of them proved abortive a number of small tracts issued from his pen with wonderful rapidity such as marmor norfolciense or an essay on an ancient prophetical inscription in monkish rhyme discovered at lynn in norfolk by probus britannicus this was a pamphlet against sir robert walpole according to sir john hawkins a warrant was issued to apprehend the author who reretired with his wife to an obscure lodging near lambeth marsh and there eluded the search or the messengers but this story has no foundation in truth johnson was never known to mention such an incident in his life and mr steel late of the treasury caused diligent search to be made at the proper offices and no trace of such a proceeding could be found in the same year     the lord chamberlain prohibited the representation of a tragedy called gustavus vasa by henry brook under the mask of irony johnson published a vindication of the licencer from the malicious and scandalous aspersions of mr brook of these two pieces sir john hawkins says they have neither learning nor wit nor a single ray of that genius which has since blazed forth but as they have been lately reprinted the reader who wishes to gratify his curiosity is referred to the fourteenth volume of johnsons works published by stockdale the lives of boerhaave blake barratier father paul and others were about that time printed in the gentlemans magazine the subscription of fifty pounds a year for savage was completed and in july      johnson parted with the companion of his midnighthours never to see him more the separation was perhaps an advantage to him who wanted to make a right use of his time and even then beheld with selfreproach the waste occasioned by dissipation his abstinence from wine and strong liquors began soon after the departure of savage what habits he contracted in the course of that acquaintance cannot now be known the ambition of excelling in conversation and that pride of victory which at times disgraced a man of johnsons genius were perhaps native blemishes a fierce spirit of independence even in the midst of poverty may be seen in savage and if not thence transfused by johnson into his own manners it may at least be supposed to have gained strength from the example before him during that connection there was if we believe sir john hawkins a short separation between our author and his wife but a reconciliation soon took place johnson loved her and showed his affection in various modes of gallantry which garrick used to render ridiculous by his mimicry the affectation of soft and fashionable airs did not become an unwieldy figure his admiration was received by the wife with the slutter of an antiquated coquette and both it is well known furnished matter for the lively genius of garrick  it is a mortifying reflection that johnson with a store of learning and extraordinary talents was not able at the age of thirty to force his way to the favor of the public slow rises worth by poverty depressed he was still as he says himself to provide for the day that was passing over him he saw cave involved in a state of warfare with the numerous competitors at that time struggling with the gentlemans magazine and gratitude for such supplies as johnson received dictated a latin ode on the subject of that contention the first lines urbane nullis fesse laboribus urbane nullis victe calumniis put one in mind of casimirs ode to pope urban  urbane regum maxim maxim urbane vatum  the polish poet was probably at that time in the hands of a man who had meditated the history of the latin poets guthrie the historian had from july      composed the parliamentary speeches for the magazines but from the beginning of the session which opened on the   th of november    0 johnson succeeded to that department and continued it from that time to the debate on spirituous liquors which happened in the house of lords in february       the eloquence the force of argument and the splendour of language displayed in the several speeches are well known and univesally admired the whole has been collected in two volumes by mr stockdale and may form a proper supplement to this edition that johnson was the author of the debates during that period was not generally known but the secret transpired several years afterward and was avowed by himself on the following occasion mr wedderburne now lord loughborough dr johnson dr francis the translator of horace the present writer and others dined with the late mr foot an important debate toward the end of sir robert walpoles administration being mentioned dr francis observed that mr pitts speech on that occasion was the best he had ever read he added that he had employed eight years of his life in the study of demosthenes and finished a translation of that celebrated orator with all the decorations of style and language within the reach of his capacity but he had met with nothing equal to the speech abovementioned many of the company remembered the debate and some passages were cited with the approbation and applause of all present during the ardour of conversation johnson remained silent as soon as the warmth of praise subsided he opened with these words that speech i wrote in a garret in exeterstreet the company was struck with astonishment after staring at each other in silent amaze dr francis asked how that speech could be written by him sir said johnson i wrote it in exeterstreet i never had been in the gallery of the house of commons but once cave had interest with the doorkeepers he and the persons employed under him gained admittance they brought away the subject of discussion the names of the speakers the side they took and the order in which they rose together with notes of the arguments advanced in the course of the debate the whole was afterward communicated to me and i composed the speeches in the form which they now have in the parliamentary debates to this discovery dr francis made answer then sir you have exceeded demosthenes himself for to say that you have exceeded franciss demosthenes would be saying nothing the rest of the company bestowed lavish encomiums on johnson one in particular praised his impartiality observing that he dealt out reason and eloquence with an equal hand to both parties that is not quite true said johnson i saved appearances tolerably well but i took care that the whig dogs should not have the best of it the sale of the magazine was greatly increased by the parliamentary debates which were continued by johnson till the month of march       from that time the magazine was conducted by dr hawkesworth  in       osborne the bookseller who kept a shop in graysinn purchased the earl of oxfords library at the price of thirteen thousand pounds he projected a catalogue in five octavo volumes at five shillings each johnson was employed in that painful drudgery he was likewise to collect all such small tracts as were in any degree worth preserving in order to reprint and publish the whole in a collection called the harleian miscellany the catalogue was completed and the miscellany in      was published in eight quarto volumes in this business johnson was a daylabourer for immediate subsistence not unlike gustavus vasa working in the mines of dalicarlia what wilcox a bookseller of eminence in the strand said to johnson on his first arrival in town was now almost confirmed he lent our author five guineas and then asked him how do you mean to earn your livelihood in this town by my literary labors was the answer wilcox staring at him shook his head by your literary labors  you had better buy a porters knot johnson used to tell this anecdote to mr nichols but he said wilcox was one of my best friends and he meant well in fact johnson while employed in graysinn may be said to have carried a porters knot he paused occasionally to peruse the book that came to his hand osborne thought that such curiosity tended to nothing but delay and objected to it with all the pride and insolence of a man who knew that he paid daily wages in the dispute that of course ensued osborne with that roughness which was natural to him enforced his argument by giving the lie johnson seized a folio and knocked the bookseller down this story has been related as an instance of johnsons ferocity but merit cannot always take the spurns of the unworthy with a patient spirit  that the history of an author must be found in his works is in general a true observation and was never more apparent than in the present narrative every era of johnsons life is fixed by his writings in      he published the life of savage and then projected a new edition of shakspeare as a prelude to this design he published in      miscellaneous observations on the tragedy of macbeth with remarks on sir thomas hanmers edition to which were prefixed proposals for a new edition of shakspeare with a specimen of this pamphlet warburton in the preface to shakspeare has given his opinion as to all those things which have been published under the title of essays remarks observations etc on shakspeare if you except some critical notes on macbeth given as a specimen of a projected edition and written as appears by a man of parts and genius the rest are absolutely below a serious notice but the attention of the public was not excited there was no friend to promote a subscription and the project died to revive at a future day a new undertaking however was soon after proposed namely an english dictionary upon an enlarged plan several of the most opulent booksellers had meditated a work of this kind and the agreement was soon adjusted between the parties emboldened by this connection johnson thought of a better habitation than he had hitherto known he had lodged with his wife in courts and alleys about the strand but now for the purpose of carrying on his arduous undertaking and to be near his printer and friend mr strahan he ventured to take a house in goughsquare fleet street he was told that the earl of chesterfield was a friend to his undertaking and in consequence of that intelligence he published in      the plan of a dictionary of the english language addrssed to the right honorable philip dormer earl of chesterfield one of his majestys principal secretaries of state mr whitehead afterward poet laureat undertook to convey the manuscript to his lordship the consequence was an invitation from lord chesterfield to the author a stronger contrast of characters could not be brought together the nobleman celebrated for his wit and all the graces of polite behavior the author conscious of his own merit towering in idea above all competition versed in scholastic logic but a stranger to the arts of polite conversation uncouth vehement and vociferous the coalition was too unnatural johnson expected a maecenas and was disappointed no patronage no asistance followed visits were repeated but the reception was not cordial johnson one day was left a full hour waiting in an antichamber till a gentleman should retire and leave his lordship at leisure this was the famous colley cibber johnson saw him go and fired with indignation rushed out of the house what lord chesterfield thought of his visitor may be seen in a passage in one of that noblemans letters to his son letter ccxii  there is a man whose moral character deep learning and superior parts i acknowledge admire and respect but whom it is so impossible for me to love that i am almost in a fever whenever i am in his company his figure without being deformed seems made to disgrace or ridicule the common structure of the human body his legs and arms are never in the position which according to the situation of his body they ought to be in but constantly employed in committing acts of hostility upon the graces he throws any where but down his throat whatever he means to drink and mangles what he means to carve inattentive to all the regards of social life he mistimes and misplaces every thing he disputes with heat indiscriminately mindless of the rank character and situation of those with whom he disputes absolutely ignorant of the several gradations of familiarity and respect he is exactly the same to his superiors his equals and his inferiors and therefore by a necessary consequence is absurd to two of the three is it possible to love such a man no the utmost i can do for him is to consider him a respectable hottentot such was the idea entertained by lord chesterfield after the incident of colley cibber johnson never repeated his visits in his high and decisive tone he has been often heard to say lord chesterfield is a wit among lords and a lord among wits  in the course of the year      garrick in conjunction with lacy became patentee of drury lane playhouse for the opening of the theater at the usual time johnson wrote for his friend the wellknown prologue which to say no more of it may at least be placed on a level with popes to the tragedy of cato the playhouse being now under garricks direction johnson thought the opportunity fair to think of his tragedy of irene which was his whole stock on his first arrival in town in the year      that play was accordingly put into rehearsal in january      as a precursor to prepare the way and awaken the public attention the vanity of human wishes a poem in imitation of the tenth satire of juvenal by the author of london was published in the same month in the gentlemans magazine for february      we find that the tragedy of irene was acted at drury lane on monday february the  th and from that time without interruption to monday february the  0th being in all thirteen nights since that time it has not been exhibited on any stage irene may be added to some other plays in our language which have lost their place in the theater but continue to please in the closet during the representation of this piece johnson attended every night behind the scenes conceiving that his character as an author required some ornament for his person he chose upon that occasion to decorate himself with a handsome waistcoat and a goldlaced hat the late mr topham beauclerc who had had a great deal of that humor which pleases the more for seeming undesigned used to give a pleasant description of this greenroom finery as related by the author himself but said johnson with great gravity i soon laid aside my goldlaced hat lest it should make me proud the amount of the three benefit nights for the tragedy of irene it is to be feared was not very considerable as the profit that stimulating motive never invited the author to another dramatic attempt some years afterward when the present writer was intimate with garrick and knew johnson to be in distress he asked the manager why he did not produce another tragedy for his lichfield friend garricks answer was remarkable when johnson writes tragedy declamation roars and passion sleeps when shakspeare wrote he dipped his pen in his own heart  there may perhaps be a degree of sameness in this regular way of tracing an author from one work to another and the reader may feel the effect of a tedious monotony but in the life of johnson there are no other landmarks he was now forty years old and had mixed but little with the world he followed no profession transacted no business and was a stranger to what is called a townlife we are now arrived at the brightest period he had hitherto known his name broke out upon mankind with a degree of luster that promised a triumph over all his difficulties the life of savage was admired as a beautiful and instructive piece of biography the two imitations of juvenal were thought to rival even the excellence of pope and the tragedy of irene though uninteresting on the stage was universally admired in the closet for the propriety of the sentiments the richness of the language and the general harmony of the whole composition his fame was widely diffused and he had made his agreement with the booksellers for his english dictionary at the sum of fifteen hundred guineas part of which was to be from time to time advanced in proportion to the progress of the work this was a certain fund for his support without being obliged to write fugitive pieces for the petty supplies of the day accordingly we find that in      he established a club consisting of ten in number at horsemans in ivylane on every tuesday evening this is the first scene of social life to which johnson can be traced out of his own house the members of this little society were samuel johnson dr salter father of the late master of the charter house dr hawkesworth mr ryland a merchant mr pain a bookseller in paternosterrow mr samuel dyer a learned young man dr william mghie a scotch physician dr edmund barker a young physician dr bathurst another young physician and sir john hawkins this list is given by sir john as it should seem with no other view than to draw a spiteful and malevolent character of almost every one of them mr dyer whom sir john says he loved with the affection of a brother meets with the harshest treatment because it was his maxim that to live in peace with mankind and in a temper to do good offices was the most essential part of our duty that notion of moral goodness gave umbrage to sir john hawkins and drew down upon the memory of his friend the bitterest imputations mr dyer however was admired and loved through life he was a man of literature johnson loved to enter with him into a discussion of metaphysical moral and critical subjects in those conflicts exercising his talents and according to his custom always contending for victory dr bathurst was the person on whom johnson fixed his affection he hardly ever spoke of him without tears in his eyes it was from him who was a native of jamaica that johnson received into his service frank the black servant whom on account of his master he valued to the end of his life at the time of instituting the club in ivylane johnson had projected the rambler the title was most probably suggested by the wanderer a poem which he mentions with the warmest praise in the life of savage with the same spirit of independence with which he wished to live it was now his pride to write he communicated his plan to none of his friends he desired no assistance relying entirely on his own fund and the protection of the divine being which he implored in a solemn form of prayer composed by himself for the occasion having formed a resolution to undertake a work that might be of use and honor to his country he thought with milton that this was not to be obtained but by devout prayer to that eternal spirit that can enrich with all utterance and knowledge and send out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases  having invoked the special protection of heaven and by that act of piety fortified his mind he began the great work of the rambler the first number was published on tuesday march the  0th    0 and from that time was continued regularly every tuesday and saturday for the space of two years when it finally closed on saturday march         as it began with motives of piety so it appears that the same religious spirit glowed with unabating ardour to the last his conclusion is the essays professedly serious if i have been able to execute my own intentions will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of christianity without any accommodation to the licentiousness and levity of the present age i therefore look back on this part of my work with pleasure which no man shall diminish or augment i shall never envy the honors which wit and learning obtain in any other cause if i can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue and confidence to truth the whole number of essays amounted to two hundred and eight addisons in the spectator are more in number but not half in point of quantity addison was not bound to publish on stated days he could watch the ebb and flow of his genius and send his paper to the press when his own taste was satisfied johnsons case was very different he wrote singly and alone in the whole progress of the work he did not receive more than ten essays this was a scanty contribution for the rest the author has described his fituation he that condemns himself to compose on a stated day will often bring to his task an attention dissipated a memory embarrassed an imagination overwhelmed a mind distracted with anxieties a body languishing with disease he will labor on a barren topic till it is too late to change it or in the ardour of invention diffuse his thoughts into wild exuberance which the pressing hour of publication cannot suffer judgment to examine or reduce of this excellent production the number sold on each day did not amount to five hundred of course the bookseller who paid the author four guineas a week did not carry on a successful trade his generosity and perseverance deserve to be commended and happily when the collection appeared in volumes were amply rewarded johnson lived to see his labors flourish in a tenth edition his posterity as an ingenious french writer has said on a similar occasion began in his lifetime  in the beginning of    0 soon after the rambler was set on foot johnson was induced by the arts of a vile impostor to lend his assistance during a temporary delusion to a fraud not to be paralleled in the annals of literature one lauder a native of scotland who had been a teacher in the university of edinburgh had conceived a mortal antipathy to the name and character of milton his reason was because the prayer of pamela in sir philip sidneys arcadia was as he supposed maliciously inserted by the great poet in an edition of the eikon basilike in order to fix an imputation of impiety on the memory of the murdered king fired with resentment and willing to reap the profits of a gross imposition this man collected from several latin poets such as masenius the jesuit staphorstius a dutch divine beza and others all such passages as bore any kind of resemblance to different places in the paradise lost and these he published from time to time in the gentlemans magazine with occasional interpolations of lines which he himself translated from milton the public credulity swallowed all with eagerness and milton was supposed to be guilty of plagiarism from inferior modern writers the fraud succeeded so well that lauder collected the whole into a volume and advertised it under the title of an essay on miltons use and imitation of the moderns in his paradise lost dedicated to the universities of oxford and cambridge while the book was in the press the proofsheets were shown to johnson at the ivylane club by pain the bookleller who was one of the members no man in that society was in possession of the authors from whom lauder professed to make his extracts the charge was believed and the contriver of it found his way to johnson who is represented by sir john hawkins not indeed as an accomplice in the fraud but through motives of malignity to milton delighting in the detection and exulting that the poets reputation would suffer by the discovery more malice to a deceased friend cannot well be imagined hawkins adds that he wished well to the argument must be inferred from the preface which indubitably was written by him the preface it is well known was written by johnson and for that reason is inserted in this edition but if johnson approved of the argument it was no longer than while he believed it founded in truth let us advert to his own words in that very preface among the enquiries to which the ardour of criticism has naturally given occasion none is more obscure in itself or more worthy of rational curiosity than a retrospection of the progress of this mighty genius in the construction of his work a view of the fabric gradually rising perhaps from small beginnings till its foundation rests in the center and its turrets sparkle in the skies to trace back the structure through all its varieties to the simplicity of the first plan to find what was projected whence the scheme was taken how it was improved by what assistance it was executed and from what stores the materials were collected whether its founder dug them from the quarries of nature or demolished other buildings to embellish his own these were the motives that induced johnson to assist lauder with a preface and are not these the motives of a critic and a scholar what reader of taste what man of real knowledge would not think his time well employed in an enquiry so curious so interesting and instructive if lauders facts were really true who would not be glad without the smalest tincture of malevolence to receive real information it is painful to be thus obliged to vindicate a man who in his heart towered above the petty arts of fraud and imposition against an injudicious biographer who undertook to be his editor and the protector of his memory another writer dr towers in an essay on the life and character of dr johnson seems to countenance this calumny he says it can hardly be doubted but that johnsons aversion to miltons politics was the cause of that alacrity with which he joined with lauder in his infamous attack on our great epic poet and which induced him to assist in that transaction these words would seem to describe an accomplice were they not immediately followed by an express declaration that johnson was unacquainted with the imposture dr towers adds it seems to have been by way of making some compensation to the memory of milton for the share he had in the attack of lauder that johnson wrote the prologue spoken by garrick at drury lane theater    0 on the performance of the masque of comus for the benefit of miltons granddaughter dr towers is not free from prejudice but as shakspeare has it he begets a temperance to give it smoothness he is therefore entitled to a dispassionate answer when johnson wrote the prologue it does appear that he was aware of the malignant artifices practiced by lauder in the postscript to johnsons preface a subscription is proposed for relieving the granddaughter of the author of paradise lost dr towers will agree that this shows johnsons alacrity in doing good that alacrity showed itself again in the letter printed in the european magazine january      and there said to have appeared originally in the general advertiser  th april    0 by which the public were invited to embrace the opportunity of paying a just regard to the illustrious dead united with the pleasure of doing good to the living the letter adds to assist industrious indigence struggling with distress and debilitated by age is a display of virtue and an acquisition of happiness and honor whoever therefore would be thought capable of pleasure in reading the works of our incomparable milton and not so destitute of gratitude as to refuse to lay out a trifle in a rational and elegant entertainment for the benefit of his living remains for the exercise of their own virtue the increase of their reputation and the consciousness of doing good should appear at drury lane theater tomorrow april   when comus will be performed for the benefit of mrs elizabeth foster granddaughter to the author and the only surviving branch of his family nota been there will be a new prologue on the occasion written by the author of irene and spoken by mr garrick the man who had thus exerted himself to serve the granddaughter cannot be supposed to have entertained personal malice to the grandfather it is true that the malevolence of lauder as well as the impostures of archibald bower were fully detected by the labors in the cause of truth of the rev dr douglas now lord bishop of salisbury   diram qui contudit hydram notaque fatali portenta labor subegit but the pamphlet entitled milton vindicated from the charge of plagiarism brought against him by mr lauder and lauder himself convicted of several forgeries and gross impositions on the public by john douglas m a rector of eaton constantine salop was not published till the year      in that work p    dr douglas says it is to be hoped nay it is expected that the elegant and nervous writer whose judicious sentiments and inimitable style point out the author of lauders preface and postscript will no longer allow a man to plume himself with his feathers who appears so little to have deserved his assistance an assistance which i am persuaded would never have been communicated had there been the least suspicion of those facts which i have been the instrument of conveying to the world we have here a contemporary testimony to the integrity of dr johnson throughout the whole of that vile transaction what was the consequence of the requisition made by dr douglas johnson whose ruling passion may be said to be the love of truth convinced lauder that it would be more for his interest to make a full confession of his guilt than to stand forth the convicted champion of a lie and for this purpose he drew up in the strongest terms a recantation in a letter to the rev mr douglas which lauder signed and published in the year      that piece will remain a lasting memorial of the abhorrence with which johnson beheld a violation of truth mr nichols whose attachment to his illustrious friend was unwearied showed him in    0 a book called remarks on johnsons life of milton in which the affair of lauder was renewed with virulence and a poetical scale in the literary magazine      when johnson had ceased to write in that collection was urged as an additional proof of deliberate malice he read the libellous passage with attention and instantly wrote on the margin in the business of lauder i was deceived partly by thinking the man too frantic to be fraudulent of the poetical scale quoted from the magazine i am not the author i fancy it was put in after i had quitted that work for i not only did not write it but i do not remember it as a critic and a scholar johnson was willing to receive what numbers at the time believed to be true information when he found that the whole was a forgery he renounced all connection with the author  in march      he felt a severe stroke of affliction in the death of his wife the last number of the rambler as already mentioned was on the   th of that month the loss of mrs johnson was then approaching and probably was the cause that put an end to those admirable periodical essays it appears that she died on the   th of march in a memorandum at the foot of the prayers and meditations that is called her dying day she was buried at bromley under the care of dr hawkesworth johnson placed a latin inscription on her tomb in which he celebrated her beauty with the singularity of his prayers for his deceased wife from that time to the end of his days the world is sufficiently acquainted on easterday   d april      his memorandum says thought on tetty poor dear tetty with my eyes full went to church after sermon i recommended tetty in a prayer by herself and my father mother brother and bathurst in another i did it only once so far as it might be lawful for me in a prayer january         the day on which his mother was buried he commends as far as may be lawful her soul to god imploring for her whatever is most beneficial to her in her present state in this habit he perservered to the end of his days the rev mr strahan the editor of the prayers and meditation observes that johnson on some occasions prays that the almighty may have had merry on his wife and mr thrale evidently sapposing their sentence to have been already passed in the divine mind and by consequence proving that he had no belief in a state of purgatory and no reason for praying for the dead that could impeach the sincerity of his profession as a protestant mr strahan adds that in praying for the regretted tenants of the grave johnson conformed to a practice which has been retained by many learned members of the established church though the liturgy no longer admits it if where the tree salleth there it shall be if our state at the close of life is to be the measure of our final sentence then prayers for the dead being visibly fruitless can be regarded only as the vain oblations of superstition but of all superstitions this perhaps is one of the least unamiable and most incident to a good mind if our sensations of kindness be intense those whom we have revered and loved death cannot wholly seclude from our concern it is true for the reason just mentioned such evidences of our surviving affection may be thought illjudged but surely they are generous and some natural tenderness is due even to a superstition which thus originates in piety and benevolence these sentences extracted from the rev mr strahans preface if they are not a full justisication are at least a beautiful apology it will not be improper to add what johnson himself has said on the subject being asked by mr boswell life of johnson vol i p      what he thought of purgatory as believed by the roman catholics his answer was it is a very harmless doctrine they are of opinion that the generality of mankind are neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting punishment nor so good as to merit being admitted into the society of blessed spirits and therefore that god is graciously pleased to allow a middle state where they may be purified by certain degrees of suffering you see there is nothing unreasonable in this and if it be once established that there are souls in purgatory it is as proper to pray for them as for our brethren of mankind who are yet in this life this was dr johnsons guess into futurity and to guess is the utmost that man can do shadows clouds and darkness rest upon it  mrs johnson left a daughter lucy porter by her first husband she had contracted a friendship with mrs anne williams the daughter of zachary williams a physician of eminence in south wales who had devoted more than thirty years of a long life to the study of the longitude and was thought to have made great advances toward that important discovery his letters to lord halifax and the lords of the admiralty partly corrected and partly written by dr johnson are still extant in the hands of mr nichols see gentlemans magazine for nov and dec       we there find dr williams in the eightythird year of his age stating that he had prepared an instrument which might be called an epitome or miniature of the terraqueous globe sliewing with the assistance of tables constructed by himself the variations of the magnetic needle and ascertaining the longitude for the safety of navigation it appears that this scheme had been referred to sir isaac newton but that great philosopher excusing himself on account of his advanced age all applications were useless till      when the subject was referred by order of lord anson to dr bradley the celebrated professor of asironomy his report was unfavourable ibid for dec      p  0    though it allows that a considerable progress had been made dr williams after all his labor and expense died in a short time after a melancholy instance of unrewarded merit his daughter possessed uncommon talents and though blind had an alacrity of mind that made her conversation agreeable and even desirable to relieve and appease melancholy reflections johnson took her home to his house in goughsquare in      garrick gave her a benefitplay which produced two hundred pounds in      she published by subscription a quarto volume of miscellanies and incrensed her little stock to three hundred pounds that fund with johnsons protection supported her through the remainder of her life  during the two years in which the rambler was carried on the dictionary proceeded by slow degrees in may      having composed a prayer preparatory to his return from tears and sorrow to the duties of life he resumed his grand design and went on with vigor giving however occasional assistance to his friend dr hawkesworth in the adventurer which began soon after the rambler was laid aside some of the most valuable essays in that collection were from the pen of johnson the dictionary was completed toward the end of      and cave being then no more it was a mortification to the author of that noble addition to our language that his old friend did not live to fee the triumph of his labors in may      that great work was published johnson was desirous that it should come from one who had obtained academical honors and for that purpose his friend the rev thomas warton obtained for him in the preceding month of february a diploma for a matters degree from the university of oxford garrick on the publication of the dictionary wrote the following lines  talk of war with a briton he ll boldly advance that one english soldier can beat ten of france would we alter the boast from the sword to the pen our odds are still greater still greater our men in the deep mines of science though frenchmen may toil can their strength be compared to lock newton or boil let them rally their heroes send forth all their powers their versemen and prosemen then match them with ours first shakspeare and milton like gods in the fight have put their whole drama and epic to slight in satires epistles and odes would they cope their numbers retreat before dryden and pope and johnson well armed like a hero of yore has beat forty french and will beat forty more it is perhaps needless to mention that forty was the number of the french academy at the time when their dictionary was published to settle their language  in the course of the winter preceding this grand publication the late earl of chesterfield gave two essays in the periodical paper called the world dated november    and december        to prepare the public for so important a work the original plan addressed to his lordship in the year      is there mentioned in terms of the highest praise and this was understood at the time to be a courtly way of soliciting a dedication of the dictionary to himself johnson treated this civility with disdain he said to garrick and others i have sailed a long and painful voyage round the world of the english langunge and does he now send out two cockboats to tow me into harbor he had said in the last number of the rambler that having labored to maintain the dignity of virtue i will not now degrade it by the meanness of dedication such a man when he had finished his dictionary not as he says himself in the soft obscurities of retirement or under the shelter of academic bowers but amidst inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow and without the patronage of the great was not likely to be caught by the lure thrown out by lord chesterfield he had in vain sought the patronage of that nobleman and his pride exasperated by disappointment drew from him the following letter dated in the month of february       to the right honorable the earl of chesterfield my lord i have been lately informed by the proprietors of the world that two papers in which my dictionary is recommended to the public were written by your lordship to be so distinguished is an honor which being very little accustomed to favors from the great i know not well how to receive or in what terms to acknowledge  when upon some slight encouragement i first visited your lordship i was overpowered like the rest of mankind by the enchantment of your address and could not forbear to wish that i might boast myself le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre that i might obtain that regard for which i saw the world contending but i found my attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it when i had once addressed your lordship in public i had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly scholar can possess i had done all that i could and no man is well pleased to have his all neglected be it ever so little  seven years my lord have now passed since i waited in your outward room or was repulsed from your door during which time i have been pushing on my work through difficulties of which it is useless to complain and have brought it at last to the verge of publication without one act of assistance one word of encouragement or one smile of favor such treatment i did not expect for i never had a patron before  the shepherd in virgil grew acquainted with love and found him a native of the rocks  is not a patron my lord one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water and when has he reached ground encumbers him with help the notice which you have been pleased to take of my labors had it been early had been kind but it has been delayed till i am indifferent and cannot enjoy it till i am solitary and cannot impart it till i am known and do not want it i hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no benefit has been received or to be unwilling that the public should consider me as owing that to a patron which providence has enabled me to do for myself  having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of learning i shall not be disappointed though i should conclude it if less be possible with less for i have been long wakened from that dream of hope in which i once boasted myself with fo much exultation  my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant samuel johnson   it is said upon good authority that johnson once received from lord chesterfield the sum of ten pounds it were to be wished that the secret had never transpired it was mean to receive it and meaner to give it it may be imagined that for johnsons ferocity as it has been called there was some foundation in his finances and as his dictionary was brought to a conclusion that money was now to flow in upon him the reverse was the case for his subsistence during the progress of the work he had received at different times the amount of his contract and when his receipts were produced to him at a taverndinner given by the booksellers it appeared that he had been paid a hundred pounds and upwards more than his due the author of a book called lexiphanes written by a mr campbell a scotchman and purser of a man of war endeavored to blast his laurels but in vain the world applauded and johnson never replied abuse he said is often of service there is nothing so dangerous to an author as silence his name like a shuttlecock must be beat backward and forward or it falls to the ground lexiphanes professed to be an imitation of the pleasant manner of lucian but humor was not the talent of the writer of lexiphanes as dryden says he had too much horseplay in his raillery  it was in the summer      that the present writer became acquainted with dr johnson the cause of his first visit is related by mrs piozzi nearly in the following manner mr murphy being engaged in a periodical paper the graysinn journal was at a friends house in the country and not being disposed to lose pleasure for business wished to content his bookseller by some unstudied essay he therefore took up a french journal literaire and translating something he liked sent it away to town time however discovered that he translated from the french a rambler which had been taken from the english without acknowledgement upon this discovery mr murphy thought it right to make his excuses to dr johnson he went next day and found him covered with soot like a chimneysweeper in a little room as if he had been acting lungs in the alchymist making ether this being told by mr murphy in company come come said dr johnson the story is black enough but it was a happy day that brought you first to my house after this first visit the author of this narrative by degrees grew intimate with dr johnson the first striking sentence that he heard from him was in a few days after the publication of lord bolingbrokes posthumous works mr garrick asked him if he had seen them yes i have seen them what do you think of them think of them he made a long pause and then replied think of them a scoundrel and a coward a scoundrel who spent his life in charging a gun against christianity and a coward who was afraid of hearing the report of his own gun but left half a crown to a hungry scotchman to draw the trigger after his death his mind at this time strained and overlaboured by constant exertion called for an interval of repose and indolence but indolence was the time of danger it was then that his spirits not employed abroad turned with inward hostility against himself his reflections on his own life and conduct were always severe and wishing to be immaculate he destroyed his own peace by unnecessary scruples he tells us that when he surveyed his past life he discovered nothing but a barren waste of time with some disorders of body and disturbances of mind very near to madness his life he says from his earliest years was wasted in a morning bed and his reigning sin was a general sluggishness to which he was always inclined and in part of his life almost compelled by morbid melancholy and weariness of mind this was his constitutional malady derived perhaps from his father who was at times overcast with a gloom that bordered on insanity when to this it is added that johnson about the age of twenty drew up a description of his infirmities for dr swinfen at that time an eminent physician in staffordshire and received an answer to his letter importing that the symptoms indicated a future privation of reason who can wonder that he was troubled with melancholy and dejection of spirit an apprehension of the worst calamity that can befall human nature hung over him all the rest of his life like the sword of the tyrant suspended over his guest in his sixtieth year he had a mind to write the history of his melancholy but he desisted not knowing whether it would not too much disturb him in a latin poem however to which he has prefixed as a title  he has left a picture of himself drawn with as much truth and as firm a hand as can be seen in the portraits of hogarth or sir joshua reynolds the learned reader will find the original poem in this volume p     and it is hoped that a translation or rather imitation of so curious a piece will not be improper in this place  know yourself after revising and enlarging the english lexicon or dictionary when scaliger whole years of labor past beheld his lexicon complete at last and weary of his task with wondering eyes saw from words pild on words a fabric rise he cursed the industry inertly strong in creeping toil that could persist so long and if enraged he cried heaven meant to shed its keenest vengeance on the guilty head the drudgery of words the damned would know doomed to write lexicons in endless woe see scaligers epigram on this subject communicated with out doubt by dr johnson gent mag      p    yes you had cause great genius to repent you lost good days that might be better spent you well might grudge the hours of lingering pain and view your learned labors with disdain to you were given the large expanded mind the flame of genius and the taste refined twas yours on eagle wings aloft to soar and amidst rolling worlds the great first cause explore to fix the aeras of recorded time and live in every age and every clime record the chiefs who propt their countrys cause who founded empires and established laws to learn whatever the sage with virtue fraught whatever the muse of moral wisdom taught these were your quarry these to you were known and the worlds ample volume was your own yet warned by me ye pigmy wits beware nor with immortal scaliger compare for me though his example strike my view oh not for me his footsteps to pursue whether first nature unpropitious cold this clay compounded in a ruder mould or the slow current loitring at my heart no gleam of wit or fancy can impart whatever the cause from me no numbers flow no visions warm me and no raptures glow a mind like scaligers superior still no grief could conquer no misfortune chill though for the maze of words his native skies he seemed to quit twas but again to rise to mount once more to the bright source of day and view the wonders of thaetherial way the love of fame his generous bosom fired each science hailed him and each muse inspired for him the sons of learning trimmed the bays and nations grew harmonious in his praise my talk performed and all my labors over for me what lot has fortune now in store the listless will succeeds that worst disease the rack of indolence the sluggish ease care grows on care and over my aching brain black melancholy pours her morbid train no kind relief no lenitive at hand i seek at midnight clubs the social band but midnight clubs where wit with noise conspires where comus revels and where wine inspires delight no more i seek my lonely bed and call on sleep to sooth my languid head but sleep from these sad lids flies far away i mourn all night and dread the coming day exhausted tired i throw my eyes around to find some vacant spot on classic ground and soon vain hope i form a grand design languor succeeds and all my powers decline if science open not her richest vein without materials all our toil is vain a form to rugged stone when phidias gives beneath his touch a new creation lives remove his marble and his genius dies with nature then no breathing statue vies whatever i plan i feel my powers confined by fortunes frown and penury of mind i boast no knowledge gleaned with toil and strife that bright reward of a wellacted life i view myself while reasons feeble light shoots a pale glimmer through the gloom of night while passions error phantoms of the brain and vain opinions fill the dark domain a dreary void where fears with grief combined waste all within and desolate the mind what then remains must i in slow decline to mute inglorious ease old age resign or bold ambition kindling in my breast attempt some arduous task or were it best brooding over lexicons to pas the day and in that labor drudge my life away such is the picture for which dr johnson sat to himself he gives the prominent features of his character his lassitude his morbid bid melancholy his love of fame his dejection his tavernparties and his wandering reveries vacuae mala somnia mentis about which so much has been written all are painted in miniature but in vivid colors by his own hand his idea of writing more dictionaries was not merely said in verse mr hamilton who was at that time an eminent printer and well acquainted with dr johnson remembers that he engaged in a commercial dictionary and as appears by the receipt in his possession was paid his price for several sheets but he soon relinquished the undertaking it is probable that he found himself not suffiently versed in that branch of knowledge  he was again reduced to the expedient of short compositions for the supply of the day the writer of this narrative has now before him a letter in dr johnsons handwriting which shows the distress and melancholy situation of the man who had written the rambler and finished the great work of his dictionary the letter is directed to mr richardson the author of clarissa and is as follows  sir i am obliged to entreat your assistance i am now under an arrest for five pounds eighteen shillings mr strahan from whom i should have received the necessary help in this case is not at home and i am afraid of not finding mr millar if you will be so good as to send me this sum i will very gratefully repay you and add it to all former obligations i am sir  your most obedient and most humble servant samuel johnson goughsquare    march  in the margin of this letter there is a memorandum in these words march         sent six guineas witness wm richardson for the honor of an admired writer it is to be regretted that we do not find a more liberal entry to his friend in distress he sent eight shillings more than was wanted had an incident of this kind occurred in one of his romances richardson would have known how to grace his hero but in fictitious scenes generosity costs the writer nothing  about this time johnson contributed several papers to a periodical miscellany called the visitor from motives which are highly honorable to him a compassionate regard for the late mr christopher smart the criticism on popes epitaphs appeared in that work in a short time after he became a reviewer in the literary magazine under the auspices of the late mr newbery a man of a projecting head good taste and great industry this employment engrossed but little of johnsons time he resigned himself to indolence took no exercise rose about two and then received the visits of his friends authors long since forgotten waited on him as their oracle and he gave responses in the chair of criticism he listened to the complaints the schemes and the hopes and fears of a crowd of inferior writers who he said in the words of roger ascham lived men know not how and died obscure men marked not when he believed that he could give a better history of grubstreet than any man living his house was filled with a succession of visitors till four or five in the evening during the whole time he presided at his teatable tea was his favorite beverage and when the late jonas hanway pronounced his anathema against the use of tea johnson rose in defense of his habitual practice declaring himself in that article a hardened sinner who had for years diluted his meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant whose teakettel had no time to cool who with tea solaced the midnight hour and with tea welcomed the morning  the proposal for a new edition of shakspeare which had formerly miscarried was resumed in the year      the booksellers readily agreed to his terms and subscriptiontickets were issued out for undertaking this work money he confessed was the inciting motive his friends exerted themselves to promote his interest and in the mean time he engaged in a new periodical production called the idler the first number appeared on saturday april         and the last april      0 the profits of this work and the subscriptions for the new edition of shakspeare were the means by which he supported himself for four or five years in      was published rasselas prince of abyssinia his translation of lobos voyage to abyssinia seems to have pointed out that country for the scene of action and rassila christos the general of sultan segued mentioned in that work most probably suggested the name of the prince the author wanted to set out on a journey to lichfield in order to pay the last offices of filial piety to his mother who at the age of ninety was then near her dissolution but money was necessary mr johnston a bookseller who has long since left off business gave one hundred pounds for the copy with this supply johnson set out for lichfield but did not arrive in time to close the eyes of a parent whom he loved he attended the funeral which as appears among his memorandums was on the   d of january       johnson now found it necessary to retrench lis expenses he gave up his house in goughsquare mrs williams went into lodgings he retired to graysinn and soon removed to chambers in the inner templelane where he lived in poverty total idleness and the pride of literature magni stat nominis umbrd mr fitzherbert the father of lord st helens the present minister at madrid a man distinguished through life for his benevolence and other amiable qualities used to say that he paid a morning visit to johnson intending from his chambers to send a letter into the city but to his great surprise he found an author by profession without pen ink or paper the present bishop of salisbury was also among those who endeavored by constant attention to sooth the cares of a mind which he knew to be afflicted with gloomy apprehensions at one of the parties made at his house boscovich the jesuit who had then lately introduced the newtonian philosophy at rome and after publishing an elegant latin poem on the subject was made a fellow of the royal society was one of the company invited to meet dr johnson the conversation at first was mostly in french johnson though thoroughly versed in that language and a professed admirer of boileau and la bruyere did not understand its pronunciation nor could he speak it himself with propriety for the rest of the evening the talk was in latin boscovich had a ready current flow of that flimsy phraseology with which a priest may travel through italy spain and germany johnson scorned what he called colloquial barbarisms it was his pride to speak his best he went on after a little practice with as much facility as if it was his native tongue one sentence this writer well remembers observing that fontinelle at first opposed the newtonian philosophy and embraced it afterward his words were fontinellus ni fallor in extrema senectute fuit transfuga ad castra newtoniana  we have now traveled through that part of dr johnsons life which was a perpetual struggle with difficulties halcyon days are now to open upon him in the month of may      his majesty to reward literary merit signified his pleasure to grant to johnson a pension of three hundred pounds a year the earl of bute was minister lord loughborongh who perhaps was originally a mover in the business had authority to mention it he was well acquainted with johnson but having heard much of his independent spirit and of the downfall of osborne the bookseller he did not know but his benevolence might be rewarded with a folio on his head he desired the author of these memoirs to undertake the task this writer thought the opportunity of doing so much good the most happy incident in his life he went without delay to the chambers in the inner templelane which in fact were the abode of wretchedness by slow and studied approaches the message was disclosed johnson made a long pause he asked if it was seriously intended he fell into a profound meditation and his own definition of a pensioner occurred to him he was told that he at least did not come within the definition he desired to meet next day and dine at the mitre tavern at that meeting he gave up all his scruples on the following day lord loughborough conducted him to the earl of bute the conversation that passed was in the evening related to this writer by dr johnson he expressed his sense of his majestys bounty and thought himself the more highly honored as the favor was not bestowed on him for having dipped his pen in faction no sir said lord bute it is not offered to you for having dipped your pen in faction nor with a design that you ever should sir john hawkins will have it that after this interview johnson was often pressed to wait on lord bute but with a sullen spirit refused to comply however that be johnson was never heard to utter a disrespectful word of that nobleman the writer of this essay remembers a circumstance which may throw some light on this subject the late dr rose of chiswick whom johnson loved and respected contended for the preeminence of the scotch writers and fergusons book on civil society then on the eve of publication he said would give the laurel to north britain alas what can he do upon that subject said johnson aristotle polybius grotius puffendorf and burlemaqui have reaped in that field before him he will treat it said dr rose in a new manner a new manner buckinger had no hands and he wrote his name with his toes at charingcross for half a crown apiece that was a new manner of writing dr rose replied if that will not satisfy you i will name a writer whom you must allow to be the best in the kingdom who is that the earl of bute when he wrote an order for your pension there sir said johnson you have me in the toil to lord bute i must allow whatever praise you may claim for him ingratitude was no part of johnsons character  being now in the possession of a regular income johnson left his chambers in the temple and once more became master of a house in johnsonscourt fleet street dr levet his friend and physician in ordinary paid his daily visits with assiduity made tea all the morning talked what he had to say and did not expect an answer mrs williams had her apartment in the house and entertained her benefactor with more enlarged conversation chemistry was part of johnsons amusement for this love of experimental philosophy sir john hawkins thinks an apology necessary he tells us with great gravity that curiosity was the only object in view not an intention to grow suddenly rich by the philosophers stone or the transmutation of metals to enlarge his circle johnson once more had recourse course to a literary club this was at the turks head in gerrardstreet soho on every tuesday evening through the year the members were besides himself the right honorable edmund burke sir joshua reynolds dr nugent dr goldsmith the late mr topham beauclerk mr langton mr chamier sir john hawkins and some others johnsons affection for sir joshua was founded on a long acquaintance and a thorough knowledge of the virtues and amiable qualities of that excellent artist he delighted in the conversation of mr burke he met him for the first time at mr garricks several years ago on the next day he said i suppose murphy you are proud of your countryman cum talis sit utinam noster esset from that time his constant observation was that a man of sense could not meet mr burke by accident under a gateway to avoid a shower without being convinced that he was the first man in england johnson felt not only kindness but zeal and ardour for his friends he did every thing in his power to advance the reputation of dr goldsmith he loved him though he knew his failings and particularly the leaven of envy which corroded the mind of that elegant writer and made him impatient without disguise of the praises bestowed on any person whatever of this infirmity which marked goldsmiths character johnson gave a remarkable instance it happened that he went with sir joshua reynolds and goldsmith to see the fantoccini which were exhibited some years ago in or near the haymarket they admired the curious mechanism by which the puppets were made to walk the stage draw a chair to the table sit down write a letter and perform a variety of other actions with such dexterity that though natures journeymen made the men they imitated humanity to the astonishment of the spectator the entertainment being over the three friends retired to a tavern johnson and sir joshua talked with pleasure of what they had seen and says johnson in a tone of admiration how the little fellow brandished his spontoon there is nothing in it replied goldsmith starting up with impatience give me a spontoon i can do it as well myself  enjoying his amusements at his weekly club and happy in a state of independence johnson gained in the year      another resource which contributed more than any thing else to exempt him from the solicitudes of life he was introduced to the late mr thrale and his family mrs piozzi has related the fact and it is therefore needless to repeat it in this place the author of this narrative looks back to the share he had in that business with selfcongratulation since he knows the tenderness which from that time soothed johnsons cares at streatham and prolonged a valuable life the subscribers to shakspeare began to despair of ever seeing the promised edition to acquit himself of this obligation he went to work unwillingly but proceeded with vigor in the month or october      shakspeare was published and in a short time after the university of dublin sent over a diploma in honorable terms creating him a doctor of laws oxford in eight or ten years afterward followed the example and till then johnson never assumed the title of doctor in      his constitution seemed to be in a rapid decline and that morbid melancholy which often clouded his understanding came upon him with a deeper gloom than ever mr and mrs thrale paid him a visit in this situation and found him on his knees with dr delap the rector of jews in sussex beseeching god to continue to him the use of his understanding mr thrale took him to his house at streatham and johnson from that time became a constant resident in the family he went occasionally to the club in gerardstreet but his head quarters were fixed at streatham an apartment was fitted up for him and the library was greatly enlarged parties were constantly invited from town and johnson was every day at an elegant table with select and polished company whatever could be devised by mr and mrs thrale to promote the happiness and establish the health of their guest was studiously performed from that time to the end of mr thrales life johnson accompanied the family in all their summer excursions to brighthelmstone to wales and to paris it is but justice to mr thrale to say that a more ingenuous frame of mind no man possessed his education at oxford gave him the habits of a gentleman his amiable temper recommended his conversation and the goodness of his heart made him a sincere friend that he was the patron of johnson is an honor to his memory  in petty disputes with contemporary writers or the wits of the age johnson was seldom entangled a single incident of that kind may not be unworthy of notice since it happened with a man of great celebrity in his time a number of friends dined with garrick on a christmas day foot was then in ireland it was said at table that the modern aristophanes so foot was called had been horsewhipped by a dublin apothecary for mimicking him on the stage i wonder said garrick that any man should show so much resentment to foot he has a patent for such liberties nobody ever thought it worth his while to quarrel with him in london i am glad said johnson to find that the man is rising in the world the expression was afterward reported to foot who in return gave out that he would produce the caliban of literature on the stage being informed of this design johnson sent word to foot that the theater being intended for the reformation of vice he would step from the boxes on the stage and correct him before the audience foot knew the intrepidity of his antagonist and abandoned the design no ill will ensued johnson used to say that for broadfaced mirth foot had not his equal  dr johnsons fame excited the curiosity of the king his majesty expressed a desire to see a man of whom extraordinary things were said accordingly the librarian at buckinghamhouse invited johnson to see that elegant collection of books at the same time giving a hint of what was intended his majesty entered the room and among other things asked the author if he meant to give the world any more of his compositions johnson answered that he thought he had written enough and i should think so too replied his majesty if you had not written so well  though johnson thought he had written enough his genius even in spite of bodily sluggishness could not lie still in    0 we find him entering the lists as a political writer the flame of discord that blazed throughout the nation on the expulsion of mr wilkes and the final determination of the house of commons that mr luttrell was duly elected by  0  votes against      spread a general spirit of discontent to allay the tumult dr johnson published the false alarm mrs piozzi informs us that this pamphlet was written at her house between eight oclock on wednesday night and twelve on thursday night this celerity has appeared wonderful to many and some have doubted the truth it may however be placed within the bounds of probability johnson has observed that there are different methods of composition virgil was used to pour out a great number of verses in the morning and pass the day in retrenching the exuberances and correcting inaccuracies and it was popes custom to write his first thoughts in his first words and gradually to amplify decorate rectify and refine them others employ at once memory and invention and with little intermediate use of the pen form and polish large masses by continued meditation and write their productions only when in their opinion they have completed them this last was johnsons method he never took his pen in hand till he had well weighed his subject and grasped in his mind the sentiments the train of argument and the arrangement of the whole as he often thought aloud he had perhaps talked it over to himself this may account for that rapidity with which in general he dispatched his sheets to the press without being at the trouble of a fair copy whatever may be the logic or eloquence of the false alarm the house of commons have since erased the resolution from the journals but whether they have not left materials for a future controversy may be made a question  in      he published another tract on the subject of falkland islands the design was to show the impropriety of going to war with spain for an island thrown aside from human use stormy in winter and barren in summer for this work it is apparent that materials were furnished by direction of the minister  at the approach of the general election in      he wrote a short discourse called the patriot not with any visible application to mr wilkes but to teach the people to reject the leaders of opposition who called themselves patriots in      he undertook a pamphlet of more importance namely taxation no tyranny in answer to the resolutions and address of the american congress the scope of the argument was that distant colonies which had in their assemblies a legislature of their own were notwithstanding liable to be taxed in a british parliament where they had neither peers in one house nor representatives in the other he was of opinion that this country was strong enough to enforce obedience when an englishman he says is told that the americans shoot up like the hydra he naturally considers how the hydra was destroyed the event has shown how much he and the minister of that day were mistaken  the account of the tour to the western islands of scotland which was undertaken in the autumn of      in company with mr boswell was not published till some time in the year      this book has been variously received by some extolled for the elegance of the narrative and the depth of observation on life and manners by others as much condemned as a work of avowed hostility to the scotch nation the praise was beyond all question fairly deserved and the censure on due examination will appear hasty and illfounded that johnson entertained some prejudices against the scotch must not be dissembled it is true as mr boswell says that he thought their success in england exceeded their proportion of real merit and he could not but see in them that nationality which no liberalminded scotsman will deny the author of these memoirs well remembers that johnson one day asked him have you observed the difference between your own country impudence and scottish impudence the answer being in the negative then i will tell you said johnson the impudence of an irishman is the impudence of a fly that buzzes about you and you put it away but it returns again and flutters and teazes you the impudence of a scotsman is the impudence of a leech that fixes and sucks your blood upon another occasion this writer went with him into the shop of davies the bookseller in russel street covent garden davies came running to him almost out of breath with joy the scots gentleman is come sir his principal wish is to see you he is now in the backparlour well well i will see the gentleman said johnson he walked toward the room mr boswell was the person this writer followed with no small curiosity i find said mr boswell that i am come to london at a bad time when great popular prejudice has gone forth against us north britons but when i am talking to you i am talking to a large and liberal mind and you know that i cannot help coming from scotland sir said johnson no more can the rest of your countrymen  he had other reasons that helped to alienate him from the natives of scotland being a cordial wellwisher to the constitution in church and state he did not think that calvin and john knox were proper founders of a national religion he made however a wide distinction between the dissenters of scotland and the separatists of england to the former he imputed no disaffection no want of loyalty their soldiers and their officers had shed their blood with zeal and courage in the service of great britain and the people he used to say were content with their own established modes of worship without wishing in the present age to give any disturbance to the church of england this he was at all times ready to admit and therefore declared that whenever he found a scotchman to whom an englishman was as a scotchman that scotchman should be as an englishman to him in this surely there was no rancour no malevolence the dissenters on this side the tweed appeared to him in a different light their religion he frequently said was too worldly too political too restless and ambitious the doctrine of cashiering kings and erecting on the ruins of the constitution a new form of government which lately issued from their pulpits he always thought was under a calm disguise the principle that lay lurking in their hearts he knew that a wild democracy had overturned king lords and commons and that a set of republican fanatics who would not bow at the name of jesus had taken possession of all the livings and all the parishes in the kingdom that those scenes of horror might never be renewed was the ardent wish of dr johnson and though he apprehended no danger from scotland it is probable that his dislike of calvinism mingled sometimes with his reflections on the natives of that country the association of ideas could net be easily broken but it is well known that he loved and reflected many gentlemen from that part of the island dr robertsons history of scotland and dr beatties essays were subjects of his constant praise m boswell dr rose of chiswick andrew millar mr hamilton the printer and the late mr strahan were among his most intimate friends many others might be added to the list he scorned to enter scotland as a spy though hawkins his biographer and the professing defender of his fame allowed himself leave to represent him in that ignoble character he went into scotland to survey men and manners antiquities fossils and minerals were not within his province he did not visit that country to settle the station of roman camps or the spot where galgacus fought the last battle for public liberty the people their customs and the progress of literature were his objects the civilities which he received in the course of his tour have been repaid with grateful acknowledgement and generally with great elegance of expression his crime is that he found the country bare of trees and he has stated the fact this mr boswell in his tour to the hebrides has told us was resented by his countrymen with anger inflamed to rancour but he admits that there are few trees on the east side of scotland mr pennant in his tour says that in some parts of the eastern side of the country he saw several large plantations of pine planted by gentlemen near their seats and in this respect such a laudable spirit prevails that in another half century it never shall be said to spy the nakedness of the land are you come johnson could not wait for that half century and therefore mentioned things as he found them if in any thing he has been mistaken he has made a fair apology in the last paragraph of his book avowing with candor that he may have been surprised by modes of life and appearances of nature that are familiar to men of wider survey and more varied conversation novelty and ignorance must always be reciprocal and he is conscious that his thoughts on national manners are the thoughts of one who has seen but little  the poems of ossian made a part of johnsons enquiry during his residence in scotland and the hebrides on his return to england november      a storm seemed to be gathering over his head but the cloud never burst and the thunder never fell ossian it is well known was presented to the public as a translation from the earse but that this was a fraud johnson declared without hesitation the earse he says was always oral only and never a written language the welsh and the irish were more cultivated in earse there was not in the world a single manuscript a hundred years old martin who in the last century published an account of the western islands mentions irish but never earse manuscripts to be found in the islands in his time the bards could not read if they could they might probably have written but the bard was a barbarian among barbarians and knowing nothing himself lived with others that knew no more if there is a manuscript from which the translation was made in what age was it written and where is it if it was collected from oral recitation it could only be in detached parts and scattered fragments the whole is too long to be remembered who put it together in its present form for these and such like reasons johnson calls the whole an imposture he adds the editor or author never could show the original nor can it be shown by any other to revenge reasonable incredulity by refusing evidence is a degree of insolence with which the world is not yet acquainted and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt this reasoning carries with it great weight it roused the resentment of mr macpherson he sent a threatening letter to the author and johnson answered him in the rough phrase of stern defiance the two heroes frowned at a distance but never came to action  in the year      the misfortunes of dr dodd excited his compassion he wrote a speech for that unhappy man when called up to receive judgment of death besides two petitions one to the king and another to the queen and a sermon to be preached by dodd to the convicts in newgate it may appear trifling to add that about the same time he wrote a prologue to the comedy of a word to the wise written by hugh kelly the play some years before had been damned by a party on the first night it was revived for the benefit of the authors widow mrs piozzi relates that when johnson was rallied for these exertions so close to one another his answer was when they come to me with a dying parson and a dead staymaker what can a man do we come now to the last of his literary labors at the request of the booksellers he undertook the lives of the poets the first publication was in      and the whole was completed in      in a memorandum of that year he says some time in march he finished the lives of the poets which he wrote in his usual way dilatorily and hastily unwilling to work yet working with vigor and haste in another place he hopes they are written in such a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety that the history of so many men who in their different degrees made themselves conspicuous in their time was not written recently after their deaths seems to be an omission that does no honor to the republic of letters their contemporaries in general looked on with calm indifference and suffered wit and genius to vanish out of the world in total silence unregarded and unlamented was there no friend to pay the tribute of a tear no just observer of life to record the virtues of the deceased was even envy silent it seemed to have been agreed that if an authors works survived the history of the man was to give no moral lesson to afterages if tradition told us that been jonson went to the devil tavern that shakspeare stole deer and held the stirrup at playhouse doors that dryden frequented buttons coffeehouse curiosity was lulled asleep and biography forgot the best part of her function which is to instruct mankind by examples taken from the school of life this task remained for dr johnson when years had rolled away when the channels of information were for the most part choked up and little remained besides doutful anecdote uncertain tradition and vague report  nunc fitus informis premit et deserta vetustas the value of biography has been better understood in other ages and in other countries tacitus informs us that to record the lives and characters of illustrious men was the practice of the roman authors in the early periods of the republic in france the example has been followed fontinells d alembert and monsieur thomas have left models in this kind of composition they have embalmed the dead but it is true that they had incitements and advantages even at a distant day which could not by any diligence be obtained by dr johnson the wits of france had ample materials they lived in a nation of critics who had at heart the honor done to their country by their poets their heroes and their philosophers they had besides an academy of belles lettres where genius was cultivated refined and encouraged they had the tracts the essays and dissertations which remain in the memories of the academy and they had the speeches of the several members delivered at their first admission to a seat in that learned assembly in those speeches the new academician did ample justice to the memory of his predecessor and though his harangue was decorated with the colors of eloquence and was for that reason called panegyric yet being pronounced before qualified judges who knew the talents the conduct and morals of the deceased the speaker could not with propriety wander into the regions of fiction the truth was known before it was adorned the academy saw the marble before the artist polished it but this country has had no academy of literature the public mind for centuries has been engrossed by party and faction by the madness of many for the gain of a few by civil wars religious dissentions trade and commerce and the arts of accumulating wealth amidst such attentions who can wonder that cold praise has been often the only reward of merit in this country doctor nathaniel hodges who like the good bishop of marseilles drew purer breath amidst the contagion of the plague in london and during the whole time continued in the city administering medical assistence was suffered as johnson used to relate with tears in his eyes to die for debt in a gaol in this country the man who brought the new river to london was ruined by that noble project and in this country otway died for want on tower hill butler the great author of hudibras whose name can only die with the english language was left to languish in poverty the particulars of his life almost unknown and scarcs a vestige of him left except his immortal poem had there been an academy of literature the lives at least of those celebrated persons would have been written for the benefit of posterity swift it seems had the idea of such an institution and proposed it to lord oxford but whig and tory were more important objects it is needless to dissemble that dr johnson in the life of roscommon talks of the inutility of such a project in this country he says an academy could be expected to do but little if an academicians place were profitable it would be given by interest if attendance were gratuitous it would be rarely paid and no man would endure the least disgust unanimity is impossible and debate would separate the assembly to this it may be sufficient to answer that the royal society has not been dissolved by sullen disgust and the modern academy at somerset house has already performed much and promises more unanimity is not necessary to such an assembly on the contrary by difference of opinion and collision of sentiment the cause of literature would thrive and flourish the true principles of criticism the secret of fine writing the investigation of antiquities and other interesting subjects might occasion a clash of opinions but in that contention truth would receive illustration and the essays of the several members would supply the memoirs of the academy but says dr johnson suppose the philological decree made and promulgated what would be its authority in absolute government there is sometimes a general reverence paid to all that has the sanction of power the countenance of greatness how little this is the state of our country needs not to be told the edicts of an english academy would probably be read by many only that they may be sure to disobey them the present manners of the nation would deride authority and therefore nothing is left but that every writer should criticize himself this surely is not conclusive it is by the standard of the best writers that every man settles for himself his plan of legitimate composition and since the authority of superior genius is acknowledged that authority which the individual obtains would not be lessened by an association with others of distinguished ability it may therefore be inferred that an academy of literature would be an establishment highly useful and an honor to literature in such an institution profitable places would not be wanted vatis avarus haud facile est animus and the minister who shall find leisure from party and faction to carry such a scheme into execution will in all probability be respected by posterity as the maecenas of letters  we now take leave of dr johnson as an author four volumes of his lives of the poets were published in      and the work was completed in      should biography fall again into disuse there will not always be a johnson to look back through a century and give a body of critical and moral instruction in april      he lost his friend mr thrale his own words in his diary will best tell that melancholy event on wednesday the   th of april was buried my dear friend mr thrale who died on wednesday the  th and with him were buried many of my hopes and pleasures about five i think on wednesday morning he expired i felt almost the last flutter of his pulse and looked for the last time upon the face that for fifteen years before had never been turned upon me but with respect and benignity farewell may god that delights in mercy have had mercy on thee i had constantly prayed for him before his death the decease of him from whose friendship i had obtained many opportunities of amusement and to whom i turned my thoughts as to a refuge from misfortune has left me heavy but my business is with myself from the close of his last work the malady that persecuted him through life came upon him with alarming severity and his constitution declined apace in      his old friend levet expired without warning and without a groan events like these reminded johnson of his own mortality he continued his visits to mrs thrale at streatham to the  th day of october      when having first composed a prayer for the happiness of a family with whom he had for many years enjoyed the pleasures and comforts of life he removed to his own house in town he says he was up early in the morning and read fortuitously in the gospel which was his parting use of the library the merit of the family is manifested by the sense he had of it and we see his heart overflowing with gratitude he leaves the place with regret and casts a lingering look behind  the few remaining occurrences may be soon dispatched in the month of june      johnson had a paralytic stroke which affected his speech only he wrote to dr tailor of westminster and to his friend mr allen the printer who lived at the next door dr brocklesby arrived in a short time and by his care and that of dr heberden johnson soon recovered during his illness the writer of this narrative visited him and found him reading dr watsons chemistry articulating with difficulty he said from this book he who knows nothing may learn a great dealand he who knows will be pleased to find his knowledge recalled to his mind in a manner highly pleasing in the month of august he set out for lichfield on a visit to mrs lucy porter the daughter of his wife by her first husband and in his way back paid his respects to dr adams at oxford mrs williams died at his house in boltcourt in the month of september during his absence this was another shock to a mind like his ever agitated by the thoughts of futurity the contemplation of his own approaching end was constantly before his eyes and the prospect of death he declared was terrible for many years when he was not disposed to enter into the conversation going forward whoever sat near his chair might hear him repeating from shakspeare  ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods  and from milton  who would lose for fear of pain this intellectual being by the death of mrs williams he was left in the a state of destitution with nobody but frank his black servant to sooth his anxious moments in november      he was swelled from head to foot with a drosy dr brocklesby with that benevolence with which he always assists his friends paid his visits with assiduity the medicines prescribed were so efficacious that in a few days johnson while he was offering up his prayers was suddenly obliged to rise and in the course of the day discharged twenty pints of water  johnson being eased of his dropsy began to entertain hopes that the vigor of his constitution was not entirely broken for the sake of conversing with his friends he established a convesation club to meet on every wednesday evening and to serve a man whom he had known in mr thrales household for many years the place was fixed at his house in essex street near the temple to answer the malignant remarks of sir john hawkins on this subject were a wretched waste of time professing to be johnsons friend that biographer has raised more objections to his character than all the enemies of that excellent man sir john had a root of bitterness that put rancours in the vessel of his peace fielding he says was the inventor of a cant phrase goodness of heart which means little more than the virtue of a horse or a dog he should have known that kind affetions are the essence of virtue they are the will of god implanted in our nature to aid and strengthen moral obligation they incite to action a sense of benevolence is no less necessary than a sense of duty good affections are an ornament not only to an author but to his writings he who shows himself upon a cold scent for opportunities to bark and snarl throughout a volume of six hundred pages may if he will pretend to moralize but goodness of heart or to use that politer phrase the virtue of a horse or a dog would redound more to his honor but sir john is no more our business is with johnson the members of his club were respectable for their rank their talents and their literature they attended with punctuality till about midsummer      when with some appearance of health johnson went into derbyshire and thence to lichfield while he was in that part of the world his friends in town were laboring for his benefit the air of a more southern climate they thought might prolong a valuable life but a pension of l  00 a year was a slender fund for a traveling valetudinarian and it was not then known that he had saved a moderate sum of money mr boswell and sir joshua reynolds undertook to solicit the patronage of the chancellor with lord thurlow while he was at the bar johnson was well acquainted he was often heard to say thurlow is a man of such vigor of mind that i never knew i was to meet him but  i was going to say i was afraid but that would not be true for i never was afraid of any man but i never knew that i was to meet thurlow but i knew i had something to encounter the chancellor undertook to recommend johnsons case but without success to protract if possible the days of a man whom he respected he offered to advance the sum of five hundred pounds being informed of this at lichfield johnson wrote the following letter  my lord after a long and not inattentive observation of mankind the generosity of your lordships offer raises in me not less wonder than gratitude bounty so liberally bestowed i should gladly receive if my condition made it necessary for to such a mind who would not be proud to own his obligations but it has pleased god to restore me to so great a measure of health that if i should now appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good i could not escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim my journey to the continent though i once thought it necessary was never much encouraged by my physicians and i was very desirous that your lordship should be told it by sir joshua reynolds as an event very uncertain for if i grew much better i should not be willing if much worse i should not be able to migrate your lordship was first solicited without my knowledge but when i was told that you were pleased to honor me with your patronage i did not expect to hear of a refusal yet as i have had no long time to brood hopes and have not rioted in imaginary opulence this cold reception has been scarce a disappointment and from your lordships kindness i have received a benefit which only men like you are able to bestow i shall now live mihi carior with a higher opinion of my own merit  i am my lord your lordships most obliged most grateful and most humble servant samuel johnson september       we have in this instance the exertion of two congenial minds one with a generous impulse relieving merit in distress and the other by gratitude and dignity of sentiment rising to an equal elevation  it seems however that greatness of mind is not confined to greatness of rank dr brocklesby was not content to assist with his medical art he resolved to minister to his patients mind and pluck from his memory the sorrow which the late refusal from a high quarter might occasion to enable him to visit the south of france in pursuit of health he offered from his own funds an annuity of one hundred pounds payable quarterly this was a sweet oblivious antidote but it was not accepted for the reasons assigned to the chancellor the proposal however will do honor to dr brocklesby as long as liberal sentiment shall be ranked among the social virtues  in the month of october      we find dr johnson corresponding with mr nichols the intelligent compiler of the gentlemans magazine and in the langour of sickness still desirous to contribute all in his power to the advancement of science and useful knowledge he says in a letter to that gentleman dated lichfield october  0 that he should be glad to give so skilful a lover of antiquities any information he adds at ashburne where i had very little company i had the luck to borrow mr bowyers life a book so full of contemporary history that a literary man must find some of his old friends i thought that i could now and then have told you some hints worth your notice we perhaps may talk a life over i hope we shall be much together you must now be to me what you were before and what dear mr allen was besides he was taken unexpectedly away but i think he was a very good man i have made very little progress in recovery i am very weak and very sleepless but i live on and hope  in that languid condition he arrived on the   th of november at his house in boltcourt there to end his days he labored with the dropsy and an asthma he was attended by dr heberden dr warren dr brocklesby dr butter and mr cruikshank the eminent surgeon eternity presented to his mind an aweful prospect and with as much virtue as perhaps ever is the lot of man he shuddered at the thought of his dissolution his friends awakened the comfortable reflection of a wellspent life and as his end drew near they had the satisfaction of seeing him composed and even cheerful insomuch that he was able in the course of his restless nights to make translations of greek epigrams from the anthologia and to compose a latin epitaph for his father his mother and his brother nathaniel he meditated at the same time a latin inscription to the memory of garrick but his vigor was exhausted  his love of literature was a passion that stuck to his last sand seven days before his death he wrote the following letter to his friend mr nichols  sir the late learned mr swinton of oxford having one day remarked that one man meaning i suppose no man but himself could assign all the parts of the ancient universal history to their proper authors at the request of sir robert chambers or myself gave the account which i now transmit to you in his own hand being willing that of so great a work the history should be known and that each writer should receive his due proportion of praise from posterity  i recommend to you to preserve this scrap of literary intelligence in mr swintons own hand or to deposit in the museum it is there deposited j n  that the veracity of this account may never be doubted  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson dec        mr swinton the history of the carthaginians  numidians  mauritanians  gaetulians  garamantes  melano gaetulians  nigritae  cyrenaica  marmarica the history of the regio syrtica  turks tartars and moguls  indians  chinese  dissertation on the peopling of america the history of the dissertation on the independency of the arabs the cosmogony and a small part of the history immediately following by mr sale to the birth of abraham chiefly by mr shelvock history of the jews gauls and spaniards by mr psalmanazar xenophons retreat by the same history of the persians and the constantinopolitan empire by dr campbell history of the romans by mr bower before this authentic communication mr nichols had given in the volume of the magazine for      p   0 the following account of the universal history the proposals were published october        and the authors of the first seven volumes were vol   mr sale translator of the koran ii george psalmanazar iii george psalmanazar iii archibald bower captain shelvock dr campbell iv the same as vol iii v mr bower vi mr bower rev john swinton vii mr swinton mr bower      on the morning of dec   dr johnson requested to see mr nichols a few days before he had borrowed some of the early volumes of the magazine with a professed intention to point out the pieces which he had written in that collection the books lay on the table with many leaves doubled down and in particular those which contained his share in the parliamentary debates such was the goodness of johnsons heart that he then declared that those debates were the only parts of his writings which gave him any compunction but that at the time he wrote them he had no conception that he was imposing upon the world though they were frequently written from very slender materials and often from none at all the mere coinage of his own imagination he added that he never wrote any part of his work with equal velocity three columns of the magazine in an hour he said was no uncommon effort which was faster than most persons could have transcribed that quantity in one day in particular and that not a very long one he wrote twelve pages more in quantity than ever he wrote at any other time except in the life of savage of which forty eight pages in octavo were the production of one long day including a part of the night  in the course of the conversation he asked whether any of the family of faden the printer were living being told that the geographer near charing cross was fadens son he said after a short pause i borrowed a guinea of his father near thirty years ago be so good as to take this and pay it for me  wishing to discharge every duty and every obligation johnson recollected another debt of ten pounds which he had borrowed from his friend mr hamilton the printer about twenty years before he sent the money to mr hamilton at his house in bedford row with an apology for the length of time the reverend mr strahan was the bearer of the message about four or five days before johnson breathed his last  mr sastres whom dr johnson esteemed and mentioned in his will entered the room during his illness dr johnson as soon as he saw him stretched forth his hand and in a tone of lamentation called out jam moriturus but the love of life was still an active principle feeling himself swelled with the dropsy he conceived that by incisions in his legs the water might be discharged mr cruikshank apprehended that a mortification might be the consequence but to appease a distempered fancy he gently lanced the surface johnson cried out deeper deeper i want length of life and you are afraid of giving me pain which i do not value  on the  th of december the reverend mr strahan drew his will by which after a few legacies the residue amounting to about fifteen hundred pounds was bequeathed to frank the black servant formerly consigned to the testator by his friend dr bathurst  the history of a deathbed is painful mr strahan informs us that the strength of religion prevailed against the infirmity of nature and his foreboding dread of the divine justice subsided into a pious trust and humble hope of mercy at the throne of grace on monday the   th day of december the last of his existence on this side the grave the desire of life returned with all its former vehemence he still imagined that by puncturing his legs relief might be obtained at eight in the morning he tried the experiment but no water followed in an hour or two after he fell into a doze and about seven in the evening expired without a groan  on the  0th of the month his remains with due solemnities and a numerous attendance of his friends were buried in westminster abbey near the foot of shakspeares monument and close to the grave of the late mr garrick the funeral service was read by his friend dr tailor  a black marble over his grave has the following inscription  samuel johnson ll d   xiii die decembris  anno domini  mdcclxxxiv  aetatis suae lxxv  if we now look back as from an eminence to view the scenes of life and the literary labors in which dr johnson was engaged we may be able to delineate the features of the man and to form an estimate of his genius  as a man dr johnson stands displayed in open day light nothing remains undiscovered whatever he said is known and without allowing him the usual privilege of hazarding sentiments and advancing positions for mere amusement or the pleasure of discussion criticism has endeavored to make him answerable for what perhaps he never seriously thought his diary which has been printed discovers still more we have before us the very heart or the man with all his inward consciousness and yet neither in the open paths of life nor in his secret recesses has any one vice been discovered we see him reviewing every year of his life and severely censuring himself for not keeping resolutions which morbid melancholy and other bodily infirmities rendered impracticable we see him for every little defect imposing on himself voluntary penance going through the day with only one cup of tea without milk and to the last amidst paroxysms and remissions of illness forming plans of study and resolutions to amend his life on the subject of voluntary penance see the rambler no cx many of his scruples may be called weaknesses but they are the weaknesses of a good a pious and most excellent man  his person it is well known was large and unwieldy his nerves were affected by that disorder for which at two years of age he was presented to the royal touch his head shook and involuntary motions made it uncertain that his legs and arms would even at a teatable remain in their proper place a person of lord chesterfields delicacy might in his company be in a fever he would sometimes of his own accord do things inconsistent with the established modes of behavior sitting at table with the celebrated mrs cholmondeley who exerted herself to circulate the  subscription for shakspeare he took hold of her hand in the middle of dinner and held it close to his eye wondering at the delicacy and the whiteness till with a smile she asked will he give it to me again when he has done with it the exteriors of politeness did not belong to johnson even that civility which proceeds or ought to proceed from the mind was sometimes violated his morbid melancholy had an effect on his temper his passions were irritable and the pride of science as well as of a fierce independent spirit inflamed him on some occasions above all bounds of moderation though not in the shade of academic bowers he led a scholastic life and the habit of pronouncing decisions to his friends and visitors gave him a dictatorial manner which was much enforced by a voice naturally loud and often overstretched metaphysical discussion moral theory systems of religion and anecdotes of literature were his favorite topics general history had little of his regard biography was his delight the proper study of mankind is man sooner than hear of the punic war he would be rude to the person that introduced the subject  johnson was born a logician one of those to whom only books of logic are said to be of use in consequence of his skill in that art he loved argumentation no man thought more profoundly nor with such acute discernment a fallacy could not stand before him it was sure to be refuted by strength of reasoning and a precision both in idea and expression almost unequalled when he chose by apt illustration to place the argument of his adversary in a ludicrous light one was almost inclined to think ridicule the test of truth he was surprised to be told but it is certainly true that with great powers of mind wit and humor were his shining talents that he often argued for the sake of a triumph over his adversary cannot be dissembled dr rose of chiswick has been heard to tell of a friend of his who thanked him for introducing him to dr johnson as he had been convinced in the course of a long dispute that an opinion which he had embraced as a settled truth was no better than a vulgar error this being reported to johnson nay said he do not let him be thankful for he was right and i was wrong like his uncle andrew in the ring at smithfield johnson in a circle of disputants was determined neither to be thrown nor conquered notwithstanding all his piety selfgovernment or the command of his passions in conversation does not seem to have been among his seize whenever he thought the contention was for superiority he has been known to break out with violence and even ferocity when the fray was over he generally softened into repentance and by conciliating measures took care that no animosity should be left rankling in the breast of his antagonist of this defect he seems to have been conscious in a letter to mrs thrale he says poor baretti do not quarrel with him to neglect him a little will be sufficient he means only to be frank and manly and independent and perhaps as you say a little wise to be srank he thinks is to be cynical and to be independent is to be rude forgive him dearest lady the rather because of his misbehaviour i am afraid he learned part of me i hope to set him hereafter a better example for his own intolerant and overbearing spirit he apologized by observing that it had done some good obscenity and impiety were repressed in his company  it was late in life before he had the habit of mixing otherwise than occasionally with polite company at mr thrales he saw a constant succession of wellaccomplished visitors in that society he began to wear off the rugged points of his own character he saw the advantages of mutual civility and endeavored to profit by the models before him he aimed at what has been called by swift the lesser morals and by cicero minores virtutes his endeavor though new and late gave pleasure to all his acquaintance men were glad to see that he was willing to be communicative on equal terms and reciprocal complacence the time was then expected when he was to cease being what george garrick brother to the celebrated actor called him the first time he heard him converse a tremendous companion he certainly wished to be polite and even thought himself so but his civility still retained something uncouth and harsh his manners took a milder tone but the endeavor was too palpably seen he labored even in trifles he was a giant gaining a purchase to lift a feather  it is observed by the younger pliny that in the confines of virtue and great qualities there are generally vices of an opposite nature in dr johnson not one ingredient can take the name of vice from his seize in literature grew the pride of knowledge and from his powers of reasoning the love of disputation and the vainglory of superior vigor his piety in some instances bordered on superstition he was willing to believe in preternatural agency and thought it not more strange that there should be evil spirits than evil men even the question about second sight hold him in suspense second sight mr pennant tells us is a power of seeing images impressed on the organs of sight by the power of fancy or on the fancy by the disordered spirits operating on the mind it is the faculty of seeing specter or visions which represent an event actually passing at a distance or likely to happen at a future day in      a gentleman the last who was supposed to be possessed of this faculty had a boat at sea in a tempestuous night and being anxious for his freight suddenly started up and said his men would be drowned for he had seen them pass before him with wet garments and dropping locks the event corresponded with his disordered fancy and thus continues mr pennant a distempered imagination clouded with anxiety may make an impression on the spirits as persons restless and troubled with indignation see various forms and figures while they lie awake in bed this is what dr johnson was not willing to reject he wished for some positive proof of communications with another world his benevolence embraced the whole race of man and yet was tinctured with particular prejudices he was pleased with the minister in the isle of sky and loved him so much that he began to wish him not a presbyterian to that body of dissenters his zeal for the established church made him in some degree an adversary and his attachment to a mixed and limited monarchy led him to declare open war against what he called a sullen republican he would rather praise a man of oxford than of cambridge he disliked a whig and loved a tory these were the shades of his character which it has been the business of certain partywriters to represent in the darkest colors  since virtue or moral goodness consists in a just conformity of our actions to the relations in which we stand to the supreme being and to our fellow creatures where shall we find a man who has been or endeavored to be more diligent in the discharge of those essential duties his first prayer was composed in      he continued those fervent ejaculations of piety to the end of his life in his meditations we see him scrutinizing himself with severity and aiming at perfection unattainable by man his duty to his neighbor consisted in universal benevolence and a constant aim at the production of happiness who was more sincere and steady in his friendships it has been said that there was no real affection between him and garrick on the part of the latter there might be some corrosions of jealousy the character of prospero in the rambler no  00 was beyond all question occasioned by garricks ostentatious display of furniture and dresden china it was surely fair to take from this incident a hint for a moral essay and though no more was intended garrick we are told remembered it with uneasiness he was also hurt that his lichfield friend did not think so highly of his dramatic art as the rest of the world the fact was johnson could not see the passions as they rose and chased one another in the varied features of that expressive face and by his own manner of reciting verses which was wonderfully impressive he plainly showed that he thought there was too much of artificial tone and measured cadence in the declamation of the theater the present writer well remembers being in conversation with dr johnson near the side of the scenes during the tragedy of king lear when garrick came off the stage he said you two talk so loud you destroy all my feelings prithee replied johnson do not talk of feelings punch has no feelings this seems to have been his settled opinion admirable as garricks imitation of nature always was johnson thought it no better than mere mimickry yet it is certain that he esteemed and loved garrick that he dwelt with pleasure on his praise and used to declare that he deserved his great success because on all applications for charity he gave more than was asked after garricks death he never talked of him without a tear in his eyes he offered if mrs garrick would desire it of him to be the editor of his works and the historian of his life it has been mentioned that on his deathbed he thought of writing a latin inscription to the memory of his friend numbers are still living who know these facts and sti   remember with gratitude the friendship which he showed to them with unaltered affection for a number of years his humanity and generosity in proportion to his slender income were unbounded it has been truly said that the lame the blind and the sorrowful found in his house a sure retreat a strict adherence to truth he considered as a sacred obligation insomuch that in relating the most minute anecdote he would not allow himself the smallest addition to embellish his story the late mr tyers who knew dr johnson intimately observed that he always talked as if he was talking upon oath after a long acquaintance with this excellent man and an attentive retrospect to his whole conduct such is the light in which he appears to the writer of this essay the following lines of horace may be deemed his picture in miniature  iracundior est paulo minus aptus acutis naribus horum hominum rideri possit eo quod rusticius tonso toga defluit and male laxus in pede calceus haeret at est bonus ut melior vir non alius quisquam at tibi amicus at ingenium ingens inculto latet hoc sub corpore your friend is passionate perhaps unfit for the brisk petulance of modern wit his hair ill cut his robe that awkward flows or his large shoes to raillery expose the man you love yet is he not possessed of virtues with which very few are blessed while underneath this rude uncouth disguise a genius of extensive knowledge lies franciss hor book i sat    it remains to give a review of johnsons works and this it is imagined will not be unwelcome to the reader  like milton and addison he seems to have been fond of his latin poetry those compositions show that he was an early scholar but his verses have not the graceful ease that gave so much suavity to the poems of addison the translation of the messiah labors under two disadvantages it is first to be compared with popes inimitable performance and afterward with the pollio of virgil it may appear trifling to remark that he has made the letter o in the word virgo long and short in the same line virgo virgo parit but the translation has great merit and some admirable lines in the odes there is a sweet flexibility particularly to his worthy friend dr laurence on himself at the theater march        the ode in the isle of sky and that to mrs thrale from the same place  his english poetry is such as leaves room to think if he had devoted himself to the muses that he would have been the rival of pope his first production in this kind was london a poem in imitation of the third satire of juvenal the vices of the metropolis are placed in the room of ancient manners the author had heated his mind with the ardour of juvenal and having the skill to polish his numbers he became a sharp accuser of the times the vanity of human wishes is an imitation of the tenth satire of the same author though it is translated by dryden johnsons imitation approaches nearest to the spirit of the original the subject is taken from the alcibiades of plato and has an intermixture of the sentiments of socrates concerning the object of prayers offered up to the deity the general proposition is that good and evil are so little understood by mankind that their wishes when granted are always destructive this is exemplified in a variety of instances such as riches statepreferment eloquence military glory long life and the advantages of form and beauty juvenals conclusion is worthy of a christian poet and such a pen as johnsons let us he says leave it to the gods to judge what it fittest for us man is dearer to his creator than to himself if we must pray for special favor let it be for a sound mind in a sound body let us pray for fortitude that we may think the labors of hercules and all his sufferings preferable to a life of luxury and the soft repose of sardanapalus this is a blessing within the reach of every man this we can give ourselves it is virtue and virtue only that can make us happy in the translation the zeal of the christian conspired with the warmth and energy of the poet but juvenal is not eclipsed for the various characters in the original the reader is pleased in the english poem to meet with cardinal wolsey buckingham stabbed by felton lord strafford clarendon charles xii of sweden and for tully and demosthenes lydiat galileo and archbishop laud it is owing to johnsons delight in biography that the name of lydiat is called forth from obscurity it may therefore not be useless to tell that lydiat was a learned divine and mathematician in the beginning of the last century he attacked the doctrine of aristotle and scaliger and wrote a number of sermons on the harmony of the evangelists with all his merit he lay in the prison of bocardo at oxford till bishop usher laud and others paid his debts he petitioned charles i to be sent to ethiopia to procure manuscripts having spoken in favor of monarchy and bishops he was plundered by the puritans and twice carried away a prisoner from his rectory he died very poor in       the tragedy of irene is founded on a passage in knolless history of the turks an author highly commended in the rambler no     an incident in the life of mahomet the great first emperor of the turks is the hinge on which the fable is made to move the substance of the story is shortly this in      mahomet laid siege to constantinople and having reduced the place became enamoured of a fair greek whose name was irene the sultan invited her to embrace the law of the prophet and to grace his throne enraged at this intended marriage the janissaries formed a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor to avert the impending danger mahomet in a full assembly of the grandees catching with one hand as knolles relates it the fair greek by the hair of her head and drawing his falchion with the other he at one blow struck off her head to the great terror of them all and having so done said unto them now by this judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his affections or not the story is simple and it remained for the author to amplify it with proper episodes and give it complication and variety the catastrophe is changed and horror gives place to terror and pity but after all the fable is cold and languid there is not throughout the piece a single situation to excite curiosity and raise a conflict of passions the diction is nervous rich and elegant but splendid language and melodious numbers will make a fine poem not a tragedy the sentiments are beautiful always happily expressed but seldom appropriated to the character and generally too philosophic what johnson has said of the tragedy of cato may be applied to irene it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a representation of natural affections nothing excites or assuages emotion the events are expected without solicitude and are remembered without joy or sorrow of the agents we have no care we consider not what they are doing nor what they are suffering we wish only to know what they have to say it is unaffecting elegance and chill philosophy the following speech in the mouth of a turk who is supposed to have heard of the british constitution has been often selected from the numberless beauties with which irene abounds  if there be any land as fame reports where common laws restrain the prince and subject a happy land where circulating power flows through each member of the embodied state sure not unconscious of the mighty blessing her grateful sons shine bright with every virtue untainted with the lust of innovation sure all unite to hold her league of rule unbroken as the sacred chain of nature that links the jarring elements in peace these are british sentiments above forty years ago they found an echo in the breast of applauding audiences and to this hour they are the voice of the people in defiance of the metaphysics and the new lights of certain politicians who would gladly find their private advantage in the disasters of their country a race of men quibus nulla ex honesto spes  the prologue to irene is written with elegance and in a peculiar strain shows the literary pride and lofty spirit of the author the epilogue we are told in a late publication was written by sir william young this is a new discovery but by no means probable when the appendages to a dramatic performance are not assigned to a friend or an unknown hand or a person of fashion they are always supposed to be written by the author of the play it is to be wished however that the epilogue in question could be transferred to any other writer it is the worst jeu d esprit that ever fell from johnsons pen  an account of the various pieces contained in this edition such as miscellaneous tracts and philological dissertations would lead beyond the intended limits of this essay it will suffice to say that they are the productions of a man who never wanted decorations of language and always taught his reader to think the life of the late king of prussia as far as it extends is a model of the biographical style the review of the origin of evil was perhaps written with asperity but the angry epitaph which it provoked from soame jenyns was an illtimed resentment unworthy of the genius of that amiable author  the rambler may be considered as johnsons great work it was the basis of that high reputation which went on increasing to the end of his days the circulation of those periodical essays was not at first equal to their merit they had not like the spectators the art of charming by variety and indeed how could it be expected the wits of queen annes reign sent their contributions to the spectator and johnson stood alone a stagecoach says sir richard steel must go forward on stated days whether there are passengers or not so it was with the rambler every tuesday and saturday for two years in this collection johnson is the great moral teacher of his countrymen his essays form a body of ethics the observations on life and manners are acute and instructive and the papers professedly critical serve to promote the cause of literature it must however be acknowledged that a settled gloom hangs over the authors mind and all the essays except eight or ten coming from the same fountainhead no wonder that they have the raciness of the soil from which they sprung of this uniformity johnson was sensible he used to say that if he had joined a friend or two who would have been able to intermix papers of a sprightly turn the collection would have been more miscellaneous and by consequence more agreeable to the generality of readers this he used to illustrate by repeating two beautiful stanzas from his own ode to cave or sylvanus urban  non ulla musis pagina gratior qusm quae severis ludicra jungere novit fatigatamque nugis utilibus recreare mentem texente nymphis serta lycoride rosae ruborem sic viola adjuvat immista sic iris refulget aethereis variata fucis it is remarkable that the pomp of diction which has been objected to johnson was first assumed in the rambler his dictionary was going on at the same time and in the course of that work as he grew familiar with technical and scholastic words he thought that the bulk of his readers were equally learned or at least would admire the splendor and dignity of the style and yet it is well known that he praised in cowley the ease and unaffected structure of the sentences cowley may be placed at the head of those who cultivated a clear and natural style dryden tillotson and sir william temple followed addison swift and pope with more correctness carried our language well nigh to perfection of addison johnson was used to say he is the raphael of essay writers how he differed so widely from such elegant models is a problem not to be solved unless it be true that he took an early tincture from the writers of the last century particularly sir thomas brown hence the peculiarities of his style new combinations sentences of an unusual structure and words derived from the learned languages his own account of the matter is when common words were less pleasing to the ear or less distinct in their signification i familiarized the terms of philosophy by applying them to popular ideas but he forgot the observation of dryden if too many foreign words are poured in upon us it looks as if they were designed not to assist the natives but to conquer them there is it must be admitted a swell of language often out of all proportion to the sentiment but there is in general a fullness of mind and the thought seems to expand with the found of the words determined to discard colloquial barbarisms and licentious idioms he forgot the elegant simplicity that distinguishes the writings of addison he had what lock calls a roundabout view of his subject and though he was never tainted like many modern wits with the ambition of shining in paradox he may be fairly called an original thinker his reading was extensive he treasured in his mind whatever was worthy of notice but he added to it from his own meditation he collected quae reconderet auctaque promeret addison was not so profound a thinker he was born to write converse and live with ease and he found an early patron in lord summers he depended however more upon a fine taste than the vigor of his mind his latin poetry shows that he relished with a just selection all the refined and delicate beauties of the roman classics and when he cultivated his native language no wonder that he formed that graceful style which has been so justly admired simple yet elegant adorned yet never overwrought rich in allusion yet pure and perspicuous correct without labor and though sometimes deficient in strength yet always musical his essays in general are on the surface of life if ever original it was in pieces of humor sir roger de coverley and the tory foxhunter need not to be mentioned johnson had a fund of humor but he did not know it nor was he willing to descend to the familiar idiom and the variety of diction which that mode of composition required the letter in the rambler no    from a young girl that wants a place will illustrate this observation addison possessed an unclouded imagination alive to the first objects of nature and of art he reaches the sublime without any apparent effort when he tells us if we consider the fixed stars as so many oceans of flame that are each of them attended with a different set of planets if we still discover new firmaments and new lights that are sunk further in those unfathomable depths of ether we are lost in a labyrinth of suns and worlds and confounded with the magnificence and immensity of nature the ease with which this passage rises to unaffected grandeur is the secret charm that captivates the reader johnson is always lofty he seems to use drydens phrase to be over informed with meaning and his words do not appear to himself adequate to his conception he moves in state and his periods are always harmonious his oriental tales are in the true style of eastern magnificence and yet none of them are so much admired as the visions of mirza in matters of criticism johnson is never the echo of preceding writers he thinks and decides for himself if we except the essays on the pleasures of imagination addison cannot be called a philosophical critic his moral essays are beautiful but in that province nothing can exceed the rambler though johnson used to say that the essay on the burdens of mankind in the spectator no     was the most exquisite he had ever read talking of himself johnson said topham beauclerk has wit and every thing comes from him with ease but when i say a good thing i seem to labor when we compare him with addison the contrast is still stronger addison lends grace and ornament to truth johnson gives it force and energy addison makes virtue amiable johnson represents it as an awful duty addison insinuates himself with an air of modesty johnson commands like a dictator but a dictator in his splendid robes not laboring at the plough addison is the jupiter of virgil with placid serenity talking to venus  vultu quo coelum tempestatesque serenat johnson is jupiter tonans he darts his lightning and rolls his thunder in the cause of virtue and piety the language seems to fall short of his ideas he pours along familiarizing the terms of philosophy with bold inversions and sonorous periods but we may apply to him what pope has said of homer it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense  it is not the design of this comparison to decide between those two eminent writers in matters of taste every reader will choose for himself johnson is always profound and of course gives the fatigue of thinking addison charms while he instructs and writing as he always does a pure an elegant and idiomatic style he may be pronounced the safest model for imitation  the essays written by johnson in the adventurer may be called a continuation of the rambler the idler in order to be consistent with the assumed character is written with abatad vigor in a style of ease and unlaboured elegance it is the odyssey after the iliad intense thinking would not become the idler the first number presents a welldrawn portrait of an idler and from that character no deviation could be made accordingly johnson forgets his austere manner and plays us into sense he fill continues his lectures on human life but he adverts to common occurrences and is often content with the topic of the day an advertisement in the beginning of the first volume informs us that twelve entire essays were a contribution from different hands one of these no    is the journal of a senior fellow at cambridge but as johnson being himself an original thinker always revolted from servile imitation he has printed the piece with an apology importing that the journal of a citizen in the spectator almost precluded the attempt of any subsequent writer this account of the idler may be closed after observing that the authors mother being buried on the   d of january      there is an admirable paper occasioned by that event on saturday the   th of the same month no    the reader if he pleases may compare it with another fine paper in the rambler no    on the conviction that rushes on the mind at the bed of a dying friend  rasselas says sir john hawkins is aspecimen of our language scarcely to be paralleled it is written in a style refined to a degree of imaculate purity and displays the whole force of turgid eloquence one cannot but smile at this encomium rasselas is undoubtedly both elegant and sublime it is a view of human life displayed it must be owned in gloomy colors the authors natural melancholy depressed at the time by the approaching dissolution of his mother darkened the picture a tale that should keep curiosity awake by the artifice of unexpected incidents was not the design of a mind pregnant with better things he who reads the heads of the chapters will find that it is not a course of adventures that invites him forward but a discussion of interesting questions reflections on human life the history of imlac the man of learning a dissertation upon poetry the character of a wise and happy man who discourses with energy on the government of the passions and on a sudden when death deprives him of his daughter forgets all his maxims of wisdom and the eloquence that adorned them yielding to the stroke of affliction with all the vehemence of the bitterest anguish it is by pictures of life and profound moral reflection that expectation is engaged and gratified throughout the work the history of the mad astronomer who imagines that for five years he possessed the regulation of the weather and that the sun passed from tropic to tropic by his direction represents in striking colors the sad effects of a distempered imagination it becomes the more affecting when we recollect that it proceeds from one who lived in fear of the same dreadful visitation from one who says emphatically of the uncertainties in our present state the most dreadful and alarming is the uncertain continuance of reason the enquiry into the cause of madness and the dangerous prevalence of imagination till in time some particular train of ideas fixes the attention and the mind recurs constantly to the favorite conception is carried on in a strain of acute observation but it leaves us room to think that the author was transcribing from his own apprehensions the discourse on the nature of the soul gives us all that philosophy knows not without a tincture of superstition it is remarkable that the vanity of human pursuits was about the same time the subject that employed both johnson and voltaire but candide is the work of a lively imagination and rasselas with all its splendor of eloquence exhibits a gloomy picture it should however be remembered that the world has known the weeping as well as the laughing philosopher  the dictionary does not properly fall within the province of this essay the preface however will be found in this edition he who reads the close of it without acknowledging the force of the pathetic and sublime must have more insensibility in his composition than usually sells to the share of man the work itself though in some instances abuse has been loud and in others malice has endeavored to undermine its same still remains the mount atlas of english literature  though storms and tempests thunder on its brow and oceans break their blows at its seet it stands unmoved and glories in its height that johnson was eminently qualified for the office of a commentator on shakspeare no man can doubt but it was an office which he never cordially embraced the public expected more than he had diligence to perform and yet his edition has been the ground on which every subsequent commentator has chose to build one note for its singularity may be thought worthy of notice in this place hamlet says for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a godkissing carrion in this warburton discovered the origin of evil hamlet he says breaks off in the middle of the sentence but the learned commentator knows what he was going to say and being unwilling to keep the secret he goes on in a train of philosophical reasoning that leaves the reader in astonishment johnson with true piety adopts the fanciful hypothesis declaring it to be a noble emendation which almost sets the critic on a level with the author the general observations at the end of the several plays and the preface will be found in this edition the former with great elegance and precision give a summary view of each drama the preface is a tract of great erudition and philosophical criticism  johnsons political pamphlets whatever was his motive for writing them whether gratitude for his pension or the solicitation of men in power did not support the cause for which they were undertaken they are written in a style truly harmonious and with his usual dignity of language when it is said that he advanced positions repugnant to the common rights of mankind the virulence of party may be suspected it is perhaps true that in the clamor raised throughout the kingdom johnson over heated his mind but he was a friend to the rights of man and he was greatly superior to the littleness of sprit that might incline him to advance what he did not think and firmly believe in the false alarm though many of the most eminent men in the kingdom concurred in petitions to the throne yet johnson having well surveyed the mass of the people has given with great humor and no less truth what may be called the birth parentage and education of a remonsirance on the subject of falklands islands the fine dissuasive from too hastily involving the world in the calamities of war must extort applause even from the party that wished at that time for seenes or tumult and commotion it was in the same pamphlet that johnson offered battle to junius a writer who by the uncommon elegance of his style charmed every reader though his object was to inflame the nation in favor of a faction junius fought in the dark he saw his enemy and had his full blow while he himself remained safe in obscurity but let us not said johnson mistake the venom of the shaft for the vigor of the bow the keen invective which he published on that occasion promised a paperwar between two combatants who knew the use of their weapons a battle between them was as eagerly expected as between mendoza and big ben but junius whatever was his reason never returned to the field he laid down his arms and has ever since remained as secret as the man in the mask in voltaires history  the account of his journey to the hebrides or western isles of scotland is a model for such as shall hereafter relate their travels the author did not visit that part of the world in the character of an antiquary to amuse us with wonders taken from the dark and fabulous ages nor as a mathematician to measure a degree and settle the longitude and latitude of the several islands those who expected such information expected what was never intended in every work regard the writers end johnson went to see men and manners modes of life and the progress of civilization his remarks are so artfully blended with the rapidity and elegance of his narrative that the reader is inclined to wish as johnson did with regard to gray that to travel and to tell his travels had been more of his employment  as to johnsons parliamentary debates nothing with propriety can be said in this place they are collected in two volumes by mr stockdale and the flow of eloquence which runs through the several speeches is sufficiently known  it will not be useless to mention two more volumes which may form a proper supplement to this edition they contain a set of sermons left for publication by john tailor lld the reverend mr hayes who ushered these discourses into the world has not given them as the compesition of dr tailor all he could say for his departed friend was that he left them in silence among his papers mr hayes knew them to be the production of a superior mind and the writer of these memoirs owes it to the candor of that elegant scholar that he is now warranted to give an additional proof of johnsons ardour in the cause of piety and every moral duty the last discourse in the collection was intended to be delivered by dr tailor at the funeral of johnsons wife but that reverend gentleman declined the office because as he told mr hayes the praise of the deceased was too much amplified he who reads the piece will find it a beautiful moral lesson written with temper and no where overcharged with ambitious ornaments the rest of the discourses were the fund which dr tailor from time to time carried with him to his pulpit he had the largest bull see johnsons letters from ashbourne in vol xii of this edition in england and some of the best sermons  we come now to the lives of the poets a work undertaken at the age of seventy yet the most brilliant and certainly the most popular of all our authors writings for this performance he needed little preparation attentive always to the history of letters and by his own natural bias fond of biography he was the more willing to embrace the proposition of the booksellers he was versed in the whole body of english poetry and his rules of criticism were settled with precision the differtation in the life of cowley on the metaphysical poets of the last century has the attraction of novelty as well as sound observation the writers who followed dr done went in quest of something better then truth and nature as sancho says in don qnixotte they wanted better bread than is made with wheat they took pains to bewilder themselves and were ingenious for no other purpose than to err in johnsons review of cowleys works false wit is detected in all its shapes and the gothic taste for glittering conceits and farfetched allusions is exploded never it is hoped to revive again  an author who has published his observations on the life and writings of dr johnson speaking of the lives of the poets says these compositions abounding in strong and acute remark and with many fine and even sublime passages have unquestionably great merit but if they be regarded merely as containing narrations of the lives delineations of the characters and strictures of the several authors they are far from being always to be depended on he adds the characters are sometimes partial and there is sometimes too much malignity of misrepresentation to which perhaps may be joined no inconsiderable portion of erroneous criticism the several clauses of this censure deserve to be answered as fully as the limits of this essay will permit  in the first place the facts are related upon the best instelligence and the best vouchers that could be gleaned after a great lapse of time probability was to be inferred from such materials as could be procured and no man better understood the nature of historical evidence than dr johnson no man was more religiously an observer of truth if his history is any where defective it must be imputed to the want of better information and the errors of uncertain tradition  ad nos vix tenuis famae perlabitur aura if the strictures on the works of the various authors are not always satisfactory and if erroneous criticism may sometimes be suspected who can hope that in matters of taste all shall agree the instances in which the public mind has differed from the positions advanced by the author are few in number it has been said that justice has not been done to swift that gay and prior are undervalued and that gray has been harshly treated this charge perhaps ought not to be disputed johnson it is well known had conceived a prejudice against swift his friends trembled for him when he was writing that life but were pleased at last to see it executed with temper and moderation as to prior it is probable that he gave his real opinion but an opinion that will not be adopted by men of lively fancy with regard to gray when he condemns the apostrophe in which father thames is desired to tell who drives the hoop of tosses the ball and then adds that father thames had no better means of knowing than himself when he compares the abrupt beginning of the first stanza of the bard to the ballad of johnny armstrong is there ever a man in all scotland there are perhaps few friends of johnson who would not wish to blot out both the passages it may be questioned whether the remarks on popes essay on man can be received without great caution it has been already mentioned that crousaz a professor in switzerland eminent for his treatise of logic started up a professed enemy to that poem johnson says his mind was one of those in which philosophy and piety are happily united he looked with distrust upon all metaphysical systems of theology and was persuaded that the positions of pope were intended to draw mankind away from revelation and to represent the whole course of things as a necessary concatenation of indissoluble fatality this is not the place for a controversy about the leibnitzian system warburton with all the powers of his large and comprehensive mind publishied a vindication of pope and yet johnson says that in many passages a religious eye may easily discover expressions not very favorable to morals or to liberty this sentence is severe and perhaps dogmatical crousaz wrote an examen of the essay on man and afterward a commentary on every remarkable passage and though it now appears that mrs elizabeth carter translated the foreign critic yet it is certain that johnson encouraged the work and perhaps imbibed those early prejudices which adhered to him to the end of his life he shuddered at the idea of irreligion hence we are told in the life of pope never were penury of knowledge and vulgarity of sentiment so happily disguised pope in the chair of wisdom tells much that every man knows and much that he did not know himself and gives us comfort in the position that though mans a fool yet god is wise that human advantages are unstable that our true honor is not to have a great part but to act it well that virtue only is our own and that happiness is always in our power the reader when he meets all this in its new array no longer knows the talk of his mother and his nurse but may it not be said that every system of ethics must or ought to terminate in plain and general maxims for the use of life and though in such axioms no discovery is made does not the beauty of the moral theory consist in the premises and the chain of reasoning that leads to the conclusion may not truth as johnson himself says be conveyed to the mind by a new train of intermediate images popes doctrine about the ruling passion does not seem to be refuted though it is called in harsh terms pernicious as well as false tending to establish a kind of moral predestination or overruling principle which cannot be resisted but johnson was too easily alarmed in the cause of religion organized as the human race is individuals have different inlets of perception different powers of mind and different sensations of pleasure and pain  all spread their charms but charm not all alike on different senses different objects strike hence different passions more or less inflame as strong or weak the organs of the frame and hence one masterpassion in the breast like aarons serpent swallows up the rest brumoy says pascal from his infancy felt himself a geometrician and vandyke in like manner was a painter shakspeare who of all poets had the deepest insight into human nature was aware of a prevailing bias in the operations of every mind by him we are told masterless passion sways us to the mood of what it likes or looths  it remains to enquire whether in the lives before us the characters are partial and too often drawn with malignity of misrepresentation to prove this it is alleged that johnson has misrepresented the circumstances relative to the translation of the first iliad and maliciously ascribed that performance to addison instead of tickell with too much reliance on the testimony of pope taken from the account in the papers left by mr spence for a refutation of the fallacy imputed to addison we are referred to a note in the biographia britannica written by the late judge blackstone who it is said examined the whole matter with accuracy and found that the first regular statement of the accusation against addison was published by ruffhead in his life of pope from the materials which he received from dr warburton but with all due deference to the learned judge whose talents deserve all praise this account is by no means accurate  sir richard steel in a dedication of the comedy of the drummer to mr congreve gave the first insight into that business he says in a style of anger and resentment if that gentleman mr tickell thinks himself injured i will allow i have wronged him upon this issue that if the reputed translator of the first book of homer shall please to give us another book there shall appear another good judge in poetry besides mr alexander pope who shall like it the authority of steel outweighs all opinions founded on vain conjecture and indeed seems to be decisive since we do not find that tickell though warmly pressed thought proper to vindicate himself  but the grand proof of johnsons malignity is the manner in which he has treated the character and conduct of milton to enforce this charge has wearied sophistry and exhausted the invention of a party what they cannot deny they palliate what they cannot prove they say is probable but why all this rage against dr johnson addison before him had said of milton  oh had the poet never profaned his pen to varnish over the guilt of faithless men and had not johnson an equal right to avow his sentiments do his enemies claim a privilege to abuse whatever is valuable to englishmen either in church or state and must the liberty of unlicensed printing be denied to the friends of the british constitution  it is unnecessary to pursue the argument through all its artifices since dismantled of ornament and seducing language the plain truth may be stated in a narrow compass johnson knew that milton was a republican he says an acrimonious and surly republican for which it is not known that he gave any better reason than that a popular government was the most frugal for the trappings of a monarchy would set up an ordinary commonwealth johnson knew that milton talked aloud of the danger of readmitting kingship in this nation and when milton adds that a commonwealth was commended or rather enjoined by our savior himself to all christians not without a remarkable disallowance and the brand of gentilism upon kingship johnson thought him no better than a wild enthusiast he knew as well as milton that the happiness of a nation must needs be firmest and certainest in a full and free council of their own electing where no single person but reason only sways but the example of all the republics recorded in the annals of mankind gave him no room to hope that reason only would be heard he knew that the republican form of government having little or no complication and no consonance of parts by a nice mechanism forming a regular whole was too simple to be beautiful even in theory in practice it perhaps never existed in its most flourishing state at athens rome and carthage it was a constant scene of tumult and commotion from the mischiefs of a wild democracy the progress has ever been to the dominion of an aristocracy and the word aristocracy fatally includes the boldest and most turbulent citizens who rise by their crimes and call themselves the best men in the state by intrigue by cabal and faction a pernicious oligarchy is sure to succeed and end at last in the tyranny of a single ruler tacitus the great master of political wisdom saw under the mixed authority of king nobles and people a better form of government than miltons boasted republic and what tacitus admired in theory but despaired of enjoying johnson saw established in this country he knew that it had been overturned by the rage of frantic men but he knew that after the iron rod of cromwells usurpation the constitution was once more restored to its first principles monarchy was established and this country was regenerated it was regenerated a second time at the revolution the rights of men were then defined and the blessings of good order and civil liberty have been ever since diffused through the whole community  the peace and happiness of society were what dr johnson had at heart he knew that milton called his defense of the regicides a defense of the people of england but however glossed and varnished he thought it an apology for murder had the men who under a show of liberty brought their king to the scaffold proved by their subsequent conduct that the public good inspired their actions the end might have given some sanction to the means but usurpation and slavery followed milton undertook the office of secretary under the despotic power of cromwell offering the incense of adulation to his master with the titles of director of public councils the leader of unconquered armies the father of his country milton declared at the same time that nothing is more pleasing to god or more agreeable to reason than that the highest mind should have the sovereign power in this strain of servile flattery milton gives us the right divine of tyrants but it seems in the same piece he exhorts cromwell not to desert those great principles of liberty which he had professed to espouse for it would be a grievous enormity if after having successfully opposed tyranny he should himself act the part of a tyrant and betray the cause that he had defended this desertion of every honest principle the advocate for liberty lived to see cromwell acted the tyrant and with vile hypocrisy told the people that he had consulted the lord and the lord would have it so milton took an under part in the tragedy did that become the defender of the people of england brutus saw his country enslaved he struck the blow for freedom and he died with honor in the cause had he lived to be secretary under tiberius what would now be said of his memory  but still it seems the prostitution with which milton is charged since it cannot be defended is to be retorted on the character of johnson for this purpose a book has been published called remarks on dr johnsons life of milton to which are added miltons tractate of education and areopagitica in this labored tract we are told there is one performance ascribed to the pen of the doctor where the prostitution is of so singular a nature that it would be difficult to select an adequate motive for it out of the mountainous heap of conjectural causes of human passions or human caprice it is the speech of the late unhappy dr william dodd when he was about to hear the sentence of the law pronounced upon him in consequence of an indictment for forgery the voice of the public has given the honor of manufacturing this speech to dr johnson and the style and configuration of the speech itself confirm the imputation but it is hardly possible to divine what could be his motive for accepting the office a man to express the precise state of mind of another about to be destined to an ignominious death for a capital crime should one would imagine have some consciousness that he himself had incurred some guilt of the same kind in all the schools of sophistry is there to be found so vile an argument in the purlieus of grubstreet is there such another mouthfull of dirt in the whole quiver of malice is there so envenomed a shaft  after this it is to be hoped that a certain class of men will talk no more of johnsons malignity the last apology for milton is that he acted according to his principles but johnson thought those principles detestable pernicious to the constitution in church and state destructive of the peace of society and hostile to the great fabric of civil policy which the wisdom of ages has taught every briton to revere to love and cherish he reckoned milton in that class of men of whom the roman historian says when they want by a sudden convulsion to overturn the government
