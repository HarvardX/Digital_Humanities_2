lyrical ballads with a few other poems   london  printed for j  a arch gracechurchstreet           advertisement   it is the honourable characteristic of poetry that its materials are to be found in every subject which can interest the human mind the evidence of this fact is to be sought not in the writings of critics but in those of poets themselves  the majority of the following poems are to be considered as experiments they were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure readers accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers if they persist in reading this book to its conclusion will perhaps frequently have to struggle with feelings of strangeness and aukwardness they will look round for poetry and will be induced to enquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that title it is desirable that such readers for their own sakes should not suffer the solitary word poetry a word of very disputed meaning to stand in the way of their gratification but that while they are perusing this book they should ask themselves if it contains a natural delineation of human passions human characters and human incidents and if the answer be favourable to the authors wishes that they should consent to be pleased in spite of that most dreadful enemy to our pleasures our own preestablished codes of decision  readers of superior judgment may disapprove of the style in which many of these pieces are executed it must be expected that many lines and phrases will not exactly suit their taste it will perhaps appear to them that wishing to avoid the prevalent fault of the day the author has sometimes descended too low and that many of his expressions are too familiar and not of sufficient dignity it is apprehended that the more conversant the reader is with our elder writers and with those in modern times who have been the most successful in painting manners and passions the fewer complaints of this kind will he have to make  an accurate taste in poetry and in all the other arts sir joshua reynolds has observed is an acquired talent which can only be produced by severe thought and a long continued intercourse with the best models of composition this is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging for himself but merely to temper the rashness of decision and to suggest that if poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed the judgment may be erroneous and that in many cases it necessarily will be so  the tale of goody blake and harry gill is founded on a wellauthenticated fact which happened in warwickshire of the other poems in the collection it may be proper to say that they are either absolute inventions of the author or facts which took place within his personal observation or that of his friends the poem of the thorn as the reader will soon discover is not supposed to be spoken in the authors own person the character of the loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the story the rime of the ancyent marinere was professedly written in imitation of the style as well as of the spirit of the elder poets but with a few exceptions the author believes that the language adopted in it has been equally intelligible for these three last centuries the lines entitled expostulation and reply and those which follow arose out of conversation with a friend who was somewhat unreasonably

men ne beasts we ken       the ice was all between      the ice was here the ice was there       the ice was all around     it crackd and growld and roard and howld       like noises of a swound      at length did cross an albatross       thorough the fog it came     and an it were a christian soul       we haild it in gods name      the marineres gave it biscuitworms       and round and round it flew     the ice did split with a thunderfit       the helmsman steerd us thro      and a good south wind sprung up behind       the albatross did follow     and every day for food or play       came

 and broad as a weft upon the left       went down into the sea      and the good south wind still blew behind       but no sweet bird did follow     ne any day for food or play       came to the marineres hollo      and i had done an hellish thing       and it would work em woe     for all averrd i had killd the bird       that made the breeze to blow      ne dim ne red like gods own head

  and we did speak only to break       the silence of the sea      all in a hot and copper sky       the bloody sun at noon     right up above the mast did stand       no bigger than the moon      day after day day after day       we stuck ne breath ne motion     as idle as a painted ship       upon a painted ocean      water water every where       and all the boards did shrink     water water every where       ne any drop to drink      the very deeps did rot o christ       that ever this should be     yea slimy things did crawl with legs       upon the slimy sea      about about in reel

fathom deep he had followd us       from the land of mist and snow      and every tongue thro utter drouth       was witherd at the root     we could not speak no more than if       we had been choked

than my fist     at first it seemd a little speck       and then it seemd a mist     it movd and movd and took at last       a certain shape i wist      a speck a mist a shape i wist       and still it nerd and nerd     and an it dodgd a watersprite       it plungd and tackd and veerd      with throat unslackd with black lips bakd       ne could we laugh ne wail     then while thro drouth all dumb they stood     i bit my arm and suckd the blood       and cryd a sail a sail      with throat unslackd with black lips bakd       agape they heard me call     gramercy they for joy did grin     and all at once their breath drew in       as they were drinking all      she doth not tack from side to side       hither to work us weal     withouten wind withouten tide       she steddies with

betwixt us and the sun      and strait the sun was fleckd with bars       heavens mother send us grace     as if thro a dungeon grate he peerd       with broad and burning face      alas thought i and my heart beat loud       how fast she neres and neres     are those her sails that glance in the sun       like restless gossameres      are these her naked ribs which fleckd       the sun that did behind them peer     and are these two all all the crew       that woman and her fleshless pheere      his bones were black with many a crack       all black and bare i ween     jetblack and bare save

with never a whisper in the sea       off darts the spectreship     while clombe above the eastern bar     the horned moon with one bright star       almost atween the tips      one after one by the horned moon       listen o stranger to me     each turnd his face with a ghastly pang       and cursd me with his ee      four times fifty living men       with never a sigh or groan     with heavy thump a lifeless lump       they droppd down one by one      their souls did from their bodies fly       they fled to bliss or woe     and every soul it passd me by       like the whiz of my crossbow   iv      i fear thee ancyent marinere       i fear thy skinny hand     and thou art long and lank and brown       as is the ribbd seasand      i fear thee and thy glittering eye       and thy skinny hand so brown     fear not fear not thou wedding guest       this body dropt not down      alone alone all all alone       alone on the wide wide sea     and christ would take no pity on       my soul in agony      the many men so beautiful       and they all dead did lie     and a million million slimy things       livd onand so did i      i lookd upon the rotting sea       and drew my eyes away     i lookd upon the eldritch deck       and there the dead men lay      i lookd to heaven and tryd to pray       but or ever a prayer had gusht     a wicked whisper came and made       my heart as dry as dust      i closd my lids and kept them close       till the balls like pulses beat     for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky     lay like a load on my weary eye       and the dead were at my feet      the cold sweat melted from their limbs       ne rot ne reek did they     the look with which they lookd on me       had never passd away      an orphans curse would drag to hell       a spirit from on high     but o more horrible than that       is the curse in a dead mans eye     seven days seven nights i saw that curse       and yet i could not die      the moving moon went up the sky       and no where did abide     softly she was going up       and a star or two beside      her beams bemockd the sultry main       like morning frosts yspread     but where the ships huge shadow lay     the charmed water burnt alway       a still and awful red      beyond the shadow of the ship       i watchd the watersnakes     they movd in tracks of shining white     and when they reard the elfish light       fell off in hoary flakes      within the shadow of the ship       i watchd their rich attire     blue glossy green and velvet black     they coild and swam and every track       was a flash of golden fire      o happy living things no tongue       their beauty might declare     a spring of love gusht from my heart       and i blessd them unaware     sure my kind saint took pity on me       and i blessd them unaware      the selfsame moment i could pray       and from my neck so free     the albatross fell off and sank       like lead into the sea   v      o sleep it is a gentle thing       belovd from pole to pole     to maryqueen the praise be yeven     she sent the gentle sleep from heaven       that slid into my soul      the silly buckets on the deck       that had so long remaind     i dreamt that they were filld with dew       and when i awoke it raind      my lips were wet my throat was cold       my garments all were dank     sure i had drunken in my dreams       and still my body drank      i movd and could not feel my limbs       i was so light almost     i thought that i had died in sleep       and was a blessed ghost      the roaring wind it roard far off       it did not come anear     but with its sound it shook the sails       that were so thin and sere      the upper air bursts into life       and a hundred fireflags sheen     to and fro they are hurried about     and to and fro and in and out       the stars dance on between      the coming wind doth roar more loud       the sails do sigh like sedge     the rain pours down from one black cloud       and the moon is at its edge      hark hark the thick black cloud is cleft       and the moon is at its side     like waters shot from some high crag     the lightning falls with never a jag       a river steep and wide      the strong wind reachd the ship it roard       and droppd down like a stone     beneath the lightning and the moon       the dead men gave a groan      they groand they stirrd they all uprose       ne spake ne movd their eyes     it had been strange even in a dream       to have seen those dead men rise      the helmsman steerd the ship movd on       yet never a breeze upblew     the marineres all gan work the ropes       where they were wont to do     they raisd their limbs like lifeless tools       we were a ghastly crew      the body of my brothers son       stood by me knee to knee     the body and i pulld at one rope       but he said nought to me     and i quakd to think of my own voice       how frightful it would be      the daylight dawndthey droppd their arms       and clusterd round the mast     sweet sounds rose slowly thro their mouths       and from their bodies passd      around around flew each sweet sound       then darted to the sun     slowly the sounds came back again       now mixd now one by one      sometimes a dropping from the sky       i heard the lavrock sing     sometimes all little birds that are     how they seemd to fill the sea and air       with their sweet jargoning      and now twas like all instruments       now like a lonely flute     and now it is an angels song       that makes the heavens be mute      it ceasd yet still the sails made on       a pleasant noise till noon     a noise like of a hidden brook       in the leafy month of june     that to the sleeping woods all night       singeth a quiet tune      listen o listen thou weddingguest       marinere thou hast thy will     for that which comes out of thine eye doth make       my body and soul to be still      never sadder tale was told       to a man of woman born     sadder and wiser thou weddingguest       thoult rise to morrow morn      never sadder tale was heard       by a man of woman born     the marineres all returnd to work       as silent as beforne      the marineres all gan pull the ropes       but look at me they nold     thought i i am as thin as air       they cannot me behold      till noon we silently saild on       yet never a breeze did breathe     slowly and smoothly went the ship       movd onward from beneath      under the keel nine fathom deep       from the land of mist and snow     the spirit slid and it was he       that made the ship to go     the sails at noon left off their tune       and the ship stood still also      the sun right up above the mast       had fixd her to the ocean     but in a minute she gan stir       with a short uneasy motion     backwards and forwards half her length       with a short uneasy motion      then like a pawing horse let go       she made a sudden bound     it flung the blood into my head       and i fell into a swound      how long in that same fit i lay       i have not to declare     but ere my living life returnd     i heard and in my soul discernd       two voices in the air      is it he quoth one is this the man       by him who died on cross     with his cruel bow he layd full low       the harmless albatross      the spirit who bideth by himself       in the land of mist and snow     he lovd the bird that lovd the man       who shot him with his bow      the other was a softer voice       as soft as honeydew     quoth he the man hath penance done       and penance more will do   vi            first voice     but tell me tell me speak again       thy soft response renewing     what makes that ship drive on so fast       what is the ocean doing            second voice     still as a slave before his lord       the ocean hath no blast     his great bright eye most silently       up to the moon is cast      if he may know which way to go       for she guides him smooth or grim     see brother see how graciously       she looketh down on him            first voice     but why drives on that ship so fast       withouten wave or wind           second voice     the air is cut away before       and closes from behind      fly brother fly more high more high       or we shall be belated     for slow and slow that ship will go       when the marineres trance is abated      i woke and we were sailing on       as in a gentle weather     twas night calm night the moon was high       the dead men stood together      all stood together on the deck       for a charneldungeon fitter     all fixd on me their stony eyes       that in the moon did glitter      the pang the curse with which they died       had never passd away     i could not draw my een from theirs       ne turn them up to pray      and in its time the spell was snapt       and i could move my een     i lookd farforth but little saw       of what might else be seen      like one that on a lonely road       doth walk in fear and dread     and having once turnd round walks on       and turns no more his head     because he knows a frightful fiend       doth close behind him tread      but soon there breathd a wind on me       ne sound ne motion made     its path was not upon the sea       in ripple or in shade      it raisd my hair it fannd my cheek       like a meadowgale of spring     it mingled strangely with my fears       yet it felt like a welcoming      swiftly swiftly flew the ship       yet she saild softly too     sweetly sweetly blew the breeze       on me alone it blew      o dream of joy is this indeed       the lighthouse top i see     is this the hill is this the kirk       is this mine own countrée      we drifted oer the harbourbar       and i with sobs did pray     o let me be awake my god       or let me sleep alway      the harbourbay was clear as glass       so smoothly it was strewn     and on the bay the moon light lay       and the shadow of the moon      the moonlight bay was white all oer       till rising from the same     full many shapes that shadows were       like as of torches came      a little distance from the prow       those darkred shadows were     but soon i saw that my own flesh       was red as in a glare      i turnd my head in fear and dread       and by the holy rood     the bodies had advancd and now       before the mast they stood      they lifted up their stiff right arms       they held them strait and tight     and each rightarm burnt like a torch       a torch thats borne upright     their stony eyeballs glitterd on       in the red and smoky light      i prayd and turnd my head away       forth looking as before     there was no breeze upon the bay       no wave against the shore      the rock shone bright the kirk no less       that stands above the rock     the moonlight steepd in silentness       the steady weathercock      and the bay was white with silent light       till rising from the same     full many shapes that shadows were       in crimson colours came      a little distance from the prow       those crimson shadows were     i turnd my eyes upon the deck       o christ what saw i there      each corse lay flat lifeless and flat       and by the holy rood     a man all light a seraphman       on every corse there stood      this seraphband each wavd his hand       it was a heavenly sight     they stood as signals to the land       each one a lovely light      this seraphband each wavd his hand       no voice did they impart     no voice but o the silence sank       like music on my heart      eftsones i heard the dash of oars       i heard the pilots cheer     my head was turnd perforce away       and i saw a boat appear      then vanishd all the lovely lights       the bodies rose anew     with silent pace each to his place       came back the ghastly crew     the wind that shade nor motion made       on me alone it blew      the pilot and the pilots boy       i heard them coming fast     dear lord in heaven it was a joy       the dead men could not blast      i saw a thirdi heard his voice       it is the hermit good     he singeth loud his godly hymns       that he makes in the wood     hell shrieve my soul hell wash away       the albatrosss blood   vii      this hermit good lives in that wood       which slopes down to the sea     how loudly his sweet voice he rears     he loves to talk with marineres       that come from a far contrée      he kneels at morn and noon and eve       he hath a cushion plump     it is the moss that wholly hides       the rotted old oakstump      the skiffboat nerd i heard them talk       why this is strange i trow     where are those lights so many and fair       that signal made but now      strange by my faith the hermit said       and they answerd not our cheer     the planks look warpd and see those sails       how thin they

owlet whoops to the wolf below       that eats the shewolfs young      dear lord it has a fiendish look       the pilot made reply     i am afeardpush on push on       said the hermit cheerily      the boat came closer to the ship       but i ne spake ne stirrd     the boat came close beneath the ship       and strait a sound was heard      under the water it rumbled on       still louder and more dread     it reachd the ship it split the bay       the ship went down like lead      stunnd by that loud and dreadful sound       which sky and ocean smote     like one that hath been seven days drownd       my body lay afloat     but swift as dreams myself i found       within the pilots boat      upon the whirl where sank the ship       the boat spun round and round     and all was still save that the hill       was telling of the sound      i movd my lips the pilot shriekd       and fell down in a fit     the holy hermit raisd his eyes       and prayd where he did sit      i took the oars the pilots boy       who now doth crazy go     laughd loud and long and all the while       his eyes went to and fro     ha ha quoth hefull plain i see       the devil knows how to row      and now all in mine own countrée       i stood on the firm land     the hermit steppd forth from the boat       and scarcely he could stand      o shrieve me shrieve me holy man       the hermit crossd his brow     say quick quoth he i bid thee say       what manner man art thou      forthwith this frame of mine was wrenchd       with a woeful agony     which forcd me to begin my tale       and then it left me free      since then at an uncertain hour       now oftimes and now fewer     that anguish comes and makes me tell       my ghastly aventure      i pass like night from land to land       i

man whoeer he be     that joined your names with mine o my sweet lady     as often as i think of those dear times     when you two little ones would stand at eve     on each side of my chair and make me learn     all you had learnt in the day and how to talk     in gentle phrase then bid me sing to you     tis more like heaven to come than what has been      maria     o my dear mother this strange man has left me     troubled with wilder fancies than the moon     breeds in the lovesick maid who gazes at it     till lost in inward vision with wet eye     she gazes idlybut that entrance mother      fostermother     can no one hear it is a perilous tale      maria     no one      fostermother             my husbands father told it me     poor old leoniangels rest his soul     he was a woodman and could fell and saw     with lusty arm you know that huge round beam     which props the hanging wall of the old chapel     beneath that tree while yet it was a tree     he found a baby wrapt in mosses lined     with thistlebeards and such small locks of wool     as hang on brambles well he brought him home     and reared him at the then lord velez cost     and so the babe grew up a pretty boy     a pretty boy but most unteachable     and never learnt a prayer nor told a bead     but knew the names of birds and mocked their notes     and whistled as he were a bird himself     and all the autumn twas his only play     to get the seeds of wild flowers and to plant them     with earth and water on the stumps of trees     a friar who gathered simples in the wood     a greyhaired manhe loved this little boy     the boy loved himand when the friar taught him     he soon could write with the pen and from that time     lived chiefly at the convent or the castle     so he became a very learned youth     but oh poor wretchhe read and read and read     till his brain turnedand ere his twentieth year     he had unlawful thoughts of many things     and though he prayed he never loved to pray     with holy men nor in a holy place     but yet his speech it was so soft and sweet     the late lord velez neer was wearied with him     and once as by the north side of the chapel     they stood together chained in deep discourse     the earth heaved under them with such a groan     that the wall tottered and had wellnigh fallen     right on their heads my lord was sorely frightened     a fever seized him and he made confession     of all the heretical and lawless talk     which brought this judgment so the youth was seized     and cast into that hole my husbands father     sobbed like a childit almost broke his heart     and once as he was working in the cellar     he heard a voice distinctly twas the youths     who sung a doleful song about green fields     how sweet it were on lake or wild savannah     to hunt for food and be a naked man     and wander up and down at liberty     he always doted on the youth and now     his love grew desperate and defying death     he made that cunning entrance i described     and the young man escaped      maria                                tis a sweet tale     such as would lull a listening child to sleep     his rosy face

younger brother     went likewise and when he returned to spain     he told leoni that the poor mad youth     soon after they arrived in that new world     in spite of his dissuasion seized a boat     and all alone set sail by silent moonlight     up a great river great as any sea     and neer was heard of more but tis supposed     he lived and died among the savage men    lines left upon a seat in

benevolence     the world and man himself appeared a scene     of kindred loveliness then he would sigh     with mournful joy to think that others felt     what he must never feel and so lost man

distinguishes the west no long thin slip     of sullen light no obscure trembling hues     come we will rest on this old mossy bridge     you see the glimmer of the stream beneath     but hear no murmuring it flows silently     oer its soft bed of verdure all is still     a balmy night and tho the stars be dim     yet let us think upon the vernal showers     that gladden the green earth and we shall find     a pleasure in the dimness of the stars     and hark the nightingale begins its song     most musical most melancholy  bird     a melancholy bird o idle thought     in nature there is nothing melancholy     but some nightwandering man whose heart was piercd     with the remembrance of a grievous wrong     or slow distemper or neglected love     and so poor wretch filld all things with himself     and made all gentle sounds tell back the tale     of his own sorrows he and such as he     first namd these notes a melancholy strain     and many a poet echoes the conceit     poet who hath been building up the rhyme     when he had better far have stretchd his limbs     beside a brook in mossy forestdell     by sun or moonlight to the influxes     of shapes and sounds and shifting elements     surrendering his whole spirit of his song     and of his fame forgetful so his fame     should share in natures immortality     a venerable thing and so his song     should make all nature lovelier and itself     be lovd like naturebut twill not be so     and youths and maidens most poetical     who lose the deepning twilights of the spring     in ballrooms and hot theatres they still     full of meek sympathy must heave their sighs     oer philomelas pitypleading strains     my friend and my friends sister we have learnt     a different lore we may not thus profane     natures sweet voices always full of love     and joyance tis the merry nightingale     that crowds and hurries and precipitates     with fast thick warble his delicious notes     as he were fearful that an april night     would be too short for him to utter forth     his lovechant and disburthen his full soul     of all its music and i know a grove     of large extent hard by a castle huge     which the great lord inhabits not and so     this grove is wild with tangling underwood     and the trim walks are broken up and grass     thin grass and kingcups grow within the paths     but never elsewhere in one place i knew     so many nightingales and far and near     in wood and thicket over the wide grove     they answer and provoke each others songs     with skirmish and capricious passagings     and murmurs musical and swift jug jug     and one low piping sound more sweet than all     stirring the air with such an harmony     that should you close your eyes you might almost     forget it was not day on moonlight bushes     whose dewy leafits are but half disclosd     you may perchance behold them on the twigs     their bright bright eyes their eyes both bright and full     glistning while many a glowworm in the shade     lights up her lovetorch                                a most gentle maid     who dwelleth in her hospitable home     hard by the castle and at latest eve     even like a lady vowd and dedicate     to something more than nature in the grove     glides thro the pathways she knows all their notes     that gentle maid and oft a moments space     what time the moon was lost behind a cloud     hath heard a pause of silence till the moon     emerging hath awakend earth and sky     with one sensation and those wakeful birds     have all burst forth in choral minstrelsy     as if one quick and sudden gale had swept     an hundred airy harps and she hath watchd     many a nightingale perch giddily     on blosmy twig still swinging from the breeze     and to that motion tune his wanton song     like tipsy joy that reels with tossing head      farewell o warbler till tomorrow eve     and you my friends farewell a short farewell     we have been loitering long and pleasantly     and now for our dear homesthat strain again     full fain it would delay memy dear babe     who capable of no articulate sound     mars all things with his imitative lisp     how he would place his hand beside his ear     his little hand the small forefinger up     and bid us listen and i deem it wise     to make him natures playmate he knows well     the evening star and once when he awoke     in most distressful mood some inward pain     had made up that strange thing an infants dream     i hurried with him to our orchard plot     and he beholds the moon and hushd at once     suspends his sobs and laughs most silently     while his fair eyes that swam with undropt tears     did glitter in the yellow moonbeam well     it is a fathers tale but if that heaven     should give me life his childhood shall grow up     familiar with these songs that with the night     he may associate joy once more farewell     sweet nightingale once more my friends farewell         most musical most melancholy this passage in milton     possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere     description it is spoken in the character of the melancholy     man and has therefore a dramatic propriety the author makes     this remark to rescue himself from the charge of having     alluded with levity to a line in milton a charge than which     none could be more painful to him except perhaps that of     having ridiculed his bible    the female vagrant       by derwents side my fathers cottage stood     the woman thus her artless story told     one field a flock and what the neighbouring flood     supplied to him were more than mines of gold     light was my sleep my days in transport rolld     with thoughtless joy i stretchd along the shore     my fathers nets or watched when from the fold     high oer the cliffs i led my fleecy store     a dizzy depth below his boat and twinkling oar      my father was a good and pious man     an honest man by honest parents bred     and i believe that soon as i began     to lisp he made me kneel beside my bed     and in his hearing there my prayers i said     and afterwards by my good father taught     i read and loved the books in which i read     for books in every neighbouring house i sought     and nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought      can i forget what charms did once adorn     my garden stored with pease and mint and thyme     and rose and lilly for the sabbath morn     the sabbath bells and their delightful chime     the gambols and wild freaks at shearing time     my hens rich nest through long grass scarce espied     the cowslipgathering at mays dewy prime     the swans that when i sought the waterside     from far to meet me came spreading their snowy pride      the staff i yet remember which upbore     the bending body of my active sire     his seat beneath the honeyed sycamore     when the bees hummed and chair by winter fire     when marketmorning came the neat attire     with which though bent on haste myself i deckd     my watchful dog whose starts of furious ire     when stranger passed so often i have checkd     the redbreast known for years which at my casement peckd      the suns of twenty summers danced along     ah little marked how fast they rolled away     then rose a mansion proud our woods among     and cottage after cottage owned its sway     no joy to see a neighbouring house or stray     through pastures not his own the master took     my father dared his greedy wish gainsay     he loved his old hereditary nook     and ill could i the thought of such sad parting brook      but when he had refused the proffered gold     to cruel injuries he became a prey     sore traversed in whateer he bought and sold     his troubles grew upon him day by day     till all his substance fell into decay     his little range of water was denied      all but the bed where his old body lay     all all was seized and weeping side by side     we sought a home where we uninjured might abide      can i forget that miserable hour     when from the last hilltop my sire surveyed     peering above the trees the steeple tower     that on his marriageday sweet music made     till then he hoped his bones might there be laid     close by my mother in their native bowers     bidding me trust in god he stood and prayed     i could not praythrough tears that fell in showers     glimmerd our dearloved home alas no longer ours      there was a youth whom i had loved so long     that when i loved him not i cannot say     mid the green mountains many and many a song     we two had sung like little birds in may     when we began to tire of childish play     we seemed still more and more to prize each other     we talked of marriage and our marriage day     and i in truth did love him like a brother     for never could i hope to meet with such another      his father said that to a distant town     he must repair to ply the artists trade     what tears of bitter grief till then unknown     what tender vows our last sad kiss delayed     to him we turnedwe had no other aid     like one revived upon his neck i wept     and her whom he had loved in joy he said     he well could love in grief his faith he kept     and in a quiet home once more my father slept      four years each day with daily bread was blest     by constant toil and constant prayer supplied     three lovely infants lay upon my breast     and often viewing their sweet smiles i sighed     and knew not why my happy father died     when sad distress reduced the childrens meal     thrice happy that from him the grave did hide     the empty loom cold hearth and silent wheel     and tears that flowed for ills which patience could not heal      twas a hard change an evil time was come     we had no hope and no relief could gain     but soon with proud parade the noisy drum     beat round to sweep the streets of want and pain     my husbands arms now only served to strain     me and his children hungering in his view     in such dismay my prayers and tears were vain     to join those miserable men he flew     and now to the seacoast with numbers more we drew      there foul neglect for months and months we bore     nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred     green fields before us and our native shore     by fever from polluted air incurred     ravage was made for which no knell was heard     fondly we wished and wished away nor knew     mid that long sickness and those hopes deferrd     that happier days we never more must view     the parting signal streamed at last the land withdrew      but from delay the summer calms were past     on as we drove the equinoctial deep     ran mountainshigh before the howling blaft     we gazed with terror on the gloomy sleep     of them that perished in the whirlwinds sweep     untaught that soon such anguish must ensue     our hopes such harvest of affliction reap     that we the mercy of the waves should rue     we reached the western world a poor devoted crew      oh dreadful price of being to resign     all that is dear in being better far     in wants most lonely cave till death to pine     unseen unheard unwatched by any star     or in the streets and walks where proud men are     better our dying bodies to obtrude     than doglike wading at the heels of war     protract a curst existence with the brood     that lap their very nourishment their brothers blood      the pains and plagues that on our heads came down     disease and famine agony and fear     in wood or wilderness in camp or town     it would thy brain unsettle even to hear     all perishedall in one remorseless year     husband and children one by one by sword     and ravenous plague all perished every tear     dried up despairing desolate on board     a british ship i waked as from a trance restored      peaceful as some immeasurable plain     by the first beams of dawning light impressd     in the calm sunshine slept the glittering main     the very ocean has its hour of rest     that comes not to the human mourners breast     remote from man and storms of mortal care     a heavenly silence did the waves invest     i looked and looked along the silent air     until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair      ah how unlike those late terrific sleeps     and groans that rage of racking famine spoke     where looks inhuman dwelt on festering heaps     the breathing pestilence that rose like smoke     the shriek that from the distant battle broke     the mines dire earthquake and the pallid host     driven by the bombs incessant thunderstroke     to loathsome vaults where heartsick anguish tossd     hope died and fear itself in agony was lost      yet does that burst of woe congeal my frame     when the dark streets appeared to heave and gape     while like a sea the storming army came     and fire from hell reared his gigantic shape     and murder by the ghastly gleam and rape     seized their joint prey the mother and the child     but from these crazing thoughts my brain escape     for weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild     and on the gliding vessel heaven and ocean smiled      some mighty gulph of separation past     i seemed transported to another world     a thought resigned with pain when from the mast     the impatient mariner the sail unfurld     and whistling called the wind that hardly curled     the silent sea from the sweet thoughts of home     and from all hope i was forever hurled     for mefarthest from earthly port to roam     was best could i but shun the spot where man might come      and oft robbd of my perfect mind i thought     at last my feet a restingplace had found     here will i weep in peace so fancy wrought     roaming the illimitable waters round     here watch of every human friend disowned     all day my ready tomb the oceanflood     to break my dream the vessel reached its bound     and homeless near a thousand homes i stood     and near a thousand tables pined and wanted food      by grief enfeebled was i turned adrift     helpless as sailor cast on desart rock     nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift     nor dared my hand at any door to knock     i lay where with his drowsy mates the cock     from the cross timber of an outhouse hung     how dismal tolled that night the city clock     at morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung     nor to the beggars language could i frame my tongue      so passed another day and so the third     then did i try in vain the crowds resort     in deep despair by frightful wishes stirrd     near the seaside i reached a ruined fort     there pains which nature could no more support     with blindness linked did on my vitals fall     dizzy my brain with interruption short     of hideous sense i sunk nor step could crawl     and thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital      recovery came with food but still my brain     was weak nor of the past had memory     i heard my neighbours in their beds complain     of many things which never troubled me     of feet still bustling round with busy glee     of looks where common kindness had no part     of service done with careless cruelty     fretting the fever round the languid heart     and groans which as they said would make a dead man start      these things just served to stir the torpid sense     nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised     memory though slow returned with strength and thence     dismissed again on open day i gazed     at houses men and common light amazed     the lanes i sought and as the sun retired     came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed     the wild brood saw me weep my fate enquired     and gave me food and rest more welcome more desired      my heart is touched to think that men like these     the rude earths tenants were my first relief     how kindly did they paint their vagrant ease     and their long holiday that feared not grief     for all belonged to all and each was chief     no plough their sinews strained on grating road     no wain they drove and yet the yellow sheaf     in every vale for their delight was stowed     for them in natures meads the milky udder flowed      semblance with straw and pauniered ass they made     of potters wandering on from door to door     but life of happier sort to me pourtrayed     and other joys my fancy to allure     the bagpipe dinning on the midnight moor     in barn uplighted and companions boon     well met from far with revelry secure     in depth of forest glade when jocund june     rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon      but ill it suited me in journey dark     oer moor and mountain midnight theft to hatch     to charm the surly housedogs faithful bark     or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch     the gloomy lantern and the dim blue match     the black disguise the warning whistle shrill     and ear still busy on its nightly watch     were not for me brought up in nothing ill     besides on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still      what could i do unaided and unblest     poor father gone was every friend of thine     and kindred of dead husband are at best     small help and after marriage such as mine     with little kindness would to me incline     ill was i then for toil or service fit     with tears whose course no effort could confine     by highway side forgetful would i sit     whole hours my idle arms in moping sorrow knit      i lived upon the mercy of the fields     and oft of cruelty the sky accused     on hazard or what general bounty yields     now coldly given now utterly refused     the fields i for my bed have often used     but what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth     is that i have my inner self abused     foregone the home delight of constant truth     and clear and open soul so prized in fearless youth      three years a wanderer often have i viewd     in tears the sun towards that country tend     where my poor heart lost all its fortitude     and now across this moor my steps i bend     oh tell me whitherfor no earthly friend     have ishe ceased and weeping turned away     as if because her tale was at an end     she weptbecause she had no more to say     of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay         several of the lakes in the north of

matter     what ist that ails young harry gill     that evermore his teeth they chatter     chatter chatter chatter still     of waistcoats harry has no lack     good duffle grey and flannel fine     he has a blanket on his back     and coats enough to smother nine      in march december and in july     tis all the same with harry gill     the neighbours tell and tell you truly     his teeth they chatter chatter still     at night at morning and at noon     tis all the same with harry gill     beneath the sun beneath the moon     his teeth they chatter chatter still      young harry was a lusty drover     and who so stout of limb as he     his cheeks were red as ruddy clover     his voice was like the voice of three     auld goody blake was old and poor     ill fedd she was and thinly clad     and any man who passd her door     might see how poor a hut she had      all day she spun in her poor dwelling     and then her three hours work at night     alas twas hardly worth the telling     it would not pay for candlelight     this woman dwelt in dorsetshire     her hut was on a cold hillside     and in that country coals are dear     for they come far by wind and tide      by the same fire to boil their pottage     two poor old dames as i have known     will often live in one small cottage     but she poor woman dwelt alone     twas well enough when summer came     the long warm lightsome summerday     then at her door the canty dame     would sit as any linnet gay      but when the ice our streams did fetter     oh then how her old bones would shake     you would have said if you had met her     twas a hard time for goody blake     her evenings then were dull and dead     sad case it was as you may think     for very cold to go to bed     and then for cold not sleep a wink      oh joy for her when eer in winter     the winds at night had made a rout     and scatterd many a lusty splinter     and many a rotten bough about     yet never had she well or sick     as every man who knew her says     a pile beforehand wood or stick     enough to warm her for three days      now when the frost was past enduring     and made her poor old bones to ache     could any thing be more alluring     than an old hedge to goody blake     and now and then it must be said     when her old bones were cold and chill     she left her fire or left her bed     to seek the hedge of harry gill      now harry he had long suspected     this trespass of old goody blake     and vowd that she should be detected     and he on her would vengeance take     and oft from his warm fire hed go     and to the fields his road would take     and there at night in frost and snow     he watchd to seize old goody blake      and once behind a rick of barley     thus looking out did harry stand     the moon was full and shining clearly     and crisp with frost the stubbleland     he hears a noisehes all awake     againon tiptoe down the hill     he softly creepstis goody blake     shes at the hedge of harry gill      right glad was he when he beheld her     stick after stick did goody pull     he stood behind a bush of elder     till she had filled her apron full     when with her load she turned about     the byeroad back again to take     he started forward with a shout     and sprang upon poor goody blake      and fiercely by the arm he took her     and by the arm he held her fast     and fiercely by the arm he shook her     and cried ive caught you then at last     then goody who had nothing said     her bundle from her lap let fall     and kneeling on the sticks she prayd     to god that is the judge of all      she prayd her witherd hand uprearing     while harry held her by the arm     god who art never out of hearing     o may he never more be warm     the cold cold moon above her head     thus on her knees did goody pray     young harry heard what she had said     and icycold he turned away      he went complaining all the morrow     that he was cold and very chill     his face was gloom his heart was sorrow     alas that day for harry gill     that day he wore a ridingcoat     but not a whit the warmer he     another was on thursday brought     and ere the sabbath he had three      twas all in vain a useless matter     and blankets were about him pinnd     yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter     like a loose casement in the wind     and harrys flesh it fell away     and all who see him say tis plain     that live as long as live he may     he never will be warm again      no word to any man he utters     abed or up to young or old     but ever to himself he mutters     poor harry gill is very cold     abed or up by night or day     his teeth they chatter chatter still     now think ye farmers all i pray     of goody blake

sweet shire of cardigan     not far from pleasant ivorhall     an old man dwells a little man     ive heard he once was tall     of years he has upon his back     no doubt a burthen weighty     he says he is three score and ten     but others say hes eighty      a long blue liverycoat has he     thats fair behind and fair before     yet meet him where you will you see     at once that he is poor     full five and twenty years he lived     a running huntsman merry     and though he has but one eye left     his cheek is like a cherry      no man like him the horn could sound     and no man was so full of glee     to say the least four counties round     had heard of simon lee     his masters dead and no one now     dwells in the hall of ivor     men dogs and horses all are dead     he is the sole survivor      his hunting feats have him bereft     of his right eye as you may see     and then what limbs those feats have left     to poor old simon lee     he has no son he has no child     his wife an aged woman     lives with him near the waterfall     upon the village common      and he is lean and he is sick     his little bodys half awry     his ancles they are swoln and thick     his legs are thin and dry     when he was young he little knew     of husbandry or tillage     and now hes forced to work though weak     the weakest in the village      he all the country could outrun     could leave both man and horse behind     and often ere the race was done     he reeled and was stoneblind     and still theres something in the world     at which his heart rejoices     for when the chiming hounds are out     he dearly loves their voices      old ruth works out of doors with him     and does what simon cannot do     for she not over stout of limb     is stouter of the two     and though you with your utmost skill     from labour could not wean them     alas tis very little all     which they can do between them      beside their mossgrown hut of clay     not twenty paces from the door     a scrap of land they have but they     are poorest of the poor     this scrap of land he from the heath     enclosed when he was stronger     but what avails the land to them     which they can till no longer      few months of life has he in store     as he to you will tell     for still the more he works the more     his poor old ancles swell     my gentle reader i perceive     how patiently youve waited     and im afraid that you expect     some tale will be related      o reader had you in your mind     such stores as silent thought can bring     o gentle reader you would find     a tale in every thing     what more i have to say is short     i hope youll kindly take it     it is no tale but should you think     perhaps a tale youll make it      one summerday i chanced to see     this old man doing all he could     about the root of an old tree     a stump of rotten wood     the mattock totterd in his hand     so vain was his endeavour     that at the root of the old tree     he might have worked for ever      youre overtasked good simon lee     give me your tool to him i said     and at the word right gladly he     received my profferd aid     i struck and with a single blow     the tangled root i severd     at which the poor old man so long     and vainly had endeavourd      the tears into his eyes were brought     and thanks and praises seemed to run     so fast out of his heart i thought     they never would have done     ive heard of hearts unkind kind deeds     with coldness still returning     alas the gratitude of men     has oftner left me mourning    anecdote for fathers shewing how the art of lying may be taught       i have a boy of five years old     his face is fair and fresh to see     his limbs are cast in beautys mould     and dearly he loves me      one morn we strolld on our dry walk     our quiet house all full in view     and held such intermitted talk     as we are wont to do      my thoughts on former pleasures ran     i thought of kilves delightful shore     my pleasant home when spring began     a long long year before      a day it was when i could bear     to think and think and think again     with so much happiness to spare     i could not feel a pain      my boy was by my side so slim     and graceful in his rustic dress     and oftentimes i talked to him     in very idleness      the young lambs ran a pretty race     the morning sun shone bright and warm     kilve said i was a pleasant place     and so is liswyn farm      my little boy which like you more     i said and took him by the arm     our home by kilves delightful shore     or here at liswyn farm      and tell me had you rather be     i said and held him by the arm     at kilves smooth shore by the green sea     or here at liswyn farm      in careless mood he looked at me     while still i held him by the arm     and said at kilve id rather be     than here at liswyn farm      now little edward say why so     my little edward tell me why     i cannot tell i do not know     why this is strange said i      for here are woods and greenhills warm     there surely must some reason be     why you would change sweet liswyn farm     for kilve by the green sea      at this my boy so fair and slim     hung down his head nor made reply     and five times did i say to him     why edward tell me why      his head he raisedthere was in sight     it caught his eye he saw it plain     upon the housetop glittering bright     a broad and gilded vane      then did the boy his tongue unlock     and thus to me he made reply     at kilve there was no weathercock     and thats the reason why      oh dearest dearest boy my heart     for better lore would seldom yearn     could i but teach the hundredth part     of what from thee i learn    we are seven       a simple child dear brother jim     that lightly draws its breath     and feels its life in every limb     what should it know of death      i met a little cottage girl     she was eight years old she said     her hair was thick with many a curl     that clusterd round her head      she had a rustic woodland air     and she was wildly clad     her eyes were fair and very fair     her beauty made me glad      sisters and brothers little maid     how many may you be     how many seven in all she said     and wondering looked at me      and where are they i pray you tell     she answered seven are we     and two of us at conway dwell     and two are gone to sea      two of us in the churchyard lie     my sister and my brother     and in the churchyard cottage i     dwell near them with my mother      you say that two at conway dwell     and two are gone to sea     yet you are seven i pray you tell     sweet maid how this may be      then did the little maid reply     seven boys and girls are we     two of us in the churchyard lie     beneath the churchyard tree      you run about my little maid     your limbs they are alive     if two are in the churchyard laid     then ye are only five      their graves are green they may be seen     the little maid replied     twelve steps or more from my mothers door     and they are side by side      my stockings there i often knit     my kerchief there i hem     and there upon the ground i sit     i sit and sing to them      and often after sunset sir     when it is light and fair     i take my little porringer     and eat my supper there      the first that died was little jane     in bed she moaning lay     till god released her of her pain     and then she went away      so in the churchyard she was laid     and all the summer dry     together round her grave we played     my brother john and i      and when the ground was white with snow     and i could run and slide     my brother john was forced to go     and he lies by her side      how many are you then said i     if they two are in heaven     the little maiden did reply     o master we are seven      but they are dead those two are dead     their spirits are in heaven     twas throwing words away for still     the little maid would have her will     and said nay we are seven    lines written in early spring       i heard a thousand blended notes     while in a grove i sate reclined     in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts     bring sad thoughts to the mind      to her fair works did nature link     the human soul that through me ran     and much it grievd my heart to think     what man has made of man      through primrosetufts in that sweet bower     the periwinkle traild its wreathes     and tis my faith that every flower     enjoys the air it breathes      the birds around me hoppd and playd     their thoughts i cannot measure     but the least motion which they made     it seemd a thrill of pleasure      the budding twigs spread out their fan     to catch the breezy air     and i must think do all i can     that there was pleasure there      if i these thoughts may not prevent     if such be of my creed the plan     have i not reason to lament     what man has made of man    the thorn   i      there is a thorn it looks so old     in truth youd find it hard to say     how it could ever have been young     it looks so old and grey     not higher than a twoyears child     it stands erect this aged thorn     no leaves it has no thorny points     it is a mass of knotted joints     a wretched thing forlorn     it stands erect and like a stone     with lichens it is overgrown   ii      like rock or stone it is oergrown     with lichens to the very top     and hung with heavy tufts of moss     a melancholy crop     up from the earth these mosses creep     and this poor thorn they clasp it round     so close youd say that they were bent     with plain and manifest intent     to drag it to the ground     and all had joined in one endeavour     to bury this poor thorn for ever   iii      high on a mountains highest ridge     where oft the stormy winter gale     cuts like a scythe while through the clouds     it sweeps from vale to vale     not five yards from the mountainpath     this thorn you on your left espy     and to the left three yards beyond     you see a little muddy pond     of water never dry     ive measured it from side to side     tis three feet long and two feet wide   iv      and close beside this aged thorn     there is a fresh and lovely sight     a beauteous heap a hill of moss     just half a foot in height     all lovely colours there you see     all colours that were ever seen     and mossy network too is there     as if by hand of lady fair     the work had woven been     and cups the darlings of the eye     so deep is their vermilion dye   v      ah me what lovely tints are there     of olivegreen and scarlet bright     in spikes in branches and in stars     green red and pearly white     this heap of earth oergrown with moss     which close beside the thorn you see     so fresh in all its beauteous dyes     is like an infants grave in size     as like as like can be     but never never any where     an infants grave was half so fair   vi      now would you see this aged thorn     this pond and beauteous hill of moss     you must take care and chuse your time     the mountain when to cross     for oft there sits between the heap     thats like an infants grave in size     and that same pond of which i spoke     a woman in a scarlet cloak     and to herself she cries     oh misery oh misery     oh woe is me oh misery   vii      at all times of the day and night     this wretched woman thither goes     and she is known to every star     and every wind that blows     and there beside the thorn she sits     when the blue daylights in the skies     and when the whirlwinds on the hill     or frosty air is keen and still     and to herself she cries     oh misery oh misery     oh woe is me oh misery   viii      now wherefore thus by day and night     in rain in tempest and in snow     thus to the dreary mountaintop     does this poor woman go     and why sits she beside the thorn     when the blue daylights in the sky     or when the whirlwinds on the hill     or frosty air is keen and still     and wherefore does she cry     oh wherefore wherefore tell me why     does she repeat that doleful cry   ix      i cannot tell i wish i could     for the true reason no one knows     but if youd gladly view the spot     the spot to which she goes     the heap thats like an infants grave     the pondand thorn so old and grey     pass by her doortis seldom shut     and if you see her in her hut     then to the spot away     i never heard of such as dare     approach the spot when she is there   x      but wherefore to the mountaintop     can this unhappy woman go     whatever star is in the skies     whatever wind may blow     nay rack your braintis all in vain     ill tell you every thing i know     but to the thorn and to the pond     which is a little step beyond     i wish that you would go     perhaps when you are at the place     you something of her tale may trace   xi      ill give you the best help i can     before you up the mountain go     up to the dreary mountaintop     ill tell you all i know     tis now some two and twenty years     since she her name is martha ray     gave with a maidens true good will     her company to stephen hill     and she was blithe and gay     and she was happy happy still     wheneer she thought of stephen hill   xii      and they had fixd the weddingday     the morning that must wed them both     but stephen to another maid     had sworn another oath     and with this other maid to church     unthinking stephen went     poor martha on that woful day     a cruel cruel fire they say     into her bones was sent     it dried her body like a cinder     and almost turnd her brain to tinder   xiii      they say full six months after this     while yet the summerleaves were green     she to the mountaintop would go     and there was often seen     tis said a child was in her womb     as now to any eye was plain     she was with child and she was mad     yet often she was sober sad     from her exceeding pain     oh me ten thousand times id rather     that he had died that cruel father   xiv      sad case for such a brain to hold     communion with a stirring child     sad case as you may think for one     who had a brain so wild     last christmas when we talked of this     old farmer simpson did maintain     that in her womb the infant wrought     about its mothers heart and brought     her senses back again     and when at last her time drew near     her looks were calm her senses clear   xv      no more i know i wish i did     and i would tell it all to you     for what became of this poor child     theres none that ever knew     and if a child was born or no     theres no one that could ever tell     and if twas born alive or dead     theres no one knows as i have said     but some remember well     that martha ray about this time     would up the mountain often climb   xvi      and all that winter when at night     the wind blew from the mountainpeak     twas worth your while though in the dark     the churchyard path to seek     for many a time and oft were heard     cries coming from the mountainhead     some plainly living voices were     and others ive heard many swear     were voices of the dead     i cannot think whateer they say     they had to do with martha ray   xvii      but that she goes to this old thorn     the thorn which ive described to you     and there sits in a scarlet cloak     i will be sworn is true     for one day with my telescope     to view the ocean wide and bright     when to this country first i came     ere i had heard of marthas name     i climbed the mountains height     a storm came on and i could see     no object higher than my knee   xviii      twas mist and rain and storm and rain     no screen no fence could i discover     and then the wind in faith it was     a wind full ten times over     i looked around i thought i saw     a jutting crag and oft i ran     headforemost through the driving rain     the shelter of the crag to gain     and as i am a man     instead of jutting crag i found     a woman seated on the ground   xix      i did not speaki saw her face     her face it was enough for me     i turned about and heard her cry     o misery o misery     and there she sits until the moon     through half the clear blue sky will go     and when the little breezes make     the waters of the pond to shake     as all the country know     she shudders and you hear her cry     oh misery oh misery   xx      but whats the thorn and whats the pond     and whats the hill of moss to her     and whats the creeping breeze that comes     the little pond to stir     i cannot tell but some will say     she hanged her baby on the tree     some say she drowned it in the pond     which is a little step beyond     but all and each agree     the little babe was buried there     beneath that hill of moss so fair   xxi      ive heard the scarlet moss is red     with drops of that poor infants blood     but kill a newborn infant thus     i do not think she could     some say if to the pond you go     and fix on it a steady view     the shadow of a babe you trace     a baby and a babys face     and that it looks at you     wheneer you look on it tis plain     the baby looks at you again   xxii      and some had sworn an oath that she     should be to public justice brought     and for the little infants bones     with spades they would have sought     but then the beauteous hill of moss     before their eyes began to stir     and for full fifty yards around     the grass it shook upon the ground     but all do still aver     the little babe is buried there     beneath that hill of moss so fair   xxiii      i cannot tell how this may be     but plain it is the thorn is bound     with heavy tufts of moss that strive     to drag it to the ground     and this i know full many a time     when she was on the mountain high     by day and in the silent night     when all the stars shone clear and bright     that i have heard her cry     oh misery oh misery     o woe is me oh misery    the last of the flock       in distant countries i have been     and yet i have not often seen     a healthy man a man full grown     weep in the public roads alone     but such a one on english ground     and in the broad highway i met     along the broad highway he came     his cheeks with tears were wet     sturdy he seemed though he was sad     and in his arms a lamb he had      he saw me and he turned aside     as if he wished himself to hide     then with his coat he made essay     to wipe those briny tears away     i followd him and said my friend     what ails you wherefore weep you so     shame on me sir this lusty lamb     he makes my tears to flow     today i fetched him from the rock     he is the last of all my flock      when i was young a single man     and after youthful follies ran     though little given to care and thought     yet so it was a ewe i bought     and other sheep from her i raised     as healthy sheep as you might see     and then i married and was rich     as i could wish to be     of sheep i numberd a full score     and every year encreasd my store      year after year my stock it grew     and from this one this single ewe     full fifty comely sheep i raised     as sweet a flock as ever grazed     upon the mountain did they feed     they throve and we at home did thrive     this lusty lamb of all my store     is all that is alive     and now i care not if we die     and perish all of poverty      ten children sir had i to feed     hard labour in a time of need     my pride was tamed and in our grief     i of the parish askd relief     they said i was a wealthy man     my sheep upon the mountain fed     and it was fit that thence i took     whereof to buy us bread     do this how can we give to you     they cried what to the poor is due      i sold a sheep as they had said     and bought my little children bread     and they were healthy with their food     for me it never did me good     a woeful time it was for me     to see the end of all my gains     the pretty flock which i had reared     with all my care and pains     to see it melt like snow away     for me it was a woeful day      another still and still another     a little lamb and then its mother     it was a vein that never stoppd     like blooddrops from my heart they droppd     till thirty were not left alive     they dwindled dwindled one by one     and i may say that many a time     i wished they all were gone     they dwindled one by one away     for me it was a woeful day      to wicked deeds i was inclined     and wicked fancies crossd my mind     and every man i chancd to see     i thought he knew some ill of me     no peace no comfort could i find     no ease within doors or without     and crazily and wearily     i went my work about     ofttimes i thought to run away     for me it was a woeful day      sir twas a precious flock to me     as dear as my own children be     for daily with my growing store     i loved my children more and more     alas it was an evil time     god cursed me in my sore distress     i prayed yet every day i thought     i loved my children less     and every week and every day     my flock it seemed to melt away      they dwindled sir sad sight to see     from ten to five from five to three     a lamb a weather and a ewe     and then at last from three to two     and of my fifty yesterday     i had but only one     and here it lies upon my arm     alas and i have none     today i fetched it from the rock     it is the last of all my flock    the dungeon       and this place our forefathers made for man     this is the process of our love and wisdom     to each poor brother who offends against us     most innocent perhapsand what if guilty     is this the only cure merciful god     each pore and natural outlet shrivelld up     by ignorance and parching poverty     his energies roll back upon his heart     and stagnate and corrupt till changed to poison     they break out on him like a loathsome plaguespot     then we call in our pamperd mountebanks     and this is their best cure uncomforted     and friendless solitude groaning and tears     and savage faces at the clanking hour     seen through the steams and vapour of his dungeon     by the lamps dismal twilight so he lies     circled with evil till his very soul     unmoulds its essence hopelessly deformed     by sights of ever more deformity      with other ministrations thou o nature     healest thy wandering and distempered child     thou pourest on him thy soft influences     thy sunny hues fair forms and breathing sweets     thy melodies of woods and winds and waters     till he relent and can no more endure     to be a jarring and a dissonant thing     amid this general dance and minstrelsy     but bursting into tears wins back his way     his angry spirit healed and harmonized     by the benignant touch of love and beauty    the mad mother       her eyes are wild her head is bare     the sun has burnt her coalblack hair     her eyebrows have a rusty stain     and she came far from over the main     she has a baby on her arm     or else she were alone     and underneath the haystack warm     and on the greenwood stone     she talked and sung the woods among     and it was in the english tongue      sweet babe they say

the owlet in the moonlight air     he shouts from nobody knows where     he lengthens out his lonely shout     halloo halloo a long halloo      why bustle thus about your door     what means this bustle betty foy     why are you in this mighty fret     and why on horseback have you set     him whom you love your idiot boy      beneath the moon that shines so bright     till she is tired let betty foy     with girt and stirrup fiddlefaddle     but wherefore set upon a saddle     him whom she loves her idiot boy      theres scarce a soul thats out of bed     good betty put him down again     his lips with joy they burr at you     but betty what has he to do     with stirrup saddle or with rein      the world will say tis very idle     bethink you of the time of night     theres not a mother no not one     but when she hears what you have done     oh betty shell be in a fright      but bettys bent on her intent     for her good neighbour susan gale     old susan she who dwells alone     is sick and makes a piteous moan     as if her very life would fail      theres not a house within a mile     no hand to help them in distress     old susan lies a bed in pain     and sorely puzzled are the twain     for what she ails they cannot guess      and bettys husbands at the wood     where by the week he doth abide     a woodman in the distant vale     theres none to help poor susan gale     what must be done what will betide      and betty from the lane has fetched     her pony that is mild and good     whether he be in joy or pain     feeding at will along the lane     or bringing faggots from the wood      and he is all in travelling trim     and by the moonlight betty foy     has up upon the saddle set     the like was never heard of yet     him whom she loves her idiot boy      and he must post without delay     across the bridge thats in the dale     and by the church and oer the down     to bring a doctor from the town     or she will die old susan gale      there is no need of boot or spur     there is no need of whip or wand     for johnny has his hollybough     and with a hurlyburly now     he shakes the green bough in his hand      and betty oer and oer has told     the boy who is her best delight     both what to follow what to shun     what do and what to leave undone     how turn to left and how to right      and bettys most especial charge     was johnny johnny mind that you     come home again nor stop at all     come home again whateer befal     my johnny do i pray you do      to this did johnny answer make     both with his head and with his hand     and proudly shook the bridle too     and then his words were not a few     which betty well could understand      and now that johnny is just going     though bettys in a mighty flurry     she gently pats the ponys side     on which her idiot boy must ride     and seems no longer in a hurry      but when the pony moved his legs     oh then for the poor idiot boy     for joy he cannot hold the bridle     for joy his head and heels are idle     hes idle all for very joy      and while the pony moves his legs     in johnnys lefthand you may see     the green boughs motionless and dead     the moon that shines above his head     is not more still and mute than he      his heart it was so full of glee     that till full fifty yards were gone     he quite forgot his holly whip     and all his skill in horsemanship     oh happy happy happy john      and bettys standing at the door     and bettys face with joy oerflows     proud of herself and proud of him     she sees him in his travelling trim     how quietly her johnny goes      the silence of her idiot boy     what hopes it sends to bettys heart     hes at the guideposthe turns right     she watches till hes out of sight     and betty will not then depart      burr burrnow johnnys lips they burr     as loud as any mill or near it     meek as a lamb the pony moves     and johnny makes the noise he loves     and betty listens glad to hear it      away she hies to susan gale     and johnnys in a merry tune     the owlets hoot the owlets curr     and johnnys lips they burr burr burr     and on he goes beneath the moon      his steed and he right well agree     for of this pony theres a rumour     that should he lose his eyes and ears     and should he live a thousand years     he never will be out of humour      but then he is a horse that thinks     and when he thinks his pace is slack     now though he knows poor johnny well     yet for his life he cannot tell     what he has got upon his back      so through the moonlight lanes they go     and far into the moonlight dale     and by the church and oer the down     to bring a doctor from the town     to comfort poor old susan gale      and betty now at susans side     is in the middle of her story     what comfort johnny soon will bring     with many a most diverting thing     of johnnys wit and johnnys glory      and bettys still at susans side     by this time shes not quite so flurried     demure with porringer and plate     she sits as if in susans fate     her life and soul were buried      but betty poor good woman she     you plainly in her face may read it     could lend out of that moments store     five years of happiness or more     to any that might need it      but yet i guess that now and then     with betty all was not so well     and to the road she turns her ears     and thence full many a sound she hears     which she to susan will not tell      poor susan moans poor susan groans     as sure as theres a moon in heaven     cries betty hell be back again     theyll both be here tis almost ten     theyll both be here before eleven      poor susan moans poor susan groans     the clock gives warning for eleven     tis on the strokeif johnnys near     quoth betty he will soon be here     as sure as theres a moon in heaven      the clock is on the stroke of twelve     and johnny is not yet in sight     the moons in heaven as betty sees     but betty is not quite at ease     and susan has a dreadful night      and betty half an hour ago     on johnny vile reflections cast     a little idle sauntering thing     with other names an endless string     but now that time is gone and past      and bettys drooping at the heart     that happy time all past and gone     how can it be he is so late     the doctor he has made him wait     susan theyll both be here anon      and susans growing worse and worse     and bettys in a sad quandary     and then theres nobody to say     if she must go or she must stay     shes in a sad quandary      the clock is on the stroke of one     but neither doctor nor his guide     appear along the moonlight road     theres neither horse nor man abroad     and bettys still at susans side      and susan she begins to fear     of sad mischances not a few     that johnny may perhaps be drownd     or lost perhaps and never found     which they must both for ever rue      she prefaced half a hint of this     with god forbid it should be true     at the first word that susan said     cried betty rising from the bed     susan id gladly stay with you      i must be gone i must away     consider johnnys but halfwise     susan we must take care of him     if he is hurt in life or limb     oh god forbid poor susan cries      what can i do says betty going     what can i do to ease your pain     good susan tell me and ill stay     i fear youre in a dreadful way     but i shall soon be back again      good betty go good betty go     theres nothing that can ease my pain     then off she hies but with a prayer     that god poor susans life would spare     till she comes back again      so through the moonlight lane she goes     and far into the moonlight dale     and how she ran and how she walked     and all that to herself she talked     would surely be a tedious tale      in high and low above below     in great and small in round and square     in tree and tower was johnny seen     in bush and brake in black and green     twas johnny johnny every where      shes past the bridge thats in the dale     and now the thought torments her sore     johnny perhaps his horse forsook     to hunt the moon thats in the brook     and never will be heard of more      and now shes high upon the down     alone amid a prospect wide     theres neither johnny nor his horse     among the fern or in the gorse     theres neither doctor nor his guide      oh saints what is become of him     perhaps hes climbed into an oak     where he will stay till he is dead     or sadly he has been misled     and joined the wandering gypseyfolk      or him that wicked ponys carried     to the dark cave the goblins hall     or in the castle hes pursuing     among the ghosts his own undoing     or playing with the waterfall      at poor old susan then she railed     while to the town she posts away     if susan had not been so ill     alas i should have had him still     my johnny till my dying day      poor betty in this sad distemper     the doctors self would hardly spare     unworthy things she talked and wild     even he of cattle the most mild     the pony had his share      and now shes got into the town     and to the doctors door she hies     tis silence all on every side     the town so long the town so wide     is silent as the skies      and now shes at the doctors door     she lifts the knocker rap rap rap     the doctor at the casement shews     his glimmering eyes that peep and doze     and one hand rubs his old nightcap      oh doctor doctor wheres my johnny     im here what ist you want with me     oh sir you know im betty foy     and i have lost my poor dear boy     you know himhim you often see      hes not so wise as some folks be     the devil take his wisdom said     the doctor looking somewhat grim     what woman should i know of him     and grumbling he went back to bed      o woe is me o woe is me     here will i die here will i die     i thought to find my johnny here     but he is neither far nor near     oh what a wretched mother i      she stops she stands she looks about     which way to turn she cannot tell     poor betty it would ease her pain     if she had heart to knock again     the clock strikes threea dismal knell      then up along the town she hies     no wonder if her senses fail     this piteous news so much it shockd her     she quite forgot to send the doctor     to comfort poor old susan gale      and now shes high upon the down     and she can see a mile of road     oh cruel im almost threescore     such night as this was neer before     theres not a single soul abroad      she listens but she cannot hear     the foot of horse the voice of man     the streams with softest sound are flowing     the grass you almost hear it growing     you hear it now if eer you can      the owlets through the long blue night     are shouting to each other still     fond lovers yet not quite hob nob     they lengthen out the tremulous sob     that echoes far from hill to hill      poor betty now has lost all hope     her thoughts are bent on deadly sin     a greengrown pond she just has passd     and from the brink she hurries fast     lest she should drown herself therein      and now she sits her down and weeps     such tears she never shed before     oh dear dear pony my sweet joy     oh carry back my idiot boy     and we will neer oerload thee more      a thought is come into her head     the pony he is mild and good     and we have always used him well     perhaps hes gone along the dell     and carried johnny to the wood      then up she springs as if on wings     she thinks no more of deadly sin     if betty fifty ponds should see     the last of all her thoughts would be     to drown herself therein      oh reader now that i might tell     what johnny and his horse are doing     what theyve been doing all this time     oh could i put it into rhyme     a most delightful tale pursuing      perhaps and no unlikely thought     he with his pony now doth roam     the cliffs and peaks so high that are     to lay his hands upon a star     and in his pocket bring it home      perhaps hes turned himself about     his face unto his horses tail     and still and mute in wonder lost     all like a silent horsemanghost     he travels on along the vale      and now perhaps hes hunting sheep     a fierce and dreadful hunter he     yon valley thats so trim and green     in five months time should he be seen     a desart wilderness will be      perhaps with head and heels on fire     and like the very soul of evil     hes galloping away away     and so hell gallop on for aye     the bane of all that dread the devil      i to the muses have been bound     these fourteen years by strong indentures     oh gentle muses let me tell     but half of what to him befel     for sure he met with strange adventures      oh gentle muses is this kind     why will ye thus my suit repel     why of your further aid bereave me     and can ye thus unfriended leave me     ye muses whom i love so well      whos yon that near the waterfall     which thunders down with headlong force     beneath the moon yet shining fair     as careless as if nothing were     sits upright on a feeding horse      unto his horse thats feeding free     he seems i think the rein to give     of moon or stars he takes no heed     of such we in romances read     tis johnny johnny as i live      and thats the very pony too     where is she where is betty foy     she hardly can sustain her fears     the roaring waterfall she hears     and cannot find her idiot boy      your ponys worth his weight in gold     then calm your terrors betty foy     shes coming from among the trees     and now all full in view she sees     him whom she loves her idiot boy      and betty sees the pony too     why stand you thus good betty foy     it is no goblin tis no ghost     tis he whom you so long have lost     he whom you love your idiot boy      she looks againher arms are up     she screamsshe cannot move for joy     she darts as with a torrents force     she almost has oerturned the horse     and fast she holds her idiot boy      and johnny burrs and laughs aloud     whether in cunning or in joy     i cannot tell but while he laughs     betty a drunken pleasure quaffs     to hear again her idiot boy      and now shes at the ponys tail     and now shes at the ponys head     on that side now and now on this     and almost stifled with her bliss     a few sad tears does betty shed      she kisses oer and oer again     him whom she loves her idiot boy     shes happy here shes happy there     she is uneasy every where     her limbs are all alive with joy      she pats the pony where or when     she knows not happy betty foy     the little pony glad may be     but he is milder far than she     you hardly can perceive his joy      oh johnny never mind the doctor     youve done your best and that is all     she took the reins when this was said     and gently turned the ponys head     from the loud waterfall      by this the stars were almost gone     the moon was setting on the hill     so pale you scarcely looked at her     the little birds began to stir     though yet their tongues were still      the pony betty and her boy     wind slowly through the woody dale     and who is she betimes abroad     that hobbles up the steep rough road     who is it but old susan gale      long susan lay deep lost in thought     and many dreadful fears beset her     both for her messenger and nurse     and as her mind grew worse and worse     her body it grew better      she turned she tossd herself in bed     on all sides doubts and terrors met her     point after point did she discuss     and while her mind was fighting thus     her body still grew better      alas what is become of them     these fears can never be endured     ill to the woodthe word scarce said     did susan rise up from her bed     as if by magic cured      away she posts up hill and down     and to the wood at length is come     she spies her friends she shouts a greeting     oh me it is a merry meeting     as ever was in christendom      the owls have hardly sung their last     while our four travellers homeward wend     the owls have hooted all night long     and with the owls began my song     and with the owls must end      for while they all were travelling home     cried betty tell us johnny do     where all this long night you have been     what you have heard what you have seen     and johnny mind you tell us true      now johnny all night long had heard     the owls in tuneful concert strive     no doubt too he the moon had seen     for in the moonlight he had been     from eight oclock

going many miles to take     a last leave of my son a mariner     who from a seafight has been brought to falmouth     and there is dying in an hospital    the complaint of a forsaken indian woman  when a northern indian from sickness is unable to continue his journey with his companions he is left behind covered over with deerskins and is supplied with water food and fuel if the situation of the place will afford it he is informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue and if he is unable to follow or overtake them he perishes alone in the desart unless he should have the good fortune to fall in with some other tribes of indians it is unnecessary to add that the females are equally or still more exposed to the same fate see that very interesting work hearnes journey from hudsons bay to the northern ocean when the northern lights as the same writer informs us vary their position in the air they make a rustling and a crackling noise this circumstance is alluded to in the first stanza of the following poem       before i see another day     oh let my body die away     in sleep i heard the northern gleams     the stars they were among my dreams     in sleep did i behold the skies     i saw the crackling flashes drive     and yet they are upon my eyes     and yet i am alive     before i see another day     oh let my body die away      my fire is dead it knew no pain     yet is it dead and i remain     all stiff with ice the ashes lie     and they are dead and i will die     when i was well i wished to live     for clothes for warmth for food and fire     but they to me no joy can give     no pleasure now and no desire     then here contented will i lie     alone i cannot fear to die      alas you might have dragged me on     another day a single one     too soon despair oer me prevailed     too soon my heartless spirit failed     when you were gone my limbs were stronger     and oh how grievously i rue     that afterwards a little longer     my friends i did not follow you     for strong and without pain i lay     my friends when you were gone away      my child they gave thee to another     a woman who was not thy mother     when from my arms my babe they took     on me how strangely did he look     through his whole body something ran     a most strange something did i see     as if he strove to be a man     that he might pull the sledge for me     and then he stretched his arms how wild     oh mercy like a little child      my little joy my little pride     in two days more i must have died     then do not weep and grieve for me     i feel i must have died with thee     oh wind that oer my head art flying     the way my friends their course did bend     i should not feel the pain of dying     could i with thee a message send     too soon my friends you went away     for i had many things to say      ill follow you across the snow     you travel heavily and slow     in spite of all my weary pain     ill look upon your tents again     my fire is dead and snowy white     the water which beside it stood     the wolf has come to me tonight     and he has stolen away my food     for ever left alone am i     then wherefore should i fear to die      my journey will be shortly run     i shall not see another sun     i cannot lift my limbs to know     if they have any life or no     my poor forsaken child if i     for once could have thee close to me     with happy heart i then would die     and my last thoughts would happy be     i feel my body die away     i shall not see another day    the convict       the glory of evening was spread through the west       on the slope of a mountain i stood     while the joy that precedes the calm season of rest       rang loud through the meadow and wood      and must we then part from a dwelling so fair       in the pain of my spirit i said     and with a deep sadness i turned to repair       to the cell where the convict is laid      the thickribbed walls that oershadow the gate       resound and the dungeons unfold     i pause and at length through the glimmering grate       that outcast of pity behold      his black matted head on his shoulder is bent       and deep is the sigh of his breath     and with stedfast dejection his eyes are intent       on the fetters that link him to death      tis sorrow enough on that visage to gaze       that body dismissd from his care     yet my fancy has pierced to his heart and pourtrays       more terrible images there      his bones are consumed and his lifeblood is dried       with wishes the past to undo     and his crime through the pains that oerwhelm him descried       still blackens and grows on his view      when from the dark synod or bloodreeking field       to his chamber the monarch is led     all soothers of sense their soft virtue shall yield       and quietness pillow his head      but if grief selfconsumed in oblivion would doze       and conscience her tortures appease     mid tumult and uproar this man must repose       in the comfortless vault of disease      when his fetters at night have so pressd on his limbs       that the weight can no longer be borne     if while a halfslumber his memory bedims       the wretch on his pallet should turn      while the jailmastiff howls at the dull clanking chain       from the roots of his hair there shall start     a thousand sharp punctures of coldsweating pain       and terror shall leap at his heart      but now he halfraises his deepsunken eye       and the motion unsettles a tear     the silence of sorrow it seems to supply       and asks of me why i am here      poor victim no idle intruder has stood       with oerweening complacence our state to compare     but one whose first wish is the wish to be good       is come as a brother thy sorrows to share      at thy name though compassion her nature resign       though in virtues proud mouth thy report be a stain     my care if the arm of the mighty were mine       would plant thee where yet thou mightst blossom again    lines written a few miles above tintern abbey on revisiting the banks of the wye during a tour july               five years have passed five summers with the length     of five long winters and again i hear     these waters rolling from their mountainsprings     with a sweet inland murmur once again     do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs     which on a wild secluded scene impress     thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect     the landscape with the quiet of the sky     the day is come when i again repose     here under this dark sycamore and view     these plots of cottageground these orchardtufts     which at this season with their unripe fruits     among the woods and copses lose themselves     nor with their green and simple hue disturb     the wild green landscape once again i see     these hedgerows hardly hedgerows little lines     of sportive wood run wild these pastoral farms     green to the very door and wreathes of smoke     sent up in silence from among the trees     with some uncertain notice as might seem     of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods     or of some hermits cave where by his fire     the hermit sits alone                             though absent long     these forms of beauty have not been to me     as is a landscape to a blind mans eye     but oft in lonely rooms and mid the din     of towns and cities i have owed to them     in hours of weariness sensations sweet     felt in the blood and felt along the heart     and passing even into my purer mind     with tranquil restorationfeelings too     of unremembered pleasure such perhaps     as may have had no trivial influence     on that best portion of a good mans life     his little nameless unremembered acts     of kindness and of love nor less i trust     to them i may have owed another gift     of aspect more sublime that blessed mood     in which the burthen of the mystery     in which the heavy and the weary weight     of all this unintelligible world     is lightendthat serene and blessed mood     in which the affections gently lead us on     until the breath of this corporeal frame     and even the motion of our human blood     almost suspended we are laid asleep     in body and become a living soul     while with an eye made quiet by the power     of harmony and the deep power of joy     we see into the life of things                                      if this     be but a vain belief yet oh how oft     in darkness and amid the many shapes     of joyless daylight when the fretful stir     unprofitable and the fever of the world     have hung upon the beatings of my heart     how oft in spirit have i turned to thee     o sylvan wye thou wanderer through the woods     how often has my spirit turned to thee      and now with gleams of halfextinguishd thought     with many recognitions dim and faint     and somewhat of a sad perplexity     the picture of the mind revives again     while here i stand not only with the sense     of present pleasure but with pleasing thoughts     that in this moment there is life and food     for future years and so i dare to hope     though changed no doubt from what i was when first     i came among these hills when like a roe     i bounded oer the mountains by the sides     of the deep rivers and the lonely streams     wherever nature led more like a man     flying from something that he dreads than one     who sought the thing he loved for nature then     the coarser pleasures of my boyish days     and their glad animal movements all gone by     to me was all in alli cannot paint     what then i was the sounding cataract     haunted me like a passion the tall rock     the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood     their colours and their forms were then to me     an appetite a feeling and a love     that had no need of a remoter charm     by thought supplied or any interest     unborrowed from the eyethat time is past     and all its aching joys are now no more     and all its dizzy raptures not for this     faint i nor mourn nor murmur other gifts     have followed for such loss i would believe     abundant recompence for i have learned     to look on nature not as in the hour     of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes     the still sad music of humanity     not harsh nor grating though of ample power     to chasten and subdue and i have felt     a presence that disturbs me with the joy     of elevated thoughts a sense sublime     of something far more deeply interfused     whose dwelling is the light of setting suns     and the round ocean and the living air     and the blue sky and in the mind of man     a motion and a spirit that impels     all thinking things all objects of all thought     and rolls through all things therefore am i still     a lover of the meadows and the woods     and mountains and of all that we behold     from this green earth of all the mighty world     of eye and ear both what they halfcreate      and what perceive well pleased to recognize     in nature and the language of the sense     the anchor of my purest thoughts the nurse     the guide the guardian of my heart and soul     of all my moral being                             nor perchance     if i were not thus taught should i the more     suffer my genial spirits to decay     for thou art with me here upon the banks     of this fair river thou my dearest friend     my dear dear friend and in thy voice i catch     the language of my former heart and read     my former pleasures in the shooting lights     of thy wild eyes oh yet a little while     may i behold in thee what i was once     my dear dear sister and this prayer i make     knowing that nature never did betray     the heart that loved her tis her privilege     through all the years of this our life to lead     from joy to joy for she can so inform     the mind that is within us so impress     with quietness and beauty and so feed     with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues     rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men     nor greetings where no kindness is nor all     the dreary intercourse of daily life     shall eer prevail against us or disturb     our chearful faith that all which we behold     is full of blessings therefore let the moon     shine on thee in thy solitary walk     and let the misty mountain winds be free     to blow against thee and in after years     when these wild ecstasies shall be matured     into a sober pleasure when thy mind     shall be a mansion for all lovely forms     thy memory be as a dwellingplace     for all sweet sounds and harmonies oh then     if solitude or fear or pain or grief     should be thy portion with what healing thoughts     of tender joy wilt thou remember me     and these my exhortations nor perchance     if i should be where i no more can hear     thy voice nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams     of past existence wilt thou then forget     that on the banks of this delightful stream     we stood together and that i so long     a worshipper of nature hither came     unwearied in that service rather say     with warmer love oh with far deeper zeal     of holier love nor wilt thou then forget     that after many wanderings many years     of absence these steep woods and lofty cliffs     and this green pastoral landscape were to me     more dear both for themselves and for thy sake         the river is not affected by the tides a few miles above     tintern        this line has a close resemblance to an admirable line of     young the exact expression of which i cannot recollect    end
