the road to ruin a comedy  as acted at the london and dublin theaters  dublin printed for j bra crowstreet       prologue spoken by mr fawcet enter driving a boy across the stage away sblood run for the author we can do nothing till he appears tell him in less than five minutes we shall have the house about our ears to the audience oh sirs the prompter has mislaid the prologue and we are all a mort i suppose our friends above yonder will soon be making pretty sport for pitys sake suffer us to go on without it  good dear sirs do twas most abominably dull  zounds there stands the writer well it is very true one of our te tum ti heroes was to have spoken it who measure nonsense out by the yard and our chief hope was you would make too much noise for it to be heard the author had mounted on the stilts of oratory and elocution not but he had a smart touch or two about poland france and the  the revolution telling us that frenchman and polishman and every man is our brother and that all men ay even poor negro men have a right to be free one as well as another freedom at length said he like a torrent is spreading and swelling to sweep away pride and reach the most miserable dwelling to ease happiness art science wit and genius to give birth ay to fertilize a world and renovate old earth thus he went on not mentioning a word about the play for he says prologues are blots which ought to be wiped away a gothic practice and in spite of precedent not the better for being old for if we tell any part of the plot it then becomes a tale twice told and such twice telling can rarely once excite our wonder ergo he that says nothing is least likely to blunder since therefore prologues are bad things at best pray my good friends never mind the want of one but live in hopes the play will make amends  exit dramatis personae mr dornton mr munden harry dornton mr holman mr sulky mr wilson mr silky mr quick goldfinch mr lewis mr milford mr harley mr smith mr powell hosier mr mac
