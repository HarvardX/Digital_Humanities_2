the compendious measurer being a brief yet comprehensive treatise on mensuration and practical geometry  with an introduction to decimal and duodecimal arithmetic  adapted to the use of schools and practice  by charles hutton lld and frs etc  london printed for g c j and j robinson and r baldwin in paternosterrow and g and j wilkie st pauls churchyard  mdcclxxxvi  preface some years since i published a complete treatise on mensuration both in theory and practice in which the elements of that science are demonstrated and the rules applied to the various practical purposes of life that work has been well received by the public and honored with the high approbation of the more learned mathematicians  it has however been often represented to me by tutors and others that the great size and price of that work as well as the very scientific manner in which it is formed prevent it from being so generally useful in schools and to practical measurers as a more compendious and familiar little book might be which they could put into the hands of their pupils as a work containing all the practical rules of that art in a form proper for them to copy from and unmixed with such geometrical and algebraical demonstrations as occur in the large work  in compliance therefore with such representations i have drawn up this compendium of mensuration practical geometry and arithmetic expressly with the view of accommodating it to practical matters and to the use of schools i have therefore here brought together all the most useful rules and precepts have arranged them in an orderly manner proper for the pupil to copy and delivered them in plain and familiar language an example worked out at full length is set down to each rule together with drawings or representations of the geometrical figures proper to illustrate each problem and then are subjoined some more questions to each rule as examples proposed for the practice of the learner with the answer set down by which he may know when his work is right  the introduction to decimal and duodecimal arithmetic will be found useful by going over those branches before entering on the mensuration that the learner may be very ready and expert in numeral calculations  the practical geometry contains a great number of geometrical constructions and operations by the practice of which the learner will acquire the free and easy use of his instruments and so become prepared for making the drawings that are useful for illustrating the various branches of mensuration following  the mensuration itself next succeeds and is divided into various parts first mensuration in general and then as applied to the several practical uses in life the whole being arranged in such order as the learner may properly take in succession or distinguished into several branches of which he may select and study any peculiar ones that may be more to his purpose than the rest when he either has not leisure or inducement to go over the whole in a regular gradation and notwithstanding the compendious size of the book and the great number of practical branches here treated it will be found that each one is much more full and complete than the first appearance of so small a form may promise to admit of however if farther satisfaction be desired by any one either concerning the science in general or the demonstrations of the rules or the more curious and copious display of properties he may apply to my large treatise before mentioned where he will find every part delivered in the most ample form

their denominators the numerators being so distinguished as to show what the denominators are which is done by separating by a point so many of the right hand figures from the rest as there are ciphers in the denominator the figures on the left side of the point being integers and those on the right decimals  thus 0  is understood to be   0 or and 0   is understood to be    00 or and 0   is understood to be    00 or and    is understood to be    0 or     0 and     is understood to be      0 but when there is not a sufficient number of figures in the numerator ciphers are prefixed to supply the defect  so0  is   00 or   0 and00   is    0000 or   000 so that the denominator of a decimal is a   with as many ciphers as there are figures in the decimal  a finite decimal is that which ends at a certain number of places but an infinite decimal that which no where ends but is understood to be indefinitely continued  a repeating decimal has one figure or several figures continually repeated as  0     etc which is a single or simple repetend and  0     etc or  0       etc which are compound repetends and are otherwise called circulates or circulating decimals a point is set over a single repetend and a point over the first and last figures of a circulating decimal  the first place next after the decimal mark is  0th parts the second is  00th parts the third is  000th parts and so on decreasing toward the right by  0ths or increasing toward the left by  0ths the same as whole or integer numbers do as in the following scale of notation  etc millions hundreds of thousands tens of thousands thousands hundreds tens units tenth parts hundredth parts thousand parts ten thousand parts hundred thousand parts millionth parts etc ciphers on the right of decimals do not alter their value for  or   0 that is and 0 or  0 00 that is and 00 or  00 000 that is etc are all of equal value  but ciphers before decimal figures and after the separating point diminish the value in a tenfold proportion for every cipher so  is   0 or but0  is   00 or   0 and00  is   000 or   00 and so on  so that in any mixed or fractional number if the separating point be moved one two three etc places to the right hand every figure will be  0  00  000 etc times greater than before   but if the point be moved toward the left hand then every figure will be diminished in the same manner or the whole quantity will be divided by  0  00  000 etc  addition of decimals set the numbers under each other according to the value of their places as in whole numbers or so that the decimal points stand directly below each other then add as in whole numbers placing the decimal point in the sum straight below the other points  examples              0    0           0          0     0                           0                         0 0                     0       00      ex   what is the sum of0                    and00    ex   what is the sum of               0       0      and       ex   required the sum of                 00            and    0   subtraction of decimals set the less number under the greater in the same manner as in addition then subtract as in whole numbers and place the decimal point in the remainder straight below the other points  examples       from               take             0    rem 0   0      0  0     ex   what is the difference between       and  0   ex   what is the difference between      and     ex   what is the difference between      and  00     multiplication of decimals set down the factors under each other and multiply them as in whole numbers and from the product toward the right hand point off as many figures for decimals as there are decimal places in both factors together  but if there be not as many figures in the product as there ought to be decimals prefix the proper number of ciphers to supply the defect  examples         0               0                     0             0                             00       ex   what is the product of     and     ex   what is the product of     and0    ex   what is the product of0   and00    note when decimals are to be multiplied by  0 or  00 or  000 etc that is by   with any number of ciphers it is done by only moving the decimal point as many places farther to the right hand as there are ciphers in the said multiplier subjoining ciphers if there be not so many figures  examples   the product of     and  0 is   the product of      and  00 is   the product of     and  000 is   the product of      and  0000 is contraction when the product would contain several more decimals than are necessary for the purpose in hand the work may be much contracted thus retaining only the proper number of decimals  set the units figure of the multiplier straight under such decimal place of the multiplicand as you intend the last of your product shall be writing the other figures of the multiplier in an inverted order then in multiplying reject all the figures in the multiplicand which are on the right of the figure you are multiplying by setting the products down so that their right hand figures fall straight below each other and carrying to such right hand figures from the product of the two preceding figures in the multiplicand thus viz   from   to      from    to      from    to    etc inclusively and the sum of the lines will be the product to the number of decimals required and will commonly be to the nearest unit in the last figure  examples    multiply         by     0   so as to retain only four places of decimals in the product  contracted common way                   0         0                    0                  0                    0                                  0    0   0    0   0  0    multiply   0      by        retaining four decimals in the product    multiply    0 0   by       retaining five decimals in the product    multiply     0     by        retaining three decimals in the product  division of decimals divide as in whole numbers and to know how many decimals to point off in the quotient observe the following rules    there must be as many decimals in the dividend as in both the divisor and quotient together therefore point off for decimals in the quotient as many figures as the decimal places in the dividend exceed those in the divisor    if the figures in the quotient are not so many as the rule requires supply the defect by prefixing ciphers    if the decimal places in the divisor be more than those in the dividend add ciphers as decimals to the dividend till the number of decimals in the dividend be equal to those in the divisor and the quotient will be integers till all these decimals are used and in case of a remainder after all the figures of the dividend are used and more figures are wanted in the quotient annex ciphers to the remainder to continue the division as far as necessary    the first figure of the quotient will possess the same place of integers or decimals as that figure of the dividend which stands over the units place of the first product  examples   divide      0   by       divide         by             0                   000     000       0      0  0    00             000    divide00      by      divide     by     divide     by       divide  0  by    contractions   if the divisor be an integer with any number of ciphers at the end cut them off and remove the decimal point in the dividend so many places farther to the left as there were ciphers cut off prefixing ciphers if need be then proceed as before  examples   divide     by   000   divide   0 0 by   000   000      000   0 0           0   0     etc         here i first divide by   and then by   because   times   is    here i first divide by   and then by   because   times   is      divide     by    0   divide    by   000    whence if the divisor be   with ciphers the quotient will be the same figures with the dividend having the decimal point so many places farther to the left as there are ciphers in the divisor  examples        00         by  0      by  000    by  000     when the number of figures in the divisor is great the division at large will be very troublesome but may be contracted thus  having by the  th general rule found what place of decimals or integers the first figure of the quotient will possess consider how many figures of the quotient will serve the present purpose then take the same number of the left hand figures of the divisor and as many of the dividend figures as will contain them less than  0 times by these find the first figure of the quotient and for each following figure divide the last remainder by the divisor wanting one figure to the right more than before but observing what must be carried to the first product for such omitted figures as in the second contraction of multiplication and continue the operation till the divisor is exhausted  when there are not so many figures in the divisor as are required to be in the quotient begin the division with all the figures as usual and continue it till the number of figures in the divisor and those remaining to be found in the quotient be equal after which use the contraction  examples    divide   0    0  by     0   so as to have four decimals in the quotient  in this case the quotient will contain six figures hence     0     0    0            0           0       0      divide   0      by   0 0  so that the quotient may contain four decimals    divide    0    by        that the quotient may contain five decimals    divide    0  by       that the quotient may contain three decimals  reduction of decimals   to reduce a vulgar fraction to a decimal divide the numerator with as many decimal ciphers annexed as may be necessary by the denominator and the quotient will be the decimal sought  examples   reduce     to a decimal   reduce     to a decimal    000000    0    0         0 0 00 0 0  etc      00  00     etc    here divide by   and    here divide by     and   because   times    is    because   x   x     and the decimal value of     and the decimal value of is the circulate0      is the repetend0    other examples                                      0                     so that whenever we meet with the repetend  in any operation we may substitute for it in like manner we may take for  and for   and    for  and    or   for  etc  note when a great many figures are required in the decimal and the denominator of the given fraction is a prime number greater than    the operation will be best performed as follows  suppose for instance i would find the reciprocal of the prime number    or the value of the fraction     in decimal numbers i divide  000 by    in the common way so far as to find two or three of the first figures or till the remainder becomes a single figure and then i assume the supplement to complete the quotient thus i shall have    00         for the complete quotient which equation if i multiply by the numerator   it will give    0           or rather    0          i substitute this instead of the fraction in the first equation and i shall have    00              again i multiply this equation by   and it will give    0 0             and then by substitution    00          0             again i multiply this equation by   and it becomes    0        0          0  0   and then by substitution    00          0                0           0  0   where every operation will at least double the number of figures found by the preceding operation and this will be an easy expedient for converting division into multiplication in all cases for this reciprocal of the divisor being thus found it may be multiplied by the dividend to produce the quotient  ii to reduce a decimal to a vulgar fraction  under the figures of the given decimal write its proper denominator which fraction abbreviated as much as it can be will be the vulgar fraction sought  examples so   0 and     00 and     00 and   0   and       000 and         0000  0 iii to find the value of a decimal in the lower denominations  multiply the given decimal by the number of parts in the next lower denomination from the product cut off as many decimals as are in the given number  multiply these by the parts in the next lower denomination again cutting off the same number of decimals as before  and proceed in the same manner to the lowest denomination then the several integer parts cut off on the left hand will give the value of the decimal proposed  examples   for the value of     l   for the value of     lb avoir          0    s

a compound repetend or a circulate also that a point is set over a single repetend and a point over the first and last figures of a circulate  it may farther be observed that when other decimal figures precede a repetend in any number it is called a mixed number or quantity as   or 0     otherwise it is a pure repetend as  and     similar repetends begin at the same place and consist of the same number of figures as  and   or      and       dissimilar repetends begin at different places and consist of an unequal number of figures  similar and conterminous repetends begin and end at the same place as    0  and0     reduction of repeating decimals case i to reduce a single repetend to a vulgar fraction  make the given decimal the numerator and for a denominator take as many nines as there are recurring places in the given repetend  if one or more of the left hand places in the given decimal be ciphers annex as many ciphers to the right hand of the nines in the denominator

many nines as there are figures in the repetend annex as many ciphers as there are finite places for the denominator of the vulgar fraction  multiply the nines in the denominator by the finite part of the decimal and to the product add the repeating part for the numerator  or find the vulgar fraction as before answering to the repetend then join it to the finite part and reduce them to a common denominator  examples   so    and    and    and  addition of repetends make every line to begin and end at the same place by extending the repetends and filling up the vacancies with the proper figures and ciphers then add as in common numbers only increase the sum of the right hand row or last row of the repetends by as many units as the first row of repetends contains nines and the sum will circulate at the same places as the other lines  examples                 0           0   0    0                                                           sum        0 sum

and make all the lines begin and end together when they are to be added    in multiplying a finite decimal by a single repetend multiply by the repetend and divide by  or   0    in more complex cases reduce the repetends to vulgar fractions then divide these and reduce the quotient to a decimal if necessary  examples                 0   0            0  0      0     0              0    0

    division of repetends   if the dividend only be a repetend divide as in common numbers bringing down always the recurring figures till the quotient become as exact as requisite    and if the divisor only be a repetend it will be best to change it into its equivalent vulgar fraction then multiply by its numerator and divide by its denominator    but if both divisor and dividend be repetends change them both to vulgar fractions  examples                        0      0                 0                                                   divide          by   0   here   0

by itself a certain number of times  any number is called the first power of itself if it be multiplied by itself the product is called the second power and sometimes the square if this be multiplied by the first power again the product is called the third power and sometimes the cube and if this be multiplied by the first power again the product is called the fourth power etc that is the power is denominated from the number which exceeds the number of multiplications by    thus   is the first power of      x    is the second power of      x   x     is the third power of      x   x   x     is the fourth power of    etc etc  and in this manner may be calculated the following table  table of the first twelve powers of numbers  st power                    d power                          d

                       0                   0        the number which exceeds the multiplications by   is called the index or exponent of the power so the index of the first power is   that of the second power is   that of the third is   and so on  powers are commonly denoted by writing their indices above the first power so the second power of   may be denoted thus    the third power thus    the fourth power thus    etc and the  th power of  0  thus  0    involution is the finding of powers to do which from their definition there evidently comes this  rule multiply the given number or first power continually by itself till the number of multiplications be   less than the index of the power to be found and the last product will be the power required  note   because fractions are multiplied by taking the products of their numerators and of their denominators they will be involved by raising each of their terms to the power required and if a mixed number be proposed either reduce it to an improper fraction or reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal and proceed by the rule    the raising of powers will be sometimes shortened by working according to this observation viz whatever two or more powers are multiplied together their product is the power whose index is the sum of the indices of the factors or if a power be multiplied by itself the product will be the power whose index is double of that which is multiplied so if i would find the sixth power i might multiply the given number twice by itself for the third power then the third power into itself would give the sixth power or if i would find the seventh power i might first find the third and fourth and their product would be the seventh or lastly if i would find the eighth power i might first find the second then the second into itself would be the fourth and this into itself would be the eighth      ex   the square of is x     ex   the cube of    is    x    x           ex   the square of   or     is     x                      evolution or extraction of roots the root of any given number or power is such a number as being multiplied by itself a certain number of times will produce the power and it is denominated the first second third fourth etc root respectively as the number of multiplications made of it to produce the given power is 0       etc that is the name of the root is taken from the number which exceeds the multiplications by   like the name of the power in involution  the index of the root like that of the power in involution is   more than the number of the multiplications necessary to produce the power or given number so   is the index of the second or square root and   the index of the  d or cubic root and   the index of the  th root and so on  roots are sometimes denoted by writing before the power with the index of the root against it so the third root of  0 is   0 and the second root of it is  0 the index   being omitted which index is always understood when a root is named or written without one but if the power be expressed by several numbers with the sign  or  etc between them then a line is drawn from the top of the sign of the root or radical sign over all the parts of it so the third root of      is  and sometimes roots are designed like powers with the reciprocal or the index of the root above the given number so the root of   is   the root of  0 is  0 and the third root of it is  0 also the third root of        is  and this method of notation has justly prevailed in the modern algebra because such roots being considered as fractional powers need no other directions for any operations to be made with them than those for integral powers  a number is called a complete power of any kind when its root of the same kind can be accurately extracted but if not the number is called an imperfect power and its root a surd or irrational quantity so   is a complete power of the second kind its root being   but an imperfect power of the third kind its third root being a surd quantity which cannot be accurately extracted  evolution is the finding of the roots of numbers either accurately or in decimals to any proposed degree of accuracy  the power is first to be prepared for extraction or evolution by dividing it by means of points or commas from the place of units to the left hand in integers and to the right in decimal fractions into periods containing each as many places of figures as are denoted by the index of the root if the power contain a complete number of such periods that is each period to have two figures for the square root three for the cube root four for the fourth root and so on and when the last period in decimals is not complete ciphers are added to complete it  note the root will contain just as many places of figures as there are periods or points in the given power and they will be integers or decimals respectively as the periods are so from which they are found or to which they correspond that is there will be as many integer or decimal figures in the root as there are periods of integers or decimals in the given number  to extract the square root   having divided the given number into periods of two figures each find from the table of powers in page    or otherwise a square number either equal to or the next less than the first period which subtract from it and place the root of the square on the right of the given number after the manner of a quotient in division for the first figure of the root required    to the remainder annex the second period for a dividend and on the left thereof write the double of the root already found after the manner of a divisor    find how often the divisor is contained in the dividend wanting its last figure on the right hand place that number for the next figure in the quotient and on the right of the divisor as also below the same    multiply the whole increased divisor by it placing the product below the dividend which subtract from it and to the remainder bring down the next period for a new dividend to which as before find a divisor by doubling the figures already found in the root and from these find the next figure of the root as in the last article and continue the operation still in the same manner till all the periods be used or as far as you please  note instead of doubling the root to find the new divisors you may add the last divisor to the figure below it  to prove the work multiply the root by itself and to the product add the remainder and the sum will be the given number  ex   to extract the root of    0    having divided the given number into three periods namely    and  0 and    i find that    is the next square to    the first period which set below and subtracting   remains to which bring down  0 the next period makes   0 for a dividend then   the root of     is set on the right of the given number for the first figure of the root and its double or   on the left of the dividend for the first figure of the divisor which being once contained in    the dividend wanting its last figure gives   for the next figure of the root which   is accordingly set in the root making    and in the divisor making    as also below the same these multiplied make also    set below the dividend and subtracting we have    remaining to which the last period    being brought down we have      for the new dividend then for a new divisor either double the root    or else which is easier to the last divisor add the figure   standing below it and either way gives    for the first part of the new divisor this    is   times contained in     and therefore   is the next figure to set in the root and in the divisor as also below the same which being then multiplied by it gives      the same as the dividend therefore nothing remains and     is the root of    0   as required  ex   for the root of  0     ex   for the root of000      note when all the periods of the given number are brought down and used and more figures are required to be found the operation may be continued by adding as many periods of ciphers as we please namely bringing always two ciphers at once to each dividend and when the root is to be extracted to a great number of places the work may be much abbreviated thus having proceeded in the extraction after the common method till you have found one more than half the required number of figures in the root the rest may be found by dividing the last remainder by its corresponding divisor annexing a cipher to every dividual as in division of decimals or rather without annexing ciphers by omitting continually the right hand figure of the divisor after the manner of the third contraction in division of decimals in page  0  so the operation for the root of   to    or    places may be thus  example      here having found the first seven figures         by the common extraction by adding always periods of ciphers the last six figures        are found by the method of contracted division in decimals without adding ciphers to the remainder only pointing off a figure at each time from the last divisor and the same for the two following examples  ex   for the root of      ex   for the root of      in like manner may be found the following roots  the root of   is       0 the root of   is         the root of  0 is         the root of    is         rules for the square roots of vulgar fractions and mixed numbers  first prepare all vulgar fractions by reducing them to their least terms both for this and all other roots then    take the root of the numerator and of the denominator for the respective terms of the root required and this is the best way if the denominator be a complete power but if it be not    multiply the numerator and denominator together take the root of the product this root being made the numerator to the denominator of the given fraction or made the denominator to the numerator of it will form the fractional root required  that is and this rule will serve whether the root be finite or infinite or    reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal and extract its root    mixed numbers may be either reduced to improper fractions and extracted by the first or second rule or the vulgar fraction may be reduced to a decimal then joined to the integer and the root of the whole extracted  ex   is  ex   or is     ex   for the root of       ex   for the root of       to find a mean proportional there are various uses of the square root one of which is to find a mean proportional between any two numbers which is performed thus multiply the two given numbers together then extract the square root out of their product and it will be the mean proportional sought  ex   to find a mean proportional between   and     here   x       and    is   the mean proportional sought  for        ex   to find a mean between   and    here   x   0         the mean reqd    note by means of the square root also we readily find the  th root or the  th root or the   th root etc that is the root of any power whose index is some power of the number   namely by extracting so often the square root as is denoted by the index of that power of   that is two extractions for the  th root three for the  th root and so on  thus for the  th root of         so that the  th root of      is           which expresses the circumference of a circle whose diameter is   nearly  other examples the  th root of   0    is   0    0  the  th root of    is         to extract the cube root rule i    point the given number into periods of three places each beginning at units and there will be as many integral places in the root as there are points over the integers in the given number    seek the greatest cube in the left hand period write the root in the quotient and the cube under the period from which subtract it and to the remainder bring down the next period call this the resolvend under which draw a line    under the resolvend write the triple square of the root so that units in the latter stand under the place of hundreds in the former under the triple square of the root write the triple root removed one place to the right and the sum of these two lines call a divisor under which draw a line    seek how often this divisor may be had in the resolvend its right hand place excepted and write the result in the quotient    under the divisor write the product of the triple square of the root by the last quotient figure setting units place of this line under that of tens in the divisor under this line write the product of the triple root by the square of the last quotient figure let this line be removed one place beyond the right of the former and under this line removed one place forward to the right write the cube of the last quotient figure the sum of these three lines call the subtrahend under which draw a line    subtract the subtrahend from the resolvend to the remainder bring down the next period for a new resolvend the divisor to this must be the triple square of all the quotient added to the triple thereof etc as in the third article etc  example i  what is the cube root of             if the work of this example be well considered and compared with the foregoing rule it will be easy to conceive how any other example of the like nature may be wrought and here observe that when the cube root is extracted to more than two places there is a necessity of doing some work upon a spare piece of paper in order to come at the roots triple square and the product of the triple root by the square of the quotient figure etc  in this example the given number is a cube number and therefore at the end of the operation there remained nothing for     multiplied by     the product multiplied by     gives          the given number  but if the number given be not a cube number then to the last remainder always bring down three ciphers and work anew for a decimal fraction if needful  more examples  what is the cube root of    0   answers     0       0    0  0  00   00                0                      these examples are all performed in the same manner as the foregoing one  to find two mean proportionals there are many uses of the cube root one is to find two mean proportionals between two given numbers which is performed thus  divide the greater extreme by the less and the cube root of the quotient multiplied by the less extreme gives the less mean multiply the said cube root by the less mean and the product is the greater mean proportional  note this is only understood of those numbers that are in continued geometric proportion  example i  what are the two mean proportionals between   and  0    0  divided by   gives    whose cube root is   and the less extreme   multiplied thereby gives    for the less mean and    multiplied by the said root   gives    for the greater mean  for   is to    as    to  0   example ii  find the two geometric means between   and       now            whose cube root is   and   times   is    the less mean and   times    is     the greater mean  for   is to    as     to       if the rule already given for the cube root be thought too tedious the following one will be found much more ready for use  rule ii to extract the cube root    by trials take the nearest rational cube to the given cube or number and call it the assumed cube    then the sum of the given number and double the assumed cube will be to the sum of the assumed cube and double the given number as the root of the assumed cube is to the root required nearly or as the first sum is to the difference of the given and assumed cube so is the assumed root to the difference of the roots nearly    again by using in like manner the cube of the root last found as a new assumed cube another root will be obtained still nearer and so on as far as we please using always the cube of the lastfound root for the assumed cube  example to find the cube root of   0     here we soon find that the root lies between  0 and  0 and then between    and    taking therefore    its cube is       the assumed cube then   again for a second operation the cube of this root is   0               and the process by the latter method will be thus   to extract any root whatever let g be the given power or number n the index of the power a the assumed power r its root r the required root of g  then as the sum of n  times a and n    times g is to the sum of n  times g and n    times a so is the assumed root r to the required root r  or as half the said sum of n  times a and n    times g is to the difference between the given and assumed powers so is the assumed root r to the difference between the true and assumed roots which difference added or subtracted gives the true root nearly  that is   or   and the operation may be repeated as often as we please by using always the last found root for the assumed root and its nth power for the assumed power a  example to extract the  th root of   0     here it appears that the  th root is between    and    taking    its  th power is  0  0      hence then we have   other examples    what is the  d root of   ans           what

0    ans  0         what is the  th root of   ans  0 00   general rules for extracting any root out of a vulgar fraction or mixed number   if the given fraction have a finite root of the kind required it is best to extract the root out of the numerator and denominator for the terms of the root required    but if the fraction be not a complete power it may be thrown into a decimal and then extracted or    take either of the terms of the given fraction for the corresponding term of the root and for the other term of the root extract the required root of the product arising from the multiplication of such a power of the first assigned term of the root whose index is less by   than that of the given power by the other term of the given number  this rule will do when the root is either finite or infinite  this is     mixed numbers may be reduced either to improper fractions or decimals and then extracted  examples   what is the cube root of     ans   what is the fourth root of  0 0  ans   what is the cube root of ans    00    what is the cube root of    0   ans    or     what is the third root of   ans    0    duodecimals or cross multiplication duodecimals are so called because they decrease by twelves from the place of seet toward the right hand inches are sometimes called primes and are marked thus the next division after inches are called parts or seconds and are marked thus the next are thirds and marked thus and so on  this rule is otherwise called cross multiplication because the factors are sometimes multiplied cross ways and it is commonly used by workmen and artificers in casting up the contents of their work though a much better way would be by a decimal scale  rule i   under the multiplicand write the same names or denominations of the multiplier that is feet under feet inches under inches parts under parts etc    multiply each term in the multiplicand beginning at the lowest by the feet in the multiplier and write each result under its respective term observing to carry an unit for every    from each lower denomination to its next superior    in the same manner multiply every term in the multiplicand by the inches in the multiplier and set the result of each term one place removed to the right of those in the multiplicand    proceed in like manner with the seconds and all the rest of the denominations if there be any more and the sum of all the lines will be the product required  or the denominations of the particular products will be as follows feet by feet give feet feet by primes give primes feet by seconds give seconds etc primes by primes give seconds primes by seconds give thirds primes by thirds give fourths etc seconds by seconds give fourths seconds by thirds give fifths seconds by fourths give sixths etc thirds by thirds give sixths thirds by fourths give sevenths thirds by fifths give eighths etc   in general thus  when feet are concerned the product is of the same denomination with the term multiplying the feet  when feet are not concerned the name of the product will be expressed by the sum of the indices of the two factors  ex   multiply   rule ii when the feet in the multiplicand are expressed by a large number  multiply first by the feet of the multiplier as before then instead of multiplying by the inches and parts etc proceed as in the rule of practice by taking such aliquot parts of the multiplicand as correspond with the inches and seconds etc of the multiplier then the sum of them all will be the product required  ex   multiply   rule iii if the feet in both the multiplicand and multiplier be large numbers  multiply the feet only into each other then for the inches and seconds in the multiplier take parts of the multiplicand and for the inches and seconds of the multiplicand take aliquot parts of the feet only in the multiplier and the sum of all will be the product  ex   multiply   other examples    mensuration mensuration is the measuring and estimating the magnitude

into    equal parts only   parts are here drawn for want of room  complete these into rectangles of a convenient height by drawing parallel and perpendicular lines divide the altitude into  0 equal parts if it be for a decimal scale for common numbers or into    equal parts if it be for feet and inches and through these points of division draw as many parallel lines the whole length of the scale  then divide the length of the first division ac into  0 equal parts both above and below and connect these points of division by diagonal lines and the scale is finished after being numbered as you please  note these diagonal scales serve to take off dimensions or numbers of three figures if the first large divisions be units the second set of divisions along ac will be  0th parts and the divisions in the altitude along ad will be  00th parts if cd be tens ac will be units and ad will be  0th parts if cb be hundreds ac will be tens and ad units if cb be thousands ac will be hundreds and ad will be tens and so on each set of divisions being tenth parts of the former ones  for example suppose it were required to take off     from the scale fix one foot of the compasses at   of the greatest divisions at the bottom of the scale and extend the other to   of the second divisions along the bottom then for the   slide up both points of the compasses by a parallel motion till they fall upon the third longitudinal line and in that position extend the second point of the compasses to the fourth diagonal line and you have the extent of three figures as required  or if you have any line to measure the length of  take it between the compasses and applying it to scale suppose it fall between   and   of the large divisions or more nearly that it is   of the large divisions or   hundreds and between   and   of the second divisions or   tens or  0 and a little more slide up the points of the compasses by a parallel motion keeping one foot always on the vertical division of   hundred till the other point fall exactly on one of the diagonal lines which suppose to be   which is   units which shows that the length of the line proposed to be measured is      plane scales for two figures   the above are three other forms of scales the first of which is a decimal scale for taking off common numbers consisting of two figures the other two are duodecimal scales and serve for feet and inches etc  these and other scales engraven on ivory are fittest for practical use and the most convenient form of a plane scale of equal divisions is on the very edge of the ivory made thin

rule and it is much used in timber measuring and artificers works both for taking the dimensions and casting up the contents  the instrument consists of two equal pieces each a foot in length which are connected together by a folding joint  one side or face of the rule is divided into inches and halfquarters or eighths on the same face also are several plane scales divided into twelfth parts by diagonal lines which are used in planning dimensions that are taken in feet and inches the edge of the rule is commonly divided decimally or into tenths namely each foot into  0 equal parts and each of these into  0 parts again so that by means of this last scale dimensions are taken in feet and tenths and hundredths and multiplied as common decimal numbers which is the best way  on the one part of the other face are four lines marked a b c d the two middle ones b and c being on a slider which runs in a groove made in the stock the same numbers serve for both these two middle lines the one being above the numbers and the other below  these four lines are logarithmic ones and the three a b c which are all equal to one another are double lines as they proceed twice over from   to  0 the other or lowest line d is a single one proceeding from   to  0 it is also called the girt line from its use in casting up the contents of trees and timber and upon it are marked wg at      and ag at

prices from   pence to   shillings a foot  when   at the beginning of any line is accounted   then the   in the middle will be  0 and the  0 at the end  00 and when   at the beginning is accounted  0 then the   in the middle is  00 and the  0 at the end  000 and so on and all the smaller divisions are altered proportionally  problem i to multiply numbers together suppose the two numbers    and

to find the solid content of squared or foursided timber multiply the mean breadth by the mean thickness and the product again by the length and the last product will give the content  by the sliding rule  c d d c as length   or  0quarter girtsolidity  that is as the length in feet on c is to    on d when the quarter girt is in inches or to  0 on d when it is in tenths of feet so is the quarter girt on d to the content on c  note   if the tree taper regularly from the one end to the other either take the mean breadth and thickness in the middle or take the dimensions at the two ends and half their sum will be the mean dimensions    if the piece do not taper regularly but is unequally thick in some parts and small in others take several different dimensions add them all together and divide their sum by the number of them for the mean dimensions    the quarter girt is a geometrical mean proportional between the mean breadth and thickness that is the square root of their product sometimes unskilful measurers use the arithmetical mean instead of it that it half their sum but this is always attended with error and the more so as the breadth and depth differ the more from each other  examples    the length of a piece of timber is    feet   inches the breadths at the greater and less end   foot   inches and   foot   inches and the thickness at the greater and less end   foot

the square of the quarter girt or of of the mean circumference by the length for the content  by the sliding rule  as the length upon c   or  0 upon d quarter girt in   ths or  0ths on d content on c  note   when the tree is tapering take the mean dimensions as in the former problems either by girting it in the middle for the mean girt or at the two ends and take half the sum of the two but when the tree is very irregular divide it into several lengths and find the content of each part separately    this rule which is commonly used gives the answer about less than the true quantity in the tree or nearly what the quantity would be after the tree is hewed square in the usual way so that it seems intended to make an allowance for the squaring of the tree when the true quantity is desired use the  d rule given below  examples    a piece of round timber being   feet   inches long and its mean quarter girt    inches what is the content    by the sliding rule  c d d c as     0        or

curious problems relating to the cutting of timber so as to produce uncommon effects may be found in my large treatise on mensuration from which may be seen the absurd and mischievous consequences attending the constant use of the first or common rule for measuring round timber in all cases  artificers work artificers compute the contents of their works by several different measures  as glazing and masonry by the foot  painting plastering paving etc by the yard of   square feet  flooring partitioning roofing tiling etc by the square of  00 square feet  and brickwork either by the yard of   square feet or by the perch or square rod or pole containing     square feet or  0 square yards being the square of the rod or pole of    feet or   yards long  as this number     is a troublesome number to divide by the is often omitted in practice and the content in feet divided only by the     but as this is not exact it will be both better and easier to multiply the feet by   and then divide successively by      and    also to divide square yards by  0 first multiply them by   and then divide twice by     all works whether superficial or solid are computed by the rules proper to the figure of them whether it be a triangle or rectangle a parallelopiped or any other figure  bricklayers work brickwork is estimated at the rate of a brick and a half thick and if a wall be more or less than this standard thickness it must be reduced to it as follows  multiply the superficial content of the wall by the number of half bricks in the thickness and divide the product by    the dimensions of a building are usually taken by measuring half round on the outside and half round it on the inside the sum of these two gives the compass of the wall to be multiplied by the height for the content of the materials  chimneys are by some measured as if they were solid deducting only the vacuity from the hearth to the mantle on account of the trouble of them  and by others they are girt or measured round for their breadth and the height of the story is their height taking the depth of the jambs for their thickness and in this case no reduction is made for the vacuity from the floor to the mantle tree because of the gathering of the breast and wings to make room for the hearth in the next story  to measure the chimney shafts which appear above the building girt them about with a line for the breadth to multiply by their height and account their thickness half a brick more than it really is in consideration of the plastering and scaffolding  all windows doors etc are to be deducted out of the contents of the walls in which they are placed but this deduction is made only with regard to materials for the whole measure is taken for workmanship and that all outside measure too namely measuring quite round the outside of the building being in consideration of the trouble of the returns or angles they have also some other allowances such as double measure for feathered gable ends etc  examples    how many yards and rods of standard brickwork are in a wall whose length or compass is    feet   inches and height    feet   inches the walls being   bricks or   half bricks thick    by the sliding rule  b a b a as           0   ex   required the content of a wall    feet   inches long and    feet   inches high and   bricks thick  ans        yards  ex   a

stone work and the measure made use of is a foot either superficial or solid  walls columns blocks of stone or marble etc are measured by the cubic foot and pavements slabs chimneypieces etc by the superficial or square foot  cubic or solid measure is used for the materials and square measure for the workmanship  in the solid measure the true length breadth and thickness are taken and multiplied continually together in the superficial there must be taken the length and breadth of every part of the projection which is seen without the general upright face of the building  examples    required

the square foot or yard etc but enriched mouldings and some other articles are often estimated by running or lineal measure and some things are rated by the piece  in measuring of joists it is to be observed that only one of their dimensions is the same with that of the floor and the other will exceed the length of the room by the thickness of the wall and of the same because each end is let into the wall about of its thickness  no deductions are made for hearths on account of the additional trouble and waste of materials  partitions are measured from wall to wall for one dimension and from floor to floor as far as they extend for the other  no deduction is made for doorways on account of the trouble of framing them  in measuring of joiners work the string is made to ply close to every part of the work over which it passes  the measure of centering for cellars is found by making a string pass over the surface of the arch for the breadth and taking the length of the cellar for the length but in groincentering it is usual to allow double measure on account of their extraordinary trouble  in roofing the length of the house in the inside together with of the thickness of one gable is to be considered as the length and the breadth is equal to double the length of a string which is stretched from the ridge down the rafter and along the eavesboard till it meets with the top of the wall  for staircases take the breadth of all the steps by making a line ply close over them from the top to the bottom and multiply the length of this line by the length of a step for the whole area  by the length of a step is meant the length of the front and the returns at the two ends and by the breadth is to be understood the girt of its two upper surfaces or the tread and riser  for the balustrade take the whole length of the upper part of the handrail and girt over its end till it meet the top of the newel post for the length and twice the length of the baluster upon the landing with the girt of the handrail for the breadth  for wainscotting take the compass of the room for the length and the height from the floor to the cieling making the string ply close into all the mouldings for the breadth  out of this must be made deductions for windows doors and chimneys etc but workmanship is counted for the whole on account of the extraordinary trouble  for doors it is usual to allow for their thickness by adding it into both the dimensions of length and breadth and then multiply them together for the area  if the door be pannelled on both sides take double its measure for the workmanship but if one side only be pannelled take the area and its half for the workmanship  for the surrounding architrave gird it about the outermost part for its length and measure over it as far as it can be seen when the door is open for the breadth  windowshutters bases etc are measured in the same manner  in the measuring of roofing for workmanship alone all holes for chimney shafts and skylights are generally deducted  but in measuring for work and materials they commonly measure in all skylights luthernlights and holes for the chimney shafts on account of their

the product subtract the content of the vacuity found by the foregoing problems and the remainder will be the content of the solid materials    in groin arches however it is usual to take the whole as solid without deducting the vacuity on account of the trouble and waste of materials attending the cutting and fitting them to the arch  land surveying chapter   description and use of the instruments   of the chain land is measured with a chain called gunters chain of   poles or    yards in length which consists of  00 equal links each link being    00 of a yard or    00 of a foot or     inches long that is nearly   inches or of a foot  an acre of land is equal to  0 square chains that is  0 chains in length and   chain in breadth or it is   0 x    or    0 square yards or it is  0 x   or   0 square poles or it is  000 x  00 or  00000 square links these being all the same quantity  also an acre is divided into   parts called roods and a rood into  0 parts called perches which are square poles or the square of a pole of   yards long or the square of of a chain or of    links which is     square links so that the divisions of land measure will be thus      sq links  pole or perch  0 perches  rood   roods  acre   the length of lines measured with a chain are set down in links as integers every chain in length being  00 links and not in chains and decimals therefore after the content is found it will be in square links then cut off five of the figures on the right hand for decimals and the rest will be acres those decimals are then multiplied by   for roods and the decimals of these again by  0 for perches  examples  suppose the length of a rectangular piece of ground be     links and its breadth     to find the area in acres roods and perches      of the plain table this instrument consists of a plain rectangular board of any convenient size the center of which when used is fixed by means of screws to a threelegged stand having a ball and socket or joint at the top by means of which when the logs are fixed on the ground the table is inclined in any direction  to the table belongs    a frame of wood made to fit round its edges and to be taken off for the convenience of putting a sheet of paper upon the table the one side of this frame is usually divided into equal parts for drawing lines across the table parallel or perpendicular to the sides and the other side of the frame is divided into   0 degrees from a center which is in the middle of the table by means of which the table is to be used as a theodolite etc    a needle and compass screwed into the side of the table to point out the directions and to be a check upon the sights    an index which is a brass twofoot scale with either a small telescope or open sights erected perpendicularly upon the ends these sights and one edge of the index are in the same plane and that edge is called the fiducial edge of the index  before you use this instrument take a sheet of paper which will cover it and wet it to make it expand then spread it flat upon the table pressing down the frame upon the edges to stretch it and keep it fixed there and when the paper is become dry it will by contracting again stretch itself smooth and flat from any cramps or unevenness upon this paper is to be drawn the plan or form of the thing measured  in using this instrument begin at any part of the ground you think the most proper and make a point upon a convenient part of the paper or table to represent that point of the ground then six in that point one leg of the compasses or a fine steel pin and apply to it the fiducial edge of the index moving it round till through the sights you perceive some remarkable object as the corner of a field etc and from the station point draw a line with the point of the compasses along the iducial edge of the index then set another object or corner and draw its line do the same by another and so on till as many objects are set as may be thought necessary then measure from your station toward as many of the objects as may be necessary and no more taking the requisite offsets to corners or crooks in the hedges etc and lay the measures down upon their respective lines upon the table then at any convenient place measured to fix the table in the same position and set the objects which appear from thence etc as before and thus continue till your work is finished measuring such lines as are necessary and determining as many as you can by intersecting lines of direction drawn from different stations  and in these operations observe the following particular cautions and directions    let the lines upon which you make starions be directed toward objects as far distant as possible and when you have set any such object go round the table and look through the sights from the other end of the index to see if any other remarkable object lie directly opposite if there be not such an one endeavor to find another forward object such as shall have a remarkable backward opposite one and make use of it rather than the other because the back object will be of use in fixing the table in the original position either when you have measured too near to the forward object or when it may be hid from your sight at any necessary station by intervening hedges etc    let the said lines upon which the stations are taken be pursued as far as you conveniently can for that will be the means of preserving more accuracy in the work    at each station it will be necessary to prove the truth of it that is whether the table be straight in the line toward the object and also whether the distance be rightly measured and laid down on the paper  to know if the table be set down straight in the line lay the index upon the table in any manner and more the table about till through the sights you perceive either the fore or back object then without moving the table go round it and look through the sights by the other end of the index to see if the other object can be perceived if it be the table is in the line if not it must be shifted to one side according to your judgment till through the sights both objects can be seen  the aforesaid operation only informs you if the station be straight in the line but to know if it be in the right part of the line that is if the distance has been rightly laid down fix the table in the original position by laying the index along the station line and turning the table about till the fore and back objects appear through the sights and then also will the needle point at the same degree as at first then lay the index over the station point and any other point on the paper representing an object which can be seen from the station and if the said object appear straight through the sights the station may be depended on as right if not the distance should be examined and corrected till the object can be so seen and for this very useful purpose it is advisable to have some high object or two which can be seen from the greatest part of the ground accurately laid down on the paper from the beginning of the survey to serve continually as proof objects  when from any station the fore and back objects cannot both be seen the agreement of the needle with one of them may be depended on for placing the table straight on the line and for fixing it in the original position  of shifting the paper on the plain table  when one paper is full and you have occasion for more draw a line in any manner through the farthest point of the last station line to which the work can be conveniently laid down then take the sheet off the table and fix another on drawing a line upon it in a part the most convenient for the rest of the work then sold or cut the old sheet by the line drawn on it apply the edge to the line on the new sheet and as they lie in that position continue the last station line upon the new paper placing upon it the rest of the measure beginning at where the old sheet left off and so on from sheet to sheet  when the work is done and you would fasten all the sheets together into one piece or rough plan the aforesaid lines are to be accurately joined together as when the lines were transferred from the old sheets to the new ones  but it is to be noted that if the said joining lines upon the old and new sheet have not the same inclination to the side of the table the needle will not point to the original degree when the table is rectified and if the needle be required to respect still the same degree of the compass the easiest way of drawing the lines in the same position is to draw them both parallel to the same sides of the table by means of the equal divisions marked on the other two sides    of the theodolite the theodolite is a brazen circular ring divided into   0 degrees and having an index with sights or a telescope placed upon the center about which the index is moveable also a compass fixed to the center to point out courses and check the sights the whole being fixed by the center upon a stand of a convenient height for use  in using this instrument an exact account or fieldbook of all measures and things necessary to be remarked in the plan must be kept from which to make out the plan upon your return home from the ground  begin at such part of the ground and measure in such directions as you judge most convenient taking angles or directions to objects and measuring such distances as appear necessary under the same restrictions as in the use of the plain table and it is safest to six the theodolite in the original position at every station by means of fore and back objects and the compass exactly as in using the plain table registering the number of degrees cut off by the index when directed to each object and at any station placing the index at the same degree as when the direction toward that station was taken from the last preceding one to fix the theodolite there in the original position after the same manner as the plain table is fixed in the original position by laying its index along the line of the last direction  the best method of laying down the aforesaid lines of direction is to describe a pretty large circle quarter it and lay upon it the several numbers of degrees cut off by the index in each direction then by means of a parallel ruler draw from station to station lines parallel to lines drawn from the center to the respective points in the circumference    of the cross the cross consists of two pair of sights set at right angles to each other upon a staff having a sharp point at the bottom to stick in the ground  the cross is very useful to measure small and crooked pieces of ground the method is to measure a base or chief line usually in the longest direction of the piece from corner to corner and while measuring it finding the places where perpendiculars would fall upon this line from the several corners and bends in the boundary of the piece with the cross by fixing it by trials upon such parts of the line as that through one pair of the sights both ends of the line may appear and through the other pair you can perceive the corresponding bends or corners and then measuring the lengths of the said perpendiculars  remarks besides the forementioned instruments which are most commonly used there are some others as the circumferentor which resembles the theodolite in shape and use and the semicircle for taking angles etc but of all the instruments for measuring the plain table is certainly the best not only because it may be used as a theodolite or semicircle by turning uppermost that side of the frame which has the   0 degrees upon it but because it is in its own proper use by much the easiest safest and most accurate for the purpose for by planning every part immediately upon the spot as soon as measured there is not only saved a great deal of writing in the fieldbook but every thing can also be planned more easily and accurately while it is in view than it can afterward from a fieldbook in which many little things must be either neglected or mistaken and besides the opportunities which the plain table afford of correcting your work or proving if it be right at every station are such advantages as can never be balanced by any other method but although the plain table be the most generally useful instrument it is not always so there being many cases in which sometimes one instrument is the properest and sometimes another nor is that surveyor master of his business who cannot in any case distinguish which is the fittest instrument or method and use it accordingly nay sometimes no instrument at all but barely the chain itself is the best method particularly in regular open fields lying together and even when you are using the plain table it is often of advantage to measure such large open parts with the chain only and from those measures lay them down upon the table  the perambulator is used for measuring roads and other great distances on level ground and by the sides of rivers it has a wheel of   feet or half a pole in circumference upon which the machine turns and the distance measured is pointed out by an index which is moved round by clock work  levels with telescople or other sights are used to find the level between place and place or how much one place is higher or lower than another  an offsetstaff is a very useful and necessary instrument for measuring the offsets and other short distances it is  0 links in length being divided and marked at each of the  0 links  ten small arrows or rods of iron or wood are used to mark the end of every chain length in measuring lines and sometimes pickets or staves with flags are set up as marks or objects of direction  various scales are also used in protracting and measuring on the plan or paper such as plane scales line of chords protractor compasses reducing scale parallel and perpendicular rules etc of plane scales there should be several sizes as a chain in   inch a chain in of an inch a chain in an inch etc and of these the best for use are those that are laid on the very edges of the ivory scale to prick off distances by without compasses  the field book in surveying with the plain table a fieldbook is not used as every thing is drawn on the table immediately when it is measured but in surveying with the theodolite or any other instrument some sort of a fieldbook must be used to write down in it a register or account of all that is done and occurs relative to the survey in hand  this book every one contrives and rules as he thinks fittest for himself the following is a specimen of a form very generally used it is ruled into   columns the middle or principal column is for the stations angles bearings distances measured etc and those on the right and left are for the offsets on the right and left which are set against their corresponding distances in the middle column as also for such remarks as may occur and be proper to note in drawing the plan etc  here   is the first station where the angle or bearing is  0     on the left at    links in the distance or principal line is an offset of    and at   0 an offset of    to a cross hedge on the right at o or the beginning an offset    to the corner of the field at     browns boundary hedge commences at   0 an offset    and at     the end of the first line the o denotes its terminating in the hedge and so on for the other stations  draw a line under the work at the end of every station line to prevent confusion  form of the fieldbook offsets and remarks on the left stations bearings and distances offsets and remarks on the right    0     00    corner           browns hedge cross a hedge      0        00       0 00 00 house corner            0  0 a tree         0 a style       0       a brook  0           a spring foot path      0 cross hedge         0 a pond  but in smaller surveys and measurements a very good way of setting down the work is to draw by the eye on a piece of paper a figure resembling that which is to be measured and so write the dimensions as they are found against the corresponding parts of the figure and this method may be practiced to a considerable extent even in the larger surveys  chapter ii the practice of surveying this part contains the several works proper to be done in the field or the ways of measuring by all the instruments and in all situations  problem i to measure a line or distance to measure a line on the ground with the chain having provided a chain with  0 small arrows or rods to stick one into the ground as a mark at the end  every chain two persons take hold of the chain one at each end of it and all the  0 arrows are taken by one of them who is to go foremost and is called the lder the other being called the follower for distinctions sake  a picket or stationstaff being set up in the direction of the line to be measured if there do not appear some marks naturally in that direction the follower stands at the beginning of the line holding the ring at the end of the chain in his hand while the leader drags forward the chain by the other end of it till it is stretched straight and laid or held level and the leader directed by the follower waving his hand to the right or left till the follower see him exactly in a line with the mark or direction to be measured to there both of them stretching the chain straight and stooping and holding it level the leader having the head of one of his arrows in the same hand by which he holds the end of the chain let him there stick one of them down with it while he holds the chain stretched this done he leaves the arrow in the ground as a mark for the follower to come to and advances another chain forward being directed in his position by the follower standing at the arrow as before as also by himself now and at every succeeding chains length by moving himself from side to side till he brings the follower and the back mark into a line having then stretched the chain and stuck down an arrow as before the follower takes up his arrow and they advance again in the same manner another chainlength and thus they proceed till all the  0 arrows are employed and are in the hands of the follower and the leader without an arrow is arrived at the end of the   th chain length the follower then sends or brings the  0 arrows to the leader who puts one of them down at the end of his chain and advances with the chain as before and thus the arrows are changed from the one to the other at every  0 chains length till the whole line is finished when the number of changes of the arrows shows the number of tens to which the follower adds the arrows he holds in his hand and the number of links of an other chain over to the mark or end of the line so if there have been   changes of the arrows and the follower hold   arrows and the end of the line cut off    links more the whole length of the line is set down in links thus       problem ii to take angles and bearings let b and c be two objects or two pickets set up perpendicular and let it be required to take their bearings or the angle formed between them at any station a  diagram    with the plain table  the table being covered with a paper and fixed on its stand plant it at the station a and fix a sine pn or a point of the compasses in a proper point of the paper to represent the point a close by the side of this pin lay the fiducial edge of the index and turn it about still touching the pin till one object b can be seen through the sights then by the fiducial edge of the index draw a line in the very same manner draw another line in the direction of the other object c and it is done    with the theodolite etc  direct the fixed sights along one of the lines as ab by turning the instrument about till you see the mark b through these sights and there screw the instrument fast then turn the moveable index about till through its sights you see the other mark c then the degrees cut by the index upon the graduated limb or ring of the instrument shows the quantity of the angle    with the magnetic needle and compass  turn the instrument or compass so that the north end of the needle point to the flowerdeluce then direct the sights to one mark as b and note the degrees cut by the needle then direct the sights to the other mark c and note again the degrees cut by the needle then their sum or difference as the case is will give the quantity of the angle bac    by measurement with the chain etc  measure one chain length or any other length along both directions as to b and c then measure the distance bc and it is done  this is easily transferred to paper by making a triangle abc with these three lengths and then measuring the angle a as in practical geometry prob xi  problem iii to measure the offsets ahiklmn being a crooked hedge or river etc from a measure in a straight direction along the side of it to b and in measuring along this line ab observe when you are directly opposite any bends or corners of the hedge as at c d e etc and from thence measure the perpendicular offsets ch di etc with the offsetstaff if they are not very large otherwise with the chain itself and the work is done and the register or fieldbook may be as follows offs left base line ab 0 a ch       ac di      0 ad ek  0   0 ae fl      0 af gm        ag hn        ab  diagram  note when the offsets are not very large their places c d e etc on the base line can be very well determined by the eye especially when assisted by laying down the offsetstaff in a cross or perpendicular direction but when these perpendiculars are very large find their positions by the cross or by the instrument which you happen to be using in this manner as you measure along ab when you come about c where you judge a perpendicular will stand plant your instrument in the line and turn the index till the marks a and b can be seen through both the sights looking both backward and forward then look along the cross sights or the cross line on the index and if it point directly to the corner or bend h the place of c is right otherwise move the instrument backward or forward on the line ab till the cross line points straight to h this being found set down the distance measured from a to c then measure the offset ch and set it down opposite the former and on the left hand side  then proceed forward in the line ab till you arrive opposite another corner and determine the place d of the perpendicular as before and so on throughout the whole length  problem iv to survey a triangular field abc   by the chain  ap     ab      pc      diagram  having set up marks at the corners which is to be done in all cases where there are not marks naturally measure with the chain from a to p where a perpendicular would fall from the angle c and set up a mark at p noting down the distance ap then complete the distance ab by measuring from p to b having set down this measure return to p and measure the perpendicular pc and thus having the base and perpendicular the area from them is easily found or having the place p of the perpendicular the triangle is easily constructed  or measure all the three sides with the chain and note them down from which the content is easily found or the figure constructed    by taking one or more of the angles  measure two sides ab ac and the angle a between them or measure one side ab and the two adjacent angles a and b from either of these ways the figure is easily planned then by measuring the perpendicular cp on the plan and multiplying it by half ab you have the content  problem v to measure a foursided field   by the chain  ae       0 de af      0  bf ac      diagram  measure along either of the diagonals as ac and either the two perpendiculars

field by the chain only having set up marks at the corners where necessary of the proposed field abcdefg walk over the ground and consider how it can best be divided into triangles and trapeziums and measure them separately as in the last two problems and in this way it will be proper to divide it into as few separate triangles and as many trapeziums as may be by drawing diagonals from corner to corner and so as that all the perpendiculars may fall within the figure thus the following figure is divided into the two trapeziums abcg gdef and the triangle gcd then in the first beginning at a measure the diagonal ac and the two perpendiculars gm bn then the base gc and the perpendicular dq lastly the diagonal df and the two perpendiculars pe og all which measures write against the corresponding parts of a rough figure drawn to resemble the figure to be surveyed or set them down in any other form you choose  am       0 mg an   0   0 nb ac   0 cq       0 quoth cg   0 fo  0    0

line either within or without them together with the perpendiculars let fall upon it from every corner of them for they are by those means divided into several triangles and trapezoids all whose parallel sides are perpendicular to the base line and the sum of these triangles and trapeziums will be equal to the figure proposed if the base line fall within it if not the sum of the parts which are without being taken from the sum of the whole which are both within and without will leave the area of the figure proposed  in pieces that are not very large it will be sufficiently exact to find the points in the base line where the several perpendiculars will fall by means of the cross and from thence measuring to the corners for the lengths of the perpendiculars  and it will be most convenient to draw the line so as that all the perpendiculars may fall within the figure  thus in the following figure beginning at a and measuring along the line ag the distances and perpendiculars on the right and left are as below  ab       0 bb ac   0  0 cc ad       0 dd ae   0  0 ee af   0   0 ff ag  0 0 0  diagram  problem vii to survey any field with the plain table   from one station  plant the table at any angle as c from whence all the other angles or marks set up can be seen and turn the table about till the needle point to the flowerdeluce and there screw it fast make a point for c on the paper on the table and lay the edge of the index to c turning it about c till through the sights you see the mark d and by the edge of the index draw a dry or obscure line then measure the distance cd and lay that distance down on the line cd then turn the index about the point c till the mark e be seen through the sights by which draw a line and measure the distance to e laying it on the line from c to e in like manner determine the positions of ca and cb by turning diagram the sights successively to a and b and lay the lengths of those lines down then connect the points with the boundaries of the field by drawing the black lines cd de ea ab bc    from a station within the field  when all the other parts cannot be seen from one angle choose some place o within or even without if more convenient from whence the other parts can be seen plant the table at o then fix it with the needle north and mark the point o on it apply the index successively to o turning it round

cd de ea  diagram    by going round the figure  when the figure is a wood or water or from some other obstruction you cannot measure lines across it begin at any point a and measure round it either within or without the figure and draw the directions of all the sides thus plant the table at a turn it with the needle to the north or flowerdeluce fix it and mark the point a apply the index to a turning it till you can see the point e there draw a line and then the point b and there draw a line then measure these lines and lay them down from a to e and b next move the table to b lay the index along the line ab and turn the table about till you can see the mark a and screw fast the table in which position also the needle will again point to the flowerdeluce as it will do indeed at every station when the table is in the right position here turn the index about b till through the sights you see the mark c there draw a line measure bc and lay the distance upon that line after you have set down the table at c turn it then again into its proper position and in like manner find the next line cd and so on quite round by e to a again then the proof of the work will be the joining at a for if the work is all right the last direction ea on the ground will pass exactly through the point a on the paper and the measured distance will also reach exactly to a if these do not coincide or nearly so some error has been committed and the work must be examined over again  problem viii to survey a field with the theodolite etc   from one point or station  when all the angles can be seen from one point as the angle e first fig to last prob place the instrument at o and turn it about till through the fixed sights you see the mark b and there fix it then turn the moveable index about till the mark a is seen through the sights and note the degrees cut on the instrument next turn the index successively to e and d noting the degrees cut off at each which gives all the angles bca bce bcd lastly measure the lines cb ca ce cd and enter the measures in a fieldbook or rather against the corresponding parts of a rough figure drawn by guess to resemble the field    from a point within or without  plant the instrument at o last fig and turn it about till the fixed sights point to any object as a and there screw it fast then turn the moveable index round till the sights point successively to the other points e d c b noting the degrees cut off at each of them which gives all the angles round the point o lastly measure the distances oa ob oc od oe noting them down as before and the work is done    by going round the field  by measuring round either within or without the field proceed thus having set up marks at b c etc near the corners as usual plant the instrument at any point a and turn it till the sixed index be in the direction ab and there screw it fast then turn the moveable index to the direction af and the degrees cut off will be the angle a measure the line ab and plant the instrument at b and there in the same manner observe the angle a then measure bc and observe the angle c then measure the distance cd and take the angle d then measure de and take the angle e then measure e and take the angle f and lastly measure the distance fa  diagram  to prove the work add all the inward angles a b c etc together and when the work is right their sum will be equal to twice as many right angles as the figure has sides wanting   right angles and when there is an angle as f that bends inwards and you measure the external angle which is less than two right angles subtract it from   right angles or   0 degrees to give the internal angle greater than a semicircle or   0 degrees  otherwise  instead of observing the internal angles you may take the external angles formed without the sigure by producing the sides further out and in this case when the work is right their sum altogether will be equal to   0 degrees but when one of them as f runs inwards subtract it from the sum of the rest to leave   0 degrees  problem ix to survey a field with crooked hedges etc with any of the instruments measure the lengths and positions of imaginary lines running as near the sides of the field as you can and in going along them measure the offsets in the manner before taught and you will have the plan on the paper in using the plain table drawing the crooked hedges through the ends of the offsets but in surveying with the theodolite or other instrument set down the measures properly in a fieldbook or memorandumbook and plan them after returning from the field by laying down all the lines and angles  diagram  so in surveying the piece abcde set up marks a b c d dividing it into as few sides as may be then begin at any station a and measure the lines ab bc cd da and take their positions or the angles a b c d and in going along the lines measure all the offsets as at m n o p etc along every station line  and this is done either within the field or without as may be most convenient when there are obstructions within as wood water hills etc then measure without as in the figure here below  diagram  problem x to survey a field or any other thing by two stations this is performed by choosing two stations from whence all the marks and objects can be seen then measuring the distance between the stations and at each station taking the angles formed by every object from the station line or distance  the two stations may be taken either within the bounds or in one of the sides or in the direction of two of the objects or quite at a distance and without the bounds of the objects or part to be surveyed  in this manner not only grounds may be surveyed without even entering them but a map may be taken of the principal parts of a country or the chief places of a town or any part of a river or coast surveyed or any other inaccessible objects by taking two stations on two towers or two hills or such like  diagram  when the plain table is used plant it at one station m draw a line mn on it along which lay the edge of the index and turn the table about till the sights point directly to the other station and there screw it fast then turn the sights round m successively to all the objects abc etc drawing a dry line by the edge of the index at each as ma mb mc etc then measure the distance to the other station there plant the table and lay that distance down on the station line from m to n next lay the index by the line nm and turn the table about till the sights point to the other station m and there screw it fast then direct the sights successively to all the objects a b c etc as before drawing lines each time as na nb nc etc and their intersection with the former lines will give the places of all the objects or corners a b c etc  when the theodolite or any other instrument for taking angles is used proceed in the same way measuring the station distance mn planting the instrument first at one station and then at another then placing the fixed sights in the direction m n and directing the moveable sights to every object noting the degrees cut off at each time then these observations being planned the intersections of the lines will give the objects as before  when all the objects to be surveyed cannot be seen from two stations then three stations may be used or four or as many as is necessary measuring always the distance from one station to another placing the instrument in the same position at every station by means described before and from each station observing or setting every object that can be seen from it by taking its direction or angular position till every object be determined by the intersection of two or more lines of direction the more the better and thus may very extensive surveys be taken as of large commons rivers coasts countries hilly grounds and such like  problem xi to survey a large estate if the estate be very large and contain a great number of fields it cannot well be done by surveying all the fields singly and then putting them together nor can it be done by taking all the angles and boundaries that enclose it for in these cases any small errors will be so multiplied as to render it very much distorted    walk over the estate two or three times in order to get a perfect idea of it and till you can carry the map of it tolerably in your head and to help your memory draw an eye draught of it on paper or at least of the principal parts of it to guide you    choose two or more eminent places in the estate for your stations from whence you can see all the principal parts of it and let these stations be as far distant from one another as possible as the fewer stations you have to command the whole the more exact your work will be and they will be sitter for your purpose if these station lines be in or near the boundaries of the ground and especially if two lines or more proceed from one station    take what angles between the stations you think necessary and measure the distances from station to station always in a right line these things must be done till you get as many angles and lines as are sufficient for determining all your points of station and in measuring any of these station distances mark accurately where these lines meet with any hedges ditches roads lanes paths rivulets etc and where any remarkable object is placed by measuring its distance from the station line and where a perpendicular from it cuts that line and always mind in any of these observations that you be in a right line which you will know by taking backsight and foresight along your station line and thus as you go along any main station line take offsets to the ends of all hedges and to any pond house mill bridge etc omitting nothing that is remarkable and all these things must be noted down for these are your data by which the places of such objects are to be determined upon your plan and be sure to set marks up at the intersections of all hedges with the station line that you may know where to measure from when you come to survey these particular fields which must immediately be done as soon as you have measured that station line whilst they are fresh in memory by this means all your station lines are to be measured and the situation of all places adjoining to them determined which is the first grand point to be obtained it will be proper for you to lay down your work upon paper every night when you go home that you may see how you go on    as to the inner parts of the estate they must be determined in like manner by new station lines for after the main stations are determined and every thing adjoining to them then the estate must be subdivided into two or three parts by new station lines taking inner stations at proper places where you can have the best view measure these station lines as you did the first and all their intersections with hedges and all offsets to such objects as appear then you may proceed to survey the adjoining fields by taking the angles that the sides make with the station line at the intersections and measuring the distances to each corner from the intersections for every station line will be a basis to all the future operations the situation of all parts being entirely dependent upon them and therefore they should be taken as long as possible and it is best for them to run along some of the hedges or boundaries of one or more fields or to pass through some of their angles all things being determined for these stations you must take more inner stations and continue to divide and subdivide till at last you come to single fields repeating the same work for the inner stations as for the outer ones till all be done and close the work as often as you can and in as few lines as possible and that you may choose stations the most conveniently so as to cause the least labor let the station lines run as far as you can along some hedges and through as many corners of the fields and other remarkable points as you can and take notice how one field lies by another that you may not misplace them in the draught    an estate may be so situated that the whole cannot be surveyed together because one part of the estate cannot be seen from another in this case you may divide it into three or four parts and survey the parts separately as if they were lands belonging to different persons and at last join them together    as it is necessary to protract or lay down your work as you proceed in it you must have a scale of a due length to do it by to get such a scale you must measure the whole length of the estate in chains then you must consider how many inches long the map is to be and from these you will know how many chains you must have in an inch then make your scale or choose one already made accordingly    the trees in every hedge row must be placed in their proper situation which is soon done by the plain table but may be done by the eye without an instrument and being thus taken by guess in a rough draught they will be exact enough being only to look at except it be such as are at any remarkable places as at the ends of hedges at styles gates etc and these must be measured but all this need not be done till the draught is finished and observe in all the hedges what side the gutter or ditch is on and to whom the fences belong    when you have long stations you ought to have a good instrument to take angles with and the plain table may very properly be made use of to take the several small internal parts and such as cannot be taken from the main stations as it is a very quick and ready instrument  problem xii to survey a county or large tract of land   choose two three or four eminent places for stations such as the tops of high hills or mountains towers or church steeples which may be seen from one another and from which most of the towns and other places of note may also be seen and let them be as far distant from one another as possible upon these places raise beacons or long poles with flags of different colors flying at them so as to be visible from all the other stations    at all the places which you would set down in the map plant long poles with flags at them of several colors to distinguish the places from one another fixing them upon the tops of church steeples or the tops of houses or in the centers of lesser towns  but you need not have these marks at many places at once as suppose half a score at a time for when the angles have been taken at the two stations to all these places the marks may be moved to new ones and so successively to all the places you want these marks then being set up at a convenient number of places and such as may be seen from both stations go to one of these stations and with an instrument to take angles standing at that station take all the angles between the other station and each of these marks observing which is blue which red etc and which hand they lie on and set all down with their colors then go to the other station and take all the angles between the first station and each of the former marks and set them down with the others each against his fellow with the same color you may if you can also take the angles at some third station which may serve to prove the work if the three lines intersect in that point where any mark stands the marks must stand till the observations are finished at both stations and then they must be taken down and set up at fresh places and the same operations must be performed at both stations for these fresh places and the like for others your instrument for taking angles must be an exceeding good one made on purpose with telescopic sights and of three four or five feet radius a circumferentor is reckoned a good instrument for this purpose    and though it is not absolutely necessary to measure any distance because any stationary line being laid down from any scale all the other lines will be proportional to it yet it is better to measure some of the lines to ascertain the distances of places in miles and to know how many geometrical miles there are in any length and from thence to make a scale to measure any distance in miles in measuring any distance it will not be exactenough to go along the high roads by reason of their turnings and windings and hardly ev lying in a right line between the stations which must cause infinite reductions and create endless trouble to make it a right line for which reason it can never be exact but a better way is to measure in a right line with a chain between station and station over hills and dales or level fields and all obstacles only in case of water woods towns rocks banks etc where one cannot pass such parts of the line must be measured by the methods of inaccessible distances and besides allowing for ascents and descents when we meet with them and a good compass that shows the bearing of the two stations will always direct you to go straight when you do not see the two stations and in your progress if you can go straight you may take offsets to any remarkable places likewise note the intersection of your stationary line with all roads rivers etc    and from all your stations and in your whole progress be very particular in observing sea coasts river mouths towns castles houses churches windmills watermills trees rocks sands roads bridges fords ferries woods hills mountains rills brooks parks beacons sluices floodgates looks etc and in general all things that are remarkable    after you have done with your first and main station lines which command the whole county you must then take inner stations at some places already determined which will divide the whole into several partitions and from these stations you must determine the places of as many of the remaining towns as you can and if any remain in that part you must take more stations at some places already determined from which you may determine the rest and thus we must go through all the parts of the county taking station after station till we have determined all we want and in general the station distances must always pass through such remarkable points as have been determined before by the former stations    lastly the position of the station line you measure or the point of the compass it lies on must be determined by astronomical observation hang up a thread and plummet in the sun over some part of the station line and observe when the shadow runs along that line and at that moment take the suns altitude then having his declination and the latitude the azimuth will be found by spherical trigonometry and the azimuth is the angle the station line makes with the meridian and therefore a meridian may easily be drawn through the map or a meridian may be drawn through it by hanging up two threads in a line with the pole star when he is just north which may be known from astronomical tables or thus observe the star alioth or that in the rump of the great bear being that next the square or else cassiopeias hip i say observe by a line and plummet when either of these stars and the pole star come into a perpendicular and at that time they are due north therefore two perpendicular lines being fixed at that moment toward these two stars will give the position of the meridian  problem xiii to survey a town or city this may be done with any of the instruments for taking angles but best of all with the plain table where every minute part is drawn while in sight it is best also to have a chain of  0 feet long divided into  0 links and an offsetstaff of  0 feet long  begin at the meeting of two or more of the principal streets through which you can have the longest prospects to get the longest station lines there having fixed the instrument draw lines of direction along those streets using two men as marks or poles set in wooden pedestals or perhaps some remarkable places in the houses at the further ends as windows doors corners etc measure these lines with the chain taking offsets with the staff at all corners of streets bendings or windings and to all remarkable things as churches markets halls colleges eminent houses etc then remove the instrument to another station along one of these lines and there repeat the same process as before and so on till the whole is finished  diagram  thus fix the instrument at a and draw lines in the direction of all the streets meeting there and measure ab noting the street on the left at m at the second station b draw the directions of the streets meeting there measure from b to c noting the places of the streets at n and o as you pass by them at the  d station c take the direction of all the streets meeting there and measure cd at d do the same and measure de noting the place of the cross streets at p and in this manner go through all the principal streets this done proceed to the smaller and intermediate streets and lastly to the lanes alleys courts yards and every part that it may be thought proper to represent  chapter iii of planning castingup and dividing problem i to lay down the plan of any survey if the survey was taken with a plain table you have a rough plan of it already on the paper which covered the table but if the survey was with any other instrument a plan of it is to be drawn from the measures that were taken in the survey and first of all a rough plan upon paper  to do this you must have a set of proper instruments for laying down both lines and angles etc as scales of various sizes the more of them and the more accurate the better scales of chords protractors perpendicular and parallel rulers etc diagonal scales are best for the lines because they extend to three figures or chains and links which are hundredth parts of chains but in using the diagonal scale a pair of compasses must be employed to take off the lengths of the principal lines very accurately but a scale with a thin edge divided is much readier for laying down the perpendicular offsets to crooked hedges and for marking the places of those offsets upon the station line which is done at only one application of the edge of the scale to that line and then pricking off all at once the distances along it angles are to be laid down either with a good scale of chords which is perhaps the most accurate way or with a large protractor which is much readier when many angles are to be laid down at one point as they are pricked off all at once round the edge of the protractor  very particular directions for laying down all sorts of figures cannot be necessary in this place to any person who has learned practical geometry and the construction of figures and the use of his instruments it may therefore be sufficient to observe that all lines and angles must be laid down on the plan in the same order in which they were measured in the field and in which they are written in the fieldbook laying down first the angles for the position of lines then the lengths of the lines with the places of the offsets and then the lengths of the offsets themselves all with dry or obscure lines then a black line drawn through the extremities of all the offsets will be the hedge or bounding line of the field etc after the principal bounds and lines are laid down and made to fit or close properly proceed next to the smaller objects till you have entered every thing that ought to appear in the plan as houses brooks trees hills gates styles roads lanes mills bridges woodlands etc etc  the north side of a map or plan is commonly placed uppermost and a meridian somewhere drawn with the compass or flowerdeluce pointing north also in a vacant part a scale of equal parts or chains must be drawn and the title of the map in conspicuous characters and embellished with a compartment all hills must be shadowed to distinguish them in the map color the hedges with different colors represent hilly grounds by broken hills and valleys draw single dotted lines for footpaths and double ones for horse or carriage roads write the name of each field and remarkable place within it and if you choose its content in acres roods and perches  in a very large estate or a county draw vertical and horizontal lines through the map denoting the spaces between them by letters placed at the top and bottom and sides for readily finding any field or other object mentioned in a table  in mapping counties and estates that have uneven grounds of hills and valleys reduce all oblique lines measured up hill and down hill to horizontal straight lines if that was not done during the survey before they were entered in the fieldbook by making a proper allowance to shorten them for which purpose there is commonly a small table engraven on some of the instruments for surveying  problem ii to cast up the contents of fields   compute the contents of the figures whether triangles or trapeziums etc by the proper rules for the several figures laid down in measuring multiplying the lengths by the breadths both in links the product is acres after you have cut off five figures on the right for decimals then bring these decimals to roods and perches by multiplying first by   and then by  0 an example of which is given in the description of the chain page        in small and separate pieces it is usual to cast up their contents from the measures of the lines taken in surveying them without making a correct plan of them  thus in the triangle in prob iv page     where we had ap    and ab        or the first example to prob v page  00 thus   or the  d example to the same prob v thus     in pieces bounded by very crooked and winding hedges measured by offsets all the parts between the offsets are most accurately measured separately as small trapezoids thus for the example to prob     p     where ac       ch ad   0    di ae   0  0 ek af   0    fl ag        gm ab        bn  then     sometimes such pieces as that above are computed by finding a mean breadth by dividing the sum of the offsets by the number of them accounting that for one of them where the boundary meets the station line as at a then multiply the length ab by that mean breadth thus     but in larger pieces and whole estates consisting of many fields it is the common practice to make a rough plan of the whole and from it compute the contents quite independent of the measures of the lines and angles that were taken in surveying for then new lines are drawn in the fields in the plan so as to divide them into trapeziums and triangles the bases and perpendiculars of which are measured on the plan by means of the seals from which it was drawn and so multiplied together for the contents in this way the work is very expeditiously done and sufficiently correct for such dimensions are taken as afford the most easy method of calculation and among a number of parts thus taken and applied to a seal it is likely that some of the parts will be taken a small matter too little and others too great so that they will upon the whole in all probability very nearly balance one another after all the fields and particular parts are thus computed separately and added all together into one sum calculate the whole estate independent of the fields by dividing it into large and arbitrary triangles and trapeziums and add these also together then if this sum be equal to the former or nearly so the work is right but if the sums have any considerable difference it is wrong and they must be examined and recomputed till they nearly agree  a specimen of dividing into one triangle or one trapezium which will do for most single fields may be seen in the examples to the last problem and a specimen of dividing a large tract into several such trapeziums and triangles in prob vi of chapter ii of surveying page  0  where a piece is so divided and its dimensions taken and set down and again at prob vi of mensuration of surfaces where the contents of the same piece are computed    but the chief secret in casting up consists in finding the contents of pieces bounded by curved or very irregular lines or in reducing such crooked sides of fields or boundaries to straight lines that shall enclose the same or equal area with those crooked sides and so obtain the area of the curved figure by means of the rightlined one which will commonly be a trapezium now this reducing the crooked sides to straight ones is very easily and accurately performed thus apply the straight edge of a thin clear piece of lanthornhorn to the crooked line which is to be reduced in such a manner that the small parts cut off from the crooked figure by it may be equal to those which are taken in which equality of the parts included and excluded you will presently be able to judge of very nicely by a little practice then with a pencil draw a line by the straight edge of the horn do the same by the other sides of the field or figure so shall you have a straight sided figure equal to the curved one the content of which being computed as before directed will be the content of the curved figure proposed  or instead of the straight edge of the horn a horsehair may be applied across the crooked sides in the same manner and the easiest way of using the hair is to string a small slender bow with it either of wire or cane or whalebone or such like slender springy matter for the bow keeping it always stretched it can be easily and neatly applied with one hand while the other is at liberty to make two marks by the side of it to draw the straight line by  example  thus let it be required to find the contents of the same figure as in prob ix of the last chapter page  0  to a scale of   chains to an inch  diagram  draw the four dotted straight lines ab bc cd da cutting off equal quantities on both sides of them which they do as near as the eye can judge so is the crooked figure reduced to an equivalent rightlined one of four sides abcd then draw the diagonal bd which by applying a proper scale to it measures      also the perpendicular or nearest distance from a to this diagonal measures     and the distance of c from it is      then   and thus the content of the trapezium and consequently of the irregular figure to which it is equal is easily found to be   acres   roods   perches  problem iii to transfer a plan to another paper etc after the rough plan is completed and a fair one is wanted this may be done either on paper or vellum by any of the following methods  first method lay the rough plan upon the clean paper and keep them always pressed flat and close together by weights laid upon them then with the point of a fine pin or pricker prick through all the corners of the plan to be copied take them asunder and connect the pricked points on the clean paper with lines and it is done this method is only to be practiced in plans of such figures as are small and tolerably regular or bounded by right lines  second method rub the back of the rough plan over with black lead powder and lay the said black part upon the clean paper upon which the plan is to be copied and in the proper position then with the blunt point of some hard substance as brass or such like trace over the lines of the whole plan pressing the tracer so much as that the black lead under the lines may be transferred to the clean paper after which take off the rough plan and trace over the leaden marks with common ink or with indian ink etc  or instead of blacking the rough plan you may keep constantly a blacked paper to lay between the plans  third method another method of copying plans is by means of squares this is performed by dividing both ends and sides of the plan which is to be copied into any convenient number of equal parts and connecting the corresponding points of division with lines which will divide the plan into a number of small squares then divide the paper upon which the plan is to be copied into the same number of squares each equal to the former when the plan is to be copied of the same size but greater or less than the others in the proportion in which the plan is to be increased or diminished when of a different size lastly copy into the clean squares the parts contained in the corresponding squares of the old plan and you will have the copy either of the same size or greater or less in any proportion  fourth method a fourth method is by the instrument called a pentagraph which also copies the plan in any size required  fifth method but the neatest method of any is this procure a copying frame or glass made in this manner namely a large square of the best window glass set in a broad frame of wood which can be raised up to any angle when the lower side of it rests on a table set this frame up to any angle before you facing a strong light fix the old plan and clean paper together with several pins quite around to keep them together the clean paper being laid uppermost and upon the face of the plan to be copied lay them with the back of the old plan upon the glass namely that part which you intend to begin at to copy first and by means of the light shining through the papers you will very distinctly perceive every line of the plan through the clean paper in this state then trace all the lines on the paper with a pencil having drawn that part which covers the glass slide another part over the glass and copy it in the same manner and then another part and so on till the whole be copied  then take them asunder and trace all the pencillines over with a sine pen and indian ink or with common ink  and thus you may copy the finest plan without injuring it in the least  when the lines etc are copied upon the clean paper or vellum the next business is to write such names remarks or explanations as may be judged necessary laying down the scale for taking the lengths of any parts a flowerdeluce to point out the direction and the proper title ornamented with a compartment and illustrating or coloring every part in such manner as shall seem most natural such as shading rivers or brooks with crooked lines drawing the representations of trees bshes hills woods hedges houses gates roads etc in their proper places running a single dotted line for a foot path and a double one for a carriage road and either representing the bases or the elevations of buildings etc  conic sections and their solids definitions   conic sections are the plane figures formed by cutting a cone  according to the different positions of the cutting plane there will arise five different figures or sections    if the cutting plane pass through the vertex and any part of the base the section will be a triangle  diagram    if the cone be cut parallel to the base the section will be a circle  diagram    the section is called an ellipsis when the cone is cut obliquely through both sides  diagram    the section is a parabola when the cone is cut parallel to one of its sides  diagram    the section is an hyperbola when the cutting plane meets the opposite cone continued above the vertex where it will make another section or hyperbola equal to the lower one  diagram    the vertices of any section are the points where the cutting plane meets the opposite sides of the cone    the transverse axis is the line between the two vertices and the middle point of the transverse is the center of the conic section  diagram  diagram    the conjugate axis is a line drawn through the center and perpendicular to the transverse   0 an ordinate is a line perpendicular to the axis     an absciss is a part of the axis between the ordinate and the vertex     a spheroid or ellipsoid is a solid generated by the revolution of an ellipse about one of its axes it is a prolate one when the revolution is made about the transverse axis and oblate when about the conjugate  diagram     a conoid is a solid formed by the revolution of a parabola or hyperbola about the axis and is accordingly called parabolic or hyperbolic  the parabolic conoid is also called a paraboloid and the hyperbolic conoid an hyperboloid  diagram     a spindle is formed by any of the three sections revolving about a double ordinate like the circular spindle     a segment of any of these figures is a part cut off at the top by a plane parallel to the base     and a frustum is the part left next the base after the segment is cut off  problem i to describe an ellipse let tr be the transverse co the conjugate etc the center with the radius tc and center c describe an arc cutting tr in the points f f which are called the two foci of the ellipse  diagram  assume any point p in the transverse then with the radii pt pr and centers f f describe two arcs intersecting in   which will be a point in the curve of the ellipse  and thus by assuming a number of points p in the tranverse there will be found as many points in the curve as you please then with a steady hand draw the curve through all these points  otherwise with a thread  take a thread of the length of the transverse tr and fasten its ends with two pins in the foci f f then stretch the thread and it will reach to i in the curve and by moving a pencil round within the thread keeping it always stretched it will trace out the ellpse  problem ii in an ellipse to find the transverse or conjugate or

and those of their frustums by prob xix where some examples of them are given  of gauging the business of caskgauging is commonly performed by two instruments namely the gauging or slidingrule and the gauging or diagonal rod    of the gauging rule this instrument serves to compute the contents of casks etc after the dimensions have been taken it is a square rule having various logarithmic lines on its four sides or faces and three sliding pieces running in grooves in three of them  upon the first face are three lines namely two marked a b for multiplying and dividing and the third md for malt depth because it serves to gauge malt the middle one b is upon the slider and is a kind of double line being marked at both the edges of the slider for applying it to both the lines a and md these three lines are all of the same radius or distance from   to  0 each containing twice the length of the radius a and b are placed and numbered exactly alike each beginning at   which may be either   or  0 or  00 etc or  or0  or00  etc but whatever it is the middle division  0 will be  0 times as much and the last division  00 times as much but   on the line md is opposite     or more exactly    0  on the other lines which number    0  denotes the cubic inches in a malt bushel and its divisions numbered retrograde to those of a and b upon these two lines are also several other marks and letters thus on the line a are m for malt bushel at the number    0  and a for ale at     the cubic inches in an ale gallon and upon the line b is w for wine at     the cubic inches in a wine gallon also si for square inscribed at 0  the side of a square inscribed in a circle whose diameter is   se for square equal at    the side of a square which is equal to the same circle and c for circumference at       the circumference of the same circle  upon the second face or that opposite the first are a slider and four lines marked d c d e at one end and root square root cube at the other the lines c and e containing respectively the squares and cubes of the opposite numbers on the lines d d the radius of d being double to that of a b c and triple to that of e so that whatever the first   on d denotes the first on c is the square of it and the first on e the cube of it so if d begin with   c and e will begin with   but if d begin with  0 c will begin with  00 and e with  000 and so on upon the line c are marked  at0    for the area of the circle whose circumference is  and 0 d at     for the area of the circle whose diameter is   also upon the line d are wg for wine gauge at      and ag for ale gauge at      and mr for malt round at      these three being the gauge points for round or circular measure and are found by dividing the square roots of         and    0  by the square root of     also ms for malt square are marked at      the malt gauge point for square measure being the square root of    0   upon the third face are three lines one upon a slider marked n and two on the stock marked ss and sl for segment standing and segment lying which serve for ullaging standing and lying casks  and upon the fourth or opposite face are a scale of inches and three other scales marked spheroid or  st variety  d variety  d variety the scale for the  th or conic variety being on the inside of the slider in the third face the use of these lines is to find the mean diameters of casks  besides all those lines there are two others on the insides of the two first sliders being continued from the one slider to the other the one of these is a scale of inches from    to    and the other is a scale of ale gallons between the corresponding numbers    and     which form a table to show in ale gallons the contents of all cylinders whose diameters are from    to    inches their common altitude being   inch  the use of the gauging rule problem i to multiply two numbers as    and    set   on b to either of the given numbers as    on a then against    on b stands  00 on a which is the product  problem ii to divide one number by another as  00 by    set   on b to    on a then against  00 on a stands    on b for the quotient  problem iii to find a fourth proportional as to      and

proportion as to find a number which shall be to   as the root of   0 to the root of   0 set   on d to   0 on c then against   0 on c stands   on d for the answer  problem ix to find numbers in triplicate proportion as to find a number which shall be to  00 as the cube of    is to the cube of  0 set  0 on d to  00 on e then against    on d stands     on e for the answer  problem x to find numbers in subtriplicate proportion as to find a number which shall be to  0 as the cube root of     is to the cube root of  00  set  0 on d to  00 on e then against     on e stands    on d for the answer  problem xi to compute malt bushels by the line md as to find the malt bushels in the couch floor or cistern whose length is   0 breadth     and depth    inches  set   0 on b to    on md then against     on a stands     bushels on b for the answer  note the uses of the other marks on the rule will appear in the examples farther on  of the gauging or diagonal rod the diagonal rod is a square rule having four faces being commonly   feet long and folding together by joints this instrument is used both for gauging or measuring casks and computing their contents and that from one dimension only namely the diagonal of the cask or the length from the middle of the bunghole to the meeting of the head of the cask with the stave opposite to the bung and is the longest line that can be drawn within the cask from the middle of the bung and accordingly on one face of the rule is a scale of inches for measuring this diagonal to which are placed the areas in ale gallons of circles to the corresponding diameters in like manner as the lines on the under sides of the three slides in the sliding rule  on the opposite face are two scales of ale and wine gallons expressing the contents of casks having the corresponding diagonals and these are the lines which chiefly form the difference between this instrument and the sliding rule for all their other lines are the same and to be used

weighs just  000 ounces avoirdupois the numbers in this table express not only the specific gravities of the several bodies but also the weight of a cubic foot of each in avoirdupois ounces and thence by proportion the weight of any other quantity or the quantity of any other weight may be known as in the following problems  problem i to find the magnitude of any body from its weight as the tabular specific gravity of the body is to its weight in avoirdupois ounces so is one cubic foot or      cubic inches to its content in feet or inches respectively examples    required the content of an

weight lost in water then  as the weight lost in water is to the whole weight so is the specific gravity of water to the specific gravity of the body example  a piece of stone weighed  0lb but in water only  lb required its specific gravity    case   when the body is lighter than water so that it will not quite sink assix to it a piece of another body heavier than water so that the mass compounded of the two may sink together weigh the heavier body and the compound mass separately both in water and out of it then find how much each loses in water by subtracting its weight in water from its weight in air and subtract the less of these remainders from the greater then  as this last remainder is to the weight of the light body in air so is the specific gravity of water to the specific gravity of the body example  suppose a piece of elm weighs   lb in air and that a piece of copper which weighs   lb in air and   lb in water is affixed to it and that the compound weighs  lb

in the foregoing table each number in the column of area seg is the area of the circular segment whose height or the versed fine of its half are is the number immediately on the left of it in the column of heights the diameter of the circle being   and its whole area        the use of this table is to find by it the area of the segment of any other circle whatever be the diameter and this is done by first dividing the height of any proposed segment by its own diameter and the quotient is a decimal to be sought in the column of heights and against it is the tabular area to be taken out which is similar to the proposed segment then this tabular area being multiplied by the square of the given diameter will be the area of your segment required because similar areas are to each other as the squares of their diameters  example  so if it be required to find the area of a segment of a circle whose height is   the diameter being  0  here  0     0   quot or tab height and the tab seg is0      which multiply by   00 the square of the diam gives       00 the area required  but in dividing the given height by the diameter if the quotient do not terminate in three places of decimals without a fractional remainder then the area for that fractional part ought to be proportioned for thus having found the tabular area answering to the first three decimals of the quotient take the difference between it and the next following tabular area which difference multiply by the fractional remaining part of the quotient and the product will be the corresponding proportional part to be added to the first tabular area  so if the height of a proposed segment were   to the diameter  0  here  0   0   then to0   answers0      the next area is0      their difference is     of which is     which added to0      gives the whole tab area0      and mult by   00 gives the area      000 sought  finis books by the same author lately published   mathematical tables containing the common
