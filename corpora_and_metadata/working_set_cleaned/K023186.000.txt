heart once and but once i caught him in a lie and then unwhippd he had the grace to cry the fault he has i fairly shall reveal could you oerlook but that  it is to steal ille ferat pretium etc if after this you took the graceless lad could you complain my friend he proved so bad faith in such case if you should prosecute i think sir godfry should decide the suit who sent the thief who stole the cash away and punished him that put it in his way dixi me pigrum etc consider then and judge me in this light i told you when i went i could not write you said the same and are you discontent with laws to which you gave your own assent nay worse to ask for verse at such a time do you think me good for nothing but to rhyme luculli miles etc in annas wars a soldier poor and old had dearly earned

full early i begun to read in greek the wrath of peleus son besides my father taught me from a lad the better art to know the good from bad and little sure imported to remove to hunt for truth in maudlins learned grove but knottier points we knew not half so well deprived us soon of our paternal cell and certain laws by suffrers thought unjust denied all posts of profit or of trust hopes after hopes of pious papists failed while mighty williams thundering arm prevailed for right hereditary taxed and fined he stuck to poverty with peace of mind and me the muses helped to undergo it convict a papist he and i a poet but thanks to homer since i live and thrive indebted to no prince or peer alive sure i should want the care of ten dr monroe physician to bedlam hospital monroes if i would scribble rather than repose singula de nobis anni etc years follwing years steal something every day at last they steal us from our selves away in one our frolicks one amusements end in one a mistress drops in one a friend this subtle thief of life this paltry time what will it leave me if it snatch my rhyme if every wheel of that unwearied mill that turned ten thousand verses now stands still

a poet begs me i will hear him read in palaceyard at nine you will find me there  at ten for certain sir in bloomsbrysquare  before the lords at twelve my cause comes on  there is a rehearsal sir exact at one  oh but a wit can study in the streets and raise his mind above the mob he meets not quite so well however as one ought a hackneycoach may chance to spoil a thought and then a nodding beam or pig of lead god knows may hurt the very ablest head have you not seen at guildhalls narrow pass two aldermen dispute it with an ass and peers give way exalted as they are even to their own srv  nce in a carr inunc and versus etc go lofty poet and in such a crowd sing thy sonorous verse  but not aloud alas to grottos and to groves we run to ease and silence every muses son blackmore himself for any grand effort would drink and doze at two villages within   or   miles of london tooting or earlscourt how shall i rhyme in this eternal roar how match the bards whom none ever matched before the man who stretched in isis calm retreat to books and study gives sevn years complete see strowd with learned dust his nightcap on he walks an object new beneath the sun the boys flock round him and

much do i suffer much to keep in peace this jealous waspish wronghead rhiming race and much must flatter if the whim should bite to seek applause by printing what i write but let the fit pass over i am wise enough to stop my ears to their confounded stuff ridentur mala qui componunt etc in vain bad rhimers all mankind reject they treat themselves with most profound respect it is to small purpose that you hold your tongue each praised within is happy all day long but how severely with themselves proceed the men who write such verse as we can read their own strict judges not a word they spare that wants or force or light or weight or care however unwillingly it quits its place nay though at court perhaps it may find grace such they will degrade and sometimes in its stead in downright charity revive the dead mark where a bold expressive phrase appears bright through the rubbish of some hundred years command old words that long have slept to wake such as wise bacon or brave raleigh spoke or bid the new be english ages hence for use will father what is begot by sense pour the full tide of eloquence along serenely pure and yet divinely strong rich with the treasures of each foreign tongue prune the luxuriant the uncouth refine but show no mercy to an empty line then polish all with so much life and ease you think it is nature and a knack to please but ease in writing flows from art not chance as those move easiest who have learned to dance praetulerim scriptor delirus etc if such the plague and pains to write by rule better say i be pleased and play the fool call

equal measure of the soul quocirca mecum loquor haec etc soon as i enter at my country door my mind resumes the thread it dropped before thoughts which at hydeparkcorner i forgot meet and rejoin me in my pensive grott there all alone and compliments apart i ask these sober questions of my heart si tibi nulla sitim etc if when the more you drink the more you crave you tell the doctor when the more you have the more you want why not with equal ease confess as well your folly as disease the heart resolves this matter in a trice men only feel the smart but not the vice si vulnus tibi etc when golden angels cease to cure the evil you give all royal witchcraft to the devil when servile chaplains cry that birth and place indue a peer with honor truth and grace look in that breast most dirty d  be fair say can you find out one such lodger there yet still not heeding what your heart can teach you go to church to hear these flattrers preach indeed could wealth bestow or wit or merit a grain

possessions just the same the case whether you call them villa park or chase alas my bathurst what will they avail join cotswold hills to sapertons fair dale let rising granaries and temples here

as well as keep my heir may sigh and think it want of grace a man so poor would live without a place but sure no statute in his favor says how free or frugal i shall pass my days i who at some times

rage inflame nor fear appall not the black fear of death that saddens all with terrors round can reason hold her throne despise the known nor tremble at the unknown survey both worlds intrepid and entire in spite of witches devils dreams and fire pleased to look forward pleased to look behind and count each birthday with a grateful mind has life no sourness drawn so near its end can thou endure a foe forgive a friend has age but melted the rough parts away as winterfruits grow mild ever they decay or will you think my friend your business done when of a hundred thorns you pull out one vivere
