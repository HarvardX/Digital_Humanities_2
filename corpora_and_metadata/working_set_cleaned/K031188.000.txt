the auction a poem a familiar epistle to a friend with the head of harpocrates the god of silence amongst the egyptians in a ring  london printed for george kearsly at no   ludgate street mdcclxx  advertisement this poem consisted originally of no more than about a hundred and fifty lines and was sent by the author with the head of harpocrates the god of silence in a ring to a particular friend who suggested to him that if it were properly enlarged it might not be unworthy the perusal of the public in consequence of which he has accordingly enlarged it and submits it to their candor and indulgence  if the critic should accuse him of absurdity for giving language to the god of silence he answers there may be times when the actions of men are so palpably absurd and so totally subversive of liberty that even the tongue of silence may become eloquent in its cause  if this subterfuge is too flimsey to pass he flies to the poetica licentia that extensive field of fiction where the poet is allowed to dispose of animation personification or elocution in any manner his fancy directs uncontrouled by the shackles of common sense  that part of the poem where mr holland is

reach of common thought a spring no mortal could suspect if touched produced this strange effect the head would shake the eyes would roll and seeming life possessed the whole to know its history and fame the universal wish became when one in eastern learning skilled the universal wish fulfilled  in ancient times when the rude north  poured her rapacious children forth  when like a widely spreading flood  they deluged all the east with blood  they seized that hapless princes throne  and deemed his revenues their own  some say it still recorded stands  he fell untimely by their hands  but in these days when justice reigns  the horrid tale no credit gains while he proceeded to relate this princes and his countrys fate the messenger the busto bearing returned and begged a patient hearing  soon as said he the spot i gained  where truth and elocution reigned  fronting the chair i took my stand  applying to the spring my hand  shake not said one thy head at me  thou can not say i murdered thee  let not thine eye indignant roll  another cried to fright my soul  a third exclaimed ye shades of night  it is d  w  a hide me from his sight  and now a general terror ran  through all and caught from man to man  i seized the moment of dismay  and came with hasty steps away  when from a prince to empire born  the diadem is basely torn  the wretch who gave the bleeding blow  may well the action disavow  may well should ever his shade appear  to petrifaction turn with fear  but that the unpolluted heart  should thus eccentrically start  that souls as virtues bosom fair  should shake at trifles light as air  shake like the murderer and thief  amazes me beyond belief he ceased and with him all agreed twas strange twas passing strange indeed a group of heads but lately brought from herculaneums dreadful vault gorged when the almighty hid his face and nature trembled to her base came in rotation to be sold and langford thus their history told  these were the men when rome arose  said he with vengeance on her foes  when from the orient to the north  her eagles flew with terror forth  when she to half the world gave law  and kneeling kept the rest in awe  these were the men who brought disgrace  on her and all the roman race  restored what long she sought to gain  by millions spent and thousands slain  and bid her conquering legions cease  bribed by the nations round to peace  twas then the high patrician pride  looked with contempt on all beside  twas then the public treasure went  to serve each infamous intent  twas then corrupt her senate grown  assumed a power before unknown  and freedom by the swelling tear  confessed her dissolution near  twas then her judges warped the laws  to serve the abandoned villains cause  then over a son whose guiltless blood  fast flowed a weeping father stood  the prop of his declining day  snatched by the murdrers arm away  and saw the wretch by vile chicane  escape by whom his son was slain  then justice hid abashed her head  misrule her baleful influence spread  and stalking forth with giant stride  menaced destruction far and wide  at length enraged the people rose  and rushed impetuous on their foes  to justice brought them for their crimes  a mark to all succeeding times  and lo beneath the sculptors hand  consigned to infamy they stand all looked astonished at the tale some blushed and some turned sickly pale when one intelligent of soul thus feelingly addressed the whole  would you my countrymen but cast  a retrospect on centrys past  would you explore the historic page  transmitted down from age to age  then would you feel without alloy  the many blessings you enjoy  thrice happy england happy plains  where justice dwells and freedom reigns  where round a virtuous monarch stand  a glorious patriotic band  watchful and firm with argus eyes  to guard her laws against surprise  where grafton ever honored name  immortal on the roll of fame  who like an atlas bears the weight  attendant on a mighty state  never leaves the council never attends  newmarket and his jockeyfriends  who when the fascinating die  bids ample patrimonies fly  never mingles in the guilty train  damned to variety of pain  where grafton stands unawed by fear  though faction thunder in his ear  let fear the guilty mind deform  the virtuous man defies the storm  where bedford whose exalted breast  is by fair freedoms love impressed  to whom hibernias sons shall raise  the voice of unabating praise  who when the laurel once the boast  of britains nervous sons was lost  bid war with all his horrors cease  and gave his vanquished country peace  refused all profit for himself  superior to the love of pelf  all save a snuff box trifling thing  presented by the gallic king  where bedford stands beyond the reach  of those who dare his fame impeach  contemns the shafts around him hurled  and scorns the malice of the world  where virtuous mansfield first and best  of orators by all confessed  whose firm undeviating heart  from rectitude shall never depart  but who an angel might believe  if he attempted to deceive  who in the gay convivial hour  when wine prevails over reasons power  has seen his friends drink copious streams  in healths to charley and to james  has seen them on their knees implore  high heaven their s  n to restore  yet has refused the knee to bend  solicited by every friend  and nobly scorned the guilty wine  true to the hanoverian line  where mansfield stands o glorious cause  to guard and to explain her laws  laws which our ancestors obtained  when john and either henry

them from his sire  o it is a theme on which to dwell  with pleasure makes each artry swell  extatick to the last degree  britannias highborn sons to see  with fond parental care secure  her laws inviolably pure  but for those grinning traitors there  condemned their countrys hate to bear  take them my friend o take them hence  and with another lot commence next came an old historic piece which rivaled all the works of greece the story was so well portrayd assisted so by light and shade that even the most consummate dunce might know the history at once the hero of the canvas stood in many a different attitude first in the senate he appeared and seemed with much attention heard then as a minister of state he scowld around with pride elate next stood an army in array which he appeared employed to pay one hand in business nicely skilled performed that office tother filled a coffer of enormous size on which he looked with jealous eyes near this again he stood confessed a tempting coronet his crest the sure the neverfailing boast of those who serve their country most but last disgraceful situation accused by all of peculation abandoned and detested grown he safety sought behind a throne whether the people dragged him thence to pay for his supposed offense or suffered him secure to stay the painters art forbore to say forbore on purpose i presume to give imagination room still were the tints so fresh and fair though painted many a hundred year the preservation still so nice twas sold at an enormous price its fate extremely odd appeared when from the buyers lips we heard  twas bought alone to decorate  the room where traitors to the state  for manifold offenses lie  before they on the scaffold die last came an urn which l  gf  d feigned was carved when good aurelius reigned but which to me and all appeared the work of days far less revered full in the front in bassrelief romes colonies oerwhelmd with grief were seen whilst commerce trembling stood and feared again to tempt the flood in alto on the other side enthroned oppression sat and pride corruption near them held her seat and freedom crouchd beneath their feet whilst faction bursting from her cell encouraged millions to rebel around this motto struck the eye the sad remains of liberty who for so many ages spurned tyrannic rage behold inurnd cut off o most unhallowed deed when least of all she feared to bleed much said the auctioneer to raise the price and credit of the vase twas he declared no modern bauble but an etruscan veritable and fit so capital a thing fit for the palace of a king when one distinguished from the crowd whose genius was by all allowed superior to the common herd on his own knowledge thus declared  this curious vase exceeding like  in all respects the true antique  is made my friends of modern clay  by artists of the present day  i know them perfectly could teach  the name and character of each  could tell how all their lives were spent  to bring about this blessed event  who mixed the clay who formed the urn  who bid the flame so fiercely burn  with life whose hand each figure crowned  and who inscribed the motto round  but it is enough for me to prove  excited by my countrys love  to prove of equal rank in fame  the ancient and the modern name  he sent it to saint stephens fane  where liberty was wont to reign  and said though she be banished thence  her ashes cannot give offense  when all the catalogue was sold  bust urn and picture turned to gold  by l  ds art who said his say  in his obliging smiling way  i hapless i who tell the tale  was offered up to public sale  silence a lady cried for shame  silence indeed i hate the name an empty prating fool replied  madam with you i coincide  and so do i replied a brother another still and still another replied the same and all the cry was who the duce would silence buy  no bidders l  d knocked me down  to a jewbroker for a crown  who with small interest content  sold me for ten times ten per cent  from him twas my mishap to pass  into a virtuosos glass  near whose abode a structure stands  where men from the remotest lands  of indiscriminate degrees  all buz and gather round like bees  where christians jews and turks confound  language in undistinguished sound  behind it stands that famous place  where modesty never shows her face  where ignorance if she chance to come  is certainly sent wadling home  whose lawless sons avow this creed  by lies and fraud we best succeed  and meet tumultuous every day  on each unwary fool to prey  offended thus my eyes and ears  out burst involuntary tears  my long invelopd tongue i tried  nor found the use of speech denied  said i o  if thy breast  compassion feels for the distressed  if when the heartdepressing sigh  has burst the sluices of the eye  thy soul susceptible has known  concern for sorrows not thy own  surely thou will with pity hear  nor treat contemptuously my prayer  deliver me for thou art able  from this detested modern babel he listened with astonished ear the tongue of silence thus to hear and while his breast with anger burned thus with severity returned  dare thou presumptuously defame  this spot by that opprobrious name  where matchless beauty every day  shines forth with undiminishd ray  where merchants meet of genuine worth  from the four quarters of the earth  men who expand the golden sail  of commerce to the rising gale  bring tides of wealth in copious streams  along the bosom of the thames  and bid augusta in the eyes  of all the grand emporium rise  dare thou presumptuously reflect  on such a place with disrespect said i ah little did i dread  to draw thy vengeance on my head  else had consummate silence hung  for ever on my hapless tongue  but how shall misery find relief  if she neglect to tell her grief  how shall the wretch oppressed with woe  emerge if none his sorrows know  i hoped in some sequestered cot  such as thou often have wished thy lot  beside a stream and sylvan shade  thou kindly would have seen me laid  or to some friend to sense and thee  who when from follys children free  glad from the bustling world retreats  and science in his study meets  thou would my person have consigned  in mercy to my tortured mind  let then compassion in thine eye  assure me thou will yet comply  let anger in thy bosom cease  and give me once again to peace  and now his stubborn soul subdued  no longer was my prayer withstood when kindly he o cease to grieve  i pity thee and will relieve  i have harpocrates a friend  who never will thy ear offend  dumb i presume not he indeed  he talks as fast as i can read  but then his tongue flows smoothly on  with sense in perfect unison  go to him give my compliments  assure him why thou come and whence  tell all thy tale nay do not linger  and beg he will wear thee on his finger finis
