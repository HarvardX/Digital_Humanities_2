an address to the people of england being the protest of a private person against every suspension of law that is liable to injure or endanger personal security  wherein is shown that the claim of personal protection and relief from unjust imprisonment by due process of the law and that without delay is a common right so indispensably due to all innocent persons that it cannot be set aside or withdrawn from any that are so who demand it without fundamentally subverting the political constitution or legal establishment of these kingdoms and thereby rendering the advisers and promoters of such a measure guilty of high treason  it is the duty of every individual whatsoever to aid peace and public justice  agreeable to a maxim of the law  unusquisque paci et justitiae publicae tenetur succurrere those men who set aside or suspend the law of the land do thereby incur a perpetual stain of infamy  for it is a fundamental maxim of the constitution   legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt london printed in the year mdcclxxviii  to the people of england common charity will induce us to believe that the advocates for an occasional suspension of the habeas corpus laws are not really aware of the dangerous tendency of such a measure and therefore when the author of this protest in the following pages charges the advisers and promoters of the suspension with high treason against the king and state he professes to aim the severity of his censure chiefly against the measure itself in order to express the real danger and malignity of its effect rather than against the persons of those men who inadvertently or through inattention to the fundamental or indispensable principles of law have promoted it and therefore to those persons jointly with all the other people of england as being equally interested with the rest in the effects of such a measure the author of this protest now addresses himself not to promote a spirit of vengeance and personal resentment but merely for the purposes of warning and instruction to all parties that they may cordially unite in restoring the due limitations of government on which depends the common safety both of king and people  the advocates for an occasional suspension of the law perhaps will allege that the new temporary powers whatever they may happen to be which would thereby be thrown into the hands of the persons entrusted with the administration of government are by no means intended to take effect against the people of england that are resient in this island but only against such persons as have been guilty of treason in foreign parts in america let us suppose for instance or on the high seas or for piracy and therefore they conceive that the free inhabitants of this island could not be injured by so limited a suspension of the laws especially if they should admit in their bill an additional clause of limitation proposed even by an opposite party by way of security which we will suppose to be couched in the following terms viz that nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to extend to the case of any other prisoner or prisoners than such as shall have been out of the realm at the time or times of the offense or offenses wherewith he or they shall be charged or of which they shall be suspected such a clause as this seems on a slight examination to secure the inhabitants of this island from the danger of an unlimited power against which all true englishmen ought to be ever upon their guard but alas so dangerous is it to stop the ordinary course of justice and common right or to alter the due process of the law in any cases whatsoever wherein personal liberty the highest and most valuable temporal object of englishmen is concerned that if we should suppose the case of such a suspension of the laws as courtiers in general would endeavor to obtain were they to be entrusted with the compiling of a bill for that purpose and then carefully compare the said supposed bill with the abovementioned clause of limitation we should soon have reason to be convinced that the security of the latter is only imaginary and that multitudes of his majestys innocent and peaceable subjects would be still liable to be oppressed and be denied the benefits of public justice and common right by such a suspension of law if they should happen to incur the displeasure of persons in power or be misrepresented to them by any secret enemy  the proposed clause leaves unprotected all the nobility gentry and other persons whatsoever that have made any excursions into france italy germany flanders etc or even to ireland ever since the commencement of the troubles whatever they might be which occasioned an imaginary necessity or plea for suspending the laws and this perhaps might be extended three or four years back and might thereby exclude from the protection of the limiting clause a great multitude of the most respectable people of the kingdom who might happen to have traveled abroad during such a period neither does the clause protect the merchants traders and other persons that have arrived from the west indies ireland or any other country within such a supposed period and they are surely too numerous and respectable a body to be thus outlawed  add to this that all seafaring persons without exception though they are the most valuable subjects of this maritime state would be left unprotected by such a clause and of course would be rendered subject to the unlimited will of man arbitrium hominis which is the true definition of arbitrary power instead of law and lastly all other persons whatsoever are liable to suffer the same inconveniences if they have not kept a diary or have not memory or memorandums to enable them to produce sufficient evidence of their being actually within this realm at any period of time that might be fixed upon within the last three or four years so that not only persons seized and taken out of the realm would be made liable to the effects of such a suspending act but all the other persons abovementioned though they are actually resient within the realm  in order to state the case for my argument as clearly as i am able i have here supposed the adoption of such a suspending bill as we might naturally conceive to be proposed by any set of men in power who are warmed by the sunshine of courtfavour till they forget that their own real interest is inseparably connected with that of the public and that the increase of power which they promote may possibly fall into some other hands than their own but the hands of government must be strengthened they would probably say and for this purpose they would be very apt to insert in their bill some discretionary powers to enable the king and his ministers to imprison not only persons seized and taken out of the realm but also persons who shall be committed in any part of his majestys dominions for the said crimes i mean any crimes which i have before supposed in stating this case viz high treason in any of his majestys colonies or plantations in america or on the high seas which will include our own coasts any where beyond low water mark or the crime of piracy without any description or limitation of place whatsoever so that if any innocent man who happens not to be able to prove an alibi for every day and even every hour since these troubles began should be maliciously charged with the crime of treason or piracy committed within half a mile of the british coasts he may be seized and imprisoned without bail or mainprize at the will and pleasure of the king and council for many months and at the expiration of the limited time without any farther examination or opportunity of being heard at all by his country his term of confinement is prolonged by another such act and perhaps another after that as evil examples beget others till the time of his relief by due process of the law becomes totally uncertain and indefinite  a deplorable condition this which in our common law is deemed wretched slavery  for misera est servitus says the maxim ubi jus est vagum aut incertum  principia leg and aeq p     but the condition of the deluded subjects will be rendered still more completely uncertain and wretched if the compilers of the supposed suspending act should endeavor to avail themselves of vague terms and expressions  for instance  in the body of the bill  such crimes referring to the crimes particularly named in the former part instead of the said crimes  for as nullum simile est idem   like is not the same  the expression such crimes signifies only similar crimes and not the same crimes before expressed whereby the power of the act would be liable to an arbitrary extension at the will of the magistrate  whenever persons in power cease to be duly limited by a free parliament they will pay but very little regard to the grossness of the propositions which they tender to that once august assembly and therefore if such an illegal power should ever be usurped by any set of men we may then expect to find many more vague expressions in our public acts  we may in that case without improbability suppose the penning of a suspending act to be  not only for such crimes or any of them  but also for suspicion of such crimes or any of them by any magistrate etc viz any trading magistrate pensioned middlesex justice or other wretched timeserver that may happen to be entrusted with a power of committing to prison  and in such times it will afford a sufficient handle against any person whatsoever if they are but charged with such crimes whether they be guilty of them or not or even if they be but charged with the suspicion of such crimes or any of them by any magistrate etc  nothing more arbitrary or capricious can easily be described and yet alas my supposed bill by no means exceeds the bounds of probability for when the baneful practice of bribery becomes triumphant and the very foundations of government are thoroughly corrupted we may expect that probability will still go farther and that the above supposed extraordinary powers will be farther augmented by a non obstante to trample down at once not only the habeas corpus act but all the other fences of british liberty national justice and common right on which the safety of englishmen depends viz any law statute or usage to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding  the clause is indeed a common one for the repeal of useless or indifferent matters but when the effect extends to annul all the laws of personal protection and the common right of englishmen to the due process of the law which is to be tried without delay by their country per legem terrae and if innocent to be restored to freedom  such a suspension i say of common justice and common right is so fundamentally subversive of the british constitution of state that no authority of parliament can make it legal because it it is high treason against the king and people and all the abettors and promoters of such an act would thereby render themselves eternally infamous in the eye of the law  which is declared by a constitutional maxim  legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt   inst p      those men who set aside the law of the land which is certainly the case of those who vote for suspending it do thereby incur a perpetual stain of infamy  if ever such an act therefore should subsist and the promoters of it remain in power british subjects may amuse themselves with the name of freedom if they please but they will have no more real and just right to boast of their liberty than the subjects of france or prussia for they would then be involved exactly in the same uncertain and precarious condition and though they might not perhaps for some considerable time afterward begin to feel the pernicious effects of a government unlimited by law yet that would not render their condition less base or slavish for our common law has already stated the condition of such as an outlawed people  res est misera ubi jus est vagum grounds and rudiments of law and equity p  0   wretched is the state of affairs wherever common right is vague and uncertain  nay it is downright slavery as declared by another maxim already cited in p     the learned sir robert atkins formerly one of the judges of the common pleas has remarked concerning the popes exercise of his power of dispensing or rather of suspending laws by virtue of such a non obstante that it was used with some moderation at first in cases that seemed to be of great necessity only but at last by degrees it grew to be intolerable and unlimited see his parliamentary and political tracts p     and surely we ought to be equally jealous of every claim or pretension to omnipotence or unlimited power whenever and by whomsoever it is made though we do not immediately feel the baneful effects of it  there are but too many advocates for the imaginary omnipotence or unlimited power of parliament  true it is that the same persons who are entrusted with authority to make laws are entrusted likewise with authority to suspend or repeal them but in this without the least detriment to their just liberty and free privileges they are not without limitation even liberty itself is limited and submits to the same sort of definition for liberty says an old and eminent lawwriter is not a power to act quidquid libet what we list for this may be licentious and a lust or passion may enslave a man or men as much as any chain or fetter but quod licet what is just and rational rights of the kingdom p     and in the preceding page speaking expressly of the house of commons or parliaments he says  when they are freest they have limits for they be not infinite nay when they are most free they are most bound to good orders and to right reason the truth of this doctrine is unquestionable for if a parliament or legislative power of any kind regal or popular presume to enact ordinances which oppose or in any respect set aside natural justice or the common right of innocent persons and shall claim an authority or privilege to do so which is ignorantly and vainly called omnipotence of parliament the said power ceases to be a legal power because it casts off the restraint and government of gods indispensable laws and thereby becomes excommunicated from god  shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which frames mischief by a law psalm xciv  0  a due consideration of this ought to restrain the modern rage of actmaking for it is laid down in that ancient and respectable lawbook called fleta that the power of right  or justice is of god alone but the power of wrong or injury is of the devil and the works of whichsoever of these two viz of god or of the devil he shall do  speaking of the agency of a king and the same may surely be said also of a parliament of him he is the servant potestas enim juris solius est dei injuriae vero diaboli et cujus opera fecerit ejus et minister erit fleta c xvii p    and to this doctrine as an unquestionable truth that illustrious lawyer henry de bracton who was a judge in this realm above   0 years ago has made the following addition  therefore  says he still speaking of a king while he does justice he is the vicar of the eternal king but he is the servant of the devil while he declines to injustice or wrong quia illa potestas potestas juris solius dei est potestas autem injuriae diaboli et non dei et cujus horum opera fecerit rex ejus minister erit cujus opera fecerit and then follows the addition quoted above igitur dum facit justitiam vicarius est regis aeterni minister autem diaboli dum declinet ad injuriam bract lib iii c   p  0  and in like manner a parliament or the persons entrusted with the power of legislation are to be esteemed as the servants of the devil and as enemies to god while they promote or establish any notorious injustice for know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness romans vi     many laws there are which belong to god as well as man and which are therefore to be esteemed as parts of the eternal law ie the will of god that all things be moved and directed to a good and proper end a perpetual and constant will to give to every one his right lex aeterna nihil aliud est quam ipsa summa ratio gubernationis rerum in deo sive illa summa ratio divinae sapientiae qua vult deus omnia a se condita moveri et dirigi ad bonum et debitum finem  etc and again lex aeterna sub alia descriptione dicitur perpetua et constans voluntas jus suum unicuique tribuens etc doct et stud c i p   and no right can be more sacred than the right of an innocent man to obtain freedom by due process of the law from duress and unjust imprisonment for liberty is inestimable  libertas est res inestimabilis jenk cent    and is planted by god in the very nature of man  libertas a deo hominis est indita naturae fortescu de laud leg ang    so that human nature entreats or implores favor in the cause of liberty more than in any other cause  humana natura in libertatis causa favorem semper magis quam in aliis causis deprecetur etc ib c xlvii p  0  and consequently the man who does not favor the cause of liberty is already condemned in our common law as impious and cruel impius et crudelis judicandus est qui libertati non favet co lit     and in like manner every act of parliament or statute which is unfavourable thereto by reducing freedom and augmenting slavery must necessarily be esteemed equally obnoxious and inimical to god and man  for crudelis etiam necessario judicabitur lex quae servitutem augmentat et minuit libertatem fortescu c    and as this will of god respecting the right of men is in the above quotation declared to be perpetual and constant it necessarily follows that no human authority upon earth can suspend or annul any part of the eternal law without grievous sin for our first allegiance is made in baptism to god and his laws and the latter consist not merely in the written injunctions of divine revelation which we call the scriptures but also in reason and natural justice the knowledge of which though it is a divine attribute is inherited by mankind in general and written in their hearts scribiturque haec lex lex rationis in cord cujuslibet hominis docens eum quid agendum et quid fugiendum unde dicit apostolus ad romanos secundo omnes gentes qui legem s scriptam non habent naturaliter ea quae legis suni faciunt hujusmodi legem non habentes ipsi sibi sunt lex qui ostendunt opus legis scriptum in cordibus suis testimonium reddente illis conscientia ipsorum et quod lex rationis in cord scribitur ideo deleri non potest nec etiam recepit mutationem ex loco nec tempore sed ubique et inter omnes homines servari debet nam jura naturalia immutabilia sunt etc doct et stud c ii p   or else there could be no such thing as the imputation of sin the law of reason is therefore justly esteemed the first foundation of the laws of england  primum fundamentum legis angliae est lex rationis doct et stud c v p    and the law of reason includes the laws of nature which cannot lawfully be suspended or changed by parliament for our common law declares that they are immutable  jura naturae sunt immutabilia prin leg et aequit p    the laws of nature are unchangeable they cannot therefore be lawfully suspended or changed by parliament neither can any manifest injustice be made lawful for by the same authority we know that lex injusta non est lex an unjust ordinance or act of parliament is not law  no plea of necessity could render such a parliamentary exertion even excuseable for though there are many maxims on this head as necessitas non habet legem and salus populi which even bad legislators will pretend to regard suprema est lex  necessitas facit licitum quod alias non est licitum  necessitas vincet legem yet these can relate only to such laws as are made to remedy inconveniences not in themselves evil mere mala prohibita but cannot authorize any thing that is malum in se for that would be rebellion against god which no case can justify for of those who say let us do evil that good may come the scripture has added whose damnation is just romans iii   fiat justitia ruat coelum is therefore a sound maxim both of law and politics so that no necessity whatever can justify the establishment of any injustice without a remedy and no injustice evil tort wrong or iniquity can be more flagrant or more dangerous to the state than an unnecessary delay of common right and justice to an innocent man whose personal liberty is unjustly invaded for if personal liberty is not secured and protected by equal law no property or other rights whatsoever can have any real value and from thence it arises that the common right of every innocent person to the laws of protection is esteemed our highest and most valuable inheritance for major haereditas venit unicuique nostrum a jure et legibus quam a parentibus a greater inheritance descends to every one of us from the constitutional establishment of right it is called right says the lord coke  nd inst p    because it is the best birthright the subject has for thereby his goods lands wife children his body for it is the birthright and best protection of every honest seaman as well as of all other men life honor and estimation are protected from injury and wrong and then he cites the maxim  major haereditas etc and the laws than from our parents  a non obstante therefore which boldly suspends at once all the ancient constitutional laws of personal protection and leaves an innocent man without a remedy cannot be law being contrary to all that ought to be esteemed law for lex nemini operatur iniquum nemini facit injuriam law works no iniquity to any man does injury to no man and quicquid est contra norman recti est injuria whatever is contrary to the rule of right is injury  and tort a la ley est contrary co lit     wrong is contrary to law and therefore whatever is done contrary to law or makes against law ought to be esteemed as undone  pro infecto habetur says the maxim quod contra legem fit pro infecto habetur so that the examples that have been cited as precedents for suspending the laws of liberty and protection are no precedents of justification for the legislative power of dispensing with laws extends only to those laws which relate to mala prohibita as i have before remarked dispensatio est mali prohibiti provida relaxatio utilitate communi pensata and cannot effect the laws of natural justice and common constitutional right because an act of parliament for any such purpose must be a malum in se and consequently is null and void in itself  the king has no power nor can be allowed any power to defer postpone or suspend that equal and right justice which is due by inheritance to all british subjects to common sailors as well as others without respect of persons because the king subscribed magna charta when he received the holy sacrament at his coronation of which the author of this protest is an eyewitness being very near the kings person at that time whereby he has promised before god and the people that he will delay or deny to none right or justice  nulli negabimus aut differemus justitiam vel rectum cap xxix so that this excludes all power of suspending any of the laws on which justice or right depend the king therefore must neither delay justice himself nor be in any way instrumental in preventing his judges from proceeding to do justice according to magna charta and the other ancient and fundamental laws of the land for the judges are also sworn to deny to no man common right by the kings letters nor none other mans nor for none other cause see the oath made    edward iii kebles statutes p   0 this wary expression in the oath viz for none other cause excludes all possibility of admitting any exception whatsoever so that the sworn judges are so bound to god the king and the people for they are sworn to serve the people ye shall swear and well and lawfully ye shall serve our lord the king and his people in the office of justice etc as well as the king that they must not obey even an act of parliament which sets aside this matter of common right i mean the common right of personal liberty to all ranks of men that are innocent from crimes and free from debt  some worthy men zealous for the privileges of parliament are indeed unwilling to admit this seeming independence of the judges in the administration of justice or common right which by their oaths they are to deny to no man but the just privileges of parliament never can be injured by the independence of the judges in this single point because if a judge is so scrupulous or conscientious that he refuses to enforce or obey an unjust statute it is still in the power of parliament to impeach or discharge him from his office for disobedience so that the loss would fall only upon the honest and worthy judge though the dishonor of the injustice would rest where it began nevertheless while judges remain in office they must not acknowledge any obligation superior to that which they owe to natural justice and the laws of god for they are bound to god as i have already remarked by the nature of their office as well as to the king and the people though this first and most binding obligation is not expressed in their oath yet the scripture says the judgment is gods deuteronomy i    and again ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment   chronicles ix   and therefore neither the judges nor the king himself are to be accounted laymen but ministers of god for righteousness justice and judgment  by the two latter in the present case i do not mean penal justice or judgment but the duties of maintaining the common right of innocent persons and of relieving the oppressed these are in a peculiar manner sacred to god and therefore unalienable from the people and not to be suspended by the authority of parliament because the commands of god in these matters are peremptory and can admit of no exceptions  thus says the lord jehovah keep ye judgment and do justice isaiah lvi   which is diametrically opposite to the measure of suspending or postponing them and again  keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy god continually or always hos xii   so that there never can be any time of danger or difficulty so pressing and urgent as to justify the plea of a necessity for the suspension of justice and judgment when demanded by innocent persons under illegal restraint or duress for prisoners that are really guilty will not demand judgment by writs of habeas corpus for fear of the penal statutes and even if such prisoners trusting at any time to the want of sufficient evidence against them should demand judgment and thereby escape yet it is better that ten offenders should escape penal justice than that one innocent man should suffer by the denial or suspension of common right  melius est ut december noxii evadant quam ut unus innocens pereat  for herein the difference between the sort of justice and judgment for which i contend and penal justice which may be suspended by competent authority is manifested viz that the righteous judge of all the world declared himself willing to suspend his penal judgment against a whole nation of notorious convicted offenders rather than he would involve ten innocent persons in their destruction if so many could have been found among them this sentiment of divine justice was revealed for our instruction to a man who was honored with the testimony of being inclined to keep the way of the lord  and the way of the lord as the following words declare is  to do justice and judgment genesis xviii       the suspension therefore of justice and judgment from innocent persons is plainly the reverse of keeping the way of the lord wherefore  let it suffice you o princes of israel remove violence and spoil and execute judgment and justice which is the very reverse of suspending them take away your exactions from my people says the lord ezekiel xlv    cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment righten the oppressed for this is plainly the kind of judgment which in the former texts god has commanded men to keep and which therefore ought never to be suspended judge the fatherless plead for the widow isaiah i        it is also necessary to remark the divine testimony against those who suspended or did not keep justice and judgment but on the contrary devised wicked ordinances  they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spiders web etc all which may well be said of those who enact wicked statutes to ensnare and oppress the people and again the act of violence is in their hands their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings meaning no legal judgment or due process of the law for the hebrew word is  properly signifying a legal decision as  also signifies a judge they have made them crooked paths which may surely be said of wicked or unjust laws but more especially of any law to suspend or annul the law itself whosoever goes therein shall not know peace therefore is judgment far from us  meaning that the due process of the law or proper legal decision is far from us for it is the same hebrew word as before neither does righteousness in the common version it is rendered  neither does justice overtake us which is liable to be understood in a contrary sense from the original as if it referred to penal justice whereas the hebrew word is  properly righteousness which as it is due to all men may justly be understood to signify that which in our english law is called common right  or common right reach us etc isaiah lix      and again the   th and   th verses of the same chapter demonstrate that what i have already cited from it relates to the failure of justice and judgment or the suspension of due legal process and judgment said the prophet is turned away backward and justice or rather common right as i have before remarked for the hebrew word is  righteousness stands afar off for truth is fallen in the street  i e the truth of conviction or acquittal by legal process is fallen and equity cannot enter which must generally be the case when will is set up above law but hear the prophet yes truth says he fails and he that departs from evil makes himself a prey or as we read in the margin is accounted mad ie in the opinion of those detestable politicians who do evil that good may come and the lord jehovah saw and it displeased him that there was no judgment   so that it can never be either lawful or expedient to remove the due process of the law from the reach of innocent persons by suspension or in any other manner and he saw that there was no man that is  no man to stand in the gap for the defense of his eternal law which is explained by the  th verse  none calls for justice  more properly for righteousness or the common right of the people nor any pleads for truth etc neither prince prelate nor judge it seems were inclined to enter a protest in favor of immutable justice and right  horrible depravity and he the almighty wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breast plate and an helmet of salvation i e in behalf of the poor and those that were unjustly oppressed upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak and then follows the law of retribution according to their deeds accordingly he will repay  fury to his adversaries recompense or retribution to his enemies to the islands he will repay retribution where then if we have any belief in gods eternal law is the boasted omnipotence of parliament or who can be truly loyal in the proper sense of that epithet but those who acknowledge that the former is unchangeable and that common right and the justice due to innocent persons can never be suspended without rebellion against god for there is no salvation for man without charity and our common law teaches us  that the highest  and therefore the most indispensable charity is to do justice to all and every single soul at all times  so that a time of necessity i mean such a time as is generally called so will afford but a poor excuse for so notorious a breach of this first principle of charity summa caritas est facere justitiam singulis et omnibus omni tempore  my countrymen in general i fear are too depraved to bear all the truths of my remonstrance but i cannot now be silent without guilt  many are the limitations of the law of reason too numerous to be here recited which necessarily annul all acts of legislature that unhappily exceed them against this law i e the law of reason prescription statute nor custom may not prevail and if any be brought in against it they be not prescriptions statutes nor customs but  corruptelae corruptions et contra eam viz legem rationis non est praescriptio vel ad appositum statutum sive consuetudo et si aliqua fiant non sunt statuta sive consuetudines sed corruptelae doct et stud c ii p   ed at  things void and against justice doct et stud eng ed      p   if the first foundation of the english law already mentioned in p    be duly regarded and the second foundation of our excellent legal establishment acknowledges no fewer limitations of legislature than there are divine precepts of morality and justice in the holy scriptures for the second foundation of the law of england is the law of god against which the haughty omnipotence of parliament the pope of england has not the least authority to ordain any thing insomuch that if any statute is set forth against them it ought to be esteemed of no force in the law of england  etiam si aliquod statutum esse editum contra eos probably miswritten for eas leges divinas or eam legem divinam nullius vigoris in legibus angliae censeri debet etc doct et stud c vi p    b for if foundations are removed the whole fabric of our law and political constitution must precipitate into destruction  i appeal to the judges themselves for the truths which i here assert they know the foundations of our law they know that there are many maxims of a superior order by maxims of a superior order i mean those inevitable and necessary conclusions of reason which belong to the first foundation of english law for though these may be justly included also in the fourth foundation of our law under the general head of maxims yet they ought to be duly distinguished from those less obvious maxims which relate only to the general customs of the kingdom and have no claim to be ranked higher than the fourth foundation which bear ample testimony to my doctrine that justice or common right can never be suspended without subverting the legal constitution of this kingdom  si a jure discedas vagus eris et erunt omnia omnibus incerta if you depart from common right you will become vague or unsettled and all things will be uncertain to all men co lit     and res est misera  misera est servitus ubi jus est vagum aut incertum affairs are in a wretched state  nay it is deplorable slavery wherever justice or common right is vague or uncertain   inst     wherefore  justitia nemini neganda est justice must be denied to no man justitia est cuilibet facienda justice must be done to every man whatsoever injusticia non est alicui facienda injustice must not be done to any man whatsoever justitia non est neganda non differenda justice must neither be denied nor delayed i e nor suspended jenk cent     and therefore no plea of necessity whatever can excuse so great an evil as a suspension of justice or common right this is confirmed also by another maxim  melius est omnia mala pati quam malo consentire it is better to endure all adversities than to assert to one evil measure   inst    how much soever any particular man in authority may be either inclined or think himself obliged to accommodate his opinion to the present times of violence and injustice yet i flatter myself that there is not a single judge in the kingdom who will venture to set his face against these indispensable conclusions of reason and therefore to the judges i have appealed for the truth of my assertion that every act of parliament which contains any thing in it contrary to these first principles of reason and honesty is null and void  is a corruption and not law for statutes  nec contra rationem nec contra legem divinam existunt statutes cannot exist either against reason or the law divine doct et stud c  0 de diversis statutis because hae duae leges declinari non possunt because these two laws the law of reason and the law of god cannot abate or turn aside ib c    and because the holy scriptures denounce woe against the makers of unjust laws  woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees or laws and write grievousness which they have prescribed to turn aside the needy from judgment which in israel was a judgment of peers the judgment of the congregation and to take away the right  or rather the judgment or process of the law for the hebrew word is  from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless and then follows the retribution which proves that there never can be any necessity for injustice and what will you do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far to whom will you flee for help and where will ye leave your glory or in the plural your honors isai x       no necessity therefore whatever can justify the adoption of an unrighteous or unjust measure by any legislature upon earth because no danger or evil whatsoever is so much to be dreaded as gods vengeance for the failure of justice judgment and righteousness and therefore common right and equal justice which belong to god for the good of his people are so interwoven and united with the legal constitution of these kingdoms that to set them aside by public authority amounts to a total subversion of the common law and of course to the legal constitution of these kingdoms which no act of parliament can effect for that with respect to the legislature would be a sort of felo de se whatever is destructive of the law cannot itself be law for then the law would be felo de se lex quae leges avertit ipsa lex esse non potest a thing divided against itself and therefore will not stand uhi non est pudor nec cura juris instabile regnum est judge atkins p     a crime of the highest treason in all who voted for it for which they are liable to be impeached by the great body of the nation in case a political reformation should take place and precedents are not wanting for inflicting capital punishment on judges for enforcing unjust laws though the same had obtained the sanction of parliament to submit the operation of law to the will of the king and council which is done by this supposed act that no judge or justice of peace shall bail or try any such person or persons without order from his majestys most honorable privy council etc any law statute usage etc notwithstanding boldly subverting at once the whole legal constitution  would tend to annul even the kings authority for it is laid down as an established principle of the british constitution by one of the best authorities in our common law that there is no king where will rules and not law non est enim rex ubi dominatur voluntas et non lex so that a king of england ceases to be king when he ceases to be limited by the law as another old constitutional maxim also informs us the law is the most high inheritance that the king has for if the law was not there would be no king nor inheritance le ley est le plus haute inheritance que le roi ad car par la ley ilmeme et tous ses sujets sont rules et si le ley ne fuit null roi et null inheritance sera year book    hen vi    and another maxim says cessa regnare si non vis judicare cease to reign if you will not do justice  the king therefore must not deny or delay common right and the insertion of a non obstante to set aside at once all the laws statutes and usages of the kingdom respecting the personal protection of the subject is a manifest subversion of our legal constitution and consequently is high treason against the king as well as against the state and the latter is declared to be no less a crime than the former  non minor est proditio legis quam regem velle perdere  so that such an attempt against the law is not only a most dangerous undermining of the kings crown and dignity but the highest act of treason and disloyalty in the strictest sense of the word as no man can be loyal who votes for a general suspension of all the laws and fences of that most valuable right of the subject the right to personal liberty  such a suspension of law is too similar to that non obstante of pope innocent iv whereby as the proctors of king henry iii declared common right was annulled and authentic records rendered void  per quam jus pro nihilo habetur et authentica scripta enervantur judge atkins parl tracts p     and the same learned judge remarks that it is part of the description given of antichrist by the prophet daniel c   he shall think that he may change times and laws and they shall be given into his hands p     in the following paragraph he also cites bp jewels exposition upon the epistle to the thessalonians fol     viz antichrist says the bishop is there called  a man without order or law that man of sin which is one of the peculiar notes of antichrist he shall seek to be free and go at liberty he shall be tied to no law neither of god nor man hence it is said of the pope that he is solutus omni lege humana in iis quae vult est ei pro ratione voluntas nec est qui dicat illi domine cur ita facis ille potest supra jus dispensare et de injustitia facere justitiam corrigendo jura et mutando  to set up the will and pleasure of man therefore above law or to pretend to give a power to the king or his privy council to suspend the fundamental laws of the kingdom is to render them  lawless and unlimited like the princes and powers of antichrist foretold in the second psalm who say  let us break their bonds asunder and cast away their cords from us viz the bonds of reason law and natural justice and the cords of allegiance to divine authority for to this effect i have seen a remark upon the text by judge atkins though i cannot at present find the passage an act of parliament for so base a purpose as the establishment of an unlimited power is so far from deserving the name of law that it must necessarily be deemed a subversion of law as it sets up the will and pleasure of man king and council above the operation of law contrary to a fundamental principle of the constitution more secure as well as more powerful is the effect or operation of law than the will and pleasure of man firmior et potentior est operatio legis quam dispositio hominis co lit  0  because the man who is allowed more power than is just and equal will affect still more than is allowed cui plus licet quam par est plus vult quam licet   inst      from the unhappy experience of all nations in all ages this established doctrine of our common law may be amply proved and with respect to the supposed act in question it is certainly liable to afford such opportunity and temptation to promote unjust charges against innocent persons arming a particular party with unconstitutional powers of oppression and iniquity to intimidate all honest and independent people that it is manifestly a malum in se as i have said which can never be made lawful nay the whole business is so disloyal that it seems to be nothing less than framing mischief by a law which is the most dangerous as well as most iniquitous mode of oppression because it amounts to an apostasy from god as the scriptures declare shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which forms mischief by a law ps    0 and again woe be to them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed to turn aside the needy from judgment etc the very case in point isaiah x    see pages             and     we are bound by our baptismal vow to renounce the devil and all his works and of course it is our duty to resist and oppose evil to the utmost of our power otherwise we deserve not to be ranked with the servants and soldiers of the prince of peace because he is also the king of righteousness and therefore in a christian community every private person every individual has an undoubted right to detect and protest against every iniquity and injustice even though it shall have obtained the sanction of the public legislature and it is a maxim of the common law that unusquisque paci et justitiae publicae tenetur succurrere but the judges are still more particularly bound both on account of their learning and office to point out and reject every ordinance of man that is contrary to natural justice and the laws of god and so far is it from being their duty to obey or enforce any such laws that the common law has provided them a ready answer for refusing the functions of their office in such cases  contra justitiam nihil possumus for though they are officers of the king and people and sit in the kings judgment seat judging in his name yet their duty respecting common right and natural justice does not depend on the king nor any other but on god alone as i have already remarked for they judge not for man but for the lord etc  d chron xix      and again  ye shall not be afraid of the face of man which excludes all partial influence of kings or any other human powers for the judgment is gods deuteronomy i        and all judges ought to be deeply impressed with that indispensable doctrine of our common law that it is infinitely more heinous to offend eternal than temporal majesty for it is a maxim  gravius est eternam quam temporalem laedere majestatem  thus stands the law of god respecting judges and the law of god is always to be esteemed an unalienable and unchangeable part of the law of england see p        both the king and his judges are sworn as i have already observed p     0 not to delay or deny common right and therefore no danger or other evil whatsoever against which men have ever pleaded a necessity of suspending the laws of protection from innocent persons can be so great an evil or be so imminently dangerous in itself as that very measure of suspension no necessity whatsoever can be so deplorable or so disgracefully injurious to the state as the measure itself and therefore there never can be a necessity for such a measure and the same may be said with unquestionable truth concerning every other measure of oppression and injustice but more particularly may it be said of that other most notorious and iniquitous mode of suspending or rather annulling all the laws of british freedom in the case of seamen i mean the impressing the form of presswarrants and the expressions used therein may perhaps be very ancient and those expressions viz impress and pressmoney perhaps according to the ancient meaning of them may be innocent and legal but no right or prerogative either by usage or prescription is thereby to be presumed in favor of the modern sense in which they are now usually interpreted viz as a warrant to take a man by force to drag him away like a thief to a floating prison the most dangerous and detestable of all others that by imprisonment and duress he may be compelled to enter into an involuntary servitude what is this but a true definition of the most absolute slavery  and yet it is equally true when applied to the case of pressed seamen onboard the tenders and hulks but let us examine by what authority this is done and then judge whether the supposed prerogative is legal the warrant is signed by the lords commissioners of the admiralty and their secretary who claim no other authority in their justification than what is expressed in the beginning of the warrant  viz  in pursuance of his majestys order in council dated  etc etc  now unhappily for the lords of the admiralty and their secretary if they should be duly prosecuted for their misdemeanor neither his majesty nor the privy council neither any of them separately nor all of them together have any legal power to commit or distrain an innocent man of his liberty because all power for any such purposes was taken from them by authority of parliament and the act is still in full force see    cha i c x the purpose of this act is expressly for the regulating the privy council as well as for taking away the court commonly called the star chamber  in the preamble of this act the great charter is cited  that  no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold or liberties etc but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land and also besides several others that inestimable statute of    edw iii cap iii that no man of what estate or condition soever he be shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken nor imprisoned etc without being brought in to answer by due process of law  so that the whole statute of    cha i c x must be construed according to the true spirit of these golden laws of liberty and more especially the  th section of it where we read  that if any person here can be no exception to the prejudice of seamen shall hereafter be committed restrained of his liberty or suffer imprisonment by the order or decree of any such court of star chamber etc mentioning several other courts and then adds or by the command or warrant of the kings majesty his heirs or successors in their own person or by the command or warrant of the councelboard or of any of the lords or others of his majestys privy council that in every such case every person so committed restrained of his liberty or suffering imprisonment  which necessarily includes the case of every person   restrained of his liberty or taken or imprisoned by a presswarrant especially as his majestys order in council which is expressly limited by this act is the only authority cited by the admiralty for issuing such warrants since the clause of non obstante statuto has been declared void in law upon demand or motion made says the act by his counsel or other employed by him for that purpose unto the judges of the court of kings bench or common pleas in open court shall without delay upon any pretense whatsoever for the ordinary dues usually paid for the same have forthwith granted unto him a writ of habeas corpus to be directed generally unto all and every sheriff jailer minister officer or other person in whose custody the party so committed or restrained shall be etc and after describing the mode of making the return to the writ the statute directs the court that they  shall thereupon do what to justice shall appertain either by delivering bailing or remanding the prisoner and if any thing shall be otherwise wilfully done or omitted to be done by any judge justice officer or other person aforementioned contrary to the direction and true meaning hereof necessarily including the true meaning likewise of all the acts recited in the preamble so that if a judge should presume to remand into confinement any man of what estate or condition soever he be that has been taken or imprisoned etc without due process of law that then says the act such person so offending shall forfeit to the party grieved his treble damages to be recovered by such means and in such manner as is formerly in this act limited and appointed for the like penalty to be sued for and recovered etc  in the preamble of the petition of rights   cha i the same noble declarations of british liberty drawn from the ancient statutes against taking and imprisoning a man without due process of the law are expressly recited and confirmed see  d and  th as well as in the lastmentioned act and the judges are likewise expressly directed by both acts to grant writs of habeas corpus for immediate relief from all such illegal imprisonments whether committed by authority of the king or of the privy council so that there are two habeas corpus acts previous to and of equal authority with that which commonly engrosses the title of the habeas corpus act though it is in reality only a supplement to the two former acts being clearly intended to supply all that could be thought insufficient for the security of the subjects liberty in the former acts above recited being entitled   an act for the better securing the liberty of the subject etc see stat    cha ii c ii and therefore whatever may seem doubtful or not sufficiently expletive therein must necessarily be construed in favor of liberty according to the established rules and maxims of the common law  impius et crudelis judicandus est qui libertati non favet co lit    from fortescu impious and cruel is that man to be esteemed who does not favor liberty  angliae jura in omni casu libertati dant savorem see prin leg et aequit p   from fortescu the laws of england favor liberty in every case and the learned chancellor fortescu himself expresses this noble principle still more fully in c xlvii p  0  e laud leg ang  humana natura in libertatis causa favorem semper magis quam in aliis causis deprecetur etc in the cause of liberty human nature always implores favor more than in any other cause   if a judge therefore should remand a man into any such illegal imprisonment he immediately by the inevitable construction of these laws this truth is also farther testified by the arguments and authorities collected in bushels case reported by ld c j vaughan p      viz when a man is brought by habeas corpus to the court and upon return of it it appears to the court that he was against law imprisoned and detained though there be no cause of privilege for him in this court he shall never be by the act of the court remanded to his unlawful imprisonment for then the court should do an act of injustice in imprisoning him de novo against law whereas the the great charter is quod nullus liber homo imprisonetur nisi per legem terrae etc  becomes a party in the injury for the illegality of remanding a man brought up by habeas corpus where no cause is certified that is no legal cause is severely condemned in the  th sect of the bill of rights and the subsequent act of    cha i c x gives a penalty of treble damages as i have already remarked and what is worse if any judge should be guilty of such injustice in the case of a pressed man he would be liable to still greater penalties because the case of pressing necessarily includes not only the circumstances of taking and imprisoning a man without due process of the law but also the intention of carrying him a prisoner out of the realm whereby the judges so offending become liable to all the penalties of the last supplemental habeas corpus act which is treble costs and  00 l damages at the least a disability to bear any office of trust or profit under the crown besides all the other penalties of a praemunire which the king cannot pardon  the person or persons who shall knowingly frame contrive write seal or countersign any warrant or writing for such commitment detainer imprisonment or transportation or shall so commit detain imprison or transport any person or persons contrary to this act or be any ways advising aiding or assisting therein which must inevitably include the act of remanding being lawfully convicted thereof shall besides the penalties of treble costs and l  00 damages mentioned in the former part of the section be disabled from thenceforth to bear any office of trust or profit within the said realm of england etc and shall incur and sustain the pains penalties etc in and by the statute of provision and praemunire etc  and be incapable of any pardon from the king his heirs etc  stat    car ii xii and by the x a forfeit of  00 l is awarded against any judge for refusing the writ of habeas corpus even though demanded in time of vacation   the plea of necessity for the service will not excuse them because that very plea in the very same case the necessity for the sea service viz for the good and safety of the kingdom in general etc and the whole kingdom in danger and a stronger or more urgent necessity cannot be expressed yet it was deemed insufficient to justify the opinion of all the judges in favor of extorting ship money    cha i c    and much more insufficient will it be to excuse the violent and forcible taking and imprisoning of shipmen because the persons of men are infinitely more sacred in law than their pecuniary property for it is an unquestionable maxim that law regards the person above his possessions life and liberty most etc prin leg et aeq p    and as the inheritance of the law by an established maxim already quoted is said to descend unicuique nostrum  to every one of us without exception the seamen are surely as much entitled to claim their inheritance and right to the whole benefit of the law as any other part of the community for they cannot be excluded because another excellent maxim says turpis est pars quae non convenit cum suo toto plowden     shameful is that part of a community which is not suited with its whole body so that if seamen are denied the benefit and protection of the laws on the part of government such a denial unavoidably tends to slacken and untie the bands of allegiance on the part of the seamen who are thereby compelled to undertake their own protection and defense whenever the law is denied them for the ties of allegiance must necessarily be reciprocal according to the first principles of social government because the protection of natural right is the first foundation of english law which no act of parliament has any authority to subvert and the useful order of seamen in particular cannot be denied the protection of the law without the most stimulalating provocation to resistance in their own defense because it is agreeable to a fundamental maxim of the british constitution of state that nothing is more intolerable in law than that any one part of the community should be esteemed under a different law from the rest nihil in lege intolerabilius est candem rem diverso jure censeri and another maxim says  turpis est pars quae non convenit cum suo toto for there can be no such thing as common right wherever this is the case  thus i have endeavored to express the right of seamen in as plain and intelligible terms as i could that every common seaman of common sense may be able to discern the inestimable value of his best inheritance the law and i shall always esteem it my duty to god to maintain and defend their rights to the utmost of my power   them into service by force and violence which the most dissolute of public ministers never presumed to palliate or excuse by any other plea than this mere bugbear necessity  it is a practice so notoriously repugnant to common right and equity so fundamentally subversive of the most essential and indispensable principles of our happy legal establishment and at the same time so impious a violation of that natural equality with respect to law justice and personal protection which the almighty himself has commanded to be maintained without respect of persons that even an act of parliament cannot make it lawful for god is no respecter of persons acts x    he accepts not the persons of princes nor regards the rich more than poor for they are all the work of his hands job xxxiv    he has made the small and the great and cares for all alike wisdom vi   and with respect to equal justice gods direction to judges is part of the moral law which is still binding  they shall judge the people with just judgment thou shall not wrest judgment thou shall not respect persons neither take a gift according to the common law of england also bribery or the taking of gifts is esteemed a most heinous crime in judicial proceedings yet it is much more heinous because more dangerous in legislation insomuch that a just suspicion of undue influence by private pensions places held during pleasure etc is sufficient also to vitiate and annul the proceedings even of a legislature and therefore when wicked and corrupt men in the administration of any government presume to varnish over their illegal proceedings with the specious pretense of vindicating and establishing legislative authority and yet at the same time by sapping its honor and dignity with the baneful influence of pensions and such other bribery do notoriously practice the most effectual means to undermine and destroy it  such men i say must be deemed traitors and unpardonable hypocrites whom national justice will mark for the future vengeance of a much injured and hitherto deluded people if they do not repent before the measure of their iniquity be fulfilled and heartily adopt some prudent plan of political reformation etc deuteronomy xvi    the fashionable sneer therefore of some modern lawyers against the just doctrine concerning the equality of mankind savours of a lamentable ignorance in the first principles of their profession relating to common right or justice  all that i have said against the supposed act for suspending the law would be equally applicable to an act of parliament for impressing either seamen or any other rank or denomination of british subjects because it would be a real suspension with respect to one part of the community of all the most valuable acts of parliament which are deemed the pillars of the constitution though the learned judge foster has prostituted his pen by asserting that it is not inconsistent with any statute that learned man surely did not consider that the practice of impressing as now carried on necessarily includes the circumstances of taking and imprisoning without due process of the law which is expressly prohibited not only by one statute but by many statutes the very first statute in our book ordains that no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned etc but by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land which in another recital by parliamentary authority is explained to signify process of the law  and another venerable statute which like magna charta has been so frequently confirmed by other acts of parliament in different periods that no single parliament can have sufficient authority to repeal it expressly ordains that no man of what estate or condition that he be so that there can be no exception of seamen shall be put out of land or tenements nor taken nor imprisoned nor disinherited and the protection of the law is already shown to be our most valuable inheritance nor put to death without being brought to answer by due process of law stat    ed iii c   this excellent statute and the clause above quoted from the greatcharter are both expressly recited and confirmed in the bill of rights   cha i c   and also in the act for regulating the privy council    cha i c  0  so that judge fosters assertion in favor of pressing viz that it is not inconsistent with any statute is an unpardonable instance of disingenuity for what due process of law can be pointed out to justify or warrant the taking imprisoning and disinheriting of his most valuable inheritance the law an innocent sailor  an admiraltywarrant cannot be considered as a due process of the law to justify any such taking imprisoning etc because it is founded on no other authority than that of the king and council whose warrant for any such purposes is rendered totally illegal by authority of an act of parliament still in force    cha i c  0 so that if a judge should presume to remand a man to confinement that has been taken and imprisoned by any such warrant which is illegal and of course no process of law he would be liable to an impeachment of high treason to the state for promoting an illegal power and pretension of the crown in direct opposition to a solemn act of the whole legislature  for the same reasons every magistrate who presumes to back a presswarrant is also highly criminal and makes himself an adviser and party in a most notorious breach of the kings peace because the effect of promoting an illegal warrant to suspend as much as in him lies the laws of the kings peace common right and personal protection from any of the kings subjects and this even in the kings name must necessarily suspend also at the same time the allegiance of the persons injured for so a long time as they are in any actual danger and they are permitted even by the first foundation of the english law primum fundamentum legis angliae est lex rationis  doct et stud c    insuper lex rationis permittit plurima fieri ut scilicet quod licitum est vim vi repellere et quod fas est unicuique seamen not excepted se tueri et rem suam defendere contra vim injustam doct et stud c ii to repel force with force and to defend themselves and their own property against unjust violence and they are not deemed guilty of murder even if they kill the assailants provided the killing be inevitable in their defense and that they cannot otherwise maintain their rights  nay men are not only justified in defending themselves with force and arms but may also legally defend and rescue any other person whatever that is attacked or oppressed by an unlawful violence though he be totally unknown to the rescuers  for this was literally the case of hopkins hugget and three others an adjudged case in b r    car   who in attempting to rescue a stranger from the custody of some pressmasters in smithfield happened to kill one of them  this was but manslaughter says ld c j holt see his report of regina versus mawgridge published at the end of ld c j kelyngs reports of which judge holt was the editor some stress has been laid on the circumstance in the above case that the piece of paper which the pressmasters showed to hugget etc was not a sufficient warrant this is indeed readily allowed and we may safely add that if the lord admiral himself had attended to assist his pressmasters his authority in this case would have been as insignificant as that of any other man since the baneful clause of non obstante statuto in the lord admirals patent is declared null and void and even if the king at that time and the lords of the privy council had also attended in person with the best warrant they could make it would still have been an insufficient warrant to justify any such violent attacks upon the liberty of innocent subjects and the same judgment in law must inevitably have been given supposing the law to be duly maintained as in the recited case because the meanest subjects are as much entitled to the protection of the law as a king is to his crown and consequently are equally justified in defending it and in resisting unlawful force with force according to the first foundation of the english law as already recited for it is a maxim in law that the king can order nothing i e nothing of legal process except by a court legally appointed rex nil potest jubere nisi per curiam legitime constitutam now as all pretense of legal power in the capacity of a court of law is taken from the king and council by express act of parliament it would be absurd to attribute to their warrants and orders or the admiralty presswarrants which are founded on no other authority the least legal authority as a sufficient warrant to justify the taking and imprisoning any man whatsoever because they are not nor cannot be considered as any part of the due process of the law which alone can justify the taking and imprisoning british subjects and therefore as pressgangs officers as well as men are manifestly employed in an unlawful business acting without law there is no crime in beating or even in killing them if they cannot otherwise be repelled which must necessarily be deemed a justifiable manslaughter se defendendo because it is a maxim that  where there is no law there is no transgression ubi non est lex ibi non est transgressio and another maxim says  in vain does that man implore the aid or protection of law who strives to subvert even the law itself  frustra legis auxilium implorat qui leges ipsas subvertere conatur which must inevitably be deemed the case of pressgangs insomuch that judge foster himself if he meant to act according to law must have directed the jury to find the same verdict in his famous reported case of alexander broadfoot even if instead of a common sailor belonging to the pressgang broadfoot had shot the lieutenant of the gang or even the captain himself with the admiralty warrant in his hand because the same just objection would still have held good against the pressgang viz  that they acted without legal warrant for an admiralty warrant to impress seamen is no legal warrant or process of the law to take or imprison any man whatsoever  and therefore all the pains that have been taken by that learned man to disguise and confound the true legal state of the case are frivolous and unworthy his rank and character  for when the liberty of one subject is invaded it affects all the rest it is a provocation to all people as being of ill example and pernicious consequence  in short that excellent adage for all the ordinary circumstances of life viz  honesty the best policy will be found to hold equally good in real politics or affairs of government even throughout the most dangerous and alarming difficulties and emergencies of state because if we entertain any real belief in divine providence examples may be produced from the histories of all nations to demonstrate that the crafty refinements of mere worldly policy do frequently hasten or produce the very evils they were intended to avert an administration of government therefore which cannot subsist with law justice and common honesty is unfit to subsist at all because law is the only basis of good and lawful government so that no man can be esteemed truly loyal who thinks otherwise and though several precedents for suspending the law both in pressing and other cases may easily be produced yet they can afford no justification or excuse for such measures because the iniquity of them still remains and malum quo communius eo pejus so that the citing bad presidents is a manifest aggravation of the treason and it is a maxim  that peace is the life of the commonwealth liberty the soul of it and the laws it is body  vita reipublicae pax et animus libertas et corpus leges  and therefore the hateful measure of suspending the laws under a pretended necessity of carrying on a cruel war against the advocates for liberty ought to be deemed an attempt to destroy the life soul and body of the republic   great is the truth and stronger than all things  it lives and conquereth for evermore with her there is no accepting of persons or rewards she does the things that are just and refraineth from all unjust and wicked things  neither in her judgment or decree is any unrighteousness and she is the strength kingdom power and majesty of all ages blessed be the god of truth
