the siege of gibraltar a musical farce in two acts as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  by f pilon  london printed for g kearsly no    fleet street mdcclxxx price one shilling  advertisement the very favorite song of how stands the glass around my boys is so peculiarly adapted to the situation in which it is introduced that the author hopes he will not be censured for the sacrifice he has made of originality in adopting it it is moreover written in a spirit and taste which is much easier to admire than equal as to the rest of the songs they are all his own and he fears he must trust more to the indulgence of the public in regard to them than to any thing he can say or has written in their favor  characters men major bromfield mr reinhold ben hassan mr quick
