to men milton london printed in the year mdcclive  the relief a poem why all this solemn apparatus why why all this din about a worms concerns the child of dust of misery of scorn the prey of flattery the food of pride ain expectations bubble reasons dupe  frantic hope misled and lost in whirls  visionary scenes enchanted piles he fancied fabrics built by vanity upon the vapors of a heated brain  craft kept up in injured reasons spite  custom held in reverential awe e sacred bugbears of a frighted world to serve the purpose of designing knaves and yoke the neck of fools  the awful temples tombs and rolling clocks the midnight damps that drop from weeping yews beneath the eclipsed moon the scriechowls haunt drenching the locks of some nightwatching pilgrim who sits in dismal meditation wrapped and brainsick horror over yon mouldering grave by time defaced and frequent footsteps worn no mark remaining but the erected stone inscribed with narratives uncouth of birth of death a mute unmeaning blank between the chissels story to the pensive hind who painful pores upon the wasted words and puzzling scans the imperfect characters half hid in nettles and perplexed with thorn here moping superstition nightly broods here counts the clarion of the bird of dawn whose dreary note proclaims the ebbing night and drives the frighted goblin to his haunt the timerecording cock or to the winds repeats her unavailing vespers over the winds that mournful yell from  vaults and broken sepulchers their groaning access as if they waild the longdeparting dead who slumber deep in everlasting night within these dreary mansions where no dawn returns thus hideous melancholy dips her pencil still in dark delusive tincts and paints the face of things detested growpe a landscape fit for hell the work of fiends let rescued fancy turn aloft her eye and view yon wide extended arch behold yon crystal concave studded with the gems the radiant gems of heaven that nightly burn in golden lamps and gild the aetherial space that smiling vault that canopy of stars those clustered constellations mark yon moon serenely shine her borrowed luster full the mountain tops the rocks the vales the lawns by her set off adorned and made delightful the boundless main a polished mirror now reflecting from its bosom back the vast the wonderful the glorious glad appearance bright visions echo to the enchanted eye as on the ear harmonious sounds return in mimic notes responsive made to fill to charm the fancy with repeated transport all these in their eternal round rejoice all these with universal praise proclaim their great creator bountiful benign immensely good rejoicing in his creatures behold yon blazing sun but oh to what to what shall we compare away with such a thought to what resemble him this globe ten thousand thousand worlds beyond where space exists where matter lives beyond the grasp of human thought imaginations ken nay reasons reach the intellect of angels  but silence best becomes the boundless theme in wonder swallowed up and deep astonishment what should we fear this glorious prospect brings no dreadful phantom to the frighted eye no terror to the soul it is transport all here fancy roves in sweet variety for ever lost her native bliss for her the blue ethereal arch expands her table spread out with all the dainties of the sky imaginations rich regale for her the clouds absorb the evening ray and drink the liquid gold which stains their fleecy sides with all the tincts of heaven transmitted through a thousand different strainers to the eye and thence upon the ravished soul diffused the blushing beauties of the infant morn auroras saffron beam the splendid bow whose copious arch was bent by hands divine an emblem formed of half eternity by angels robed in all the aggregate the unblended aggregate of various day of heavens own day and from its sunbeams drawn in all its tinges dipped its glories dressed for her the smiling earth puts on her mantle her mantle green with purple mixed with gold with all the livries of the youthful spring to wake new raptures in the heart of man and fill his soul with gratitude immense all these are reasons treasures stores of thought reflections unexhausted funds replete with matter for her own delightful task here wisdom works at large here smiling builds for sweet content a homely shed where joy where gladness visit often her temperate guests and make their willing stay here undisturbed they reign they revel take their fill of all that nature ever bounteous mother yields for use or pleasure but excess avoid that fiend accursed whose bloated visage wan and troubled eye betray her inward pang which shakes severe her paralytic nerve her tottering frame ever death by nature taught and time in season due with gentle hand can cut the wasted thread excess usurps with force the abortive task and vindicates her prey  come all ye family of joy ye children of the cheerful hour begot by wisdom on the virtuous mind o come come innocence in conscious strength secure come courage foremost in the manly train come all and in the honest heart abide your native residence your fortress still from real or from fancied evils free o come indignant drive out far beyond the utmost precincts of the human breast beyond the springs of hope the cells of joy and every mansion where a virtue lives o drive far off for ever drive that bane that hideous pest engendered deep in hell where stygian glooms condensed dimensiond darkness contains within its dire embrace that monster horrid to sight and by the frighted furies in their dread pannic superstition named the close contracted span of human life is dearly purchased by the sons of care since sickness disappointment pain and death a thousand varied unavoided evils prey hourly on the vexing heart of man like officers of wrath let loose by pride to raise the rigid tax on wretched being a dreadful interest for a sum so small enough are these alas to gall and sting what need we then for fancied evils seek to scare the soul and harrow up the heart already tossed and torn and broken down by evils of its own contrivance evils still adverse found to natures wholesome ways the bane of every bliss and social joy ambition with her train and luxury with custom linked with fell corruption joined led up by fashion in her frantic dance followed by misery despair and death for pitys sake forbear to haunt the world with hideous specter and fantastic forms with harpy footed furies fearful phantoms everlasting torments and unquenched fire o say what horrid scenes are these you draw what portraits of the almighty hence away see reason turns the face aside see nature start at the monstrous form and cry aloud through all her works it is not like forbear ye croaking ministers of midnight dreams ye madding trumpeters of false report forbear to pour your ghastly images on truth nor give just providence the lie what is a churchyard what i pray this horri goblin arrayed in midnight weeds by frantic fancy in the solemn moonstruck hour a bed prepared for silent unperceiving dust that once to human thought was wedded vital clay divorced by death to join the general mother divided far from its companion dear the immortal soul that now above the stars forgets this trampled clod and joins the choirs of bliss it is gloomy all and solemn hark was it the clock that told the passing hour and told it too at midnight when deep silence and hideous darkness reign over half the world it was  what then it tells it too at noon amidst the noise and sunshine of that hour the clock that calls to business or to pleasure the sons of avarice and sensual joy what tragic bustle when an engine strikes shall mere negations unsubstantial shades such monsters form to fright the unthinking crowd to fancy tangible to terror real let monks let nurses put these vizors on to startle bigots and astonish babes reason scorns and common sense defies em and who so weak to shudder at the sound of yon departed moment fled for ever or with his sad foreboding sighs keep time to each elapsing sand that silent flows from his exhausting glass with breaking heart o wretched avarice of breath to draw fresh air or gaze upon the wearied sun to tread the same unvaryd round with pain to eat to drink to sleep to satisfy each sensual sordid appetite alas how often have distant prospects verdant views with all that fortunes faithless flattering mirror to sanguine pride presents and vain selflove how often has cheated hope complained and sought or refuge in despair the sense itself grows weary of the toil the beastly toil and reason often repeats this lesson learned from pain it is time to die and what is time elf this awful sire of births prodigious the creature of the mind no more the vassal of thought whose very being is the soul made short or long as that is more or less employed  good heaven and earth what horrid noise what stir about a reptiles poor concerns and when a worm expires shall nature say shall suffering nature sympathize with me reeccho groan for groan so pride asserts o monstrous pride made drunk by fancy at ambitions feast shall yonder sun be hid fierce aetna flame and thunder shake the poles because forsooth some spring eccentric moves within this frail machine and passion sways the soul for this the universal flood broke loose beyond its stated bounds for this the mountains melt the comets glare for this shall famine pestilence and war devour but hark the infernal forge begins to roar the sounds of sorrow and the yells of pain now tear the shop of death and reach my sense the flames ascend the furies howl and all the stygian ecchos ring a peal a peal so loud that shakes the north of hell and makes the throne of terror start o whence this fierce uproar this strong convulsion in the realms of woe behold yon reptile gasping in the arms the inexorable arms of death how pale how ghastly are its looks ah see how fear how dread distort the face and fix the eye the pallid eye that window of the soul the parting soul that spark of entity which now stands shivering on the verge of life and views the imaginary gulf beneath what horrors o what anguish must she taste whilst yet her faculties are left entire whilst yet she views the gaping fiends and flames o say can human thought can words express what nature feels in that tremenduous hour what pangs what spasms twisting too and fro with irritated force convulsive tug the rooted fibers and the springs of life by horrors heightened and distempered fumes that rack the mind and tear the tortured frame till the cracked heart subdued at length forgets to pant and death in mercy ends the fray nor only then when near the expiring gasp though then each moment counterweighs an age not only then but through the goaded length of harrassd life we drag the burdened weight of slavish fear imposed on childhoods thought by ignorance made gray in gainful error and credulous design who sit enthroned like tyrants of an ancient race to plead prescriptions right and rule the passive soul can then a gracious god be said to call from forth the vacant unexisting blank a race of creatures capable of joy enriched with thought and warm with fierce desire with delicate sensations covered over and nice perception prompt to gratify the implanted impulse and the vigorous call when nature makes her strong her just demand when passion rises at the loud alarm led up by reason to the genial task by reason guided to the wise retreat can justice punish what herself decrees and make obedience to her laws a crime justice is nature in her social dress and social virtue is the voice of heaven shall arbitrary cobwebs skreen this truth with positive dogmatical behests and give yon blazing sun the lie awake unhoodwinkd man and cast abroad thy eyes behold all nature in one generous strife the war of amity and discord sweet the strife of strong benevolence behold the universal agents all at work from different quarters with contending powers in hostile harmony to propagate one glorious and eternal good to man to beasts to fish to fowl to plants perhaps to all that feel the informing touch of good with grateful energy their texture strike and send the gladsome tiding to the soul see nature in her various style express the thankful tribute of incessant praise from lifeless matter to the sprouting blade of humble grass upon the livryd lawn from trodden daisies to the plant of jove behold the genial ether swarm with life with quickening millions float behold the ant that citizen severe with all her tribes incorporate or different colored train denisons of dust and privileged to think employ their parsimonious intellect and in their turn rejoice it is lifes great charter given from eternity to all that breathe shall those to whom our jealous pride denies superior talents and immortal thought shall they in selffelicity flow over and mental transport since no joy alas but in the mind can live shall they whom we mere animates miscall shall they rejoice with fearless hearts of shadows fearless made and fancied terrors all imaginary phantoms from these exempt they live at ease regale each sense enjoy existence still without excess the sons of pride may here be taught what instinct and what reason mean reason thou title
