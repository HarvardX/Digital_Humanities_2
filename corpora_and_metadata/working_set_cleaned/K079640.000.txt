observations on the river wye and several parts of south wales etc relative chiefly to picturesque beauty made in the summer of the year    0 second edition  by william gilpin m a prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in new forest near lymington  london printed for r blamire in the strand  mdcclxxxix  to the rev william mason vicars hill november  0      dear sir the very favorable manner in which you spoke see grays memoirs p     of some observations i showed you in ms several years ago on the lakes and mountains of the northern parts of england induced many of my friends at different times to desire the publication of them but as they are illustrated by a great variety of plans and drawings the hazard and expense had rather a formidable appearance  your advice against a subscription i have considered and am convinced on weighing the matter that without ascertaining a little better the difficulties of printing so complicated a work i should find myself embarrassed by an engagement with the public and should infallibly injure either my subscribers on one hand or myself on the other  i have followed your advice you see also in another point and have made an essay in a smaller work of the same kind which may enable me the better to ascertain the expenses of a larger  i have chosen the following little piece for that purpose which was the first of the kind i ever amused myself with and as it is very unimportant in itself you will excuse my endeavoring to give it some little credit by the following anecdote  in the same year in which this journey was made your late valuable friend mr gray mr grays own account of this tour is contained in a letter dated the   th of may      my last summers tour was through worcestershire glocestershire monmouthshire herefordshire and shropshire five of the most beautiful counties in the kingdom the very principal light and capital feature of my journey was the river wye which i descended in a boat for near  0 miles from ross to chepstow it is banks are a succession of nameless beauties one out of many you may see not illdescribed by mr whately in his observations on gardening under the name of the newweir he has also touched on two others tinternabbey and persfield both of them famous scenes and both on the wye monmouth a town i never heard mentioned lies on the same river in a vale that is the delight of my eyes and the very seat of pleasure the vale of abergavenny ragland and chepstowcastles ludlow malvernhills etc were the rest of my acquisitions and no bad harvest in my opinion but i made no journal myself else you should have had it i have indeed a short one written by the companion of my travels mr nicholls that serves to recall and fix the fleeting images of these things made it likewise and hearing that i had put on paper a few remarks on the scenes which he had so lately visited he desired a sight of them they were then only in a rude state but the handsome things he said of them to a friend william fraser esquire undersecretary of state of his who obligingly repeated them to me gave them i own some little degree of credit in my own opinion and make me somewhat less apprehensive in risking them before the public  if this little work afforded any amusement to mr gray it was the amusement of a very late period of his life he saw it in london about the beginning of june      and he died you know at the end of the july following  had he lived it is possible he might have been induced to have assisted me with a few of his own remarks on scenes which he had so accurately examined the slightest touches of such a master would have had their effect no man was a greater admirer of nature than mr gray nor admired it with better taste  i can only however offer this little work to the public as a hasty sketch to criticize the face of a country correctly you should see it oftener than once and in various seasons different circumstances make such changes in the same landscape as give it wholly a new aspect but these scenes are marked just as they struck the eye at first i had not an opportunity to repeat the view  for the drawings i must apologize in the same manner they were hastily sketched and under many disadvantages and pretend at best to give only a general idea of a place or scene without entering into the details of portrait  such as the work is i print it by your advice and it is chiefly from my deference to your opinion and that of my other friends that my expectation of any favor from the public is derived i am dear sir with great regard and esteem  your most obedient and very sincere humble servant william gilpin  postscipt to the second edition in the first edition of this work the drawings were executed in a style between etching with a needle and aquatinta in this edition the latter mode only is employed they are all executed by one hand a very ingenious artist mr jukes in howland street  who has done them i think full justice many of the drawings he has much improved  i do not myself thoroughly understand the process of working in aquatinta but the great inconvenience of it seems to arise from it is not being sufficiently under the artists command it is not always able to give that just gradation of light and shade which he desires harsh edges will sometimes appear it is however a very beautiful mode of multiplying drawings and certainly comes the nearest of any mode we know to the softness of the pencil it may indeed literally be called drawing as it washes in the shades the only difference is that it is a more unmanageable process to wash the shades upon copper with aquafortis than upon paper with a brush if however the aquatinta mode of multiplying drawings has some inconveniences it is no more than every other mode of working on copper is subject to engraving particularly is always accompanied with a degree of stiffness  for myself i am fond of the free rough style of etching landscape with a needle after the manner of rembrandt in which much is left to the imagination to make out but this would not satisfy the public nor indeed any one whose imagination is not so conversant with the scenes of nature as to make out a landscape from a hint  this rough mode has at least the advantage of biting the copper more strongly and giving a greater number of good impressions  to the fifteen drawings of the first edition i was advised to add two as explanatory of the folding of the sidescreens of a circumscribed river see page     the first of these drawings is meant to illustrate these screens in their simplest form when each consists only of one part the second illustrates the variation of them when each consists of two parts or more  to the observations also of the first

curiosities of art  to survey the beauties of nature  and to learn the manners of men their different polities and modes of life  the following little work proposes a new object of pursuit that of examining the face of a country by the rules of picturesque beauty opening the sources of those pleasures which are derived from the comparison  observations of this kind through the vehicle of description have the better chance of being founded in truth as they are not the offspring of theory but are taken immediately from the scenes of nature as they arise  crossing hounslowheath from kingston in surry we struck into the readingroad and turned a little aside to see the approach to cavershamhouse which winds about a mile along a valley through the park this was the work of brown whose great merit lay in pursuing the path which nature had marked out nothing can be easier than the sweep nor better united than the ground nor more ornamental than several of the clumps but many of the single trees which are beeches are heavy and offend the eye almost any ordinary tree may contribute to form a group it is deformities are lost in a crowd nay even the deformities of one tree may be corrected by the deformities of another but few trees have those characters of beauty which will enable them to appear with advantage as individuals this approach to cavershamhouse i have been informed is now much injured   from lord cadogans we took the wallingfordroad to oxford it affords some variety running along the declivity of a range of hills and overlooking one of the valleys of the thames but there is nothing very interesting in these scenes the thames appears but only in short reaches it rarely exceeds the dimensions of a pool and does not once as i remember exhibit those ample sweeps in which the beauty of a river so much consists the woods too are frequent but they are formal copses and white spots bursting every where from a chalky soil disturb the eye  from wallingford to oxford we did not observe one good view except at shillingford where the bridge the river and it is woody banks exhibit some scenery  from oxford we proposed to take the nearest road to ross as far as witney the country appears flat tho in fact it rises about the eleventh stone the high grounds command a noble semicircular distance on the left and near burford there are views of the same kind on the right but not so extensive none of these landscapes however are perfect as they want the accompaniments of foregrounds  at mr lenthals in burford we admired a capital picture of the family of the mores which is said to be holbeins and appeared to us entirely in that masters style but mr walpole thinks it is not an original and says he found a date upon it subsequent to the death of that master it is however a good picture of it is kind it contains eleven figures  sir thomas more and his father two young ladies and other branches of the family the heads are as expressive as the composition is formal the judge is marked with the character of a dry facetious sensible old man the chancellor is handed down to us in history both as a cheerful philosopher and as a severe inquisitor his countenance here has much of that eagerness and stern attention which remind us of the latter the subject of this piece seems to be a dispute between the two young ladies and alludes probably to some wellknown family story  indeed every familypicture should be founded on some little story or domestic incident which in a degree should engage the attention of all the figures it would be invidious perhaps to tax vandyck on this head but if the truth might be spoken i could mention some of his family pictures which if the sweetness of his coloring and the elegant simplicity of his airs and attitudes did not make us forget all faults would appear only like so many distinct portraits stuck together on the same canvas it would be equally invidious to omit mentioning a modern master now at the head of his profession sir joshua reynolds  whose great fertility of invention in employing the figures of his familypictures is not among the least of his many excellences  the country from burford is high and downy a valley on the right kept pace with us through which flows the windrush not indeed an object of sight but easily traced along the meadows by pollardwillows and a more luxuriant vegetation  at barrington we had a pleasing view through an opening on the foreground  about northleach the road grows very disagreeable nothing appears but downs on each side and these often divided by stone walls the most offensive separation of property  from the neighborhood of london we had now pursued our journey through a tract of country almost uniformly rising tho by imperceptible degrees into the heart of glocestershire till at length we found ourselves on the ridge of coteswold  the county of gloucester is divided into three capital parts  the wolds or high downy grounds toward the east  the vale of severn in the middle  and the forest of dean toward the west the first of these tracts of country we had been traversing from our entrance into glocestershire and the ridge we now stood on made the extremity of it here the heights which we had been ascending by such imperceptible degrees that we hardly ever perceived the ascent at length broke down abruptly into the lower grounds and a vast stretch of distant country appeared at once before the eye  i know not that i was ever more struck with the singularity and grandeur of any landscape nature generally brings different countries together in some easy mode of connection if she raise the grounds on one side by a long ascent she commonly unites them with the country on the other in the same easy manner such scenes we view without wonder or emotion we glide without observation from the near grounds into the more distant all is gradual and easy but when nature works in the bold and singular style of composition in which she works here  when she raises a country through a progress of a hundred miles and then breaks it down at once by an abrupt precipice into an expansive vale we are immediately struck with the novelty and grandeur of the scene  it was the vale of severn which was spread before us perhaps no where in england a distance so rich and at the same time so extensive can be found we had a view of it almost from one end to the other winding through the space of many leagues in a direction nearly from west to north the eye was lost in the profusion of objects which were thrown at once before it and ran wild as it were over the vast expanse with rapture and astonishment before it could compose itself enough to make any coherent observations  at length we begin to examine the detail and to separate the vast immensity before us into parts  to the north we looked up the vale along the course of the severn the town of cheltenham lay below our feet at the distance of two or three miles the vale appeared afterward confined between the limits of bredon hills on the right and those of malvern on the left right between these in the middle of the vale lies tewksbury bosomed in wood the great church even at this distance makes a respectable appearance a little to the right but in distance very remote we may see the towers of worcester if the day be clear especially if some accidental gleam of light relieve them from the hills of shropshire which close the scene  to the west we look toward gloucester and here it is remarkable that as the objects in the northern part of the vale are confined by the hills of malvern and bredon so in this view the vale is confined by two other hills which tho inconsiderable in themselves give a character to the scene and the more so as they are both insulated one of these hills is known by the name of robinswood the other by that of churchdown from the singularity of a church seated on it is eminence between these hills the great object of the vale is the city of gloucester which appears rising over rich woody scenes beyond gloucester the eye still pursues the vale into remote distance till it unite with a range of mountains  still more to the west arises a distant forestview composed of the woods of the country uniting with the forest of dean of this view the principal feature is the mouth of the severn where it first begins to assume a character of grandeur by mixing with the ocean a small portion only of it is seen stretching in an acute angle over the wood but the eye used to perspective seeing such a body of water small as it appears wearing any determined form at such distance gives it credit for it is full magnitude the welsh mountains also which rise beyond the severn contribute to raise the idea for by forming an even horizontal line along the edge of the water they give it the appearance of what it really is an arm of the sea  having thus taken a view of the vast expanse of the vale of severn from the extremity of the descent of coteswold we had leisure next to examine the grandeur of the descent itself which forms a foreground not less admirable than the distance the lofty ridge on which we stood is of great extent stretching beyond the bounds of glocestershire both toward the north and toward the south it is not every where we may suppose of equal beauty height and abruptness but fine passages of landscape i have been told abound in every part of it the spot where we took this view over the vale of severn is the high ground on cricklyhill which is a promontory standing out in the vale between the villages of leckhampton and birdlip here the descent consists of various rocky knolls prominences and abruptnesses among which a variety of roads wind down the steep toward different parts of the vale and each of these roads through it is whole varying progress exhibits some beautiful view discovering the vale either in whole or in part with every advantage of a picturesque foreground  many of these precipices also are finely wooded some of the largest trees in the kingdom perhaps are to be seen in these parts the cheltenham oak and an elm not far from it are trees which curious travelers always inquire after  many of these hills which enclose the vale of severn on this side furnish landscapes themselves without borrowing assistance from the vale the woody valleys which run winding among them present many pleasing pastoral scenes the clothing country about stroud is particularly diversified in this way tho many of these valleys are greatly injured in a picturesque light by becoming scenes of habitation and industry a cottage a mill or a hamlet among trees may often add beauty to a rural scene but when houses are scattered through every part the moral sense can never make a convert of the picturesque eye stroudwater valley especially which is one of the most beautiful of these scenes has been deformed lately not only by a number of buildings but by a canal cut through the middle of it  among the curiosities of these high grounds is the sevenwellhead of the thames in a glen near the road a few limpid springs gushing from a rock give origin to this noblest of english rivers tho i suppose several little streams in that district might claim the honor with equal justice if they could bring over opinion  nothing can give a stronger idea of the nature of the country i have been describing than this circumstance of it is giving rise to the thames on one side within half a dozen miles below the precipice the severn has arrived at so much consequence as to take it is level from the tides of the ocean on the other the thames arising at our feet does not arrive at that dignity till it have performed a course of two hundred and fifty miles  having descended the heights of crickley the road through the vale continues so level to gloucester that we scarce saw the town till we entered it  the cathedral is of elegant gothic on the outside but of heavy saxon within that is these different modes of architecture prevail most in these different parts of the building but in fact the cathedral of gloucester is a compound of all the several modes which have prevailed from the days of henry the second to those of henry the seventh and may be said to include in one part or other the whole history of sacred architecture during that period many parts of it have been built in the times of the purest gothic and others which have been originally saxon appear plainly to have been altered into the gothic which was no uncommon practice a grecian screen is injudiciously introduced to separate the choir the cloisters are light and airy  as we leave the gates of gloucester the view is pleasing a long stretch of meadow filled with cattle spreads into a foreground beyond is a screen of wood terminated by distant mountains among which malvernhills make a respectable appearance the road to ross leads through a country woody rough hilly and picturesque  ross stands high and commands many distant views but that from the churchyard is the most admired and is indeed very amusing it consists of an easy sweep of the wye and of an extensive country beyond it but it is not picturesque it is marked by no characteristic objects it is broken into too many parts and it is seen from too high a point the spire of the church which is the man of rosss heavendirected spire tapers beautifully the inn which was the house he lived in is known by the name of the man of rosss house  at ross we planned our voyage down the wye to monmouth and provided a coveredboat navigated by three men less strength would have carried us down but the labor is in rowing back  sect ii the wye takes it is rise near the summit of plinlimmon and dividing the counties of radnor and brecknoc passes through the middle of herefordshire from thence becoming a second boundary between monmouth and glocestershire it falls into the severn a little below chepstow to this place from ross which is a course of near forty miles it flows in a gentle uninterrupted stream and adorns through it is various reaches a succession of the most picturesque scenes  the beauty of these scenes arises chiefly from two circumstances  the lofty banks of the river and it is mazy course both which are accurately observed by the poet when he describes the wye as ecchoing through it is winding bounds pleased vaga echoes through it is winding bounds and rapid severn hoarse applause resounds popes eth ep    it could not well echo unless it is banks were both lofty and winding  from these two circumstances the views it exhibits are of the most beautiful kind of perspective free from the formality of lines  every view on a river thus circumstanced is composed of four grand parts the area which is the river itself the two sidescreens which are the opposite banks and mark the perspective and the frontscreen which points out the winding of the river  if the wye ran like a dutch canal between parallel banks there could be no frontscreen the two sidescreens in that situation would lengthen to a point  if a road were under the circumstance of a river winding like the wye the effect would be the same but this is rarely the case the road pursues the irregularity of the country it climbs the hill and sinks into the valley and this irregularity gives the view it exhibits a different character  the views on the wye tho composed only of these simple parts are yet infinitely varied  they are varied first by the contrast of the screens sometimes one of the sidescreens is elevated sometimes the other and sometimes the front or both the sidescreens may be lofty and the front either high or low  again they are varied by the folding of the sidescreens over each other and hiding more or less of the front when none of the front is discovered the foldingside either winds round like an amphitheatre the word amphitheatre strictly speaking is a complete enclosure but i believe it is commonly accepted as here for any circular piece of architecture tho it do not wind entirely round  or it becomes a long reach of perspective  these simple variations admit still farther variety from becoming complex one of the sides may be compounded of various parts while the other remains simple or both may be compounded and the front simple or the front alone may be compounded  besides these sources of variety there are other circumstances which under the name of ornaments still farther increase them plain banks will admit all the variations we have yet mentioned but when this plainness is adorned a thousand other varieties arise  the ornaments of the wye may be ranged under four heads  ground  wood  rocks  and buildings  the ground of which the banks of the wye consist and which has thus far been considered only in it is general effect affords every variety which ground is capable of receiving from the steepest precipice to the flattest meadow this variety appears in the line formed by the summits of the banks in the swellings and excavations of their declivities and in the unequal surfaces of the lower grounds  in many places also the ground is broken which adds new sources of variety by broken ground we mean only such ground as has lost it is turf and dicovers the naked soil often you see a gravelly earth shivering from the hills in the form of waterfalls or perhaps you see dry stony channels guttering down precipices the rough beds of temporary torrents and sometimes so trifling a cause as the rubbing of sheep against the sides of little banks or hillocs will often occasion very beautiful breaks  the color too of the broken soil is a great source of variety the yellow or the red oker the ashy gray the black earth or the marley blue and the intermixtures of these with each other and with patches of verdure blooming heath and other vegetable tints still increase that variety  nor let the fastidious reader think these remarks descend too much into detail were an extensive distance described a forestscene a sea coast view a vast semicircular range of mountains or some other grand display of nature it would be trifling to mark these minute circumstances but here the hills around exhibit little except foregrounds and it is necessary where we have no distances to be more exact in finishing objects at hand  the next great ornament on the banks of the wye are it is woods in this country there are many works carried on by fire and the woods being maintained for their use are periodically cut down as the larger trees are generally left a kind of alternacy takes place what is this year a thicket may the next be an open grove the woods themselves possess little beauty and less grandeur yet when we consider them as the ornamental not as the essential parts of a scene the eye must not examine them with exactness but compound for a general effect  one circumstance attending this alternacy is pleasing many of the furnaces on the banks of the river consume charcoal which is manufactured on the spot and the smoke which is frequently seen issuing from the sides of the hills and spreading it is thin veil over a part of them beautifully breaks their lines and unites them with the sky  the chief deficiency in point of wood is of large trees on the edge of the water which clumped here and there would diversify the hills as the eye passes them and remove that heaviness which always in some degree tho here as little as any where arises from the continuity of ground they would also give a degree of distance to the more removed parts which in a scene like this would be attended with peculiar advantage for as we have here so little distance we wish to make the most of what we have  but trees immediately on the foreground cannot be suffered in these scenes as they would obstruct the navigation of the river  the rocks which are continually starting through the woods produce another ornament on the banks of the wye the rock as all other objects tho more than all receives it is chief beauty from contrast some objects are beautiful in themselves the eye is pleased with the tuftings of a tree it is amused with pursuing the eddying stream or it rests with delight on the shattered arches of a gothic ruin such objects independent of composition are beautiful in themselves but the rock bleak naked and unadorned seems scarcely to deserve a place among them tint it with mosses and lychens of various hues and you give it a degree of beauty adorn it with shrubs and hanging herbage and you still make it more picturesque connect it with wood and water and broken ground and you make it in the highest degree interesting it is color and it is form are so accommodating that it generally blends into one of the most beautiful appendages of landscape  different kinds of rocks have different degrees of beauty those on the wye which are of a greyish color are in general simple and grand rarely formal or fantastic sometimes they project in those beautiful square masses yet broken and shattered in every line which is characteristic of the most majestic species of rock sometimes they slant obliquely from the eye in shelving diagonal strata and sometimes they appear in large masses of smooth stone detached from each other and half buried in the soil rocks of this last kind are the most lumpish and the least picturesque  the various buildings which arise every where on the banks of the wye form the last of it is ornaments abbeys castles villages spires forges mills and bridges one or other of these venerable vestiges of past or cheerful habitations of present times characterize almost every scene  these works of art are however of much greater use in artificial than in natural landscape in pursuing the beauties of nature we range at large among forests lakes rocks and mountains the various scenes we meet with furnish an inexhausted source of pleasure and tho the works of art may often give animation and contrast to these scenes yet still they are not necessary we can be amused without them but when we introduce a scene on canvas  when the eye is to be confined within the frame of a picture and can no longer range among the varieties of nature the aids of art become more necessary and we want the castle or the abbey to give consequence to the scene indeed the landscapepainter seldom thinks his view perfect without characterizing it by some object of this kind  sect iii having thus analyzed the wye and considered separately it is constituent parts  the steepness of it is banks  it is mazy course  the ground woods and rocks which are it is native ornaments  and the buildings which still farther adorn it is natural beauties we shall now take a view of some of those delightful scenes which result from the combination of all these picturesque materials  i must however premise how illqualified i am to do justice to the banks of the wye were it only from having seen them under the circumstance of a continued rain which began early in the day before one third of our voyage was performed  it is true scenery at hand suffers less under such a circumstance than scenery at a distance which it totally obscures  the picturesque eye also in quest of beauty finds it almost in every incident and under every appearance of nature her works and all her works must ever in some degree be beautiful even the rain gave a gloomy grandeur to many of the scenes and by throwing a veil of obscurity over the removed banks of the river introduced now and then something like a pleasing distance yet still it hid greater beauties and we could not help regretting the loss of those broad lights and deep shadows which would have given so much luster to the whole and which ground like this is in a peculiar manner adapted to receive  the first part of the river from ross is tame the banks are low and there is scarce an object worth attention except the ruins of wiltoncastle which appear on the left shrouded with a few trees but the scene wants accompaniments to give it grandeur    the bank however soon began to swell on the right and was richly adorned with wood we admired it much and also the vivid images reflected from the water which were continually disturbed as we sailed past them and thrown into tremulous confusion by the dashing of our oars a disturbed surface of water endeavoring to collect it is scattered images and restore them to order is among the pretty appearances of nature  we met with nothing for some time during our voyage but these grand woody banks one rising behind another appearing and vanishing by turns as we doubled the several capes but tho no particular objects marked and characterized these different scenes yet they afforded great variety of beautiful perspective views as we wound round them or stretched through the reaches which they marked along the river  the channel of no river can be more decisively marked than that of the wye who has divided a watercourse for the flowing of rivers says the almighty in that grand apostrophe to job on the works of creation the idea is happily illustrated here a nobler watercourse was never divided for any river than this of the wye rivers in general pursue a devious course along the countries through which they flow and form channels for themselves by constant fluxion but sometimes as in these scenes we see a channel marked with such precision that it appears as if originally intended only for the bed of a river  after sailing four miles from ross we came to goodrichcastle where a grand view presented itself and we rested on our oars to examine it a reach of the river forming a noble bay is spread before the eye the bank on the right is steep and covered with wood beyond which a bold promontory shoots out crowned with a castle rising among trees  this view which is one of the grandest on the river i should not scruple to call correctly picturesque which is seldom the character of a purely natural scene  nature is always great in design she is an admirable colourist also and harmonizes tints with infinite variety and beauty but she is seldom so correct in composition as to produce an harmonious whole either the foreground or the background is disproportioned or some awkward line runs across the piece or a tree is illplaced or a bank is formal or something or other is not exactly what it should be the case is the immensity of nature is beyond human comprehension she works on a vast scale and no doubt harmoniously if her schemes could be comprehended the artist in the mean time is confined to a span and lays down his little rules which he calls the principles of picturesque beauty merely to adapt such diminutive parts of natures surfaces to his own eye as come within it is scope  hence therefore the painter who adheres strictly to the composition of nature will rarely make a good picture his picture must contain a whole his archetype is but a part  in general however he may obtain views of such parts of nature as with the addition of a few trees or a little alteration in the foreground which is a liberty that must always be allowed may be adapted to his rules though he is rarely so fortunate as to find a landscape completely satisfactory to him in the scenery indeed at goodrichcastle the parts are few and the whole is a very simple exhibition the complex scenes of nature are generally those which the artist finds most refractory to his rules of composition  in following the course of the wye which makes here one of it is boldest sweeps we were carried almost round the castle surveying it in a variety of forms many of these retrospects are good but in general the castle loses on this side both it is own dignity and the dignity of it is situation  the views from the castle were mentioned to us as worth examining but the rain was now set in and would not permit us to land  as we leave goodrichcastle the banks on the left which had hitherto contributed less to entertain us began now principally to attract our attention rearing themselves gradually into grand steeps sometimes covered with thick woods and sometimes forming vast concave slopes of mere verdure unadorned except here and there by a straggling tree while the flocks which hung browzing upon them seen from the bottom were diminished into white specks  the view at ruredeanchurch unfolds itself next which is a scene of great grandeur here both sides of the river are steep and both woody but in one the woods are intermixed with rocks the deep umbrage of the forest of dean occupies the front and the spire of the church rises among the trees the reach of the river which exhibits this scene is long and of course the view which is a noble piece of natural perspective continues some time before the eye but when the spire comes directly in front the grandeur of the landscape is gone  the stonequarries on the right from which the bridge of bristol was built and on the left the furnaces of bishopswood vary the scene tho they are objects of no great importance in themselves  for some time both sides of the river continue steep and beautiful no particular object indeed characterizes either but here nature characterizes her own scenes we admire the infinite variety with which she shapes and adorns these vast concave and unequal forms we admire also that varied touch with which she expresses every object  here we see one great distinction between her painting and that of all her copyists artists universally are mannerists in a certain degree each has his particular mode of forming particular objects his rocks his trees his figures are cast in one mould at least they possess only a varied sameness rubens figures are all fullfed salvators spare and longlegged  the artist also discovers as little variety in filling up the surfaces of bodies as he does in delineating their forms you see the same touch or something like it universally prevail tho applied to different subjects  in every part of painting except execution an artist may be assisted by the labors of those who have gone before him he may improve his skill in composition  in light and shade  in perspective  in grace and elegance that is in all the scientific parts of his art but with regard to execution he must set up on his own stock a mannerist i fear he must be if he get a manner of his own he may be an agreeable mannerist but if he copy anothers he will certainly be a formal one the more closely he copies nature the better chance he has of being free from this general defect  at lidbroke is a large wharf where coals are shipped for hereford and other places here the scene is new and pleasing all has thus far been grandeur and tranquillity it is now life and bustle a road runs diagonally along the bank and horses and carts appear passing to the small vessels which lie against the wharf to receive their burdens close behind a rich woody hill hangs sloping over the wharf and forms a grand background to the whole the contrast of all this business the engines used in lading and unlading together with the solemnity of the scene produce all together a picturesque assemblage the sloping hill is the frontscreen the two sidescreens are low  the front soon becomes a lofty sidescreen on the left and sweeping round the eye at welshbicknor forms a noble amphitheatre  at coldwell the frontscreen first appears as a woody hill swelling to a point in a few minutes it changes it is shape and the woody hill becomes a lofty sidescreen on the right while the front unfolds itself into a majestic piece of rockscenery  here we should have gone on shore and walked to the newweir which by land is only a mile though by water i believe it is three times as far this walk would have afforded us we were informed some very noble riverviews nor should we have lost any thing by relinquishing the water which in this part was uninteresting  the whole of this information we should probably have found true if the weather had permitted us to have profitted by it the latter part of it was certainly wellfounded for the waterviews in this part were very tame we left the rocks and precipices behind exchanging them for lowbanks and sedges  but the grand scenery soon returned we approached it however gradually the views at whitechurch were an introduction to it here we sailed through a long reach of hills whose sloping sides were covered with large lumpish detached stcones which seemed in a course of years to have rolled from a girdle of rocks that surrounds the upper regions of these high grounds on both sides of the river but particularly on the left  from these rocks we soon approached the newweir which may be called the second grand scene on the wye  the river is wider than usual in this part and takes a sweep round a towering promontory of rock which forms the sidescreen on the left and is the grand feature of the view it is not a broad fractured face of rock but rather a woody hill from which large projections in two or three places burst out rudely hung with twisting branches and shaggy furniture which like mane round the lions head give a more savage air to these wild exhibitions of nature near the top a pointed fragment of solitary rock rising above the rest has rather a fantastic appearance but it is not without it is effect in marking the scene  a great matter in landscape has adorned an imaginary view with a circumstance exactly similar stabat acuta silex praecisis undique saxis  dorso insurgens altissima visu dirarum nidis domus opportuna volucrum  prona jugo laevum incumbebat ad amnem aen viii          on the right side of the river the bank forms a woody amphitheatre following the course of the stream round the promontory it is lower skirts are adorned with a hamlet in the midst of which volumes of thick smoke thrown up at intervals from an ironforge as it is fires receive fresh fuel add double grandeur to the scene  but what peculiarly marks this view is a circumstance on the water the whole river at this place makes a precipitate fall of no great height indeed but enough to merit the title of a cascade tho to the eye above the stream it is an object of no consequence in all the scenes we had yet passed the water moving with a slow and solemn pace the objects around kept time as it were with it and every steep and every rock which hung over the river was solemn tranquil and majestic but here the violence of the stream and the roaring of the waters impressed a new character on the scene all was agitation and uproar and every steep and every rock stared with wildness and terror  a fishingboat is used in this part of the river which is curious it is constructed of waxed canvas stretched over a few slight ribs and holds only a single man it is called a coricle and is derived probably as it is name imports from the ancient boat which was formed of leather  an adventrous fellow for a wager once navigated a coricle as far as the isle of lundy at the mouth of the bristolchannel a full fortnight or more he spent in this dangerous voyage and it was happy for him that it was a fortnight of serene weather many a current and many an eddy many a flowing tide and many an ebbing one afforded him occasion to exert all his skill and dexterity sometimes his little bark was carried far to leeward and sometimes as far to windward but still he recovered his course persevered in his undertaking and at length happily achieved it when he returned to the newweir report says the account of his expedition was received like a voyage round the world  below the newweir are other rocky views of the same kind though less beautiful but description flags in running over such a monotony of terms high low steep woody rocky and a few others are all the colors of language we have to describe scenes in which there are infinite gradations and amidst some general sameness infinite peculiarities  after we had passed a few of these scenes the hills gradually descend into monmouth which lies too low to make any appearance from the water but on landing we found it a pleasant town and neatly built the townhouse and church are both handsome  the transmutations of time are often ludicrous monmouthcastle was formerly the palace of a king and birthplace of a mighty prince it is now converted into a yard for fatting ducks  the sun had set before we arrived at monmouth here we met our chaise but on enquiry finding a voyage more likely to produce amusement than a journey we made a new agreement with our bargemen and embarked again the next morning    sect iv as we left monmouth the banks on the left were at first low but on both sides they soon grew steep and woody varying their shapes as they had done the day before the most beautiful of these scenes is in the neighborhood of st brevals castle where the vast woody declivities on each hand are uncommonly magnificent the castle is at too great a distance to make any object in the view  the weather was now serene the sun shone and we saw enough of the effect of light in the exhibitions of this day to regret the want of it the day before  during the whole course of our voyage from ross we had scarce seen one cornfield the banks of the wye consist almost entirely either of wood or of pasturage which i mention as a circumstance of peculiar value in landscape furrowedlands and wavingcorn however charming in pastoral poetry are illaccommodated to painting the painter never desires the hand of art to touch his grounds  but if art must stray among them  if it must mark out the limits of property and turn them to the uses of agriculture he wishes that these limits may as much as possible be concealed and that the lands they circumscribe may approach as nearly as may be to nature  that is that they may be pasturage pasturage not only presents an agreeable surface but the cattle which graze it add great variety and animation to the scene  the meadows below monmouth which ran shelving from the hills to the waterside were particularly beautiful and wellinhabited flocks of sheep were every where hanging on their green steeps and herds of cattle occupying the lower grounds we often failed past groups of them laving their sides in the water or retiring from the heat under sheltered banks  in this part of the river also which now begins to widen we were often entertained with light vessels gliding past us their white sails passing along the sides of woodland hills were very picturesque  in many places also the views were varied by the prospect of bays and harbors in miniature where little barks lay moored taking in ore and other commodities from the mountains these vessels designed plainly for rougher water than they at present incountred showed us without any geographical knowledge that we approached the sea  from monmouth we reached by a late breakfasthour the noble ruin of tinternabbey which belongs to the duke of beaufort and is esteemed with its appendages the most beautiful and picturesque view on the river  castles and abbeys have different situations agreeable to their respective uses the castle meant for defense stands boldly on the hill the abbey intended for meditation is hid in the sequestered vale  ah happy thou if one superior rock bear on it is brow the shivered fragment huge of some old norman fortress happier far ah then most happy if thy vale below wash with the crystal coolness of it is rills some mouldering abbeys ivyvested wall such is the situation of tinternabbey it occupies a gentle eminence in the middle of a circular valley beautifully screened on all sides by woody hills through which the river winds it is course and the hills closing on it is entrance and on it is exit leave no room for inclement blasts to enter a more pleasing retreat could not easily be found the woods and glades intermixed the winding of the river the variety of the ground the splendid ruin contrasted with the objects of nature and the elegant line formed by the summits of the hills which include the whole make all together a very enchanting piece of scenery every thing around breathes an air so calm and tranquil so sequestered from the commerce of life that it is easy to conceive a man of warm imagination in monkish times might have been allured by such a scene to become an inhabitant of it  no part of the ruins of tintern is seen from the river except the abbeychurch it has been an elegant gothic pile but it does not make that appearance as a distant object which we expected tho the parts are beautiful the whole is illshaped no ruins of the tower are left which might give form and contrast to the buttresses and walls instead of this a number of gabelends hurt the eye with their regularity and disgust it by the vulgarity of their shape a mallet judiciously used but who durst use it might be of service in fracturing some of them particularly those of the cross isles which are not only disagreeable in themselves but confound the perspective  but were the building ever so beautiful encompassed as it is with shabby houses it could make no appearance from the river from a stand near the road it is seen to more advantage  but if tinternabbey be less striking as a distant object it exhibits on a nearer view when the whole together cannot be seen but the eye settles on some of it is nobler parts a very enchanting piece of ruin nature has now made it her own time has worn off all traces of the rule it has blunted the sharp edges of the chissel and broken the regularity of opposing parts the figured ornaments of the eastwindow are gone those of the westwindow are left most of the other windows with their principal ornaments remain  to these were superadded the ornaments of time ivy in masses uncommonly large had taken possession of many parts of the wall and given a happy contrast to the greycoloured stone of which the building is composed nor was this undecorated mosses of various hues with lychens maidenhair pennyleaf and other humble plants had overspread the surface or hung from every joint and crevice some of them were in flower others only in leaf but all together gave those fullblown tints which add the richest finishing to a ruin  such is the beautiful appearance which tinternabbey exhibits on the outside in thosse parts where we can obtain a near view of it but when we enter it we see it in most perfection at least if we consider it as an independent object unconnected with landscape the roof is gone but the walls and pillars and abutments which supported it are entire a few of the pillars indeed have given way and here and there a piece of the facing of he wall but in correspondent parts one always remains to tell the story the pavement is obliterated the elevation of the choir is no longer visible the whole area is reduced to one level cleared of rubbish and covered with neat turf closely shorn and interrupted with nothing but the noble columns which formed the isles and supported the tower  when we stood at one end of this awful piece of ruin and surveyed the whole in one view  the elements of air and earth it is only covering and pavement and the grand and venerable remains which terminated both  perfect enough to form the perspective yet broken enough to destroy the regularity the eye was above measure delighted with the beauty the greatness and the novelty of the scene more picturesque it certainly would have been if the area unadorned had been left with all it is rough fragments of ruin scattered round and bold was the hand that removed them yet as the outside of the ruin which is the chief object of picturesque curiosity is still left in all it is wild and native rudeness we excuse  perhaps we approve  the neatness that is introduced within it may add to the beauty of the scene  to it is novelty it undoubtedly does  among other things in this scene of desolation the poverty and wretchedness of the inhabitants were remarkable they occupy little huts raised among the ruins of the monastery and seem to have no employment but begging as if a place once devoted to indolence could never again become the seat of industry as we left the abbey we found the whole hamlet at the gate either openly soliciting alms or covertly under the pretense of carrying us to some part of the ruins which each could show and which was far superior to any thing which could be shown by any one else the most lucrative occasion could not have excited more jealousy and contention  one poor woman we followed who had engaged to show us the monks library she could scarce crawl shuffling along her palsied limbs and meager contracted body by the help of two sticks she led us through an old gate into a place overspread with nettles and briars and pointing to the remnant of a shattered cloister told us that was the place it was her own mansion all indeed she meant to tell us was the story of her own wretchedness and all she had to show us was her own miserable habitation we did not expect to be interested but we found we were i never saw so loathsome a human dwelling it was a cavity loftily vaulted between two ruined walls which streamed with variouscoloured stains of unwholesome dews the floor was earth yielding through moisture to the tread not the merest utensil or furniture of any kind appeared but a wretched bedstead spread with a few rags and drawn into the middle of the cell to prevent it is receiving the damp which trickled down the walls at one end was an aperture which served just to let in light enough to discover the wretchedness within  when we stood in the midst of this cell of misery and felt the chilling damps which struck us in every direction we were rather surprised that the wretched inhabitant was still alive than that she had only lost the use of her limbs  the country about tinternabbey has been described as a solitary tranquil scene but it is immediate environs only are meant within half a mile of it are carried on great ironworks which introduce noise and bustle into these regions of tranquillity  the ground about these works appears from the river to consist of grand woody hills sweeping and intersecting each other in elegant lines they are a continuation of the same kind of landscape as that about tinternabbey and are fully equal to it  as we still descend the river the same scenery continues the banks are equally steep winding and woody and in some parts diversified by prominent rocks and ground finely broken and adorned  but one great disadvantage began here to invade us hitherto the river had been clear and splendid reflecting the several objects on it is banks but it is waters now became ouzy and discolored sludgy shores too appeared on each side and other symptoms which discovered the influence of a tide  sect v mr morriss improvements at persfield which we soon approached are generally thought as much worth a travellers notice as any thing on the banks of the wye we pushed on shore close under his rocks and the tide being at ebb we landed with some difficulty on an ouzy beach one of our bargemen who knew the place served as a guide and under his conduct we climbed the steep by an easy regular zigzag and gained the top  the eminence on which we stood one of those grand eminences which overlooks the wye is an intermixture of rock and wood and forms in this place a concave semicircle sweeping round in a segment of two miles the river winds under it and the scenery of course is shown in various directions the river itself indeed as we just observed is charged with the impurities of the soil it washes and when it ebbs it is verdant banks become slopes of mud but if we except these disadvantages the situation of persfield is noble  little indeed was left for improvement but to open walks and views through the woods to the various objects around them all this the ingenious proprietor has done with great judgment and has shown his rocks his woods and his precipices under various forms and to great advantage sometimes a broad face of rock is presented stretching along a vast space like the walls of a citadel sometimes it is broken by intervening trees in other parts the rocks rise above the woods a little farther they sink below them sometimes they are seen through them and sometimes one series of rocks appears rising above another and tho many of these objects are repeatedly seen yet seen from different stations and with new accompaniments they appear new the winding of the precipice is the magical secret by which all these enchanting scenes are produced  we cannot however call these views picturesque they are either presented from too high a point or they have little to mark them as characteristic or they do not fall into such composition as would appear to advantage on canvas but they are extremely romantic and give a loose to the most pleasing riot of imagination  these views are chiefly shown from different stands in a close walk carried along the brow of the precipice it would be invidious perhaps to remark a degree of tediousness in this walk and too much sameness in many of the views notwithstanding the general variety which inlivens them but the intention probably is not yet complete and many things are meant to be hid which are now too profusely shown as it is many years since these remarks were made everal alterations have probably since that time taken place   having seen every thing on this side of the hill the walks we pursued led us over the ridge of it to the opposite side here the ground depositing it is wild appearance assumes a more civilized form it consists of a great variety of lawns intermixed with wood and rock and tho it often rises and falls yet it descends without any violence into the country beyond it  the views on this side are not the romantic steeps of the wye but tho of another species they are equally grand they are chiefly distances consisting of the vast waters of the severn here an arm of the sea bounded by a remote country  of the mouth of the wye entering the severn  and of the town of chepstow and it is castle and abbey of all these distant objects an admirable use is made and they are shown as the rocks of the wye were on the other side sometimes in parts and sometimes all together in one station we had the scenery of both sides of the hill at once  it is a pity the ingenious embellisher of these scenes could not have been satisfied with the grand beauties of nature which he commanded the shrubberies he has introduced in this part of his improvements i fear will rather be esteemed paltry as the embellishments of a house or as the ornament of little scenes which have nothing better to recommend them a few flowering shrubs artfully composed may have their elegance and beauty but in scenes like this they are only splendid patches which injure the grandeur and simplicity of the whole   fortasse cupressum scis simulare quid hoc   sit quidvis simplex duntaxat et unum it is not the shrub which offends it is the formal introduction of it wild underwood may be an appendage of the grandest scene it is a beautiful appendage a bed of violets or lillies may enamel the ground with propriety at the root of an oak but if you introduce them artificially in a border you introduce a trifling formality and disgrace the noble object you wish to adorn  from the scenes of persfield we walked to chepstow our barge drawing too much water to pass the shallows till the return of the tide in this walk we wished for more time than we could command to examine the romantic scenes which surrounded us but we were obliged to return that evening to monmouth  the road at first affords beautiful distant views of those woody hills which had entertained us on the banks of the wye and which appeared to as much advantage when connected with the country as they had already done in union with the river but the country soon loses it is picturesque form and assumes a bleak unpleasant wildness  about seven miles from chepstow we had an extensive view into wales bounded by mountains very remote but this view tho much celebrated has little except the grandeur of extension to recommend it and yet it is possible that in some lights it may be very picturesque and that we might only have had the misfortune to see it in an unfavourable one different lights make so great a change even in the composition of landscape  at least in the apparent composition of it that they create a scene perfectly new in distance especially this is the cafe hills and valleys may be deranged awkward abruptnesses and hollows introduced and the effect of woods and castles and all the ornamental detail of a country lost on the other hand these ingredients of landscape may in reality be awkwardly introduced yet through the magical influence of light they may be altered softened and rendered pleasing  in a mountainous country particularly i have often seen during the morning hours a range of hills rearing their summits in illdisposed fantastic shapes in the afternoon all this incorrect rudeness has been removed and each misshapen summit has softened beautifully into some pleasing form  the different seasons of the year also produce the same effect when the sun rides high in summer and when in the same meridian he just skirts the horizon in winter he forms the mountaintops and indeed the whole face of a country into very different appearances  fogs also vary a distant country as much as light softening the harsh features of landscape and spreading over them a beautiful gray harmonizing tint  we remark further on this subject that scarce any landscape will stand the test of different lights some searching ray as the sun veers round will expose it is defects and hence it is that almost every landscape is seen best under some peculiar illlumination  either of an evening or of a morning or it may be of a meridian sun  during many miles we kept upon the heights and through a long and gentle descent approached monmouth before we reached it we were benighted but as far as we could judge of a country through the gray obscurity of a summerevening this seemed to abound with many beautiful woody valleys among the hills which we descended a light of this kind tho not so favorable to landscape is very favorable to the imagination this active power embodies halfsormed images and gives existence to the most illusive scenes these it rapidly combines and often composes landscapes perhaps more beautiful than any that exist in nature they are formed indeed from nature  from the most beautiful of her scenes and having been treasured up in the memory are called into these imaginary creations by some distant resemblances which strike the eye in the multiplicity of dubious surfaces that float before it  sect vi having thus navigated the wye between ross and chepstow we had such pleasing accounts of it is beautiful scenery above ross that if our time had permitted we could have wished to have explored it  a journal however fell into my hands since the first edition of this book was printed of a tour to the source of the wye and from thence through the midland counties of wales which i shall put into a little form and making a few remarks on different parts of it shall insert here for the benefit of those who may have more time than we had  from ross to hereford the great road leaves the river which is hardly once seen but it is not probable that much is lost for the whole country here has a tame appearance  the cathedral of hereford consists in many parts of rich gothic the westfront is falling fast to decay and is every year receiving more the form of a fine ruin a subscription i hear is now opened to repair it   at hereford we again meet the wye of which we have several beautiful views from the higher grounds the road now follows the course of the river to the hay winding along it is northern banks  about six miles from hereford and very little out of the road stands foxley the form of the grounds about it and the beautiful woods that surround it are said to be worth seeing my journalist says it contains a choice collection of pictures and some good drawings of landscape by the late mr price  the ruins of bradwardinecastle appear soon in view tho but little of them remains at a bridge near them you cross the wye and now traverse the south side of the river the country which had been greatly varied before begins now to form bolder swells among these mirebichhill which rises full in front continues some time before the eye as a considerable object  leaving witneybridge on the right you still continue your course along the southern bank of the river and come soon in view of the ruins of clyffordcastle where tradition informs us the celebrated rosamond spent her early life  soon after you arrive at the hay a town pleasantly situated on the wye it was formerly a roman station and was long afterward considered as a place of great strength being defended by a castle and lofty walls till owen glendouer laid it in ashes in one of those expeditions in which he drove harry bullinbroke   thrice from the banks of wye and sandybottomed severn  if you have time to make a little excursion you will find about half way between the hay and abergavenny the ruins of llantonypriory dugdale describes it in his monasticon as a scene richly adorned with wood but dugdale lived a century ago which is a term that will produce or destroy the finest scenery it has had the latter effect here for the woods about llantonypriory are now totally destroyed and the ruin is wholly naked and desolate  after this excursion you return again to the hay and continue your rout to bualt still on the south side of the river  on the north side about four miles beyond the hay stands maeslough the ancient seat of the howarths the house shows the neglect of it is possessor but the situation is in it is kind perhaps one of the finest in wales the view from the halldoor is spoken of as wonderfully amusing a lawn extends to the river which incircles it with a curve at the distance of half a mile the banks are enriched with various objects among which two bridges with winding roads and the tower of glasburychurch surrounded by wood are conspicuous a distant country equally enriched fills the remote parts of the landscape which is terminated by mountains one of the bridges in this view that at glasbury is remarkably light and elegant consisting of several arches  how these various objects are brought together i know not i should fear there were too many of them  as you continue your rout to bualt the country grows grander and more picturesque the valley of the wye becomes contracted and the road runs at the bottom along the edge of the water  it is possible i think the wye may in this place be more beautiful than in any other part of it is course between ross and chepstow the grandeur and beauty of it is banks are it is chief praise the river itself has no other merit than that of a winding surface of smooth water but here added to the same decoration from it is banks the wye itself assumes a more beautiful character pouring over shelving rocks and forming itself into eddies and cascades which a solemn parading stream through a flat channel cannot exhibit  an additional merit also accrues to such a river from the different forms it assumes according to the fullness or emptiness of the stream there are rocks of all shapes and sizes which always vary the appearance of the water as it rushes over or plays among them so that such a river to a picturesque eye is a continued fund of new entertainment  the wye also in this part of it is course still receives farther beauty from the woods which adorn it is banks and which the navigation of the river in it is lower reaches cannot allow here the whole is perfectly rural and unincumbered even a boat i believe is never seen beyond the hay the boat itself might be an ornament but we would not give up for it such a river as would not suffer a boat  some beauties however the smooth river possesses above the rapid one in the latter you cannot have those reflections which are so ornamental to the former  nor can you have in the rapid river the opportunity of contemplating the grandeur of it is banks from the surface of the water  unless indeed the road winds close with the river at the bottom when perhaps you may see them with additional advantage  the foundation of these criticisms on smooth and agitated water is this when water is exhibited in small quantities it wants the agitation of a torrent a cascade or some other adventitious circumstance to give it consequence but when it is spread out in the reach of some capital river  in a lake  or an arm of the sea  it is then able to support it is own dignity in the former case it aims at beauty in the latter at grandeur now the wye has in no part of it is course a quantity of water sufficient to give it any great degree of grandeur so that of consequence the smooth part must on the whole yield to the more agitated which possesses more beauty  in this wild enchanting country stands llangoed the house of sir edward williams it is adorned like the house at foxley with woods and playing grounds but is a scene totally different here however are finer trees than those at foxley which when examined as individuals appear to great advantage tho my journalist has heard that some of the finest of them have lately been cut down  the road still continues through the same beautiful country along the banks of the wye and in a few miles farther brings you to bualt this town is seated in a pleasant vale surrounded with woods  a little beyond bualt where the river irvon falls into the wye is a field still marked by tradition in which llewellin the last prince of wales was put to death some historians say he was killed in battle but the traditional account of his being killed near bualt seems more probable and that he fell by the hands of an assassin when edward invaded wales we are informed that llewellin had entrenched himself in the fastnesses of snowdon here he might probably have foiled his adversary but some of his troops having been successful against the earl of surrey one of edwards generals llewellin came down from his strong holds with the hope of improving his advantage and offered edward battle llewellin was totally routed and tradition says that in his flight into glamorganshire he slept the night before he was murdered at llechryd which is now a farmhouse here the farrier who shod his horse knew him under his disguise and betrayed him to the people of bualt who put him to death and are to this day stigmatized with the name of brad wyr y bualht or the traitors of bualt  at bualt you cross the wye again and now pursue your rout along the north side of the river the same grand scenery continues  lofty banks  woody vales  a rocky channel and a rapid stream winding through it  soon after you come to the sulphurous springs of llanydrindod which you leave on the right and crossing the river ithon you reach rhaader a town about thirteen miles beyond bualt  to a welshman the appearance of the wye at rhaader need not to be described the word signifies a waterfall there is no cascade indeed of consequence near the place but the river being pent up within close rocky banks and the channel being steep the whole is a succession of waterfalls  as you leave rhaader you begin to approach the sources of the wye but the river having now lost it is chief supplies becomes more and more insignificant and as the country becomes wilder and more mountainous the scenery of the river is now disproportioned there is not a sufficiency of water in the landscape to balance the land  llangerig which is about twelve miles from rhaader is the last village you find on the banks of the wye soon after all signs of inhabitancy cease you begin to ascend the skirts of plinlimmon and after rising gradually about ten miles from llangerig you arrive at the sources of a river which through a course of so many leagues has afforded you so much entertainment  it is a singular circumstance that within a quarter of a mile of the wellhead of the wye arises the severn the two springs are nearly alike but the fortunes of rivers like those of men are owing to various little circumstances of which they take the advantage in the early part of their course the severn meeting with a track of ground rising on the right soon after it leaves plinlimmon receives a push toward the northeast in this direction it continues it is course to shrewsbury there it meets another obstruction which turns it as far to the southeast afterward still meeting with favorable opportunities it successfully improves them enlarging it is circle sweeping from one country to another receiving large accessions every where of wealth and grandeur till at length with a full tide it enters the ocean as an arm of the sea  in the mean time the wye meeting with no particular opportunities of any consequence to improve it is fortunes never makes any figure as a capital river and at length becomes subservient to that very severn whose birth and early setting out in life were exactly similar to it is own  between these two rivers is comprehended a district consisting of great part of the counties of montgomery radnor salop worcester hereford and gloucester of the last county merely that beautiful portion is enclosed which forms the forest of dean  the country about plinlimmon vast wild and unfurnished is neither adorned with accompaniments to be a scene of beauty nor should i suppose from the accounts i have received that it is dreary wastes could afford such materials as could form a scene of grandeur  tho grandeur consist in simplicity it must take some form of landscape otherwise it is a shapeless waste  monstrous without proportions  as there is nothing therefore in these inhospitable regions to detain you long and no refreshment to be had except a draught of pure water from the fountains of the wye you will soon be inclined to return to rhaader  from rhaader my journal leads into cardiganshire crossing the wye you ascend a very steep mountain about seven miles over then skirting the banks of a sweet little river the elan which falls into the wye you pass through a corner of montgomeryshire which brings you to the verge of cardiganshire  the passage into this county is rather tremendous you stand on very high ground and see extending far below a long narrow contracted valley the perspective from the top gives it rather the appearance of a chasm down one of the precipitous sides of this valley i understand the road hurries you while the river istwith at the bottom is ready to receive you if your foot should slip or your horse stumble  having descended safely to the bottom of the valley and having now passed through it you cross the river at it is close over a handsome bridge and arrive at the village of pentre near this place is havod the seat of mr johnes member for radnorshire which affords so much beautiful scenery that you should by no means pass by it it will open suddenly upon you at the close of a beautiful approach the house is new built in a style i learn between gothic and moorish it is a style of building i am not acquainted with but i am informed it has a good effect it is a large commodious mansion richly furnished one thing is worth observing over the chimney of the dining room is placed or to be placed for i believe the house is not finished a neat tablet of white marble with this inscription  prout cuique libido eft siccat inequales cyathos    the welsh gentry are very remarkable for their hospitality which sometimes i have heard will not allow the inequales cyathos but brings all to a brimming level the spirit of this inscription i hope is diffusing itself more and more over the country  but elegant houses and rich furniture are every where to be found the scenery at havod is the object and such scenery is rarely met with  the walks are divided into what is called the ladyswalk a circuit of about three miles  and the gentlemanswalk about six to these is added a more extensive round which might properly come under the denomination of a riding if in all parts it was accessible to horse men  the general groundplot of these walks and the scenery through which they convey you is this  the river istwith runs at the distance of about a quarter of a mile from the house which stands upon a lawn consisting of varied grounds descending to the river it is a rapid stream and it is channel is filled with rocks like many other welsh streams which form cataracts and cascades in various parts  more broken and convulsed than the wye about bualt it is banks consist of great variety of wooded recesses  hills  sides of mountains  and contracted valleys  thwarting and opposing each other in various forms and adorned with little cascades running every where among them in guttered chasms of the grandeur and beauty of these scenes i can speak as an eyewitriess for tho i was never on the spot i have seen a large collection of drawings and sketches not fewer than between twenty and thirty which were taken from them  through this variety of grand scenery the several walks are conducted the views shift rapidly from one to another each being characterized by some circumstance peculiar to itself  the artificial ornaments are such chiefly as are necessary many bridges are wanted both in crossing the istwith and the several streams which run into it from the surrounding hills they are varied as much as that species of architecture will admit from the stone arch to the alpine plank  in one place you see a cottage pleasantly seated among the thickets of a woody hill which mr johnes intends to fit up for the accommodation of a band of musicians for so a pack of hounds may be called among the hills and dales and ecchoing rocks of these grand scenes  among the natural curiosities of the place is a noble cascade sixty feet high which is seen through a cavern partly natural and partly artificial you enter it by a passage cut through a rock four feet broad and seven high which continues about twenty yards and brings you into a very lofty perforated cavern through which you see the cascade to great advantage  from the scenes of havod you continue your excursions among some other grand and beautiful scenery in that country  you are carried first to the devils bridge about four miles from havod i do not clearly understand the nature of the scenery here from the account given in my journal but i should suppose it is only one grand piece of foreground without any distance or accompaniments and probably one of those scenes which is itself sufficient to form a picture the plan of it is a rocky chasm over which is thrown an arch between these cheeks and just beneath the bridge the river funnach falls abruptly down the space of several yards and afterward meeting with other steeps makes it is way after a few of these interruptions into the rhydol a little below the bridge i should suppose is an interesting object it consists i understand of two arches one thrown over the other the under one which is that said to be built by the devil was not thought sufficiently strong the common people suppose when he built it he had some mischief in his head  from the devils bridge you visit another called monks bridge where the same kind of scenery is exhibited under a different modification  from thence you descend into the vale of rhydol called so from the river of that name which passes through it  if the welsh counties distinguished for so much beauty of scenery of various kinds are remarkable for preeminence in any mode i think it is in their vales their lakes are infinitely exceeded both in grandeur and beauty by those of cumberland westmoreland and scotland nor are their mountains as far as i have observed of such picturesque form as many as i have seen in those countries they are often of a heavy lumpish kind for there are orders of architecture in mountains as well as in palaces their rivers i allow are often very picturesque and so are their seacoast views but their vales and valleys i think exceed those of any country i ever saw  the vale of rhydol is described as a very grand and extensive scene continuing not less than ten miles among rocks hanging woods and varied ground which in some parts becomes mountainous while the river is every where a beautiful object and twice or three times in it is passage through the vale is interrupted in it is course and formed into a cascade this is a circumstance in a vale i think rather uncommon in a contracted valley it is frequent but an extended vale as i apprehend this to be is seldom so interrupted as not to give way to the river on one side or the other i can easily however imagine that when the whole vale is interrupted as i conceive it to be here it will occasion a very beautiful scene if the eye from so good a foreground has such an elevated station as will enable it to trace the winding of the vale as a distance beyond the cascade but this is perhaps reasoning as we often do on higher subjects without sufficient grounds on the spot i should probably find that all these conceptions are wrong  that the obstrudtions of the river in the vale of rhydol are no advantage to the scene  or perhaps after all that the vale of rhydol does not deserve that name but is only a contracted valley of considerable length  at the end of this vale or valley by whichsoever of these names it ought to be distinguished stand the ruins of abyrysthwickcastle of this fortress little now remains but a solitary tower overlooking the sea once it was the residence of the great cadwallader and in all the welshwars was considered as a fortress of the first consequence even so late as the civil wars of the last century it was esteemed a place of great strength  but the rich leadmines in it is neighborhood were the basis of it is glory these mines are said to have yielded near a hundred ounces of silver from a ton of lead and to have produced a profit of two thousand pounds a month here sir hugh middleton made that vast fortune which he expended afterward on the new river but a gentleman of the name of bushel raised these mines to their greatest height he was allowed by charles the first the privilege of setting up a mint in this castle for the benefit of paying his workmen here therefore all the business of the mines was transacted which made abyrysthwickcastle a place of more consequence and resort than any other place in wales king charles also appointed mr bushel governor of the isle of lundy where he made a harbor for the security of his vessels which carried the produce of his mines up the severn when the civil wars broke out he had an opportunity of showing his gratitude which he did with the magnificence of a prince he clothed the kings whole army and offered his majesty a loan which was considered as a gift of forty thousand pounds afterward when charles was pressed by the parliament mr bushel raised him a regiment among his miners at his own expense  from the vale of rhydol you seek again the banks of the istwitb and enter a vale which takes it name from the river  this scene is another proof of what i have just observed of the welsh vales from the accounts i have heard of it i should suppose it a scene of extraordinary beauty  less romantic than the vale of rhydol but more sylvan nature has introduced the rock more sparingly but she has made great amends by wood tho there is one part of it mentioned in which an immense rock forms a very grand feature  it is much easier however to conceive the variety of these scenes than to describe them natures alphabet consists only of four letters wood  water  rock  and ground and yet with these four letters she forms such varied compositions such infinite combinations as no language with an alphabet of twentyfour can describe  from the vale of istwith you may visit the ruins of the abbey of strata florida but as far as i find there is little among those ruins worth notice except a saxon gateway and that i should think can hardly be an object of much beauty  the painter therefore who can make little use of this old abbey consigns it over to the antiquarian who tells you that it was formerly the sacred repository of the bones of several of the welsh princes and that here the records and acts of the principality were preserved for many generations  from the ruins of strata florida you return to hereford through rhosfair rhaader pinabout and new radnor in which rout i find nothing in my journal mentioned as worth notice tho it is hardly possible that in so large a tract of rough country there should not be many picturesque passages    sect vii from monmouth to abergavenny by raglandcastle the road is a good stone causeway as the roads in these parts commonly are and leads through a pleasant enclosed country discovering on each side extensive views of rich cultivation  raglandcastle seemed to stand as we saw it from the heights in a vale but as we descended it took an elevated station it is a large and very noble ruin more perfect than ruins of this kind commonly are it contains two areas within the ditch into each of which you enter by a lofty and deep gateway  the buildings which circumscribe the first area consisit of the kitchen and offices it is amusing to hear stories of ancient hospitality here are the remains of an oven said our conductor which was large enough to bake a whole ox and of a firerange wide enough to roast him  the grand hall or banquettingroom a large and lofty apartment forms the screen between the two areas and is perfect except the roof the musicgallery may be distinctly traced and the butteries which divide the hall from a parlour near the hall is shown a narrow chapel  on viewing the comparative size of halls and chapels in old castles one can hardly at first avoid observing that the founders of these ancient structures supposed a much greater number of people would meet together to feast than to pray but yet we may perhaps account for the thing without calling in question the piety of our ancestors the hall was meant to regale a whole country while the chapel was intended only for the private use of the inhabitants of the castle  the whole area of the first enclosure is vaulted and contains cellars dungeons and other subterraneous apartments  the buildings of the second area are confined merely to chambers  near the castle stands the citadel a large octagonal tower two or three sides of which are still remaining this tower is incircled by a separate moat and was formerly joined to the castle by a drawbridge  raglandcastle owes it is present picturesque form to cromwell who laid his iron hands upon it and shattered it into ruin a window is shown through which a girl in the garrison by waving a handkerchief introduced his troops  from raglandcastle the views are still extensive the roads enclosed and the country rich the distances are skirted by the brecknochills among which the sugar loaf makes a remarkable appearance  the brecknochills are little more than gentle swellings cultivated to the top for many miles they kept their station in a distant range on each side but by degrees they began to close in approximating more and more and leaving in front a narrow pass between them through which an extensive country appeared through this pass we hoped the progress of our road would lead us as it seemed to open into a fair and beautiful country  it led us first to abergavenny a small town which has formerly been fortified lying under the hills we approached it by the castle of which nothing remains but a few staring ruins  from hence we were carried as we expected through the pass which we had long observed at a distance it opened into the vale of usk  the vale of usk is a delightful scene the river from whence it borrows it is name winds through the middle of it and the hills on both sides are diversified with woods and lawns in many places they are partially cultivated we could distinguish little cottages and farms faintly traced along their shadowy sides which at such a distance rather varied and enriched the scene than impressed it with any regular and unpleasing shapes    through this kind of road we passed many miles the usk continued every where our amusing companion and if at any time it made a more devious curve than usual we were sure to meet it again at the next turn our passage through the vale was still more inlivened by many little foaming rills which crossed the road some of them so large as to make bridges necessary and two ruined castles with which at proper intervals the country is adorned  after leaving the latter of them called tretowercastle we mounted some high grounds which gave a variety to the scene tho not so picturesque an exhibition of it here the road brought us in view of langorspool which is no very inconsiderable lake as we descended these heights the usk met us once more at the bottom and conducted us into brecknoc  brecknoc is a very romantic place abounding with broken grounds torrents dismantled towers and ruins of every kind i have seen few places where a landscapepainter might get a collection of better ideas the castle has once been large and is still a ruin of dignity it is easy to trace the main body the citadel and all the parts of ancient fortification  in many places indeed these works are too much ruined even for picturesque use yet ruined as they are as far as they go they are very amusing the arts of modern fortification are ill calculated for the purposes of landscape the angular and formal works of vauban and cohorn when it comes to their turn to be superseded by works of superior invention will make a poor figure in the annals of picturesque beauty no eye will ever be delighted with their ruins while not the least fragment of a british or a norman castle exists that is not surveyed with delight  but the most beautiful scenery we saw at brecknoc is about the abbey we had a view of it tho but a transient view from a little bridge in the neighborhood there we saw a sweet limpid stream glistening over a bed of pebbles and forming two or three cascades as it hurried to the bridge it issued from a wood with which it is banks were beautifully hung amidst the gloom arose the ruins of the abbey tinged with a bright ray which discovered a profusion of rich gothic workmanship and exhibited in pleasing contrast the gray stone of which the ruins are composed with the feathering foliage that floated round them but we had not time to examine how all these beauteous parts were formed into a whole  the imagination formed it after the vision vanished but tho it might possibly create a whole more agreeable to the rules of painting yet it could scarce do justice to the beauty of the parts  from brecknoc in our road to trecastle we enter a country very different from the vale of usk this too is a vale but nature always marks even kindred scenes with some peculiar character the vale of usk is almost one continued winding sweep the road now played among a variety of hills the whole seemed to consist of one great vale divided into a multiplicity of parts all together they wanted unity but separately afforded a number of those pleasing passages which treasured up in the memory become the ingredients of future landscapes  sometimes the road instead of winding round the hills took the shortest way over them in general they are cultivated like those of the vale of usk but as the cultivation in many of them is brought too near the eye it becomes rather offensive our best ideas were obtained from such as were adorned with wood and fell in various forms into the valleys below  in these scenes we lost the usk our sweet playful companion in the vale but other rivers of the same kind frequently met us tho they seldom continued long disappearing in haste and hiding themselves among the little tufted recesses at the bottom of the hills  in general the welsh gentlemen in these parts seem fond of whitening their houses which gives them a disagreeable glare a speck of white is often beautiful but white in profusion is of all tints the most inharmonious a white feat at the corner of a wood or a few white cattle grazing in a meadow inliven a scene perhaps more than if the seat or the cattle had been of any other color they have meaning and effect but a front and two staring wings an extent of rails a huge chinese bridge the tower of a church and a variety of other large objects which we often see daubed over with white make a disagreeable appearance and unite ill with the general simplicity of natures coloring  nature never colors in this offensive way her surfaces are never white the chalky cliff is the only permanent object of the kind which she allows to be here is and this seems rather a force upon her from the boisterous action of a furious element but even here it is her constant endeavor to correct the offensive tint she hangs her cliffs with sarmphire and other marine plants or she stains them with various hues so as to remove in part at least the disgusting glare the western end of the isle of wight called the needlecliffs is a remarkable instance of this these rocks are of a substance nearly resembling chalk but nature has so reduced their unpleasant luster by a variety of chastising tints that in most lights they have even a beautiful effect she is continually at work also in the same manner on the white cliffs of dover tho her endeavors here are more counteracted by a greater exposure but here and in all other places were it not for the intervention of foreign causes she would in time throw her green mantle over every naked and exposed part of her surface  in these remarks i mean only to insinuate  that white is a hue which nature seems studious to expunge from all her works except in the touch of a flower an animal a cloud a wave or some other diminutive or transient object  and that her mode of coloring should always be the model of curs  in animadverting however on white objects i would only censure the mere raw tint it may easily be corrected and turned into stonecolours of various hues which tho light if not too light may often have a good effect  mr lock who did me the favor to overlook these papers made some remarks on this part of my subject which are so new and so excellent that i cannot without impropriety take the credit of them myself  white offers a more extended scale of light and shadow than any other color when near and is more susceptible of the predominant tint of the air when distant the transparency of it is shadows which in near objects partake so little of darkness that they are rather second lights discover without injuring the principal light all the details of surfaces  i partake however of your general dislike to the color and though i have seen a very splendid effect from an accidental light on a white object yet i think it a hue which oftener injures than it improves the scene it particularly disturbs the air in it is office of graduating distances shows objects nearer than they really are and by pressing them on the eye often gives them an importance which from their form and situation they are not entitled to  the white of snow is so active and refractory as to resist the discipline of every harmonizing principle i think i never saw mont blanc and the range of snows which run through savoy in union with the rest of the landscape except when they were tinged by the rays of the rising and setting sun or participated of some other tint of the surrounding sky in the clear and colorless days so frequent in that country the glaciers are always out of tune  sect viii from trecastle we ascended a steep of three miles which the country people call a pitch it raised us to a level with the neighboring hills whose rugged summits formed all the landscape we had no sweet views into the valleys below presented themselves all around was wild and barren  from these heights we descended gently through a space of seven miles as we approached the bottom we saw at a distance the town of llandovery seated in the meadows below at the conflux of several rivulets unadorned with wood it made only a naked appearance but light wreaths of smoke rising from it in several parts showed that it was inhabited while a ray of the setting sun singled it out among the objects of the vale and gave it some little consequence in the landscape as we descended into it it is importance increased we were met by an old castle which had formerly defended it tho nothing remains except the ruins of the citadel  llandovery stands at the entrance of the vale of towy which like other vales receives it is name from the river that winds through it this delightful scene opened before us as we left llandovery in our way to llandilo which stands about twelve miles lower in the vale  the vale of towy is still less a scene of cultivation than that of usk the woodland views are more frequent and the whole more wild and simple the scenery seems precisely of that kind with which a great master in landscape was formerly enamoured   juvat arva videre non rastris hominum non ulli obnoxia curae rura mihi and rigui placeant in vallibus amnes flumina amem sylvasque  in this vale the river towy tho it frequently met us and always kept near us yet did not so constantly appear and bear us such close company as the usk had done before some heights too we ascended but such heights as were only proper stands from whence we viewed in greater perfection the beauties of the vale  this is the scene which dyer celebrated in his poem of grongarhill dyer was bred a painter and had here a picturesque subject but he does not give us so good a landscape as might have been expected we have no where a complete formed distance tho it is the great idea suggested by such a vale as this no where any touches of that beautiful obscurity which melts a variety of objects into one rich whole here and there we have a few accidental strokes which belong to distance tho seldom masterly as where he describes the beautiful form which removed cultivation takes how close and small the hedges lie what streaks of meadow cross the eye or a distant spire seen by sunset rising from the woods the spire seems from far ascending fire   or the aerial view of a distant hill  yon summits soft and fair clad in colors of the air which to those who journey near barren brown and rough appear     i call them accidental because they are not employed in producing a landscape nor do they in fact unite in any such idea but are rather introductory to some moral sentiment which however good in itself is here forced and mistimed  dinevawrcastle which stands about a mile from llandilo and the scenery around it were the next objects of our curiosity this castle is seated on one of the sides of the vale of towy where it occupies a bold eminence richly adorned with wood it was used not long ago as a mansion but mr rice the proprietor of it has built a handsome house in his park about a mile from the castle which however he still preserves as one of the greatest ornaments of his place  this castle also is taken notice of by dyer in his grongarhill and seems intended as an object in a distance but his distances i observed are all in confusion and indeed it is not easy to sepavate them from his foregrounds  the landscape he gives us in which the castle of dinevawr makes a part is seen from the brow of a distant hill the first object that meets his eye is a wood it is just beneath him and he easily distinguishes the several trees of which it is composed the gloomy pine the poplar blue the yellow beech the sable yew the slender fir that taper grows the sturdy oak with broadspread boughs   this is perfectly right objects so near the eye should be distinctly marked what next strikes him is a purplegrove that is i presume a grove which has gained it is purplehue from distance this is no doubt very just coloring tho it is here i think introduced rather too early in the landscape the blue and purple tints belong chiefly to the most removed objects which seem not here to be intended thus far however i should not greatly cavil  the next object he surveys is a level lawn from which a hill crowned with a castle which is meant i am informed for that of dinevawr arises here his great want of keeping appears his castle instead of being marked with still fainter colors than the purplegrove is touched with all the strength of a foreground you see the very ivy creeping upon it is walls transgressions of this kind are common in descriptive poetry innumerable instances might be collected from much better poems than grongarhill but i mention only the inaccuracies of an author who as a painter should at least have observed the most obvious principles of his art  with how much more picturesque beauty does milton introduce a distant castle towers and battlements he sees bosomed high in tufted trees   here we have all the indistinct coloring which obscures a distant object we do not see the irongrated window the portcullis the ditch or the rampart we can just distinguish a castle from a tree and a tower from a battlement  the scenery around dinevawrcastle is very beautiful consisting of a rich profusion of wood and lawn but what particularly recommends it is the great variety of the ground i know few places where a painter might study the inequalities of a surface with more advantage  nothing gives so just an idea of the beautiful swellings of ground as those of water where it has sufficient room to undulate and expand in ground which is composed of refractory materials you are presented often with harsh lines angular insertions and disagreeable abruptnesses in water whether in gentle or in agitated motion all is easy all is softened into itself and the hills and the valleys play into each other in a variety of beautiful forms in agitated water abruptnesses indeed there are but yet they are such as in some part or other unite properly with the surface around them and are on the whole perfectly harmonious now if the ocean in any of these swellings and agitations could be arrested and fixed it would produce that pleasing variety which we admire in ground hence it is common to fetch our images from water and apply them to land we talk of an undulating line a playing lawn and a billowy surface and give a much stronger and more adequate idea by such imagery than plain language can possibly present  the woods which adorn these beautiful scenes about dinevawrcastle and which are clumped with great beauty consist chiefly of the finest oak some of them of large spanish chestnuts there are a few and but a few young plantations  the picturesque scenes which this place affords are numerous wherever the castle appears and it appears almost every where a landscape purely picturesque is generally presented the ground is so beautifully disposed that it is almost impossible to have bad composition and the opposite side of the vale often appears as a background and makes a pleasing distance  some where among the woody scenes of dinevawr spenser has conceived with that splendour of imagination which brightens all his descriptions the cave of merlin to be seated whether there is any opening in the ground which favors the fiction i find no account the stanzas however are too much in place to be omitted  to maridunum that is now by change of name cayrmerdin called they took their way there the wise merlin whilom wont they say to make his won low underneath the ground in a deep delve far from the view of day that of no living wight he mote be found when so he counseled with his sprights incompast round and if thou ever happen that same way to travel go to see that dreadful place it is a hideous hollow cavelike bay under a rock that lies a little space from the swift barry tumbling down apace emongst the woody hills of dinevawr but dare thou not i charge in any case to enter into that same baleful bower for fear the cruel fiends should thee unwares devour but standing high aloft low lay thine ear and there such ghastly noise of iron chains and brazen caudrons thou shall rombling hear which thousand sprights with long enduring pains do toss that it will stun thy feeble brains and oftentimes great groans and grievous stounds when too huge toil and labor them constrains and oftentimes loud strokes and ringing sounds from under that deep rock molt horribly rebounds book iii cant    as we returned from dinevawrcastle into the road a noble scene opened before us it is a distant view of a grand circular part of the vale of towy circular at least in appearance surrounded by hills one behind anoanother and forming a vast amphitheatre through this expanse which is rich to profusion with all the objects of cultivation melted together into one mass by distance the towy winds in various meanders the eye cannot trace the whole serpentine course of the river but sees it here and there in glittering spots which gives the imagination a pleasing employment in making out the whole the nearest hills partake of the richness of the vale the distant hills which rise gently above the others seem barren    sect ix from dinevawrcastle we set out across the country for neath a good turnpikeroad we were assured would lead us thither but we were told much of the difficulty of passing the mountain as they emphatically call a ridge of very high ground which lay before us  though we had left the vale of towy the country continued to wear the same face of hill and dale which it had so long worn on the right we had still a distant view of the scenery of dinevawrcastle which appeared like a grand woody bank the woods also of goldengrove varied the scene soon after other castles seated loftily on rising grounds adorned other vales truslancastle on the right and kirkennel on the left  but all these beautiful scenes by degrees were closed castles and winding rivers and woody banks were left behind one after another and we approached nearer and nearer the bleak mountain which spread it is dark mantle athwart the view  it did not however approach precipitately tho it had long blotted out all distance yet it is environs afforded a present scene and partook of the beautiful country we had passed the ground about it is foot was agreeably disposed swelling into a variety of little knolls covered with oak which a foaming rivulet winding along shaped into tufted islands and peninsulas of different forms wearing away the soil in some parts from the roots of the trees and in others delving deep channels while the mountain afforded a dark solemn background to the whole  at length we began to ascend it is steeps but before we had risen too high we turned round to take a retrospect of all the rich scenes together which we had left behind it was a noble view distance melting into distance till the whole was closed by a semicircle of azure mountains scarce distinguishable from the azure sky which absorbed them  still ascending the spiral road round the shaggy side of the mountain we arrived at what is called it is gate here all idea of cultivation ceased that was not deplorable but with it our turnpikeroad ceased also which was finished on this side no farther than the mountaingate we had gotten a guide however to conduct us over the pathless desert but it being too steep and rugged to ascend on wheels we were obliged to lighten our carriage and ascend on foot  in the midst of our labor our guide called out that he saw a storm coming on along the tops of the mountains a circumstance indeed which in these hilly countries cannot often be avoided we asked him how far it was off he answered ten minutes in less time sky mountains valleys were all wrapped in one cloud of driving rain and obscurity  our recompense consisted in following with our eye the rear of the storm observing through it is broken skirts a thousand beautiful effects and halfformed images which were continually opening lost and varying till the sun breaking out the whole resplendent landscape appeared again with double radiance under the leaden gloom of the retiring tempest  when we arrived at the top of the mountain we found a level plain which continued at least two miles it was a noble terrace but was too widely spread to give us a display of much distant scenery  at length we began to descend the mountain and soon met an excellent turnpikeroad down which we slid swiftly in an elegant spiral and found when we came to the bottom that we had spent near four hours in surmounting this great obstruction  having thus passed the mount cenis of this country we fell into the same kind of beautiful scenery on this side of it which we had left on the other only here the scene was continually shifting as if by magical interposition  we were first presented with a view of a deep woody glen lying below us which the eye could not penetrate resting only on the tops and tuftings of the trees  this suddenly vanished and a grand rocky bank arose in front richly adorned with wood  it was instantly gone and we were shut up in a close woody lane  in a moment the lane opened on the right and we had a view of an enchanting vale  we caught it is beauties as a vision only in an instant they fled and in their room arose two bold woody promontories we could just discover between them as they floated past a creek or the mouth of a river or a channel of the sea we knew not what it was but it seemed divided by a stretch of land of dingy hue which appeared like a sandbank  this scene shifting immediately arose on our left a vast hill covered with wood through which here and there projected huge masses of rock  in a few moments it vanished and a grove of trees suddenly shot up in it is room  but before we could even discover of what species they were the rocky hill which had just appeared on the left winding rapidly round presented itself full in front it had now acquired a more tremendous form the wood which had before hid it is terrors was now gone and the rocks were all left in their native wildness every where bursting from the soil  many of the objects which had floated so rapidly past us if we had had time to examine them would have given us sublime and beautiful hints in landscape some of them seemed even well combined and ready prepared for the pencil but in so quick a succession one blotted out another  the country at length giving way on both fides a view opened which suffered the eye to rest upon it  the river neath covered with shipping was spread before us it is banks were enriched with wood amidst which arose the ruins of neathabbey with it is double tower beyond the river the country arose in hills which were happily adorned when we saw them in a clear serene evening with one or two of those distant forges or charcoalpits which we admired on the banks of the wye wreathing a light veil of smoke along their summits and blending them with the sky  through this landscape we entered the town of neath which with it is old castle and bridges excited many picturesque ideas  sect x as we left neath a grand vista of woody mountains pursuing each other along the river and forming no doubt some enchanting vale if we had had time to examine it stretched into remote distance  the vistas of art are tame and formal they consist of streets with the unvarying repetition of doors and windows  or they consist of trees planted nicely in rows a succession of mere vegetable columns  or they consist of some other species of regularity but natures vistas are of a different cast she forms them sometimes of mountains sometimes of rocks and sometimes of woods but all her works even of this formal kind are the works of a master if the idea of regularity be impressed on the general form the parts are broken with a thousand varieties her vistas are models to paint from  in this before us both the mountains themselves were beautiful and the perspective combination of them  the broken ground about a copperwork a little beyond the town would afford hints for a noble landscape two contiguous hills appear as if riven asunder and lay open a very picturesque scene of rocky fragments interspersed with wood through which a torrent forcing it is way forms two or three cascades before it reaches the bottom  a little beyond this the views which had entertained us as we entered neath entertained us a second time as we left it the river covered with shipping presented itself again the woody scenery arose on it is banks and the abbey appeared among the woods tho in different perspective and in a more removed situation  here too we were again presented with those two woody promontories which we had seen before with a creek or channel between them divided by what seemed a sandbank we had now approached much nearer and found we had been right in our conjecture the extensive object we had seen was the bank of margam which when the sea retires is a vast sandy flat  from hence we had for a considerable time continued views on the left of grand woody promontories pursuing each other all rich to profusion with seaviews on the right such an intermixture of highlands and sea where the objects are beautiful and well disposed makes in general a very pleasing mode of composition the roughness of the mountains above and the smooth expanse of the waters below wonderfully aid each other by the force of contrast  from these views we were hurried at once upon a black seacoast which gave a kind of relief to the eye surfeited with rich landscape to satiety margamsandbank which seen partially afforded a sweet chastising tint to the verdure of the woody promontories through which we had twice seen it became now when unsupported and spread abroad in all it is extension a cold disgusting object  but relief was every where at hand and we seldom saw it long without some intervention of woody scenery  as we approached the river abravon our views degenerated still more margamsandbank which was now only the boundary of marshes became offensive to the eye and tho on the left the woody hills continued still shooting after us yet they had lost their pleasing shapes no variety of breaks like the members of architecture gave a lightness and elegance to their forms no mantling furniture invested their sides nor tufted fringe adorned their promontories nor clumps of scattered oak discovered the sky through interstices along their towering summits instead of this they had degenerated into mere uniform lumps of matter and were every where overspread with one heavy uninterrupted bush  of this kind were lord mansells woods which covered a promontory time with it is lenient hand may hereafter hang new beauties upon these hills when it has corrected their heaviness by improving the luxuriance of youthful foliage into the lighter forms of aged trees  from lord mansells to pyle which stands on a bleak coast the spirit of the country is totally lost  here we found the people employed in sending provisions to the shore where a dutch west india ship had just been wrecked fifteen lives were lost and among them the whole family of a zealand merchant who was bringing his children for education to amsterdam the populace came down in large bodies to pillage the wreck which the officers of the customs and gentlemen of the country assembled to protect  it was a busy scene composed of multitudes of men carts horses and horsemen  the bustle of a crowd is not illadapted to the pencil but the management of it requires great artifice the whole must be massed together and considered as one body  i mean not to have the whole body so agglomerated as to consist of no detached groups but to have these groups of which there should not be more than two or three appear to belong to one whole by the artifice of composition and the effect of light  this great whole must be varied also in it is parts it is not enough to stick bodies and heads together figures must be contrasted with figures and life spirit and action must pervade the whole  thus in managing a crowd and in managing a landscape the same general rules are to be observed tho the parts must be contrasted the whole must be combined but the difficulty is the greater in a crowd as it is parts consisting of animated bodies require a nicer observation of form being all similar likewise they require more art in the combination of them  composition indeed has never a more difficult work than when it is engaged in combining a crowd when a number of people all colored alike are to be drawn up in rank and file it is not in the art of man to combine them in a picturesque manner we can introduce a rencounter of horse where all regularity is broken  or we can exhibit a few general officers with their aids de camp on the foreground and cover a fighting army with smoke at a distance but the files of war the regiment or squadron in military array admit no picturesque composition modern heroes therefore must not look to have their achievements recorded on canvas till they abrogate their formal arts  but even when we take all the advantages of shape and color with which the human form can be varied or clothed we find it still a matter of difficulty enough  i do not immediately recollect having seen a crowd better managed than hogarth has managed one in the last print of his idle prentice in combining the multifarious company which attends the spectacle of an execution he has exemplified all the observations i have made i have not the print before me but i have often admired it in this light nor do i recollect observing any thing offensive in it which is rare in the management of such a multitude of figures  the subject before us is as well adapted as any species of crowd can be to exhibit the beauties of composition horses carts and men make a good assemblage and this variety in the parts would appear to great advantage in contrast with the simplicity of a winding shore and of a stranded ship a large dark object heeling on one side in a corner of the piece  sect xi from pyle the country grows still worse till at last it degenerates into a vile heath and continues a long time totally unadorned or at best with a few transient beauties  at bridgend where we meet the river ogmore a beautiful landscape bursts again upon us woody banks arise on both sides on the right especially which continue a considerable way marking the course of the liver on the left is a rich distance  from hence we pass in view of cultivated valleys into which the rich distance we had just seen began to form itself while the road winds over a kind of terrace above them an old castle also inriches the scene till at length the terrace giving way we sink into the vale and enter cowbridge  the heights beyond cowbridge give us the first view of the bristol channel on the right the country between the eye and the water has a marshy appearance but being well blended and the lines broken it makes a tolerable distance the road passes through pleasant enclosed lanes  at the fifth stone before we reached cardiff we had a most grand and extensive view from the heights of clanditham it contained an immense stretch of country melting gradually into a faint blue semicircle of mountains which edged the horizon  this scene indeed painted in syllables words and sentences appears very like some of the scenes we had met with before but in nature it was very different from any of them  in distant views of cultivated countries seen from lofty stands the parts which lie nearest the eye are commonly disgusting the divisions of property into squares rhomboids and other mathematical forms are unpleasant a view of this kind therefore does not assume it is beauty till you descend a little into the vale till the hedgrows begin to lengthen and form those agreeable discriminations of which virgil  et late discriminat agros aen ii     takes notice where fields and meadows become extended streaks and yet are broken in various parts by rising grounds castles and other objects with which distances abound melting away from the eye in one general azure tint just here and there diversified with a few lines of light and shade and dotted with a few indistinct objects then if we are so happy as to find a ruin a spreading tree a bold rock or some other object large enough with it is appendages to become a foreground and balance the distance such as we found among the abrupt heights of coteswold see page  0  we have the chance of being presented with a noble picture which distance alone cannot give  hence appears the absurdity of carrying a painter to the top of a high hill to take a view he cannot do it extension alone tho amusing in nature will never make a picture it must be supported  cardiff lies low tho it is not unpleasantly seated on the landside among woody hills as we approached it appeared with more of the furniture of antiquity about it than any town we had seen in wales but on the spot the picturesque eye finds it too entire to be in full perfection the castle which was formerly the prison of the unfortunate robert son of william the first who languished here the last twenty years of his life is still i believe a prison and in good repair  from the town and parts adjacent the windings and approach of the river tave from the sea with a full tide make a grand appearance this is on the whole the finest estuary we had seen in wales  from the heights beyond cardiff the views of the channel on the right continue and of the welsh mountains on the left the sugar loaf near abergavenny appears still distinctly the road leads through enclosed lanes  newport lies pleasantly on a declivity a good view might be taken from the retrospect of the river the bridge and the castle a few slight alterations would make it picturesque  beyond newport some of the views of the channel were finer than any we had seen the coast tho it continues flat becomes more woody and the parts are larger  about seven miles from newport the road winds among woody hills which here and there form beautiful dips at their intersections on one of these knolls stand the ruins of a castle which has once made a grand appearance but it is now degraded into a modern dwelling  as we approached the passage over the bristol channel the views of it became still more interesting on the right we left the magnificent ruins of caldicotcastle and arrived at the ferryhouse about three in the afternoon where we were so fortunate as to find the boat preparing to set sail it had attempted to cross at high water in the morning but after toiling three hours against the wind it was obliged to put back this afforded another opportunity when the water was at ebb for the boat can pass only at the two extremes of the tide and seldom oftener than once in a day  we had scarce alighted at the ferryhouse when we heard the boatman winding his horn from the beach about a quarter of a mile below as a signal to bring down the horses when they were all embarked the horn sounded again for the passengers a very multifarious company assembled and a miserable walk we had to the boat through sludge and over shelving and slippery rocks when we got to it we found eleven horses on board and above thirty people and our chaise which we had intended to convert into a cabin during the voyage slung into the shrouds  the boat after some struggling with the shelves at length gained the channel the wind was unfavourable which obliged us to make several tacks as the seamen phrase them these tacks occasioned a fluttering in the sail and this produced a fermentation among the horses till their fears reduced them again to order  livy gives us a beautiful picture of the terror of cattle in a scene of this kind  primus erat pavor quum soluta rati in alturn raperentur ibi urgentes inter se cedentibus extremis ab aqua trepidationem aliquantam edebant donec quietem ipse timor circumspicientibus aquam fecisset lib xxi cap xxviii   the scenery of this short voyage was of little value we had not here the steep folding banks of the wye to produce a succession of new landscapes our picture now was motionless from the beginning to the end of the voyage it continued the same it was only a display of water varied by that little change introduced by distance on a coast which seen from so low a point as the surface of the water became a mere thread the screens bore no proportion to the area  after beating near two hours against the wind our voyage concluded as it began with an uncomfortable walk through the sludge to the high water mark  the worst part of the affair is the usage of horses if they are unruly or any accident occurs there is hardly a possibility at least if the vessel be crowded of affording them relief early in our voyage as the boat heeled one of the poor animals fell down many an ineffectual struggle it made to rise but nothing could be done till we arrived at the other side  the operation too of landing horses is equally disagreeable they are forced out of the boat through an aperture in the side of it which is so inconvenient a mode of egress that in leaping many have been hurt from the difficulty of desengaging their hinder ledgs  this passage as well as the other over the severn for there is one also a little above are often esteemed dangerous the tides are uncommonly rapid in this channel and when a brisk wind happens to blow in a contrary direction the waters are very rough the boats too are often illmanaged for what is done repeatedly is often done carelessly a british admiral i have heard who had lived much at sea riding up to one of these ferries with an intention to pass over and observing the boat as she was working across the channel from the other side he declared he durst not trust himself to the seamanship of such fellows as managed her and turning his horse went round by gloucester  several melancholy accidents indeed within the course of a dozen years have thrown discredit on these ferries one i had from a gentleman who himself providentially escaped being lost he went to the beach just as the vessel was unmooring his horse had been embarked before together with sixty head of cattle a passage with such company appeared so disagreeable that he and about six or seven passengers more whom he found on the beach among whom was a young lady agreed to get into an open boat and be towed over by the large one  the passage was rough and they observed the cattle on board the larger vessel rather troublesome about half way over an ox which stood near the aperture in the side of the vessel mentioned above for the entrance and egress of cattle entangled his horn in a wooden slider which closes it and which happened according to the careless custom of boatmen to be unpinned the beast finding his head fixed and endeavoring to disengage himself drew up the slider the vessel heeled the tide rushed in and all was instant confusion the danger and the impossibility of opposing it in such a crowd struck every one at once  in the mean time the passengers in the open boat who were equally conscious of the ruin had nothing left but to cut the rope which tied them to the sinking vessel but not a knife could be found in the whole company after much confusion a little neat tortoiseshell penknife was produced with which unequal instrument they just got the rope severed when the large vessel and all it is contents went down all on board perished except two or three oxen which were seen floating on the surface and it was believed got to shore  the joy of the passengers in the boat was however shortlived it soon appeared they had escaped only one mode of death they were left to themselves in a wide expanse of water at the mercy of a tide ebbing with a violent current to the sea without oars or sail and without one person on board who had ever handled either a gentleman among them had just authority enough to keep them all quiet without which their safety could not have been insured a moment he then took up a paddle the only instrument on board with an intention if possible to get the boat on shore but the young lady who was his niece throwing her arms around him in an agony of distress not knowing what she did would not let him proceed he was obliged to quiet her by threatening in a furious tone to strike her down instantly with the oar if she did not desist notwithstanding all his efforts they were hurried away by the ebbing waters as far as kingroad where the violence of the tide slackening he prevented the boat from going out to sea and got her by degrees to shore  the gentleman who told me this story i observed was one of the persons who were saved from him i had the account of the loss of an open boat in the same passage from the obstinacy of a passenger  the wind was rough and a person on board lost his hat which floated away in a contrary direction he begged the waterman to turn round to recover it but the waterman told him it was as much as their lives were worth to attempt it on which the passenger who seemed to be a tradesman started up seized the helm and swore the fellow should return in the struggle the helm got a wrong twist and the boat instantly filled and went to the bottom it appeared afterward that the hat was a hat of value for the owner had secreted several bills in the lining of it  for ourselves however we found the passage only a disagreeable one and if there was any danger we saw it not the danger chiefly i suppose arises from carelessness and overloading the boat  as our chaise could not be landed till the tide flowed up the beach we were obliged to wait at the ferryhouse our windows overlooked the channel and the welshcoast which seen from a higher stand became now a woody and beautiful distance the wind was brisk and the sun clear except that at intervals it was intercepted by a few floating clouds the playing lights which arose from this circumstance on the opposite coast were very picturesque pursuing each other they sometimes just caught the tufted tops of trees then gleaming behind shadowy woods they spread along the vales till they faded insensibly away  often these partial lights are more stationary when the clouds which fling their lengthened shadows on distant grounds hang some time balanced in the air but whenever found or from whatever source derived the painter observes them with the greatest accuracy he marks their different appearances and lays them up in his memory among the choice ingredients of distant landscape almost alone they are sufficient to vary distance a multiplicity of objects melted harmoniously together contribute to enrich it but without throwing in those gleaming lights the artist can hardly avoid heaviness when the shadows of floating clouds fall upon the sides of mountains they have a bad effect  see picturesque observat on scotch landscape vol ii p       sect xii from the ferryhouse to bristol the views are amusing the first scene presented to us was a spacious lawn about a mile in diameter the area of which was flat and the boundary a grand woody bank adorned with towers and villas standing either boldly near the top or seated in woody recesses near the bottom the horizon line is well varied and broken  the whole of this landscape is too large and not characterized enough to make a picture but the contrast between the plain and the wood both of which are objects of equal grandeur is pleasing and many of the parts taken separately would form into good composition  when we left the plain the road carried us into shady lanes winding round woody eminences one of which was crowned with an artificial castle the castle indeed which consisted of one tower might have been better imagined the effect however was good tho the object was paltry  about three miles on this side of bristol we had a grand view of rising country it consisted of a pleasing mixture of wood and lawn the parts were large and the houses and villages scattered in good proportion the whole when we saw it was overspread with a purplish tint which as the objects were so near we could not account for but it united all the parts together in very pleasing harmony  natures landscapes are generally harmonized whether the sky is enlightened or whether it lowers whether it is tinted or whether it is untinted it gives it is yellow luster or it is gray obscurity to the surface of the earth it is but seldom however that we meet with those strong harmonizing tints which the landscape before us presented  as the air is the vehicle of these tints distant objects will of course participate of them in the greatest degree the foregrounds will be little affected as they are seen only through a very thin veil of air but when the painter thinks it proper to introduce these strong tints into his distances he will give his foregrounds likewise in some degree a participating hue more perhaps than in reality belongs to them or at least he will work them up with such colors mute or vivid as accord best with the general tone of his landscape  how far it is proper for him to attempt these uncommon appearances of nature is not a decided question if the landscape before us should be painted with that full purple glow with which we saw it overspread the connoisseur would probably take offense and call it affected  the approach to bristol is grand and the environs every where show the neighborhood of an opulent city tho the city itself lay concealed till we entered it for a considerable way the road led between stonewalls which bounded the fields on each side this boundary tho of all others the most unpleasing is yet proper as you approach a great town it is a kind of connecting thread  the narrowness of the port of bristol which is formed by the banks of the river is very striking it may be called a dry harbor notwithstanding the river for the vessels when the tide ebbs lie on an ouzy bed in a deep channel the returning tide lifts them to the height of the wharfs it exhibits of course none of those beautiful winding shores which often adorn an estuary the port of bristol was probably first formed when vessels afraid of being cut from their harbors by corsairs ran up high into the country for security  the great church is a remnant only of the ancient fabric it has been a noble pile when the nave was complete and the stunted tower crowned with a spire as i suppose it once was we were sorry we did not look into ratcliffchurch which is said to be an elegant piece of gothic architecture  the country around bristol is beautiful tho we had not time to examine it the scenery about the hotwells is in a great degree picturesque the river is cooped between two high hills both of which are adorned with a rich profusion of rock wood and verdure here is no offskip indeed but as far as foregrounds alone make a picture and they will do much better alone than distances we are presented with a very beautiful one  between these hills stands the pumproom close to the river and every ship that sails into bristol fails under it is windows  the road between bristol and bath contains very little worth notice we had been informed of some grand retrospect views but we did not find them we were told afterward that there are two roads between bath and bristol of which the glocestershire road is the more picturesque if so we unfortunately took the wrong one  at bath the buildings are strikingly splendid but the picturesque eye finds little amusement among such objects the circus from a corner of one of the streets that run into it is thrown into perspective and if it be happily enlightened is seen with advantage the crescent is built in a simpler and greater style of architecture  i have heard an ingenious friend col mitford who is wellversed in the theory of the picturesque speak of a very beautiful and grand effect of light and shade which he had sometimes observed from an afternoonfun in a bright winterday on this structure no such effect could happen in summer as the sun in the same meridian would be then too high a grand mass of light falling on one side of the crescent melted imperceptibly into as grand a body of shade on the other and the effect rose from the opposition and graduation of these extremes it was still increased by the pillars and other members of architecture which beautifully varied and broke both the light and the shade and gave a wonderful richness to each the whole he said seemed like an effort of nature to set off art and the eye roved about in astonishment to see a mere mass of regularity become the ground of so enchanting a display of harmony and picturesque effect the elliptical form of the building was the magical source of this exhibition  as objects of curiosity the parades the baths the rooms and the abbey are all worth feeing the rising grounds about bath as they appear from the town are a great ornament to it tho they have nothing pleasing in themselves there is no variety in the outline no breaks no masses of woody scenery  from bath to chippenham the road is pleasant but i know not that it deserves any higher epithet  from chippenham to marlborough we passed over a wild plain which conveys no idea but that of vastness unadorned with beauty  nature in scenes like these seems only to have chalked out her designs the ground is laid in but left unfinished the ornamental part is wanting  the river or the lake winding through the bottom which lies in form to receive it  the hanging rocks to adorn some shooting promontory  and the woody screens to incompass and give richness to the whole  marlboroughdown is one of those vast dreary scenes which our ancestors in the dignity of a state of nature chose as a repository of their dead every where we fee the tumuli which were raised over their ashes among which the largest is silburyhill these structures have no date in the history of time and will be in all probability among it is most lasting monuments our ancestors had no ingenious arts to gratify their ambition and as they could not aim at immortality by a bust a statue or a piece of basrelief they endeavored to obtain it by works of enormous labor it was thus in other barbarous countries before the introduction of arts in egypt kings endeavored to immortalize themselves by lying under pyramids  as we passed what are called the ruins of abury we could not but admire the industry and sagacity of those antiquarians who can trace a regular plan in such a mass of confusion see an acccount of abury by dr stukely   at the great inn at marlborough formerly a mansion of the somersetfamily one of these tumuli stands in the garden and is whimsically cut into a spiral walk which ascending imperceptibly is lengthened into half a mile the conceit at least gives an idea of the bulk of these massy fabrics  from marlborough the road takes a more agreeable appearance savernakeforest through which it passes is a pleasant woody scene and great part of the way afterward is adorned with little groves and opening glades which form a variety of second distances on the right but we seldom found a foreground to set them off to advantage  the country soon degenerates into open cornlands but near hungerford which is not an unpleasant town it recovers a little spirit and the road passes through close lanes with breaks here and there into the country between the boles of the trees  as we approach newberry we had a view of donningtoncastle one of those scenes where the unfortunate charles reaped some glory nothing now remains of this gallant fortress but a gateway and two towers the hill on which it stands is so overgrown with brushwood that we could scarce discern any vestiges either of the walls of the castle or of the works which had been thrown up against it  this whole woody hill and the ruins upon it are now tenanted as we were informed by our guide only by ghosts which however add much to the dignity of these forsaken habitations and are for that reason of great use in description  in virgils days when the tarpeian rock was graced by the grandeur of the capitol it was sufficiently enobled but in it is early state when it was sylvestribus horrida dumis it wanted something to give it splendour the poet therefore has judiciously added a few ideas of the awful kind and has contrived by this machinery to impress it with more dignity in it is rude state than it possessed in it is adorned one jam turn religio pavidos terrebat agrestes dira loci jam tum sylvam saxumque timebant hoc nemus hunc inquit frondoso vertice collem quis deus iucertum est habitat deus arcades ipsum credunt se vidisse jovem cum saepe nigrantem aegida concuteret dextracirc nimbosque cieret   of these imaginary beings the painter in the mean time makes little use the introduction of them instead of raising would depreciate his subject the characters indeed of jupiter juno and all that progeny are rendered as familiar to us through the antique as those of alexander and caesar but the judicious artist will be cautious how he goes farther the poet will introduce a phantom of any kind without scruple he knows his advantage he speaks to the imagination and if he deal only in general ideas as all good poets on such subjects will do every reader will form the phantom according to his own conception but the painter who speaks to the eye has a more difficult work he cannot deal in general terms he is obliged to particularize and it is not likely that the spectator will have the same idea of a phantom which he has  the painter therefore acts prudently in abstaining as much as possible from the representation of fictitious beings  the country about newberry furnished little amusement but if it is not picturesque it is very historical  in every historical country there are a set of ideas which peculiarly belong to it hastings and tewksbury runnemede and clarendon have all their associate ideas the ruins of abbeys and castles have another set and it is a soothing amusement in traveling to assimilate the mind to the ideas of the country the ground we now trod has many historical ideas associated with it two great battles a long siege and the death of the gallant lord falkland  the road from newberry to reading leads through lanes from which a flat and woody country is exhibited on the right and rising grounds on the left some unpleasant common fields intervene  in the new road from reading to henly the high grounds overlook a very picturesque distance on the right the country indeed is flat but this is a circumstance we do not dislike in a distance when it contains a variety of wood and plain and when the parts are large and wellcombined  henley lies pleasantly among woody hills but the chalk bursting every where from the soil strikes the eye in spots and injures the landscape  from hence we struck again into the road across hounslowheath having crowded much more within the space of a fortnight to which our time was limited than we ought to have done  the end
