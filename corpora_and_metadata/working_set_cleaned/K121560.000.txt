magazines and other periodical publications and if by selecting them together the author should contribute toward the entertainment of the public as well as to the lady he was in duty bound to oblige he will think the pains he has taken amply rewarded though at the same time he hopes the candid reader will not forget the following remark that  a slender poet must have time to grow to spread and flourish as his brothers do who still looks lean  sure with ill fate is cursed but no man can be falstaff fat at first dryden  notwithstanding that part of the title of this book viz the shrubs of parnassus is borrowed from mr woty the author thinks it necessary to observe that not a single line is taken or imitated from that gentlemans works  he hears there is a small pamplet in being called

a single life the reader will in all probability find many poetical errors in most of the preceding cantatas etc but as they were wrote at a very ely period of life and solely calculated for music the author humbly hopes they will be deemed pardonable  note the above is inserted exactly as it is set to music    elegy written at colchester addressed to miss k  n  scribere jussit amor ovid epist iv v  0 i i asked the muse that rules the sounding lyre to wreathe my temples with one sprig of bays some lofty subject to my soul inspire some lofty subject in heroic lays ii but venus came the soft enchanting fair i saw her glancing from her native sky loose flowed her shining tresses in the air and loves own luster trembled from her eye iii she bade me choose a less ambitious strain and showed the image of a smiling maid let delias praises echo to the plain to every murmuring stream and every shade iv o ruthless godess am i doomed to bow again to loves soft empire and to thee will thou no respite to my pangs allow no destined moment must this heart be free v yet not for this i passed the sounding main yet not for this i sought a distant shore thy captive then exulting left his chain

ranks of bleeding warriors roar and if my soul one thought of danger feels o never delia may i see thee more xii nor deem because i loiter in the shade i bear a breast unequal in the deed i hear the blasts of terror undismayed though pleased i listen to the rural reed xiii for i was nursed in virtues rigid lore nor will the goddess disavow my claim she bade my steps the arduous path explore where sacred honor points the way to fame xiv but now far other cares distract my soul joyless the laurel wreaths of fame i see in vain her animating thunders roll if with her blasts she mix no notes of thee xv then listen delia to a swain undone ah hear a slave condemned  thy chains to wear so may thy days in peace glide gently on unmixed with grief unsullied with a tear xvi for ah in vain thy gentle tear would slow to see thy lover press an early tomb then let thy pity mitigate his woe ere sickness wither and despair consume xvii wretch that i am ah rather let me bind hopes dear delusive chaplet to my brows let fancy paint thee to my wounded mind all sweetly smiling on thy lovers vows xviii o how i long by arching shades oerhung where breezes sport and fountains murmur bland to hear the tuneful accents of thy tongue to press the glowing softness of thy hand xix o how i long to lead thee to the bowers where flora scatters all her thousand dies to braid thy glossy hair with dewy flowers and catch the mild effulgence of thy eyes xx thus with ideal bliss i fondly try beneath the woodbine shade to soothe my pains but ah too soon the lovely phantoms fly and stern reality alone remains xxi she bursts with thunders armed upon my dreams she tears me struggling from the woodbine shade she points to other groves and other streams but ah she points me to no heavenly maid xxii i

fallen from heaven down to hell yet he may be from torment free though that is a thing i really doubt for he poor wit his brain had split in finding of the devil out a rebus my anxious soul once loved a maid i thought most charming fair though she alas never gave me aid but urged my pain and care ah cruel girl thy name i will tell in justice to my smart which thou have ever caused full well from thy ungenrous heart half of an herb begins her name esteemed of perfect use every one of physical fame it is virtues can produce two sixths of an instructing book when it is judicious wrote and if in

my works in manuscipt my sweet billy hawkin what argusis talking the grammar you put in a fright your own dear conceit to you may be sweet to me it is an antidote quite my answer my sweet pretty doctor of malling the person here alluded to living at townmalling in kent and by profession a surgeon in which art he is very eminent for curing insanity and not a bad writer in the poetical way fair town thou art surely stark mad or a simpleton grown for no man in his senses could ever have writ such bombastical nonsense had he the least wit but thy poetry i doubt has cracked thy brain and made thee alas like thy patients insane or midass fate has again come to pass and thou my dear doctor art turned to an ass pray send me no more such illiterate stuff for i think you have made yourself foolish enough lines sent with a present to a friend this trifle accept as a favor i ask it but pray dont forget to send back the basket the present being two chickens sent in a basket belonging to an acquaintance  on seeing a young lady that was prodigiously vain and affected ah why so vain though blooming in thy spring thou false adored and truly wretched thing old age will come disease may come before for youre as mortal now as if threescore hops a song for the year m dcc lxxvi addressed to the farmers of kent tune as i was a driving my wagon one day i ye farmers of kent who are jolly and gay come listen a while and pray mind what i say may this season be crowned with plentiful crops and off of an acre a load of good hops geho dobbin etc ii oh may they prove fine too  and fetch a great price that ye my brave boys may get rich in a trice for as ye are ever both hearty and free success to ye all for to fill ye with glee geho dobbin etc iii to crown your repast in the hoping this year i wish that the weather may be fine and clear for when it is wet it is wretched and sad from morning till night in a hop ground to pad oh sad hoping etc iv then to see the poor hopers alas what a sight it is enough to put modesty into a fright for they are so draggld and wet to the skin and show all for nothing their cloathings so thin oh poor creatures etc v in case of this weather let there be no flaw take care to provide them with plenty of straw the hopers during the season mostly lie upon straw in barns etc which the farmers provide for them  that when the poor wretches retire to their nest they may lie in comfort and all take their rest oh poor hopers etc iv but above all that is said pray dont cheat the king for if you do that it is sure a sad thing as he will have his duty by hook or by crook beware oh beware lest youre in the black book oh sad doings etc vii though ye have more honor at least so i trust i would have ye be always quite upright and just for honor and honesty carries the sway then from these great maxims never venture to stray oh rare hoping etc  as the above song was wrote at a very short notice and entirely to oblige a few gentlemen farmers in kent it is hoped the critical reader will excuse the badness of the poetry and attribute it to hurry and the singsong measure it is wrote in  poetical strictures and notes on most of the principal performers belonging to the theatresroyal in drury lane and covent garden  poetical strictures etc natio comoeda est  juv sat iii ver  00 on mr garrick before he left the stage the tragic muse her

set down since the song that i sing is about the halfcrown this being i am informed their customary fee  derry down down down derry down ii some little time since you attacked me sore for writing of prose but i will never write more then take this poetical brat and never frown although i forgot  for to send the halfcrown derry down etc iii this halfcrown i speak of you surely must know it is only been standing a twelvemonth i trow when the book was published  yet rigid was you by my faith i must own and all on account of the wonted halfcrown derry down etc iv how could such a noodle ye cried dare to write he is sure an impostor  a plagirist quite then him well ever blast to all fame and renown for see  the poor devils forgot the halfcrown derry down etc v but now honest critics come let us be friends extol but this pamphlet i will make you amends for if by your praises the work should go down i swear by the muses i will send you a crown derry down etc iv and now my kind readers you plainly may see that critics like courtiers expect a small fee in short these extortions so common are grown that all want a fee from the prince to the clown derry down etc  the readers are desired to observe that some hints of the above have been taken from a song wrote a few years ago by a friend on much the same plan and is to be found amongst a collection of poems entitled the laurel wreathe
