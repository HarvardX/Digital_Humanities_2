case of a fracture of the sternum  by john hale surgeon to the new finsbury dispensary  london printed in the year mdcclxxxvii  although fractures of the sternum are described by every writer on the accidents to which the bones are subject yet they appear to have seldom occurred even to the oldest practitioner all those authors whom i have had an opportunity of consulting very fully describe in what manner this accident may happen and as fully prescribe the rules to be observed in the treatment of it they seem however to have copied from each other without adducing any proofs to corroborate their assertions du verney in his excellent treatise on the diseases of the bones is the only writer that i have met with who enters fully and circumstantially into fractures of this part he mentions three cases which had occurred to him two of which proved instantly fatal and the third recovered but the patient remained an invalid during the rest of his life he likewise asserts that all fractures of the sternum are to be regarded as mortal though there have been patients whose constitutions have held out and have been cured i can only regret that he gives no information where those cases are recorded  the singularity of the following case the unexpected favorable termination of it together with the solicitations of my friends are the motives which induce me to have a few copies printed for their perusal  my particular thanks are due to my worthy friend and colleague dr skeete and to mr haighton for their kind advice and assistance during the progress of the cure they who are acquainted with the professional abilities of those gentlemen will rather approve my silence than commend me for any further eulogium on their merits  october      case of a fractured sternum john oats aged    by trade a cabinetmaker being in company with some friends at a tavern and drinking freely a dispute arose which terminated in blows and he was unfortunately thrown down with such violence on the edge of a chair as to cause a fracture of the sternum about four inches above the ensiform cartilage  being carried home a neighboring apothecary was sent for who ordered some draughts to be taken and a volatile liniment to embrocate the part symptoms however soon became alarming great pain and difficulty in respiration cough and oppression on the lungs these complaints were suffered to increase without any means being used to alleviate them for the space of one week he often spoke with certainty of his breast being broken and said he could feel the bones jar against each other  obtaining no relief and being positively told that his complaint was only a bruise he dismissed his apothecary and applied to the new finsbury dispensary on tuesday the   d january      he was immediately visited by dr skeete and myself with mr haighton who happened to call on me that morning on examination we perceived that a fracture had taken place as described above but how much of the bone was depressed or how deep the depression might be we could not readily ascertain owing to an inflammation which occupied the inferior and middle part of the sternum and which seemed hastily advancing to suppuration his pulse was hard and full the cough frequent and attended with such distress and anxiety to the patient that he said he should be perfectly well if the cough could be stopped for at that time he could plainly feel the broken edges of the bone grate on each other the irritation of which was almost insupportable and prevented his taking any rest  he was immediately blooded to the quantity of sixteen ounces which was much inflamed a laxative mixture ordered to be taken occasionally an emulsion of sperm ceti cum sal nitri and tinct thebaic every three hours and every other means used to obviate the effects which we imagined would be the consequences of such an accident on the day following the pulse was rather softer and the respiration not quite so laborious ten ounces more of blood were taken from him which had the same inflammatory appearance the inflammation on the sternum was more circumscribed and evidently showed that some pus was already formed the laxative medicine was ordered to be repeated and thirty drops of tinct thebaic to be taken at night  symptoms continued much the same till saturday the   th of january when mr cooper surgeon to guys hospital favored me with his company and was of opinion that the abscess on the sternum should be immediately opened about six ounces of pus were discharged on passing my finger to the bottom of the wound i expected to have discovered the broken portion of bone but did not probably owing to the parts having become thickened in consequence of the preceding inflammation the fracture however was evident to one sense though not to the other for on the patient desiring us to place our ear on the wound we could hear the edges of the bone grate on each other at every inspiration the pulse being still full it was thought necessary to draw six ounces more of blood he had no rest this night the cough being incessant on sunday the   th the countenance appeared much dejected the skin hot but the pulse calm i ordered the opiate to be increased to seventy drops of tinct thebaic and applied a bandage or rather a girt such as i use in fractures of the ribs and which is made to buckle to what degree of tightness may be requisite in hopes of being able to confine the motion of the sternum and thereby prevent the irritation which the fracture produced i intended to have applied this bandage when i first visited him but it was thought that if much pressure was thrown on the ribs it might probably cause the inferior broken part of the bone to protrude through the inflamed integuments and be productive of much danger the bandage was therefore deferred till the abscess was opened and the bone not being evident to the touch we had less to fear from the application of a moderate pressure  he experienced much relief in consequence of the bandage being applied the cough was greatly abated the opiate procured a sound sleep and the bone was not troublesome in inspiration the pulse was perfectly calm and the wound discharged a healthy pus he was now ordered some mutton broth having hitherto been confined to water gruel  from this time to monday the sixth of february the symptoms indicated much danger he sweated profusely coughed incessantly and what he expectorated was often tinged with blood he took liberally of a decoction of bark with elixir of vitriol drank warm milk every morning and used such nourishing articles of diet as were directed by dr skeete this plan seemed to succeed for from the  th to   th of february the sweats were much diminished and the cough less frequent but the wound discharged a foetid ichor in great abundance which proceeded from a sinus extending above and for some space round the superior part of the wound we were now of opinion that this ichorous discharge might proceed from the edges of the broken bone if so it became advisable to make a further opening to endeavor to reach the foundation of the mischief and then pursue such a course as might be indicated from examining the condition of the parts  this however was delayed till saturday the   th of february as for some days we pleased ourselves with the idea that the parts would unite independent of our interference especially as the discharge from the wound became thicker dr skeete having added gum myrrh to the decoction of bark but we were unhappily disappointed in our expectations and as no time was to be lost i informed him of the plan which on consultation we intended to follow viz to make an incision down to the bone to examine its condition and if necessary to remove whatever part of it might in our opinion be an obstacle to a perfect union he readily assented to whatever might be judged expedient for his relief not on his own account having suffered so much that life was become a burden but for the sake of his wife and five infant children whose subsistence depended solely on his labor i made an incision from about an inch above the edge of the old wound and continued it to the bottom the knife grated on the bone and the inferior part became evident to the touch though covered externally with a smooth granulation it now appeared that the fracture was not immediately on the center of the sternum but more inclined to the right side of it that portion to which the ribs are united was firmly attached to them and in consequence of the incision the fractured part had separated from its situation and exposed the cavity of the mediastinum i passed my finger into the cavity and felt the parts apparently carious on each side we now could only conjecture that a large exfoliation would ensue but in all probability the consequence of this operation might prove fatal either by the pus lodging in the cavity of the mediastinum or by causing that irritation often consequent to the exposure of cavities theory certainly justified us in these conclusions but practice has happily convinced us that notwithstanding these discouragements there was still a method left to prevent what we had so much reason to fear the bone though broken was not denuded both the superior and inferior portions were covered with granulations it then became an object to endeavor to promote a union of those parts by incarnation similar to what occurs in compound fractures in which light it might now certainly be considered  i must here observe that on the day following i found him much better he became easier after the operation coughed but little and slept the greatest part of the night without taking the opiate this was the first natural sleep he had enjoyed since the accident happened for the opiates only served to palliate the cough without procuring any refreshing sleep although he generally took one hundred drops of tinct thebaic the expectoration also appeared more frothy and he had no difficulty in discharging it from the lungs this amendment was but temporary for from the   th to the   th of february the opiates were again obliged to be given our attempts to procure a union of the parts proved abortive and the inferior edge of the bone protruded through the wound at every inspiration and consequently exposed the cavity of the mediastinum there seemed no prospect of any exfoliation i therefore omitted the former bandage as it appeared to have no power to answer the intention we had in view and passed a common roller round the inferior part of the sternum the pressure of this brought the lower portion in contact with the upper and we had the pleasure of seeing a union effected in a few days the sweats from this time totally ceased and the cough was not troublesome i removed him to islington for the benefit of the air there the cough entirely left him and he slept without taking the opiate  when he attempted a deep inspiration he felt a small pressure on the fractured part and also on the right side of the wound which side was evidently enlarged and felt as if the cartilages of the ribs had received some injury from the fall he complained that the air was too sharp for him and to use his own expression felt like vinegar in his nostrils indeed this was so much the case that if he stood at the window when open or attempted to walk out the air instantly caused him to sneeze violently which gave great pain to the fractured part i was therefore obliged to remove him from islington where he only continued four days and for two or three nights after he returned home the cough again became violent so that i was under the necessity of repeating the opiates as the wound healed the cough abated and his only complaint was that of great weakness and a total inability to use his arms with any freedom of motion he could stoop to buckle his shoe could take up any weight but was utterly unable to perform any lateral motion  march during this month he was perfectly free from complaint had taken pulv cort peruv   ter die the enlargement related to have been on the right side of the wound was much lessened but an abscess formed on that side immediately on the breast which broke on friday the  0th of march it appeared quite superficial and to have had no connection with the original injury  april the wound on the sternum was now healed to about the size of a sixpence and from this a vast discharge was daily evacuated suspecting some sinus i passed the probe and found one which extended about two inches on the right side between the two inferior cartilages directly above that enlargement already mentioned this sinus was laid open and continued discharging till the beginning of august when it was proposed to apply a caustic on the part the action of which laid bare the fractured portions of the bone the superior edge greatly depressed and the intermediate space filled with a kind of membranous substance which had prevented an ossific union of the parts it was now curious to observe the process which nature was daily executing in order to fill up the vacuity at every dressing some new excitement was perceived increased vascularity in order more fully to comprehend what i mean by an increased vascularity it is necessary to observe that when the slough which the action of the caustic had produced was separated from the sternum a very large portion of the inferior part of the bone appeared to be entirely deprived of the living principle but fortunately this was not the case every days inspection fully proved it by that portion becoming more and more florid and by the assistance of a glass we could plainly discover new vessels shooting in a transverse direction through the osseous fibers i therefore trust that the term of increased vascularity is not misapplied and i am at a loss for any other to express my meaning more intelligibly in the living portions of bone by which the carious part became more separated and granulations arising from the surrounding soft parts on the  0th of october the exfoliation from the inferior part took place the portion of bone was but small healthy granulations being substituted in its place  we now assisted him with an elastic truss which proved of so much service as to enable him again to follow his business of a cabinetmaker this truss makes an equal pressure on each side of the breast and supports the sternum in such a manner that if he takes it off he says he feels as if his inside was falling in pieces without it he is incapable of performing any lateral motion  the wound now healed without any interruption and was perfectly cicatrized on the   d of october  the following observations are such as will naturally suggest themselves on an attentive consideration of the above facts  first that the case was attended with considerable danger throughout the greater part of its progress but from very different and even opposite circumstances at different periods in the beginning the symptoms of inflammation in the thorax seemed to be so general and violent that without the free use of the lancet assisted by dilution and the antiphlogistic regimen it is probable that a fatal termination would speedily have ensued but the only method by which this could be prevented doubtless assisted in inducing that state of debility and hectic under which the patient was afterward in danger of sinking and which required the liberal exhibition of bark elixir of vitriol myrrh and such nourishing articles of diet as were judiciously prescribed by dr skeete the same thing happens in many cases of disease which fall under the care of the surgeon and the present instance is a strong illustration of the necessity of a particular attention being required to the state of the constitution as well as to the condition of the diseased part  secondly it may appear extraordinary that notwithstanding the frequent exposure of the cavity of the mediastinum which seemed to take place when the broken edges of the bone were separated during the alternate motions of inspiration and expiration that this exposure was not followed by any repeated attack of inflammation or by any effusion of pus into the cavities of the thorax though we had more than once sufficient reasons to apprehend such effects especially when the expectoration assumed a purulent and bloody appearance with symptoms of hectic the event therefore seems to prove that such adhesions must have taken place between the lungs and pleura in the neighborhood of the injured part as completely to have prevented any such effect  thirdly after some months the treatment was almost entirely confined to the part the healing of the wound being prevented by the state of the bone underneath as has been already mentioned  fourthly that the loss of substance which the sternum has sustained is at present supplied by granulation only and whether nature will in this case as in many others restore the part to its original state by a bony deposition time alone will be able to discover  postscript since the foregoing sheets came from the press i have read an account of a fractured sternum in the edinburgh medical commentaries vol iv p     by mr george borthwick surgeon to the   th regiment of dragoons in many instances the symptoms agreed with those mentioned in my case particularly the grating noise in the time of respiration mr borthwick being immediately called in prevented that train of dangerous symptoms which unfortunately befell my patient the account being drawn up with great precision i refer my reader to the book itself for further information  the addition of this postscript affords me an opportunity of saying that my patient called on me at the dispensary on the  0th ult and informed me that he had gained so much strength within a few days as to be enabled to perform the most laborious part of his work without the assistance of the truss  november
