his journeyman will simpson as i informed my readers in the second part of the two shoemakers had resolved to work together one hour every evening in order to p for tommy williamss schooling this circumstance brought them to be a good deal together when the rest of the men were gone home now it happened that mr stock had a mighty way o endeavoring to turn all common events to some use and he thought it right on the present occasion to make the only return in his power to will simpson for his great kindness for said he if will gives up so much of his time to hel me to provide for this poor boy it is the least can do to try to turn part of that time to the pupose of promoting wills spiritual good no as the bent of stocks own mind was religious was easy to him to lead their talk to somethin profitable he always took especial care however that the subject should be introduced properly cheerfully and without constraint as  well knew that great good may be sometimes done by a prudent attention in seizing proper opportunities so he knew that the cause of piety had been sometimes hurt by forcing serious subjects where here was clearly no disposition to receive them say he had found out that two things were necesary to the promoting of religion among his friends warm zeal to be always on the watch for occaions and a cool judgment to distinguish which vas the right time and place to make use of them to know how to do good is a great matter but to now when to do it is no small one  simpson was an honest goodnatured fellow he was now become sober and rather religiously disposed but he was ignorant he did not know uch of the grounds of religion or of the coruption of his own nature he was regular at church ut was first drawn thither rather by his skill in salmsinging than by any great devotion he had eft off going to the greyhound and often read the bible or some other good book on the sunday vening this he thought was quite enough he hought the bible was the prettiest history book in he world and that religion was a very good thing or sundays but he did not much understand what business people had with it on working days he had left off drinking because it had brought williams to the grave and his wise to dirt and ags but not because he himself had seen the evil f sin he now considered swearing and sabbath reaking as scandalous and indecent but he had ot found out that both were to be left off because hey are highly offensive to god and grieve his holy spirit as simpson was less selfconceited than most ignorant people are stock had alway a good hope that when he should come to be beter acquainted with the word of god and wi the evil of his own heart he would become o day a good christian the great hindrance w that he fancied himself so already  one evening simpson had been calling to stock mind how disorderly the house and shop when they were now sitting quietly at work had formerly been and he went on thus  will how comfortably we live now master to what we used to do in williamss time i used then never to be happy but when we were keeping it up all night but now i am as merry as the day is long i find i am twice as happy since i am grown good and sober   stock i am glad you are happy will and i rejoice that you are sober but i would not have yo take too much pride in your own goodness for fea it should become a sin almost as great as some o those you have left off besides i would not have you make quite so sure that you are good   will not good master why dont you find me regular and orderly at work   stock very much so and accordingly i have a great respect for you   will i pay every one his own seldom miss church have not been drunk since williams died have handsome clothes for sundays and save  trifle every week   stock very true and to all this you may add that you very generously work an hour for poo tommys education every evening without fee o reward   will well master what can a man do more f all this is not being good i dont know what   stock all these things are very right as far as ey go and you could not well be a christian without doing them but i shall make you stare erhaps when i tell you you may do all these ings and many more and yet be no christian   will no christian surely master i do hope that after all i have done you will not be so unkind as  say i am no christian   stock god forbid that i should say so will i ope better things of you but come now what o you think it is to be a christian   will what why to be christened when one is a hild to learn the catechism when one can read  be confirmed when one is a youth and to go  church when one is a man   stock these are all very proper things and ite necessary they make a part of a christians se but for all that a man may be exact in them l and yet not be a christian   will not be a christian ha ha ha you are ery comical master   stock no indeed i am very serious will at is rate it would be a very easy thing to be a hristian and every man who went through certain rms would be a good man and one man who oserved these forms would be as good as another whereas if we come to examine ourselves by the lord of god i am afraid there are but few comratively whom our savior would allow to be al christians what is your notion of a chrisans practice   will why he must not rob nor murder nor get drunk he must avoid scandalous things and do as other decent orderly people do   stock it is easy enough to be what the world calls a christian but not to be what the bible calls so   will why master we working men are not expected to be saints and martyrs and apostles and ministers   stock we are not and yet will there ar not two sorts of christianity we are called to practice the same religion which they practiced an something of the same spirit is expected in  which we reverence in them it was not sain and martyrs only to whom our savior said tha they must crucify the world with it is affection and lusts we are called to be holy in  measure and degree as he who has called  is holy it was not only saints and martyrs w were told that they must be likeminded  christ  that they must do all to the glory  god  that they must renounce the spirit of  world and deny themselves it was not to apost only that christ said they must have their coversation in heaven it was not to a few ho men set apart for the altar that he said they  set their affections on things above  that th must not be conformed to the world  no was to fishermen to publicans to farmers to d laborers to poor tradesmen that he spoke wh he told them they must love not the world nor  things of the world  that they must renou the hidden things of dishonesty grow in grace  up for themselves treasures in heaven   will all this might be very proper for them  be taught because they had not been bred christians but heathens or jews and christ wanted to make them his followers that is christians but thank god we do not want to be taught ll this for we are christians born in a christian ountry of christian parents   stock i suppose then you fancy that christianity omes to people in a christian country by nature   will i think it comes by a good education or  good example when a fellow who has got any ense sees a man cut off in his prime by drinking  think he will begin to leave it off when he ees another man respected like you master for hoesty and sobriety and going to church why he ill grow honest and sober and go to church that  he will see it is his advantage to be a chrisan   stock will what you say is the truth but  is not the whole truth you are right as far as you o but you do not go far enough the worldly dvantages of piety are as you suppose in genel great credit prosperity and health almost aturally attend on a religious life both because  religious life supposes a sober and industrious fe and because a man who lives in a course of aty puts himself in the way of gods blessing ut a true christian has a still higher aim in ew and will follow religion even under cirmstances when it may hurt his credit and ruin s prosperity if it should ever happen to be the ll of god that he should be brought into such a ing state   will well master to speak the truth if i go  church on sundays and follow my work in e week i must say i think that is being good   stock i agree with you that he who does both gives the best outward signs that he is good but our going to church and even reading the bible are no proofs that we are as good as we need be but rather that we do both these in order to make us better than we are we do both on sundays as means by gods blessing to make us better all the week we are to bring the fruits of that chapter or of that sermon into our daily life and try to get our inmost heart and secret thoughts as well as our daily conduct amended by them   will why sure master you will not be so unreasonable as to want a body to be religious always i cannot do that neither i am not such a hypocrite as to pretend to it   stock yes you can in every action of your life   will what master always to be thinking about religion   stock no far from it will much less to be always talking about it but you must be always acting under it is power and spirit   will but surely it is pretty well if i do this when i go to church or while i am saying my prayers even you master as strict as you are would not have me always on my knees nor always at church i suppose for then how would your work be carried on and how would our town be supplied with shoes   stock very true will twould be no proof of our religion to let our customers go barefoot but twould be a proof of our laziness and we should starve as we ought to do the business of the world must not only be carried on but carried on with spirit and activity we have the same authority for not being slothful in business as we have for being fervent in spirit religion has ut godliness and laziness as wide asunder as any wo things in the world and what god has sepaated let no man pretend to join indeed the spirit of religion can have no fellowship with sloth dolence and selfindulgence but still a chrisan does not carry on his common trade quite like another man neither for something of the spirit which he labors to attain at church he carries ith him into his worldly concerns while there re some who set up for sunday christians who ave no notion that they are bound to be weekay christians too   will why master i do think if god almighty  contented with one day in seven he will not thank ou for throwing him the other six into the bargain  thought he gave us them for our own use and i m sure nobody works harder all the week than ou do   stock god it is true sets apart one day in even for actual rest from labor and for more imediate devotion to his service but show me that ext wherein he says thou shall love the lord thy god on sundays  thou shall keep my commandents on the sabbath day  to be carnally minded n sundays is death  cease to do evil and learn o do well one day in seven  grow in grace on the lords day  is there any such text   will no to be sure there is not for that would e encouraging sin in all the other days   stock yes just as you do when you make region a thing for the church and not for the world there is no one lawful calling in pursuing which we ay not serve god acceptably you and i may erve him while we are stitching this pair of boots armer furrow while he is plowing yonder field betsy west over the way whilst she is nursing her sick mother neighbor incle in measuring out him tapes and ribbons i say all these may serve god just as acceptably in those employments as at church i had almost said more so   will aye indeed  how can that be now youre too much on the other side   stock because a mans trials in trade being often greater they give him fresh means of glorifying god and proving the sincerity of his religion a man who mixes in business is naturally brought into continual temptations and difficulties these will lead him if he be a good man to look more to god than he perhaps would otherwise do he sees temptations on the right hand and on the left he knows that there are snares all around him this makes him watchful he feels that the enemy within is too ready to betray him this makes him humble himself while a sense of his own difficulties make him tender to the failings of others   will then you would make one believe after all that trade and business must be sinful in itself since it brings a man into all these snares and scrapes   stock no no will trade and business dont create evil passions  they were in the heart before  only now and then they seem to lie snug a littleour concerns with the world bring them out into action a little more and thus show both others and ourselves what we really are but then as the world offers more trials on the one hand so on the other it holds out more duties if we are called to battle oftener we have more opportunities o victory every temptation resisted is an enemy subdued and he that rules his own spirit is better than he that takes a city   will i dont quite understand you master   stock i will try to explain myself there is no assion more called out by the transactions of trade an covetousness now it is impossible to withand such a master sin as that without carrying a ood deal of the spirit of religion into ones trade   will well i own i dont yet see how i am to e religious when i am hard at work or busy settling n account i cannot do two things at once it is as f i were to pretend to make a shoe and cut out a oot at the same moment   stock i tell you both must subsist together nay he one must be the motive to the other god commands us to be industrious and if we love im the desire of pleasing him should be the main pring of our industry   will i dont see how i can always be thinking about pleasing god   stock suppose now a man had a wife and children whom he loved and wished to serve would ot he be often thinking about them while he was at work and though he would not be always thinking about them yet would not the very love he bore them be a constant spur to his industry he would always be pursuing the same course from the same motive though his words and even his thoughts must often be taken up in the common transactions of life   will well i say first one then the other now for labor now for religion   stock i will show that both must go together i will suppose you were going to buy so many skins of our currier  that is quite a worldly transaction  you cannot see what a spirit of religion has to do with buying a few calves skins now i tell you it has a great deal to do with it covetousness a desire to make a good bargain may rise up in your heart selfishness a spirit of monopoly a wish to get all in order to distress others these are evil desires and must be subdued some opportunity of unfair gain offers in which there may be much sin and yet little scandal here a christian will stop short he will recollect that he who makes haste to be rich shall hardly be innocent perhaps the sin may be on the side of your dealer  be may want to overreach you  this is provoking  you are tempted to violent anger perhaps to swear  here is a fresh demand on you for a spirit of patience and moderation as there was before for a spirit of justice and selfdenial if by gods grace you get the victory over these temptations you are the better man for having been called out to them always provided that the temptation be not of your own seeking if you give way and sink under these temptations dont go and say that trade and business have made you covetous passionate and prosane no no depend upon it you were so before you would have had all these evil seeds lurking in your heart if you had been loitering about at home and doing nothing with the additional sin of idleness into the bargain when you are busy the devil often tempts you when you are idle you tempt the devil if business and the world call these evil tempers into action business and the world call that religion into action too which teaches us to resist them and in this you see the weekday fruit of the sundays piety it is trade and business in the week which call us to put our sunday readings praying and church going into practice   will well master you have a comical way ome how of coming over one i never should ave thought there would have been any religion vanted in buying and selling a few calves skins but i begin to see there is a good deal in what ou say  and whenever i am doing a common action i will try to remember that it must be done after a godly sort   stock i hear the clock strike nine  let us leave off our work i will only observe farther that one good end of our bringing religion into our busiess is to put us in mind not to undertake more usiness than we can carry on consistently with our religion i shall never commend that mans diligence though it is often commended by the world who is not diligent about the salvation of his soul we are as much forbidden to be overcharged with he cares of life as with it is pleasures i only wish o prove to you that a discreet christian may be wise for both worlds that he may employ his hands without entangling his soul and labor for the heat that perishes without neglecting that which ndureth unto eternal life that he may be prudent or time while he is wise for eternity   z  the hymn i o that the lord would guide my ways to keep his statutes still o that my god would give me grace to know
