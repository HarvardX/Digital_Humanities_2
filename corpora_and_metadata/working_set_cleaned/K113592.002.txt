goldsmith t cadell and t evans in the strand mdcclxxiv  the history of greece chap i from the death of socrates to the death of epaminondas hither to we have pursued the athenians both in their successes and their defeats with peculiar attention while they took the lead in the affairs of greece it was necessary to place them on the fore ground of the picture but now we must change the scene and leaving the athenians acting an obscure part go to those states who successively took the lead after their downfall  sparta seems to be the first state now that gave laws to the rest of the greeks their old jealousies began to revive against the petty states that had formerly sided against them and the eleans were the first upon whom they fell under a pretense that they were not admitted by that state to the olympic games as well as the rest of the grecians having formerly declared war and being upon the point of plundering the city of elis they were taken into the alliance of sparta and the conquerors now assumed and enjoyed the title of the protectors and arbitrators of greece soon after agesilaus who was chosen king of sparta was sent into asia with an army under pretense of freeing the grecian cities he gained a signal victory over tissaphernes near the river pactolus where he forced the enemys camp and found considerable plunder this success induced the persian monarch instead of meeting agesilaus openly in the field to subvert his interest among the grecian states by the power of bribery and indeed this confederacy was now so weakened its concord and unanimity so totally destroyed that they were open to every offer the love of money was now rooted in their affections and the spartans were the only people that for a while seemed to disdain it but the contagion still spreading even they at last yielded to its allurements and every man sought private emolument without attending to the good of his country  the thebans as they were the first gained over to the persian interest so they were the most active in promoting it to strengthen their alliance they sent ambassadors to the athenians with a long representation of the present posture of affairs wherein they artfully insinuated their zeal and affection to their state from thence they took occasion to inveigh against the tyranny of sparta and concluded with telling them that now was the time to throw off the yoke and to recover their former splendour and authority the athenians though they had no share of the persian money needed not many arguments to engage them in a rupture of this kind for which they had been long waiting a fit opportunity  agesilaus who had carried on the war in persia with success received news of the war being again broke out in greece with orders at the same time for him to return home he had set his heart upon the entire conquest of persia and was preparing to march farther into the country but such was his deference to the laws and such his submission to the ephori that he instantly obeyed their mandate but left four thousand men in asia to maintain his successes there the spartans however could not wait his arrival they found confederacies thicken on their hands and they were ready to be attacked on all sides the athenians argives thebans corinthians and eubaeans joined against them and made up a body of twentyfour thousand men both sides encamped near sicyon at a small distance from each other and soon came to a regular engagement the spartan allies at first were entirely routed but the spartans themselves turned the scale of victory by their single valor and came off conquerors with the loss of but eight men this victory however was in some measure overbalanced by a loss at sea which the spartans sustained near cnidus conon the athenian general being appointed to command the persian fleet against them took fifty of their ships and pursued the rest into port agesilaus on the other hand gained a considerable victory over the athenians and their allies upon the plains of coronea thus was the war continued by furious but undecisive engagements in which neither side was a gainer and in this manner did the spartans maintain themselves and their allies without any considerable increase or diminution of their power in this general shock the athenians seemed for a while to recover their former spirit being assisted by persian money and conducted by conon an excellent general they took the field with ardour and even rebuilt the walls of their city from the mutual jealousies of these petty states among each other all were weakened and the persian monarch became arbitrator of greece in this manner after a fluctuation of successes and intrigues all parties began to grow tired of a war and a peace ensued this peace was concluded in the second year of the   th olympiad and from the many stipulations in favor of persia plutarch terms it the reproach and ruin of greece  the spartans thus freed from the terrors of a powerful foreign enemy went on to spread terror among the petty states of greece they gave peremptory orders to the mantineans to throw down their walls and compelled them to obedience they obliged the corinthians to withdraw the garrison from argosi and some other little states they treated with an air of superiority that plainly marked that they expected obedience they marched against the olynthians who had lately grown into power and effectually subdued them they interposed also in a domestic quarrel which was carried on at thebes phaebidas having seized upon the citadel they turned him out and placed a garrison of their own in that fortress they then procured articles to be exhibited against ismenias his antagonist for having taken money of the persians and holding intelligence with them and for having been a principal promoter of their intestine broils upon which he underwent a formal trial before the commissioners deputed from sparta and one from each of the other great cities of greece and was condemned to death thus having secured thebes and having by a tedious war humbled the olynthians they went on to chastise the phliasians for having abused some exiles that had been restored by the orders of sparta in this manner they continued distributing their orders with pride and severity no state of greece was able to oppose their authority and under the color of executing justice they were hourly paving the way to supreme command in the midst of this security they were alarmed from a quarter where they least expected the thebans had for four years since the seizing of their citadel submitted to the spartan yoke but they now took occasion by a very desperate attempt to throw it off for which purpose there was a secret correspondence carried on between the most considerable of the exiles of athens and those who were well affected to them in thebes and measures were conducted between them by phyllidas secretary to the theban governors by whose contrivance a competent number of the exiles were to get into the city and charon a man of the first rank there offered his house for their reception the day being fixed they set out from athens and twelve of the most active and resolute among them were detached to enter the city the rest remaining at a proper distance to wait the event the first who offered himself was pelopidas who was young and daring and had been very zealous in encouraging the design and by the share he had in it gave a sufficient earnest of what might be further expected from him in the service of his country the next man of consequence was mellon who by some is said to have first projected the scheme with phyllidas these two with their ten associates dressed themselves like peasants and beat about the fields with dogs and huntingpoles as in search of game having thus passed unsuspected and conveyed themselves into the city they met at charons house as the general rendezvous when they were soon after joined by thirtysix more of their confederates it was concerted that phyllidas should on that day give a great entertainment to archias and philip the two governors who were appointed by the spartans and to make it the more complete he had engaged to provide some of the finest women in the town to give them a meeting matters being thus prepared the associates divided themselves into two bands one of which led by charon and mellon were to attack archias and his company and having put on womens clothes over their armor with pine and poplar over their heads to shade their faces they took their opportunity when the guests were well heated with wine to enter the room and immediately stabbed archias and philip with such others of the company as were pointed out to them by phyllidas a little before this execution archias received an express from athens with all the particulars of the conspiracy and the courier conjured him in the name of the person who wrote the letters that he should read them forthwith for that they contained matter of great importance but he laid them by unopened and with a smile said business tomorrow which words upon that occasion grew into a proverb the other band headed by pelopidas and damoclides went to attack leontiades who was at home and in bed they rushed into his house by surprise but he soon taking the alarm leaped up and with his sword in his hand received them at his chamber door and stabbed cephisodorus who was the first man that attempted to enter pelopidas was the next who encountered him and after a long and difficult dispute killed him from thence they went in pursuit of hypates his friend and neighbor and dispatched him likewise after which they joined the other band and sent to hasten the exiles they had left in attica  the whole city was by this time filled with terror and confusion the houses full of lights and the inhabitants running to and fro in the streets in a wild distracted manner and waiting impatiently for daylight that they might distinguish their friends from their foes seemed undetermined what course to take early in the morning the exiles came in armed and pelopidas appeared with his party in a general assembly of the people encompassed by the priests carrying garlands in their hands proclaiming liberty to the thebans in general and exhorting them to fight for their gods and their country for though they had made such a prosperous beginning the most difficult part still remained whilst the citadel was in the possession of the spartans with a garrison of fifteen hundred men besides a great number of citizens and others who had fled to them for protection and declared themselves on their side  early the next morning the athenians sent five thousand foot and two thousand horse to the assistance of pelopidas several other bodies of troops also came in from all the cities of boeotia so that the citadel being hemmed round and despairing of succors from without surrendered at discretion  the thebans having thus acquired their freedom the spartans were resolved at any rate to take the lead in the affairs of greece and having incensed these beyond measure attempted to seize upon the pyraeus and thus made the athenians their irreconcilable enemies agesilaus was pitched upon to command the army that was to humble the grecian states his name struck a terror into the thebans and his forces which amounted to near twenty thousand men increased their fears the thebans therefore instead of attempting to attack were contented to stand upon their defense and possessed themselves of a hill near the city agesilaus detached a party of light armed men to provoke them to come down and give him battle which they declining he drew out his whole forces in order to attack them chabrias who commanded the mercenaries on the part of the thebans ordered his men to present themselves and keep their ranks in close order with their shields laid down at their feet and their spears advanced and with one leg put forward and the knee upon the halfbent agesilaus finding them prepared in this manner to receive him and that they stood as it were in defiance of him thought fit to withdraw his army and contented himself with ravaging the country this was looked upon as an extraordinary stratagem and chabrias valued himself so much upon it that he procured his statue to be erected in that posture  thus through a succession of engagements both by sea and land the spartans having provoked a powerful confederacy grew every day weaker and their enemies more daring the thebans continually grew bolder and instead of continuing to defend themselves with difficulty attacked the enemy with courage and success though the battles fought between these states were neither regular nor decisive yet they were such as served to raise the courage of the thebans to gain them confidence and to form them for those great undertakings which were shortly to follow pelopidas who headed them at the battle of tanagra slew the spartan commander with his own hand at the battle of tegyra with very unequal forces he put a large body of the enemy to rout he himself commanded a battalion of the theban army distinguished by the name of the sacred van they were as remarkable for their fidelity to each other as for their strength and courage they were linked by the bonds of common friendship and were sworn to stand by each other in the most dangerous extremities thus united they became invincible and generally turned the victory in their favor for a succession of years until they were at last cut down as one man by the macedonian phalanx under philip  a peace of short continuance followed these successes of the thebans but they soon fell into tumults and seditions again the inhabitants of xacinthus and corcyra having expelled their magistrates put themselves under the protection of athens and repulsed the spartans who attempted to restore their magistrates by force  about the same time the inhabitants of platea applying to their old friends the athenians for their protection and alliance the thebans took offense at it and demolished the town and soon after did the same by thespiae the athenians were so highly incensed at the treatment of those two cities which had deserved so well of the common cause in the persian war that they would act no longer in conjunction with them and upon their breaking with them the affairs of greece took a new and unexpected turn  it now began to appear that the thebans were growing into power and while sparta and athens were weakening each other by mutual contests this state which had enjoyed all the emoluments without any of the expenses of the war was every day growing more vigorous and independent the thebans who now began to take the lead in the affairs of greece were naturally a hardy and robust people of slow intellects and strong constitutions it was a constant maxim with them to side either with athens or sparta in their mutual contests and which soever they inclined to they were generally of weight enough to turn the balance however they had hitherto made no further use of that weight than to secure themselves but the spirit which now appeared among them was first implanted by pelopidas their deliverer from the spartan yoke but still further carried to its utmost height by epaminondas who now began to figure in the affairs of greece  epaminondas was one of those few exalted characters with scarce any vice and almost every virtue to distinguish him from the rest of mankind though in the beginning possessed of every quality necessary for the service of the state he chose to lead a private life employed in the study of philosophy and showing an example of the most rigid observance of all its doctrines  truly a philosopher and poor out of taste he despised riches without affecting any reputation from that contempt and if justin may be believed he coveted glory as little as he did money it was always against his will that commands were conferred upon him and he behaved himself in them in such a manner as did more honor to dignities than dignities to him  though poor himself and without any estate his very poverty by drawing upon him the esteem and confidence of the rich gave him the opportunity of doing good to others one of his friends being in great necessity epaminondas sent him to a very rich citizen with orders to ask him for a thousand crowns in his name that rich man coming to his house to know his motives for directing his friend to him upon such an errand why replied epaminondas it is because this honest man is in want and you are rich fond of leisure which he devoted to the study of philosophy his darling passion he shunned public employments and made no interest but to exclude himself from them his moderation concealed him so well that he lived obscure and almost unknown his merit however discovered him he was taken from his solitude by force to be placed at the head of armies and he demonstrated that philosophy though generally in contempt with those who aspire at the glory of arms is wonderfully useful in forming heroes for it was a great advance toward conquering the enemy to know how to conquer ones self in this school anciently were taught the great maxims of true policy the rules of every kind of duty the motives for a due discharge of them what we owe our country the right use of authority wherein true courage consists in a word the qualities that form the good citizen statesman and great captain and in all these epaminondas excelled  he possessed all the ornaments of the mind he had the talent of speaking in perfection and was well versed in the most sublime sciences but a modest reserve threw a veil over all those excellent qualities which still augmented their value and of which he knew not what it was to be ostentatious spintharus in giving his character said that he never had met with a man who knew more and spoke less  such was the general appointed to command the theban army and act in conjunction with pelopidas with whom he had the most perfect and the most disinterested friendship this state being left out in the general treaty of peace and thus having the spartans and athenians confederated against it they appeared under the utmost consternation and all greece looked upon them as lost and undone the spartans ordered levies to be made in all parts of greece that sided with them and cleombrotus their general marched toward the frontiers of boeotia secure of victory willing however to give his hostilities an air of justice he sent to demand of the thebans that they should restore the cities that they had usurped to their liberties that they should rebuild those they had demolished before and make restitution for all their former wrongs to this it was replied that the thebans were accountable to none but heaven for their conduct nothing now remained on both sides but to prepare for action epaminondas immediately raised all the troops he could and began his march his army did not amount to six thousand men and the enemy had above four times that number as several bad omens were urged to prevent his setting out he replied only by a verse from homer of which the sense is there is but one good omen to fight for ones country however to reassure the soldiers by nature superstitious and whom he observed to be discouraged he instructed several persons to come from different places and report auguries and omens in his favor which revived the spirit and hopes of the troops  epaminondas had wisely taken care to secure a pass by cleombrotus which might have shortened his march considerably the latter after having taken a large compass arrived at leuctra a small town of boeotia between plataea and thespiae both parties consulted whether they should give battle which cleombrotus resolved by the advice of all his officers who represented to him that if he declined fighting with such a superiority of troops it would confirm the current report that he secretly favored the thebans the latter had an essential reason for hastening a battle before the arrival of the troops which the enemy daily expected however the six generals who formed the council of war differed in their sentiments the seventh who was epaminondas came in very good time to join the three that were for fighting and his opinion carrying the question the battle was resolved upon  the two armies were very unequal in number that of the lacedaemonians as has been said consisted of twentysour thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse the thebans had only six thousand foot and four hundred horse but all of them choice troops animated by their experience in war and determined to conquer or die the lacedemonian cavalry composed of men picked up by chance without valor and ill disciplined was as much inferior to their enemies in courage as superior in number the infantry could not be depended on except the lacedaemonians the allies as has been said having engaged in the war with reluctance because they did not approve the motive of it and being besides diffatisfied with the lacedaemonians  the ability of the generals of either side supplied the place of numerous armies especially of the theban who was the most accomplished soldier of his times he was supported by pelopidas at the head of the sacred battalion composed of three hundred thebans united in a strict friendship and affection and engaged under a particular oath never to fly but to defend each other to the last  upon the day of battle the two armies drew up on a plain cleombrotus was upon the right at the head of a body consisting of lacedaemonians on whom he confided most and whose files were twelve deep to take the advantage which his superiority of horse gave him in an open country he posted them in front of his lacedaemonians archidamus the son of agesilaus was at the head of the allies who formed the left wing  epaminondas who resolved to charge with his left which he commanded in person strengthened it with the choice of his heavyarmed troops whom he drew up fifty deep the sacred battalion was upon his left and closed the wing the rest of his infantry were posted upon his right in an oblique line which the farther it extended was the more distant from the enemy by this uncommon disposition his design was to cover his flank on the right to keep off his right wing as a kind of reserved body that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon the weakest part of his army and to begin the action with his left wing where his best troops were posted to turn the whole weight of the battle upon cleombrotus and the spartans he was assured that if he could penetrate the lacedemonian phalanx the rest of the army would soon be put to the rout as for his horse he disposed them after the enemys example in the front of his left  the action began with the cavalry as the thebans were better mounted and braver troops than the lacedemonian horse the latter were not long before they were broke and driven upon the infantry which they put into some confusion epaminondas following his horse close marched swiftly up to cleombrotus and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of his heavy battalion the latter to make a diversion detached a body of troops with orders to take epaminondas in flank and to surround him pelopidas upon the sight of that movement advanced with incredible speed and boldness at the head of the sacred battalion to prevent the enemys design and flanked cleombrotus himself who by that sudden and unexpected attack was put into disorder the battle was very fierce and obstinate and whilst cleombrotus could act the victory continued in suspense and declared for neither party but when he fell dead with his wounds the thebans to complete the victory and the lacedaemonians to avoid the shame of abandoning the body of their king redoubled their efforts and a great slaughter ensued on both sides the spartans fought with so much fury about the body that at length they gained their point and carried it off animated by so glorious an advantage they prepared to return to the charge which would perhaps have proved successful had the allies seconded their ardour but the left wing seeing the lacedemonian phalanx broken and believing all lost especially when they heard that the king was dead took to flight and drew off the rest of the army epaminondas followed them vigorously and killed a great number in the pursuit the thebans remained masters of the field of battle erected a trophy and permitted the enemy to bury their dead  the lacedaemonians had never received such a blow the most bloody defeat till then had scarce ever cost them more than four or five hundred of their citizens here they lost four thousand men of whom one thousand were lacedaemonians and four hundred spartans out of seven hundred who were in the battle the thebans had only three hundred men killed among whom were four of their citizens  the city of sparta was celebrating at that time the gymnastic games and was full of strangers whom curiosity had brought thither when the couriers arrived from leuctra with the terrible news of their defeat the ephori though perfectly sensible of all the consequences and that the spartan empire had received a mortal wound would not permit the representations of the theater to be suspended nor any changes in the celebration of the festival they sent to every family the names of their relations who were killed and stayed in the theater to see that the dances and games were continued without interruption to the end  the next day in the morning the loss of each family being known the fathers and relations of those who had died in the battle met in the public place and saluted and embraced each other with great joy and serenity in their looks whilst the others kept themselves close in their houses or if necessity obliged them to go abroad it was with a sadness and dejection of aspect which sensibly expressed their profound anguish and affliction that difference was still more remarkable in the women grief silence tears distinguished those who expected the return of their sons but such as had lost their sons were seen hurrying to the temple to thank the gods and congratulating each other upon their glory and good fortune  one great point under immediate consideration was concerning those who had fled out of the battle they were by the law in that case to be degraded from all honor and rendered infamous insomuch that it was a disgrace to intermarry with them they were to appear publicly in mean and dirty habits with patched and partycolored garments and to go half shaved and whoever met them in the streets might insult and beat them and they were not to make any resistance this was so severe a law and such numbers had incurred the penalties of it many of whom were of great families and interest that they apprehended the execution of it might occasion some public commotions besides that these citizens such as they were could very ill be spared at this time when they wanted to recruit the army under this difficulty they gave agesilaus a power even over the laws to dispense with them to abrogate them or to enact such new ones as the present exigency required he would not abolish or make any variation in the law itself but made a public declaration that it should lie dormant for that single day but revive and be in full force again on the morrow and by that expedient he saved the citizens from infamy  so great a victory was followed by instantaneous effects numbers of the grecian states that had hitherto remained neuter now declared in favor of the conquerors and increased their army to the amount of seventy thousand men epaminondas entered laconia with an army the twelfth part of which were not thebans and finding a country hitherto untouched by an enemy he ran through it with fire and sword destroying and plundering as far as the river eurotas  this river was at that time very much swollen by the melting of the snow and the thebans sound more difficulty in passing it than they expected as well from the rapidity as the extreme coldness of the water as epaminondas was passing at the head of his infantry some of the spartans showed him to agesilaus who after having attentively considered and followed him with his eyes a long time could not help crying out in admiration of his valor oh the wonderworking man the theban general however contented himself with overrunning the country without attempting any thing upon sparta and entering arcadia reinstated it in all its former privileges and liberties the lacedaemonians had some time before stripped the harmless natives of all their possessions and obliged them to take refuge among strangers their country was equal in extent to laconia and as fertile as the best in greece its ancient inhabitants who were dispersed in different regions of greece italy and sicily on the first notice given them returned with incredible joy animated by the love of their country natural to all men and almost as much by the hatred of the spartans which the length of time had only increased they built themselves a city which from the ancient name was called messene  after performing such signal exploits pelopidas and epaminondas the theban generals once more returned home not to share the triumph and acclamations of their fellowcitizens but to answer the accusations that were laid against them they were now both summoned as criminals against the state of having retained their posts four months beyond the time limited by law this offense was capital by the laws of thebes and those who stood up for the constitution were very earnest in having it observed with punctuality pelopidas was the first cited before the tribunal he defended himself with less force and greatness of mind than was expected from a man of his character by nature warm and fiery that valor haughty and intrepid in fight forsook him before his judges his air and discourse which had something timid and creeping in it denoted a man who was afraid of death and did not in the least incline the judges in his favor who acquitted him not without difficulty epaminondas on the contrary appeared with all the confidence of conscious innocence instead of justifying himself he enumerated his actions he repeated in haughty terms in what manner he had ravaged laconia reestablished messenia and reunited arcadia in one body he concluded with saying that he should die with pleasure if the thebans would renounce the sole glory of those actions to him and declare that he had done them by his own authority and without their participation all the voices were in his favor and he returned from his trial as he used to return from battle with glory and universal applause such dignity has true valor that it in a manner seizes the admiration of mankind by force this manner of reproaching them had so good an effect that his enemies declined any further prosecution and he with his colleague were honorably acquitted his enemies however jealous of his glory with a design to affront him caused him to be elected the city scavenger he accepted the place with thanks and asserted that instead of deriving honor from the office he would give it dignity in his turn  in the mean time the spartans struck with consternation at their late defeats applied to the athenians for succor who after some hesitation determined to assist them with all their forces and a slight advantage the spartans had gained over the arcadians in which they did not lose a man gave a promising dawn of success the persian king was also applied to for assistance in the confederacy against thebes but pelopidas undertaking an embassy to that court frustrated their purpose and induced that great monarch to stand neuter  thebes being thus rid of so powerful an enemy had less fears of withstanding the confederacy of sparta and athens but a new and an unexpected power was now growing up against them a power which was one day about to swallow up the liberties of greece and give laws to all mankind  some years before this jason the king of pherae was chosen general of the thessalians by the consent of the people he was at the head of an army of above eight thousand horse and twenty thousand heavy armed foot without reckoning light infantry and might have undertaken any thing with such a body of disciplined and intrepid troops who had an entire confidence in the valor and conduct of their commander death prevented his designs he was assassinated by persons who had conspired his destruction his two brothers polydorus and poliphron were substituted in his place against him pelopidas was sent the latter of whom killed the other for the sake of reigning alone and was soon after killed himself by alexander of pherae who seized the government under the pretense of revenging the death of polydorus his father the theban general soon compelled alexander to make submission to him and attempted by mild usage to change the natural brutality of his disposition but alexander long addicted to a debauched life and possessed of insatiable avarice secretly withdrew from all constraint resolved to seize an opportunity of revenge it was not till some time after that this offered for pelopidas being appointed ambassador to alexander who was at that time at the head of a powerful army he was seized upon and made prisoner contrary to all the laws of nations and humanity it was in vain that the thebans complained of this infraction it was in vain that they sent a powerful army but headed by indifferent generals to revenge the insult their army returned without effect and alexander treated his prisoners with the utmost severity it was left for epaminondas only to bring the tyrant to reason entering thessalia at the head of a powerful army his name spread such terror that the tyrant offered terms of submission and delivered up pelopidas from prison  pelopidas was scarce freed from confinement when he resolved to punish the tyrant for his perfidy and breach of faith he led a body of troops against alexander to a place called cynocephalus where a bloody battle ensued in which the thebans were victorious but pelopidas was unfortunately slain his countrymen considered their successes very dearly earned which they had obtained by his death the lamentations for him were general his funeral was magnificent and his praises boundless alexander himself soon after was killed by theba his wife and his three brothers who long shocked at his cruelties resolved to rid the world of such a monster the account has it that he slept every night guarded by a dog in a chamber which was ascended by a ladder theba allured away the dog and covered the steps of the ladder with wool to prevent noise and then with the assistance of her brothers stabbed him in several parts of his body  in the mean time the war between the thebans and the spartans proceeded with unabated vigor the theban troops were headed by their favorite general epaminondas those of sparta by agesilaus the only man in greece that was then able to oppose him  the first attempt of epaminondas in this campaign marked his great abilities and his skill in the art of war being informed that agesilaus had begun his march with his army and had left but few citizens to defend sparta at home he marched directly thither by night with a design to take the city by surprise as it had neither walls nor troops to defend it but luckily agesilaus was apprised of his design and dispatched one of his horse to advise the city of its danger soon after arriving with a powerful succor in person he had scarce entered the town when the thebans were seen passing the eurotas and coming on against the city epaminondas who perceived that his design was discovered thought it incumbent on him not to retire without some attempt he therefore made his troops advance and making use of valor instead of stratagem he attacked the city at several quarters penetrated as far as the public place and seized that part of sparta which lay upon the hither side of the river agesilaus made head every where and defended himself with much more valor than could be expected from his years he saw well that it was not now a time as before to spare himself and to act only upon the defensive but that he had need of all his courage and daring and to fight with all the vigor of despair his son archidamus at the head of the spartan youth behaved with incredible valor whenever the danger was greatest and with his small troop stopped the enemy and made head against them on all sides  a young spartan named isadas distinguished himself particularly in this action he was very handsome in the face perfectly well shaped of an advantageous stature and in the flower of his youth he had neither armor nor clothes upon his body which shone with oil he held a spear in one hand and a sword in the other in this condition he quitted his house with the utmost eagerness and breaking through the press of the spartans that fought he threw himself upon the enemy gave mortal wounds at every blow and laid all at his feet who opposed him without receiving any hurt himself whether the enemy were dismayed at so astonishing a sight or says plutarch the gods took pleasure in preserving him upon account of his extraordinary valor it is said the ephori decreed him a crown after the battle in honor of his exploits but afterward fined him a thousand drachmas for having exposed himself to so great a danger without arms  epaminondas thus failing in his design was resolved before he laid down his command which was near expiring to give the lacedaemonians and athenians battle as they followed him close in the rear  the greeks had never fought among themselves with more numerous armies the lacedaemonians consisted of more than twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse the thebans of thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse upon the right wing of the former the mantineans arcadians and lacedaemonians were posted in one line the eleans and achaeans who were the weakest of their troops had the center and the athenians alone composed the left wing in the other army the thebans and arcadians were on the left the argives on the right and the other allies in the center the cavalry on each side were disposed in the wings  the theban general marched in the same order of battle in which he intended to fight that he might not be obliged when he came up with the enemy to lose in the disposition of his army a time which cannot be recovered when lost in great enterprises  he did not march directly and with his front to the enemy but in a column upon the hills with his left wing foremost as if he did not intend to fight that day when he was over against them at a quarter of a leagues distance he made the troops halt and lay down their arms as if he designed to encamp there the enemy in effect were deceived by his stand and reckoning no longer upon a battle they quitted their arms dispersed themselves about the camp and suffered that ardour to be extinguished which a near approach of a battle is wont to kindle in the hearts of the soldiers  epaminondas however by suddenly wheeling his troops to the right having changed his column into a line and having drawn out the choice troops whom he had expressly posted in front upon his march he made them double their files upon the front of his left wing to add to its strength and to put it into a condition to attack in a point the lacedemonian phalanx which by the movement he had made faced it directly he ordered the center and right wing of his army to move very slow and to halt before they came up with the enemy that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops of which he had no great opinion  he expected to decide the victory by that body of chosen troops which he commanded in person and which he had formed into a column to attack the enemy in a wedgelike point he assured himself that if he could penetrate the lacedemonian phalanx in which the enemys principal force consisted he should not find it difficult to rout the rest of the army by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops  but that he might prevent the athenians in the left wing from coming to the support of their right against his intended attack he made a detachment of his horse and foot advance out of the line and posted them upon a rising ground in readiness to flank the athenians as well to cover his right as to alarm them and give them reason to apprehend being taken in flank and rear themselves if they advanced to sustain their right  after having disposed his whole army in this manner he moved on to charge the enemy with the whole weight of his column they were strangely surprised when they saw epaminondas advance toward them in this order and resumed their arms bridled their horses and made all the haste they could to their ranks  whilst epaminondas marched against the enemy the cavalry that covered his flank on the left the best at that time in greece entirely composed of thebans and thessalians had orders to attack the enemys horse the theban general whom nothing escaped had artfully bestowed bowmen slingers and dartmen in the intervals of his horse in order to begin the disorders of the enemys cavalry by a previous discharge of a shower of arrows stones and javelins upon them the other army had neglected to take the same precaution and had made another fault not less considerable in giving as much depth to the squadrons as if they had been a phalanx by this means their horse were incapable of supporting long the charge of the thebans after having made several ineffectual attacks with great loss they were obliged to retire behind their infantry  in the mean time epaminondas with his body of foot had charged the lacedemonian phalanx the troops fought on both sides with incredible ardour both the thebans and lacedaemonians being resolved to perish rather than yield the glory of arms to their rivals they began with fighting with the spear and those first arms being soon broken in the fury of the combat they charged each other sword in hand the resistance was equally obstinate and the slaughter very great on both sides the troops despising danger and desiring only to distinguish themselves by the greatness of their actions chose rather to die in their ranks than to lose a step of their ground  the furious slaughter on both sides having continued a great while without the victory inclining to either epaminondas to force it to declare for him thought it his duty to make an extraordinary effort in person without regard to the danger of his own life he formed therefore a troop of the bravest and most determinate about him and putting himself at the head of them made a vigorous charge upon the enemy where the battle was most warm and wounded the general of the lacedaemonians with the first javelin he threw this troop by his example having wounded or killed all that stood in their way broke and penetrated the phalanx the lacedaemonians dismayed by the presence of epaminondas and overpowered by the weight of that intrepid party were reduced to give ground the gross of the theban troops animated by their generals example and success drove back the enemy upon his right and left and made great slaughter of them but some troops of the spartans perceiving that epaminondas abandoned himself too much to his ardour suddenly rallied and returning to the fight charged him with a shower of javelins whilst he kept off part of those darts shunned some of them fenced off others and was fighting with the most heroic valor to assure the victory to his army a spartan named callicrates gave him a mortal wound with a javelin in the breast across his cuirass the wood of the javelin being broke off and the iron head continuing in the wound the torment was insupportable and he fell immediately the battle began around him with new fury the one side using their utmost endeavors to take him alive and the other to save him the thebans gained their point at last and carried him off after having put the enemy to flight  after several different movements and alternative losses and advantages the troops on both sides stood still and rested upon their arms and the trumpets of the two armies as if by consent sounded the retreat at the same time each party pretended to the victory and erected a trophy the thebans because they had defeated the right wing and remained masters of the field of battle the athenians because they had cut the detachment in pieces and from this point of honor both sides refused at first to ask leave to bury their dead which with the ancients was confessing their defeat the lacedaemonians however sent first to demand that permission after which the rest had no thoughts but of paying the last duties to the slain  in the mean time epaminondas had been carried into the camp the surgeons after having examined the wound declared that he would expire as soon as the head of the dart was drawn out of it those words gave all that were present the utmost sorrow and affliction who were inconsolable on seeing so great a man upon the point of expiring for him the only concern he expressed was about his arms and the success of the battle when they showed him his shield and assured him that the thebans had gained the victory turning toward his friends with a calm and serene air all then is well said he and soon after upon drawing the head of the javelin out of his body he expired in the arms of victory  as the glory of thebes rose with epaminondas so it fell with him and he is perhaps the only instance of one mans being able to inspire his country with military glory and lead it on to conquest without having had a predecessor or leaving an imitator of his example  the battle of mantinea was the greatest that ever was fought by grecians against grecians the whole strength of the country being drawn out and ranged according to their different interests and it was fought with an obstinacy equal to the importance of it which was the fixing the empire of greece and this must of course have been transferred to the thebans upon their victory if they had not lost the fruits of it by the death of their general who was the soul of all their counsels and designs this blasted all their hopes and put out their sudden blaze of power almost as soon as it was kindled however they did not presently give up their pretensions they were still ranked among the leading states and made several further struggles but they were faint and ineffectual and such as were rather for life and being than for superiority and dominion a peace therefore was proposed which was ratified by all the states of greece except sparta the conditions of which were that every state should maintain what they possessed and hold it independent of any other power  a state of repose ensued this peace in which the grecian powers seemed to slacken from their former animosities and if we except an expedition under agesilaus into egypt whither he went to assist tachos who had usurped that kingdom and in which he died there was little done for several years following the athenians more particularly when they found themselves delivered from him who kept up their emulation grew indolent a nd remiss and abandoned themselves to their ease and pleasure being wholly taken up with shows sports and festivals they were naturally too much addicted to these amusements and they had formerly been encouraged in them by pericles who knew how to lead them by their inclinations and took this method to ingratiate himself and to divert them from inspecting too narrowly into his administration but they now carried their diversions to a much higher pitch of extravagance they had such a passion for the stage that it stifled in them all other thoughts either of business or of glory in short the decorations and other charges attending the theater were so excessive that plutarch says it cost more to represent some of the famous pieces of sophocles and euripides than it had done to carry on the war against the barbarians and in order to support this charge they seized upon the fund which had been set apart for the war with a prohibition upon pain of death ever to advise the applying of it to any other purpose they not only reversed this decree but went as far the other way making it death to propose the restoring the fund to the uses to which it had before been appropriated under the same penalties by diverting the course of the supplies in so extraordinary a manner and entertaining the idle citizen at the expense of the soldier and marinet they seemed to have no remains of that spirit and vigor which they had exerted in the persian wars when they demolished their houses to furnish out a navy and when the women stoned a man to death who proposed to appease the great king as he was called by paying tribute and doing homage  in this general remissness it was not to be supposed that their allies would treat them with the respect they demanded most of the states that had hitherto been in alliance with them a j c    and had found security under their protection took up arms against them in reducing these chabrias iphicrates and timotheus gained great reputation and are supposed to have been consummate generals but their successes are too minute to rank them among the class of eminent commanders and whatever their skill might have been there wanted a great occasion for its display this war opened with the siege of chio in which the athenians were repulsed and chabrias unwilling to abandon his vessel preferred death to flight the siege of byzantium followed before which the fleet of the contending powers was dispersed by a storm in consequence of which the athenian generals were recalled timotheus was fined a great sum but being too poor to pay he went into voluntary banishment iphicrates was also obliged to answer for himself but got off by his eloquence and in the mean time the affairs of athens succeeded but ill under the guidance of charis who was left sole commander a peace was concluded whereby every city and people were left to the full enjoyment of their liberty and thus the war of the allies ended after having continued three years  during these transactions a power was growing up in greece hitherto unobserved but now too conspicuous and formidable to be overlooked in the general picture this was that of the macedonians a people hitherto obscure and in a manner barbarous and who though warlike and hardy had never yet presumed to intermeddle in the affairs of greece but now several circumstances concurred to raise them from obscurity and to involve them in measures which by degrees wrought a thorough change in the state of greece it will be necessary therefore to begin with a short account of their power and origin before we enter into a detail of that conspicuous part which they afterward performed on the theater of the world  chap ii from the birth to the death of philip king of macedon the people of macedon were hitherto considered as making no part of the grecian confederacy they were looked upon as borderers as men in a measure semibarbarous who boasted indeed of taking their origin from the greeks but who hitherto neither possessed their politeness nor enjoyed their freedom they had little or no intercourse with their mother country they had contracted the habits and manners of the natives where they were settled and from thence they were treated with similar disrespect  the first king who is mentioned with any degree of certainty to have reigned in macedonia was caranus by birth an argive and said to be the sixteenth in descent from hercules it was upon this foundation that philip afterward grounded his pretensions to be of the race of hercules and assumed to himself divine honors caranus therefore is commonly reputed to have led forth a body of his countrymen by the advice of the oracle into these parts where he settled and made himself king caranus having according to the general account reigned twentyeight years the succession was continued after him to the times we are now treating of but there is very little worth notice recorded of these kings they being chiefly employed in defending themselves against the incursions of their neighbors and as to their domestic affairs they were remarkable only for the frequent murders and usurpations which happened in the royal family  amyntas father of philip began to reign the third year of the ninetysixth olympiad having the very year after been warmly attacked by the illyrians and dispossessed of a great part of his kingdom which he thought it scarce possible for him ever to recover again he addressed himself to the olynthians and in order to engage them the more firmly in his interest he had given up to them a considerable track of land in the neighborhood of their city he was restored to the throne by the thessalians upon which he was desirous of resuming the possession of the lands which nothing but the ill situation of his affairs had obliged him to resign to the olynthians this occasioned a war but amyntas not being strong enough to make head singly against so powerful a people the greeks and the athenians in particular sent him succors and enabled him to weaken the power of the olynthians who threatened him with a total and impending ruin  amyntas died after having reigned twentyfour years he left three legitimate children namely alexander perdicas and philip alexander the eldest son reigned but one year perdicas the second brother was opposed by pausanias who began by seizing some fortresses but by the assistance of iphicrates the athenian general the usurper was expelled and perdicas the lawful sovereign confirmed on the throne he did not however long continue in tranquillity ptolemy a natural son of amyntas laid claim to the crown and disputed his title which by mutual consent was referred to pelopidas the theban a man more revered for his probity than his valor pelopidas determined in favor of perdicas and having judged it necessary to take pledges on both sides in order to oblige the two competitors to observe the articles of the treaty accepted by them among other hostages he carried philip with him to thebes where he resided several years he was then ten years of age eurydice at her leaving this muchloved son earnestly besought pelopidas to procure him an education worthy of his birth and of the city to which he was going an hostage pelopidas placed him with epaminondas who had a celebrated pythagorean philosopher in his house for the education of his son philip improved greatly by the instructions of his preceptor and much more by those of epaminondas under whom he undoubtedly made some campaigns though no mention is made of this he could not possibly have had a more excellent master whether for war or the conduct of life for this illustrious theban was at the same time a great philosopher that is to say a wise and virtuous man and a great commander as well as a great statesman philip was very proud of being his pupil and proposed him as a model to himself most happy could he have copied him perfectly perhaps he borrowed from epaminondas his activity in war and his promptitude in improving occasions which however formed but a very inconsiderable part of the merit of that illustrious personage but with regard to his temperance his justice his disinterestedness his sincerity his magnanimity his clemency which rendered him truly great these were virtues which philip had not received from nature and did not acquire by imitation  the thebans did not know that they were then forming and educating the most dangerous enemy of greece after philip had spent nine or ten years in their city the news of a revolution in macedon made him resolve to leave thebes clandestinely accordingly he stole away made the utmost expedition and found the macedonians greatly surprised at having lost their king perdicas who had been killed in a great battle by the illyrians but much more so to find they had as many enemies as neighbors the illyrians were on the point of returning into the kingdom with a much greater force the peonians infested it with perpetual incursions the thracians were determined to place pausanias on the throne who had not abandoned his pretensions and the athenians were bringing argaeus whom mantias their general was ordered to support with a strong fleet and a considerable body of troops macedonia at that time wanted a prince of years to govern and had only a child amyntas the son of perdicas and lawful heir of the crown philip governed the kingdom for some time by the title of guardian to the prince but the subjects justly alarmed deposed the nephew in favor of the uncle and instead of the heir whom nature had given them set him upon the throne whom the present conjuncture of affairs required persuaded that the laws of necessity are superior to all others accordingly philip at twentyfour years of age ascended the throne the first year of the  0 th olympiad  never did the present condition of the macedonians require a man of more prudence and activity they were surrounded with as many enemies as they had neighbors the illyrians slushed with their late victory were preparing to march against them with a great army the paeonians were making daily incursions upon them and at the same time the title to the crown was contested by pausanias and argaeus the former whereof was supported by the thracians and the latter by the athenians who for that purpose had sent out a good fleet and three thousand landmen  under these circumstances with so many enemies on his hands at once and that before he was settled on the throne his first care was to make sure of his own people to gain their affections and to raise their spirits for they were very much disheartened having lost above four thousand men in the late action with the illyrians he succeeded in these points by the artfulness of his address and the force of his eloquence of which he was a great master his next step was to train and exercise them and reform their discipline and it was at this time that he instituted the famous macedonian phalanx which did so much execution it was an improvement upon the ancient manner of fighting among the grecians who generally drew up their foot so close as to stand the shock of the enemy without being broken the complete phalanx was thought to contain above sixteen thousand men though it was also taken in general for any company or party of soldiers and frequently for the whole body of foot but this of philips invention is described by polybius to be a long square consisting of eight thousand pikemen sixteen deep and five hundred in front the men standing so close together that the pikes of the fifth rank were extended three foot beyond the line of the front the rest whose distance from the front made their pikes useless rested them upon the shoulders of those who stood before them and so locking them together in file pressed forward to support and push on the former ranks whereby the assault was rendered more violent and irresistible  when philip had made some proper regulation of his affairs at home he began to look abroad in order to divert the storms which threatened him from all quarters by money and promises he made up matters for the present with such of his enemies as lay nearest to him and then turned his forces against the athenians who were marched up to methone to assist argaeus he gave them battle and defeated them and the death of argaeus who was killed in the action put an end to that dispute for he permitted the athenians when they were in his power to return home this instance of his moderation gained so far upon them that they soon after concluded a peace with him which yet he observed no longer than it served his design of securing the other part of his dominions  accordingly he marched northward where he declared war against the paeonians and subdued them then fell upon the illyrians and having killed above seven thousand of them in a pitched battle obliged them to restore all their conquests in macedonia he had also obstructed the passage of the thasians but yet did not think it sufficiently secured without making himself master of amphipolis which was very commodiously situated on the river strymon and was the key of that side of his dominions he knew the importance of it therefore he possessed himself of it in the beginning of his reign this was the ground of his quarrel with the athenians who claimed it as one of their colonies and made such a point of it that their setting up argaeus against him was not so much for his own sake as for the credit of imposing a king upon the macedonians as it was with a view to get the city restored to them by his means in case he should have succeeded in his intentions philip was sensible of their drift and finding it necessary at that time to keep some measures with them would neither keep the place himself nor let them have it but took a middle course and declared it a free city thereby leaving the inhabitants to throw off their dependence on their old masters and making it appear to be their own act but the city continued no longer in this state than until he sound himself at liberty to make a more thorough conquest of it which at this time he easily effected through the remissness of the athenians who refused to send any relief to it alleging in their excuse that it would be a breach of the peace which they had concluded with philip the year before but the truth is he tricked them out of it by a promise of delivering it up to them but instead of keeping his word with them he made further encroachments by seizing on pydna and potidea the latter of which being garrisoned by athenians he drew them out and sent them home but dismissed them with such marks of civility as showed that he avoided coming to an open rupture with that state at least until his designs were more ripe for it though at the same time he did what he could to weaken them and drive them out of his neighborhood pydna with the territory belonging to it he gave up to the olynthians who were his fathers inveterate enemies his hands were too full at this time to revive the quarrel against so rich and powerful a city which for three years together had withstood the united forces of sparta and macedonia he therefore chose to buy their friendship for the present and to amuse them by the delivery of this town as he had done the athenians by the peace until he could attack them at more advantage in this step also he overreached the athenians who were at the same time courting the alliance of the olynthians in order to maintain their footing in those parts which side soever the olynthians inclined to they were strong enough to turn the balance and therefore the gaining them became a matter of great contention between philip and the athenians  from thence he proceeded to seize the city of crenides which had been built two years before and then called it philippi from his own name it was here that he discovered a gold mine which every year produced an hundred and fortyfour thousand pounds sterling this which was an immense sum for that age was much more serviceable than fleets or armies in fighting his battles and he seldom failed using it in every negotiation it is said that consulting the oracle at delphos concerning the success of an intended expedition he was answered by the priestess that with silver spears he should conquer all things he took the advice of the oracle and his success was answerable to its wisdom indeed he was less proud of the success of a battle than of a negotiation well knowing that his soldiers and generals shared in the one but that the honor of the latter was wholly his own  but a larger field was now opening to his ambition the mutual divisions of the states of greece were at no time wholly cemented and they broke out now upon a very particular occasion the first cause of the rupture which was afterward called the sacred war arose from the phocians having ploughed up a piece of ground belonging to the temple of apollo at delphos against this all the neighboring states exclaimed as a sacrilege they were cited before the council of amphyctions who particularly took cognizance of sacred matters they were cast and an heavy fine was imposed upon them this the phocians were unable to pay they refused to submit to the decree they alleged that the care and patronage of the temple anciently belonged to them and to vindicate this they quoted a precedent from homer  philomelas one of their chief citizens was principally instrumental in encouraging them to arms he raised their ardour and was appointed their general he first applied himself to the spartans who had likewise been fined by the amphyctions at the instance of the thebans after the battle of leuctra for having seized the cadmea for this reason they were very well disposed to join with him but did not yet think it proper to declare themselves however they encouraged his design and supplied him underhand with money by which means he raised troops and without much difficulty got possession of the temple the chief resistance he met with in the neighborhood was from the locrians but having worsted them he erased the decree of the amphyctions which was inscribed on the pillars of the temple however to strengthen his authority and give a color to his proceedings he thought it convenient to consult the oracle and to procure an answer in his favor but when he applied to the priestess for that purpose she refused to officiate until being intimidated by his threats she told him the god left him at liberty to act as he pleased which he looked upon as a good answer and as such took care to divulge it  the amphyctions meeting a second time a resolution was formed to declare war against the phocians most of the grecian nations engaged in this quarrel and sided with the one or the other party the boeotians the locrians thessalians and several other neighboring people declared in favor of the god whilst sparta athens and some other cities of peloponesus joined with the phocians philomelas had not yet touched the treasures of the temple but being afterward not so scrupulous he believed that the riches of the god could not be better employed than in the deitys defense for he gave this specious name to this sacrilegious attempt and being enabled by this fresh supply to double the pay of his soldiers he raised a very considerable body of troops  several battles were fought and the success for some time seemed doubtful on both sides every one knows how much religious wars are to be dreaded and the prodigious lengths which a false zeal when veiled with so venerable a name is apt to go the thebans having in a rencounter taken several prisoners condemned them all to die as sacrilegious wretches who were excommunicated the phocians did the same by way of reprisal these had at first gained several advantages but having been defeated in a great battle philomelas their leader being closely attacked on an eminence from which there was no retreating defended himself for a long time with invincible bravery which however not availing he threw himself headlong from a rock in order to avoid the torments he must undoubtedly have undergone had he fallen alive into the hands of his enemies oenomarchus was his successor and took upon him the command of the forces  philip thought it most consistent with his interest to remain neuter in this general movement of the greeks in favor either of the phocians or the thebans it was consistent with the policy of this ambitious prince who had little regard for religion or the interests of apollo but was always intent upon his own not to engage in a war by which he could not reap the least benefit and to take advantage of a juncture in which all greece employed and divided by a great war gave him an opportunity to extend his frontiers and push his conquests without any apprehension of opposition he was also well pleased to see both parties weaken and consume each other as he should thereby be enabled to fall upon them afterward to greater advantage  being desirous of subjecting thrace and of securing the conquests he had already made there he determined to possess himself of methone a small city incapable of supporting itself by its own strength but which gave him disquiet and obstructed his designs whenever it was in the hands of his enemies accordingly he besieged that city made himself master of and razed it he lost one of his eyes before methone by a very singular accident aster of amphipolis had offered his services to philip as so excellent a marksman that he could bring down birds in their most rapid slight the monarch made this answer well i will take you into my service when i make war upon starlings which answer stung the archer to the quick a repartee proves often of fatal consequence to him who makes it so that aster having thrown himself into the city he let fly an arrow on which was written to philips right eye this carried a most cruel proof that he was a good marksman for he hit him in the right eye and philip sent him back the same arrow with this inscription if philip takes the city he will hang up aster and accordingly he was as good as his word a skilful surgeon drew the arrow out of philips eye with so much art and dexterity that not the least scar remained and though he could not save his eye he yet took away the blemish  after taking the city philip ever studious either to weaken his enemies by new conquests or gain more friends by doing them some important service marched into thessaly which had implored his assistance against its tyrants the liberty of that country seemed now secure since alexander of pherae was no more nevertheless his brothers who in concert with his wife thebe had murdered him grown weary of having some time acted the part of deliverers revived his tyranny and oppressed the thessalians with a new yoke lycophron the eldest of the three brothers who succeeded alexander had strengthened himself by the protection of the phocians oenomarchus their leader brought him a numerous body of forces and at first gained a considerable advantage over philip but engaging him a second time he was entirely defeated and his army routed the flying troops were pursued to the seashore upwards of six thousand men were killed on the spot among whom was oenomarchus whose body was hung upon a gallows and three thousand who were taken prisoners were thrown into the sea by philips order as so many sacrilegious wretches the professed enemies of religion  philip after having freed the thessalians resolved to carry his arms into phocis this was his first attempt to get footing in greece and to have a share in the general affairs of the greeks from which the kings of macedon had always been excluded as foreigners in this view upon pretense of going over into phocis in order to punish the sacrilegious phocians he marched toward thermopylae to possess himself of a pass which gave him a free passage into greece and especially into attica  an admission of foreigners into greece was a measure that was always formidable to those who called themselves grecians the athenians upon hearing of a march which might prove of the utmost consequence hasted to thermopylae and possessed themselves of this important pass which philip did not care attempting to force the athenians were roused from their lethargy of pleasure to make use of this precaution by the persuasions of demosthenes the celebrated orator who from the beginning saw the ambition of philip and the power of which he was possessed to carry him through his designs  this illustrious orator and statesman whom we shall hereafter find acting so considerable a part in the course of this history was born in the last year of the ninetyninth olympiad according to dionysius who in his epistle to lammacus has accurately distinguished the different periods of his life and the times in which his several orations were delivered he was the son not of a mean and obscure mechanic as the roman satyrist has represented him but of an eminent athenian citizen who raised a considerable fortune by the manufacture of arms at the age of seven years he lost his father and to add to this misfortune the guardians to whom he was entrusted wasted and embezzled a considerable part of his inheritance thus oppressed by fraud and discouraged by a weak and effeminate habit of body he yet discovered an early ambition to distinguish himself as a popular speaker the applause bestowed on a public orator who had defended his countrys right to the city of oropus in an elaborate harangue inflamed his youthful mind with an eager desire of meriting the like honor isocrates and isaeus were then the two most eminent professors of eloquence at athens the soft and florid manner of the former did by no means suit the genius of demosthenes isaeus was more vigorous and energetic and his style better suited to public business to him therefore he applied and under his direction pursued those studies which might accomplish him for the character to which he aspired his first essay was made against his guardian by whom he had been so injuriously treated but the goodness of his cause was here of more service than the abilities of the young orator for his early attempts were unpromising and soon convinced him of the necessity of a graceful and manly pronunciation his close and severe application and the extraordinary diligence with which he labored to conquer his defects and natural infirmities are too well known and have been too frequently the subjects of historians and critics ancient and modern to need a minute recital his character as a statesman will be best collected from the history of his conduct in the present transactions as an orator the reader perhaps is not to be informed of his qualifications indeed the study of oratory was at that time the readiest and almost the only means of rising in the state his first essay at the bar was two years after this incident when he called his guardians to account for embezzling his patrimony and recovered some part of it this encouraged him some time after to harangue before the people in their public assembly but he acquitted himself so ill that they hissed him however he ventured a second time but with no better success than before so that he went away ashamed confounded and quite in despair it was upon this occasion that satyrus the player accosted him and in a friendly way encouraged him to proceed with this view he asked him to repeat to him some verses of sophocles or euripedes which he accordingly did the other repeated them after him but with such a different spirit and cadence as made him sensible that he knew very little of elocution but by his instructions and his own perseverance he at length made himself master of it and by the methods before mentioned corrected the imperfections which were born with him as well as the ill habits which he had contracted it is not very clear whether this passage be rightly ascribed to satyrus who seems to be confounded with neoptolemus and andronicus who were likewise famous comedians and demosthenes is said to have been instructed by all the three  with these advantages and improvements he appeared again in public and succeeded so well that people flocked from all parts of greece to hear him from thence he was looked upon as the standard of true eloquence insomuch that none of his countrymen have been put in comparison with him nor even among the romans any but cicero and though it has been made a question by the ancient writers to which of the two they should give the preserence they have not ventured to decide it but have contented themselves with describing their different beauties and showing that they were both perfect in their kind his eloquence was grave and austere like his temper masculine and sublime bold forcible and impetuous abounding with metaphors apostrophes and interrogations which with his solemn way of invoking and appealing to the gods the planets the elements and the manes of those who fell at salamis and marathon had such a wonderful effect upon his hearers that they thought him inspired if he had not so much softness and insinuation as is often requisite in an orator it was not that he wanted art and delicacy when the case required it he knew how to sound the inclinations of the people and to lead them to the point he aimed at and sometimes by seeming to propose that which was directly the contrary but his chief characteristic was vehemence both in action and expression and indeed that was the qualification of all others most wanted at this time for the people were grown so insolent and imperious so factious and divided so jealous of the power of the democracy and withal so sunk into a state of pleasure and indolence that no arts of persuasion would have been so effectual as that spirit and resolution that force and energy of demosthenes to humble them to unite them and to rouse them into a sense of their common danger  but neither could demosthenes himself have made such impressions on them if his talent of speaking had not been supported by their opinion of his integrity it was that which added weight and emphasis to every thing he said and animated the whole it was that which chiefly engaged their attention and determined their counsels when they were convinced that he spoke from his heart and had no interest to manage but that of the community and this he gave the strongest proofs of in his zeal against philip who said he was of more weight against him than all the fleets and armies of the athenians and that he had no enemy but demosthenes he was not wanting in his endeavors to corrupt him as he had most of the leading men in greece but this great orator withstood all his offers and as it was observed all the gold in macedon could not bribe him  when philip found himself shut out of greece by the athenians he turned his arms against those remote places which depended on them either as colonies or as conquests and particularly against the olynthians whom he had long looked upon with an evil eye but had courted and cajoled them whilst he was otherwise employed but he came now resolved entirely to reduce them and advancing toward the city only sent them a short message to let them know that one of these two points was become necessary either that they must quit olynthus or he macedonia whereupon they sent immediately to athens for relief the subject was debated there with great solemnity and demosthenes was very earnest in sending them succors he was opposed by demades and hyperides the opinion however of demosthenes prevailed the people of athens resolved to unite against philip but the great difficulty lay in furnishing the supplies their principal fund which had formerly served the purposes of war had long been converted to the use of the stage the money arising from this fund was computed at a thousand talents a year and a certain proportion of it was allotted to the citizens to defray the charge of their admittance into the theater this distribution having been continued to them from the time of pericles they claimed it now as their right especially since they had lately obtained a law which made it capital to propose the restoring the fund to the uses for which it was originally granted hence it was that upon any pressing emergency extraordinary taxes were to be raised and they were laid so unequally and collected with so much difficulty that they seldom answered the service for which they were intended  demosthenes treated this subject with the utmost art and circumspection after showing that the athenians were indispensibly obliged to raise an army in order to stop the enterprises of their aspiring enemy he asserted that the theatrical fund was the only probable means of supply these remonstrances had some weight but were not attended with deserved success the athenians sent a reinforcement to olynthus but philip who had corrupted the principal men in the town entered plundered it and sold the inhabitants among the rest of the spoil here he found much treasure which served to assist him in his further encroachments  in the mean time the thebans being unable alone to terminate the war which they had so long carried on against the phocians addressed philip hitherto as we before mentioned he had observed a kind of neutrality with respect to the sacred war and he seemed to wait for an opportunity of declaring himself that is till both parties should have weakened themselves by a long war which equally exhausted both the thebans had now very much abated of that haughtiness and those ambitious views with which the victories of epaminondas had inspired them the instant therefore they requested the alliance of philip he resolved to espouse the interest of that republic in opposition to the phocians he had not lost sight of the project he had formed of obtaining an entrance into greece in order to make himself master of it to give success to his design it was proper for him to declare in favor of one of the two parties which at that time divided all greece that is either for the thebans or the athenians and spartans he was not so void of sense as to imagine that the latter party would assist his design of carrying his arms into greece he therefore had no more to do but to join the thebans who offered themselves voluntarily to him and who stood in need of philips power to support themselves in their declining condition he therefore declared at once in their favor but to give a specious color to his arms besides the gratitude he affected to have at heart for thebes in which he had been educated he also pretended to make an honor of the zeal with which he was fired with regard to the violated god and was very glad to pass for a religious prince who warmly espoused the cause of the god and of the temple of delphos in order to conciliate by that means the esteem and friendship of the greeks  there was nothing philip had more at heart than to possess himself of thermopylae as it opened him a passage into greece to appropriate all the honor of the sacred war to himself as if he had been principal in that affair and to preside in the pythian games he was therefore desirous of aiding the thebans and by their means to possess himself of phocis but then in order to put this double design in execution it was necessary for him to keep it secret from the athenians who had actually declared war against thebes and who for many years had been in alliance with the phocians his business therefore was to make them change their measures by placing other objects in their view and on this occasion the politics of philip succeeded to a wonder  the athenians who began to grow tired of a war which was very burdensome and of little benefit to them had commissioned ctesiphon and phrynon to sound the intentions of philip and in what manner he stood disposed in regard to peace these related that philip did not appear averse to it and that he even expressed a great affection for the commonwealth upon this the athenians resolved to send a solemn embassy to enquire more strictly into the truth of things and to procure the last explanations previously necessary to so important a negotiation aeschines and demosthenes were among the ten ambassadors who brought back three from philip viz antipater parmenio and eurylochus all the ten executed their commission very faithfully and gave a very good account of it upon this they were immediately sent back with full powers to conclude a peace and to ratify it by oaths it was then demosthenes who in his first embassy had met some athenian captives in macedonia and had promised to return and ransom them at his own expense endeavored to enable himself to keep his word and in the mean time advised his colleagues to embark with the utmost expedition as the republic had commanded and to wait as soon as possible upon philip in what place soever he might be however these instead of making a speedy dispatch as they were desired went like ambassadors proceeded to macedonia by land staid three months in that country and gave philip time to possess himself of several other strong places belonging to the athenians in thrace at last meeting with the king of macedonia they agreed with him upon articles of peace but he having lulled them asleep with the specious pretense of a treaty deferred the ratification of it from day to day in the mean time he found means to corrupt the ambassadors one after another by presents demosthenes excepted who being but one opposed his colleagues to no manner of purpose  philip being suffered quietly to pursue his march into phocis gained the streights of thermopylae but did not immediately discover what use he intended to make of his entrance into greece but went on according to his agreement with the thebans to put an end to the phocian war which he easily effected his name and appearance struck such a terror among the phocians that though they had lately received a reinforcement of a thousand heavy armed spartans under the command of their king archidamus they declined giving him battle and sent to treat with him or rather to submit themselves to any terms that he would give them he allowed phalicus to retire with eight thousand men being mercenaries into peloponesus but the rest who were the inhabitants of phocis were left at his mercy as the disposing of them was a matter wherein greece in general was concerned he did not think fit to act in it by his own private authority but referred it to the amphyctions whom he caused to be assembled for that purpose but they were so much under his influence that they served only to give a sanction to his determinations they decreed that all the cities of phocis should be demolished that they who had fled as being principally concerned in the sacrilege should be stigmatized as accursed and proscribed as outlaws that they who remained as inhabitants should be dispersed in villages and obliged to pay out of their lands a yearly tribute of sixty talents until the whole of what had been taken out of the temple should be restored they were likewise adjudged to lose their seat in the council of the amphyctions wherein they had a double voice this philip got transferred to himself which was a very material point and may be looked upon as the principal step toward his gaining that authority which he afterward exercised in the affairs of greece at the same time he gained in conjunction with the thebans and thessalians the superintendency of the pythian games which the corinthians had forfeited for their having taken part with the phocians  philip having by these plausible methods succeeded in this expedition did not think it advisable by attempting any thing further at present to sully the glory he had acquired by it or to incense the body of the grecians against him wherefore he returned in a triumphant manner to his own dominions after settling his conquests at home he marched into thessaly and having extirpated the remains of tyranny in the several cities there he not only confirmed the thessalians in his interest but gained over many of their neighbors  it was upon this occasion that philip is remarked for an act of private justice which far outweighs his public celebrity a certain soldier in the macedonian army had in many instances distinguished himself by extraordinary acts of valor and had received many marks of philips favor and approbation on some occasion he embarked on board a vessel which was wrecked by a violent storm and he himself cast on the shore helpless and naked and scarcely with the appearance of life a macedonian whose lands were contiguous to the sea came opportunely to be witness of his distress and with all humane and charitable tenderness flew to the relief of the unhappy stranger he bore him to his house laid him in his own bed revived cherished comforted and for forty days supplied him freely with all the necessaries and conveniences which his languishing condition could require the soldier thus happily rescued from death was incessant in the warmest expressions of gratitude to his benefactor assured him of his interest with the king and of his power and resolution of obtaining for him from the royal bounty the noble returns which such extraordinary benevolence had merited he was now completely recovered and his kind host supplied him with money to pursue his journey in some time after he presented himself before the king he recounted his misfortunes magnified his services and this inhuman wretch who had looked with an eye of envy on the possessions of the man who had preserved his life was now so abandoned to all sense of gratitude as to request the king would bestow upon him the house and lands where he had been so tenderly and kindly entertained unhappily philip without examination inconsiderately and precipitately granted his infamous request and this soldier now returned to his preserver repaid his goodness by driving him from his settlement and taking immediate possession of all the fruits of his honest industry the poor man stung with this instance of unparalleled ingratitude and insensibility boldly determined instead of submitting to his wrongs to seek relief and in a letter addressed to philip represented his own and the soldiers conduct in a lively and affecting manner the king was instantly fired with indignation he ordered that justice should be done without delay that the possessions should be immediately restored to the man whose charitable offices had been thus horridly repaid and having seized his soldier caused these words to be branded on his forehead  the ungrateful guest  a character infamous in every age and among all nations but particularly among the greeks who from the earliest times were most scrupulously observant of the laws of hospitality  having strengthened himself in these parts he went the next year into thrace where he had formed a design against the chersonese this peninsula had with some little interruption been for many years in the hands of the athenians but cotys as being king of the country had lately wrested it from them and left it in succession to his son chersobleptes he not being able to defend himself against philip gave it back to the athenians reserving to himself only cardia the capital city but philip having soon after spoiled him of the rest of his dominions the cardians for fear of falling again under the power of the athenians threw themselves into his protection diopithes who was the chief of the athenian colony lately sent to the chersonese considered this proceeding of philip in supporting the cardians as an act of hostility against athens whereupon he invaded the maritime parts of thrace and carried away a great deal of booty philip being at this time in the upper part of the country was not in a condition to do himself justice but he wrote to complain of it at athens as an infraction of the peace and his creatures there were not wanting on their part to aggravate the charge against diopithes as having acted without orders and taking it upon himself to renew the war they likewise accused him of committing acts of piracy and of laying their allies under contribution but whatever grounds there were for this part of the accusation the government of athens was principally to blame in it for having no proper fund for the wars they sent out their generals without money or provisions and left them to shift for themselves and yet made them answerable for any miscarriages that should happen for want of their being better supplied this was a great discouragement to the service and put those who were employed in it upon pillaging and plundering in such a manner as they would otherwise have been ashamed of demosthenes in an harangue that he made upon the stage of the chersonese undertook the defense of diopithes  philip however was no way intimidated at the wordy resistance of his eloquent antagonist he went on with artful industry quelling those by his power who were unable to resist and those by his presents whom he was unable to oppose the divisions that then subsisted in peloponesus gave him a pretext for intermeddling in the affairs of the greek confederacy these divisions were chiefly owing to the spartans who having little to do in the late foreign transactions were recovering their strength at home and according to their usual practice as they increased in power made use of it to insult and oppress their neighbors the argives and messenians being at this time persecuted by them put themselves under the protection of philip and the thebans joining with them they all together formed a powerful confederacy the natural balance against it was an union between athens and sparta which the spartans pressed with great earnestness as the only means for their common security and philip and the thebans did all in their power to prevent it but demosthenes exerting himself upon this occasion roused up the athenians and put them so far upon their guard that without coming to an open rupture with philip they obliged him to desist  philip however did not continue idle upon this disappointment ever restless and enterprising he turned his views another way he had long considered the island of eubaea as proper from its situation to favor the designs he meditated against greece and in the very beginning of his reign had attempted to possess himself of it he indeed set every engine to work at that time in order to seize upon that island which he called the shackles of greece but it nearly concerned the athenians on the other side not to suffer it to fall into the hands of an enemy especially as it might be joined to the continent of attica by a bridge however that people according to their usual custom continued indolent whilst philip pursued his conquests the latter who was continually attentive and vigilant endeavored to carry on an intelligence in the island and by dint of presents bribed those who had the greatest authority in it at the request of certain of the inhabitants he sent some troops privately thither possessed himself of several strong places dismantled porthmos a very important fortress in eubaea and established three tyrants or kings over the country  the athenians were conjured in this distressing juncture by one plutarch who was at that time upon the island to come and deliver the inhabitants from the yoke which philip was going to impose upon them upon this they dispatched a few troops thither under the command of phocion a general of whom great expectations were formed and whose conduct well deserved the favorable opinion the public had of him  this man would have done honor to the early and least corrupted times of the athenian state his manners were formed in the academy upon the models of the most exact and rigid virtue it was said that no athenian ever saw him laugh or weep or deviate in any instance from the most fettled gravity and composure he learned the art of war under chabrias and frequently moderated the excesses and corrected the errors of that general his humanity he admired and imitated and taught him to exert it in a more extensive and liberal manner when he had received his directions to sail with twenty ships to collect the contributions of the allies and dependent cities why that force said phocion if i am to meet them as enemies it is insufficient if i am sent to friends and allies a single vessel will serve he bore the severities of a military life with so much ease that if phocion ever appeared warmly clothed the soldiers at once pronounced it the sign of a remarkably bad season his outward appearance was forbidding but his conversation easy and obliging and all his words and actions expressed the utmost affection and benevolence in popular assemblies his lively close and natural manner of speaking seemed as it were the echo of the simplicity and integrity of his mind and had frequently a greater effect than even the dignity and energy of demosthenes who called him the pruner of his periods he studied only good sense and plain reasoning and despised every adventitious ornament in an assembly when he was to address the people he was surprised by a friend wrapped up in thought i am considering said he whether i cannot retrench some part of my intended address he was sensible of the ill conduct of his countrymen and ever treated them with the greatest severity he defied their censures and so far did he affect to despise their applause that at a time when his sentiments extorted their approbation he turned about in surprise and asked a friend if any thing weak or impertinent had escaped him his sense of the degeneracy of athens made him fond of pacific measures he saw the designs of philip but imagined that the state was too corrupted to give him any effectual opposition so that he was of the number of those men who according to demosthenes in his third phillipic oration gave up the interests of the state not corruptly or ignorantly but from a desperate purpose of yielding to the fate of a constitution thought to be irrecoverably lost he was of consequence ever of the party opposite to demosthenes and having been taught by experience to suspect the popular leaders considered his earnestness to rouse the athenians to arms as an artifice to embroil the state and by that means to gain an influence in the assembly phocion said demosthenes the people in some mad fit will certainly sacrifice thee to their fury yes replied he and you will be their victim if ever they have an interval of reason yet they often prevailed on him to act against his judgment though never to speak against his conscience he never refused or declined the command whatever might be his opinion of the expedition forty five times was he chosen to lead their armies generally in his absence and ever without the least application they knew his merit and in the hour of danger forgot that severity with which he usually treated their inclinations and opinions  it was to him the athenians gave the command of the forces they sent to the aid of plutarch of eretria but this traitor repaid his benefactors with ingratitude he set up the standard against them and endeavored openly to repulse the very army he had requested however phocion was not at a loss how to act upon this unforeseen perfidy for he pursued his enterprise won a battle and drove plutarch from eretria  these disappointments however no way intimidated philip or rendered him the least remiss in prosecuting his original design he now therefore changed the method of his attack and sought for an opportunity of distressing athens another way he knew that this city from the barrenness of attica stood in greater want of foreign corn than any other to dispose at discretion of their transports and by that means starve the athenians he marched toward thrace from whence that city imported the greatest part of its provisions with an intention to besiege perinthus and byzantium to keep his kingdom in obedience during his absence he left his son alexander behind with sovereign authority though he was fifteen years old this young prince gave even at that time some proofs of his courage having defeated certain neighboring states subject to macedonia who had considered the kings absence as a very proper time for executing the design they had formed of revolting this happy success of alexanders first expeditions was highly agreeable to his father and at the same time an earnest of what might be expected from him but fearing lest allured by this dangerous bait he should abandon himself inconsiderately to his vivacity and fire he sent for him in order to become his master and form him in person for the trade of war  in the mean time philip opened the campaign with the siege of perinthus a considerable city of thrace and firmly attached to the athenians it was assisted from byzantium a neighboring city which threw in succors as occasion required philip therefore resolved to besiege both at the same time still however he was desirous to appear cautious and tender of displeasing the athenians whom he endeavored to amuse with the most profound respect mixed with welltimed abuses and the most flattering submission upon this occasion he wrote them a letter reproaching them in the strongest terms for their infraction of treaties and his own religious observance of them in the times of great enmity says he the most you did was to fit out ships of war against me and to seize and sell the merchants that came to trade in my dominions but now you carry your hatred and injustice to such prodigious lengths as even to send ambassadors to the king of persia to make him declare against me  this letter gave the orators who undertook philips defense a fine opportunity of justifying him to the people demosthenes alone stood firm and still continued to expose his artful designs and to break down all those labored schemes which were undertaken to deceive the people sensible on this occasion how necessary it was to remove the first impressions which the perusal of this letter might make he immediately ascended the tribunal and from thence harangued the people with all the thunder of his eloquence he told them the letter was written in a style not suitable to the people of athens that it was a plain declaration of war against them that philip had long since made the same declaration by his actions and that by the peace he had concluded with them he meant nothing further than a bare cessation of arms in order to gain time and to take them more unprepared from thence he proceeded to his usual topic of reproving them for their sloth for suffering themselves to be deluded by their orators who were in philips pay convinced by these truths continued he o athenians and strongly persuaded that we can no longer be allowed to affirm that we enjoy peace for philip has now declared war against us by his letter and has long done the same by his conduct you ought not to spare either the public treasure or the possessions of private persons but when occasion shall require haste to your respective standards and set abler generals at your head than those you have hitherto employed for no one among you ought to imagine that the same men who have ruined your affairs will have abilities to restore them to their former happy situation think how infamous it is that a man from macedon should contemn dangers to such a degree that merely to aggrandise his empire he should rush into the midst of combats and return from battle covered with wounds and that the athenians whose hereditary right it is to obey no man but to impose law on others sword in hand that athenians i say merely through dejection of spirit and indolence should degenerate from the glory of their ancestors and abandon the interest of their country to this expostulation phocion readily offered his voice and opinion he urged the incapacity of the generals already chosen and in consequence of his advice he himself was appointed general of the army that was to go against philip who was still besieging byzantium  phocion having led his troops to the succor of the byzantians the inhabitants on his arrival opened their gates to him with joy and lodged his soldiers in their houses as their own brothers and children the athenian officers and soldiers struck with the confidence reposed in them behaved with the utmost prudence and modesty and were entirely irreproachable in their conduct nor were they less admired for their courage and in all the attacks they sustained discovered the utmost intrepidity which danger seemed only to improve phocions prudence seconded by the bravery of his troops soon forced philip to abandon his design upon byzantium and perinthus he was beat out of the hellespont which diminished very much his fame and glory for he hitherto had been thought invincible and nothing had been able to oppose him phocion took some of his ships recovered many fortresses which he had garrisoned and having made several descents into different parts of his territories he plundered all the open country till a body of forces assembling to check his progress he was obliged to retire  philip after having been forced to raise the siege of byzantium marched against atheas king of scythia from whom he had received some personal cause of discontent and took his son with him in this expedition though the scythians had a very numerous army he defeated them without any difficulty he got a very great booty which consisted not in gold or silver the use and value of which the scythians were not as yet so unhappy as to know but in cattle in horses and a great number of women and children  at his return from scythia the triballi a people of moesia disputed the pass with him laying claim to part of the plunder he was carrying off philip was forced to come to a battle and a very bloody one was fought in which great numbers on each side were killed on the spot the king himself was wounded in the thigh and with the same thrust had his horse killed under him alexander flew to his fathers aid and covering him with his shield killed or put to flight all who attacked him  the athenians had considered the siege of byzantium as an absolute rupture and an open declaration of war the king of macedon who was apprehensive of the consequences of it and dreaded very much the power of the athenians whose hatred he had drawn upon himself made overtures of peace in order to soften their resentment phocion little suspicious and apprehensive of the uncertainty of military wants was of opinion that the athenians should accept his offers but demosthenes who had studied more than phocion the genius and character of philip and was persuaded that according to his usual custom his only view was to impose upon the athenians prevented their listening to his pacific proposals when philip found the athenians would not treat with him and that they were acting offensively against him especially at sea where they blocked up his ports and put an entire stop to his commerce he began to form new alliances against them particularly with the thebans and thessalians without whom he knew he could not keep open his passage into greece at the same time he was sensible that his engaging these powers to act directly against athens and in his own personal quarrel would have so bad an aspect that they would not easily come into it for which reason he endeavored underhand to create new disturbances in greece that he might take such a part in them as would best answer his views and when the flame was kindled his point was to appear rather to be called in as an assistant than to act as a principal  by the result of his machinations he soon found an opportunity of raising divisions between the locrians of amphissa and their capital city they were accused of having profaned a spot of sacred ground which lay very near the temple of delphos by ploughing it as the phocians had done upon a former occasion in order to produce and widen this breach philip employed aeschines the orator who by bribes was entirely devoted to him to harangue at the assembly of the amphyctions against this outrage upon the religion of their country aeschines was a man of great abilities and only second in eloquence to demosthenes he had now a fair opportunity of raising commotions by appearing only interested for his country and zealous for the glory and defense of athens with a passionate warmth which is frequently the effect of artifice as well as of real patriotism and which is most likely to deceive and more particularly in popular assemblies by being considered as the indication of sincerity and the overflowings of a heart honestly affected he boldly delivered his opinions his sentiments were echoed through the assembly by the friends of philip the tumult was kept up to drown all remonstrances of caution and policy and a resolution was passed that a deputation should be sent to philip king of macedon inviting him to assist apollo and the amphyctions and to repel the outrages of the impious amphissoeans and farther to declare that he was constituted by all the greeks member of the council of amphyctions and general and commander of their forces with full and unlimited powers  this welcome invitation and commission the fruit of all his secret practices philip received in thrace while he was yet on his return to macedon he bowed with an affectionate reverence to the venerable council and declared his readiness to execute their orders  the inferior states of greece and all those whose simplicity and weakness rendered them insensible to the designs now forming by philip entirely approved of the act of the amphyctions and of the nomination of a prince to the command of their forces so eminent and illustrious for his piety and so capable of executing the vengeance of heaven at sparta and at athens this event was considered in a different manner the first of these people though possessed but of a small part of their ancient greatness yet still retained their pride and seemed to have looked with a sullen indignation at the honors paid to macedon the athenians had been long taught to dread the policy of philip and now their great popular leader repeatedly urged the necessity of suspicion and represented all the late transactions in the amphyctionic council as the effects of philips intrigues and a design against greece in general but more particularly against the welfare and liberty of athens  to counteract the zeal of demosthenes and to prevent the effects of his incessant remonstrances the minds of the people were alarmed with oracles and predictions uttered with all solemnity from the sacred tripod and reported to the athenians with all the veneration due to the dictates of apollo vengeance was pronounced against all those who should presume to oppose the king of macedon the destined instrument of divine justice and the people were exhorted not to suffer artful and designing orators and popular leaders to seduce them to their ruin  in the mean time philip immediately got his troops together and with all the show of religious veneration began to march in order to chastise the irreverent locrians but he had far different aims and instead of proceeding upon so ridiculous a commission made a sudden turn and seized upon elatea a capital city of phocis which was very well situated for awing the thebans of whom he began to grow jealous and for preparing his way to athens but by so extraordinary a step as this he fairly threw off the mask and bade defiance to the whole body of grecians thus was this enterprising prince all of a sudden master of a port of the utmost consequence at the head of an army capable of striking terror into his opposers at the distance of but two days march from attica absolute commander as it were of the citadel and fortress both of thebes and athens conveniently situated for receiving succors from thessaly and macedon and entirely at liberty either to give battle to those who might presume to appear in arms against him or to protract the war to any length that might be found convenient  the news of philips recent transaction was quickly spread through the adjacent countries and received with all the stupid and helpless astonishment of men roused from a long lethargy and awakened to a dreadful sense of their danger and of the real designs of their enemy it was late in the evening when a courier arriving at athens appeared before the prytanes and pronounced the dreadful tidings that the king of macedon had taken possession of elatea these magistrates and all the other citizens were now at supper indulging themselves in the pleasures and gaieties of the table when the news which in an instant rung through all the city roused them from their state of ease and put an end to all their sestivity the streets and public places were instantly filled with a distracted concourse every man with terror and confusion in his countenance and every man solicitous for an immediate consultation on an emergency so important and alarming at the dawn of the succeeding day the assembly met together impressed with that consternation which urgent danger naturally inspires the whole body of the people flocked to the senate house seized their places and waited with the utmost anxiety for so important a deliberation the herald as was the custom at athens arose and cried out with a loud voice who among you will ascend the tribunal all however was silence terror and dismay he again repeated the invitation but still no one rose up though all the generals and orators were present at length demosthenes animated with the greatness of the approaching danger arose undaunted and unmoved in this scene of horror with a countenance of serenity the firm composure of a patriot and the sage discernment of a complete statesman he addressed himself to the assembly in the following manner  athenians permit me to explain the circumstances of that state which philip has now seized upon those of its citizens whom his gold could corrupt or his artifice deceive are all at his devotion what then is his design by drawing up his forces and displaying his powers on the borders of thebes he hopes to inspire his adherents with confidence and elevation and to terrify and control his adversaries that fear or force may drive them into those measures which they have hitherto opposed if then we are resolved in this conjuncture to cherish the remembrance of every act of unkindness which the thebans have done to athens if we regard them with suspicion as men who have ranged themselves on the side of our enemy in the first place we shall act agreeably to philips warmest wishes and then i am apprehensive that the party who now oppose him may be brought over to his interest the whole city submit unanimously to his direction and thebes and macedon fall with their united force on attica grant the due attention to what i shall now propose let it be calmly weighed without dispute or cavil and i doubt not but that my counsels may direct you to the best and most salutary measures and dispel the dangers now impending over the state what then do i recommend  first shake off that terror which has possessed your minds and instead of fearing for yourselves let the thebans be the objects of your apprehensions they are more immediately affected they are the first to feel the dangers in the next place all those of the age for military service both infantry and cavalry should march instantly to eleusis that greece may see that you are also assembled in arms and your friends in thebes be emboldened to assert their rights when they are assured that as they who have sold their country to the macedonians have a force at elatea to support them so you are ready to assist the men who bravely contend for liberty in the last place i recommend to you to nominate ten ambassadors who with the generals may have full authority to determine the time and all other circumstances of this march when these ambassadors arrive at thebes how are they to conduct this great affair this is a point worthy of your most serious attention make no demands of the thebans at this conjuncture it would be dishonorable assure them that your assistance is ready for their acceptance as you are justly affected by their danger and have been so happy as to foresee and to guard against it if they approve of your sentiments and embrace your overtures we shall effect our great purpose and act with a dignity worthy of our state but should it happen that we are not so successful whatever misfortunes they may suffer to themselves shall they be imputed while your conduct shall appear in no one instance inconsistent with the honor and renown of athens  this oration delivered with ease and resolution did not want its due effect it was received with universal applause and demosthenes himself was instantly chosen to head the embassy which he had now proposed a decree in pursuance of his advice was drawn up in form with an additional clause that a fleet of two hundred sail should be fitted out to cruize near thermopylae  in consequence of this demosthenes set out for thebes making the more haste as he was sensible that philip might overrun attica in two days philip on the other hand in order to oppose the eloquence of demosthenes sent ambassadors to thebes among whom was python who particularly distinguished himself by the liveliness of his orations but his persuasive powers were far inferior to those of demosthenes who overcame all opposition the masculine eloquence of demosthenes was irresistible and kindled in the souls of the thebans so warm a zeal for their country and so strong a passion for freedom that they were no longer masters of themselves laying aside all fear and gratitude and all prudential considerations  that which animated demosthenes next to his public safety was his having to do with a man of pythons abilities and he some time after took occasion to value himself upon the victory he had obtained over him i did not give way said he to the boasting python when he would have bore me down with a torrent of words he gloried more in the success of this negotiation than of any other he had been employed in and spoke of it as his masterpiece in politics  philip quite disconcerted by the union of these two nations sent ambassadors to the athenians to request them not to levy an armed force but to live in harmony with him however they were too justly alarmed and exasperated to listen to any accommodation and would no longer depend on the word of a prince whose whole aim was to deceive in consequence preparations for war were made with the utmost diligence and the soldiery discovered incredible ardour however many evildisposed persons endeavored to extinguish or damp it by relating fatal omens and terrible predictions which the priestess of delphos was said to have uttered but demosthenes confiding firmly in the arms of greece and encouraged wonderfully by the number and bravery of the troops who desired only to march against the enemy would not suffer them to be amused with these oracles and frivolous predictions it was on this occasion he said that the priestess philipized meaning that it was philips money that inspired the priestess opened her mouth and made the god speak whatever she thought proper he bade the thebans remember their epaminondas and the athenians their pericles who considered these oracles and predictions as idle scarecrows and consulted only their reason the athenian army set out immediately and marched to eleusis and the thebans surprised at the diligence of their confederates joined them and waited the approach of the enemy  philip on his part well knowing that the bravery and spirit of his enemies wanted that direction which might enable them to improve their advantages and conscious also of his own abilities and the weakness of those generals who commanded the greeks determined to bring on a general engagement where his superior skill must appear of the greatest moment for this purpose he took a favorable opportunity of decamping and led his army to the plain of chaeronea a name rendered famous by the event of this important contest here he chose his station in view of a temple dedicated to hercules the author of his race as if resolved to fight in his presence to make him witness of the actions of his descendant and to commit his forces and his cause to the immediate protection of this hero some ancient oracles were preserved which seemed to point out the spot on which he now encamped as the scene of some dreadful calamity to greece  his army was formed of thirtytwo thousand men warlike disciplined and long enured to the toils and dangers of the field but this body was composed of different nations and countries who had each their distinct and separate views and interests the army of the confederates did not amount to thirty thousand complete of which the athenians and thebans furnished the greatest part the rest was formed of the corinthians and peloponesians the same motives and the same zeal influenced and animated them all were equally affected by the event and all equally resolved to conquer or die in defense of liberty  on the eve of the decisive day diogenes the famous cynic who had long looked with equal contempt on either party was led by curiosity to visit the camps as an unconcerned spectator in the macedonian camp where his character and person were not known he was stopped by the guards and conducted to philips tent the king expressed surprise at a strangers presuming to approach his camp and asked with severity whether he came as a spy yes said diogenes i am come to spy upon your vanity and ambition who thus wantonly set your life and kingdom to the hazard of an hour  and now the fatal morning appeared which was for ever to decide the cause of liberty and the empire of greece before the rising of the sun both armies were ranged in order of battle the thebans commanded by theogenes a man of but moderate abilities in war and suspected of corruption obtained the post of honor on the right wing of the confederated greeks with that famous body in the front called the sacred band formed of generous and warlike youths connected and endeared to each other by all the noble enthusiasm of love and friendship the center was formed of the corinthians and peloponesians and the athenians composed the left wing led by their generals lysicles and chares on the left of the macedonian army stood alexander at the head of a chosen body of noble macedonians supported by the famous cavalry of thessaly as this prince was then but nineteen years old his father was careful to curb his youthful impetuosity and to direct his valor and for this purpose surrounded him with a number of experienced officers in the center were placed those greeks who had united with philip and on whose courage he had the least dependence while the king himself commanded on the right wing where his renowned phalanx stood to oppose the impetuosity with which the athenians were well known to begin their onset  the charge began on each side with all the courage and violence which ambition revenge the love of glory and the love of liberty could excite in the several combatants alexander at the head of the macedonian nobles first fell with all the fury of youthful courage on the sacred band of thebas which sustained his attack with a bravery and vigor worthy of its former fame the gallant youths who composed this body not being timely or not duly supported by their countrymen bore up for a while against the torrent of the enemy till at length oppressed and overpowered by superior numbers without yielding or turning their backs on their assailants they sunk down on that ground where they had been originally stationed each by the side of his darling friend raising up a bulwark by their bodies against the progress of the army but the young prince and his forces in all the enthusiastic ardor of valor animated by success pushed on through all the carnage and over all the heaps of slain and fell furiously on the main body of the thebans where they were opposed with obstinate and deliberate courage and the contest was for some time supported with mutual violence  the athenians at the same time on the right wing fought with a spirit and intrepidity worthy of the character which they boasted and of the cause by which they were animated many brave efforts were exerted on each side and success was for some time doubtful till at length part of the center and the left wing of the macedonians except the phalanx yielded to the impetuous attack of the athenians and fled with some precipitation happy had it been on that day for greece if the conduct and abilities of the athenian generals had been equal to the valor of their soldiers but these brave champions of liberty were led on by the despicable creatures of intrigue and cabal transported by the advantage now obtained the presumptuous lysicles cried out come on my gallant countrymen the victory is ours let us pursue these cowards and drive them to macedon and thus instead of improving their happy opportunity by charging the phalanx in flank and so breaking this formidable body the athenians wildly and precipitately pressed forward in pursuit of the flying enemy themselves in all the tumult and disorder of a rout philip saw this fatal error with the contempt of a skilful general and the secret exultation arising from the assurance of approaching victory he coolly observed to those officers that stood round him that the athenians knew not how to conquer and ordered his phalanx to change its position and by a sudden evolution to gain possession of an adjacent eminence from thence they marched deliberately down firm and collected and fell with their united force on the athenians now confident of success and blind to their danger the shock was irresistible they were at once overwhelmed many of them lay crushed by the weight of the enemy and expiring by their wounds while the rest escaped from the dreadful slaughter by a shameful and precipitate flight bearing down and hurrying away with them those troops which had been stationed for their support and here the renowned orator and statesman whose noble sentiments and spirited harangues had raised the courage on this day so eminently exerted betrayed that weakness which has sullied his great character he alone of all his countrymen advanced to the charge cold and dismayed and at the very first appearance of a reverse of fortune in an agony of terror turned his back cast away that shield which he had adorned with this inscription in golden characters to good fortune and appeared the foremost in the general rout the ridicule and malice of his enemies related or perhaps invented another shameful circumstance that being impeded in his flight by some brambles his imagination was so possessed with the presence of an enemy that he loudly cried out for quarter  while philip was thus triumphant on his side alexander continued the conflict on the other wing and at length broke the thebans in spite of all their acts of valor who now fled from the field and were pursued with great carnage the center of the confederates was thus totally abandoned to the fury of a victorious enemy but enough of slaughter had already been made more than one thousand of the athenians lay dead on the field of battle two thousand were made prisoners and the loss of the thebans was not inferior philip therefore determined to conclude his important victory by an act of apparent clemency which his ambition and policy really dictated he gave orders that the greeks should be spared conscious of his own designs and still expecting to appear in the field the head and leader of that body which he had now completely subdued  philip was transported with this victory beyond measure and having drank to excess at an entertainment which he gave upon that occasion went into the field of battle where he insulted over the slain and upbraided the prisoners with their misfortunes he leaped and danced about in a frantic manner and with an air of burlesque merriment sung the beginning of the decree which demosthenes had drawn up as a declaration of the war against him demades who was of the number of the prisoners had the courage to reproach him with this ungenerous behavior telling him that fortune had given him the part of agamemnon but that he was acting that of thersites he was so struck with the justness of this reproof that it wrought a thorough change in him and he was so far from being offended at demades that he immediately gave him his liberty and showed him afterward great marks of honor and friendship he likewise relieved all the athenian captives and without ransom and when they found him so generously disposed toward them they made a demand of their baggage with every thing else that had been taken from them but to that philip replied surely they think i have not beat them this discharge of the prisoners was ascribed in a great measure to demades who is said to have newmodelled philip and to have softened his temper with the attic graces as diodorus expresses it indeed philip himself acknowledged upon another occasion that his frequent converse with the athenian orators had been of great use to him in correcting his morals justin represents his carriage after the battle in a very different light alleging that he took abundance of pains to dissemble his joy that he affected great modesty and compassion and was not seen to laugh that he would have no sacrisice no crowns nor perfumes that he forbade all kinds of sports and did nothing that might make him appear to the conquerors to be elated nor to the conquered to be insolent but this account seems to have been confounded with others which were given of him after his being reformed by demades it is certain that after his first transport was over and that he began to recollect himself he showed great humanity to the athenians and that in order still to keep measures with them he renewed the peace but the thebans who had renounced their alliance with him he treated in another manner he who affected to be as much master of his allies as of his subjects could not easily pardon those who had deserted him in so critical a conjuncture wherefore he not only took ransom for their prisoners but made them pay for leave to bury their dead after these severities and after having placed a strong garrison over them he granted them a peace  we are told that isocrates the most celebrated rhetorician of that age who loved his country with the utmost tenderness could not survive the loss and ignominy with which it was covered by the loss of the battle of chaeronea the instant he received the news of its being uncertain what use philip would make of his victory and determined to die a freeman he hastened his end by abstaining from food he was fourscore and eighteen years of age this defeat was attributed chiefly to the ill conduct of the generals lysicles and chares the former whereof the athenians put to death at the instance of lycurgus who had great credit and influence with the people but was a severe judge and a most bitter accuser you lysicles said he were general of the army a thousand citizens were slain two thousand taken prisoners a trophy has been erected to the dishonor of this city and all greece is enslaved you had the command when all these things happened and yet you dare to live and view the light of the sun and blush not to appear publicly in the forum you lysicles who are born the monument of your countrys shame this lycurgus was one of the orators of the first rank and free from the general corruption which then reigned among them he managed the public treasure for twelve years with great uprightness and had all his life long the reputation of a man of honor and virtue he increased the shipping supplied the arsenal drove the bad men out of the city and framed several good laws he kept an exact register of every thing he did during his administration and when that was expired he caused it to be fixed up to a pillar that every body might be at liberty to inspect it and to censure his conduct he carried this point so far that in his last sickness he ordered himself to be carried to the senate house to give a public account of all his actions and after he had refuted one who accused him there he went home and died notwithstanding the austerity of his temper he was a great encourager of the stage which though it had been carried to an excess that was manifestly hurtful to the public he still looked upon as the best school to instruct and polish the minds of the people and to this end he kept up a spirit of emulation among the writers of tragedy and erected the statues of aeschylus sophocles and euripides he left three sons who were unworthy of him and behaved so ill that they were all put in prison but demosthenes out of regard to the memory of their father got them discharged  it does not appear that chares underwent any prosecution for his share of this action though according to his general character he deserved it as much or more than his colleague for he had no talent for command and was very little different from a common soldier timotheus said of him that instead of being a general he was fitter to carry the generals baggage his person indeed was of that robust kind of make and it was that which served in some measure to recommend him to the people but he was more a man of pleasure than fatigue in his military expeditions he was wont to carry with him a band of music and he defrayed the expense of it out of the soldiers pay notwithstanding his want of abilities he had a thorough good opinion of himself he was vain and positive bold and boisterous a great undertaker and always ready to warrant success but his performances seldom answered and hence it was that the promises of chares became a proverb and yet as little as he was to be depended on he had his partisans among the people and among the orators by whose means he got himself to be frequently employed and others to be excluded who were more capable  but it was demosthenes who seemed to have been the principal cause of the terrible shock which athens received at this time and which gave its power such a wound as it never recovered however at the very instant the athenians heard of this bloody overthrow which affected so great a number of families when it would have been no wonder had the multitude seized with terror and alarms given way to an emotion of blind zeal against the man whom they might have considered in some measure as the author of this dreadful calamity even at this very instant i say the people submitted entirely to the councils of demosthenes the precautions that were taken to post guards to raise the walls and to repair the ditches were all in consequence of his advice he himself was appointed to supply the city with provisions and to repair the walls which latter commission he executed with so much generosity that it acquired him the greatest honor and for which at the request of ctesiphon a crown of gold was decreed him as a reward for his having presented the commonwealth with a sum of money out of his own estate sufficient to defray what was wanting of the sums for repairing the walls  on the present occasion that is after the battle of chaeronea such orators as opposed demosthenes having all risen up in concert against him and having cited him to take his trial according to law the people not only declared him innocent of the several accusations laid to his charge but conferred more honors upon him than he had enjoyed before so strongly did the veneration they had for his zeal and fidelity overbalance the efforts of calumny and malice  but the people did not stop here the bones of such as had been killed in the battle of chaeronea having been brought to athens to be interred they appointed demosthenes to compose the eulogium of those brave men a manifest proof that they did not ascribe to him the ill success of the battle but to providence only who disposes of human events at pleasure  it was in this year that aeschines drew up an accusation against ctesiphon or rather against demosthenes which was the most remarkable that ever appeared before any tribunal not so much for the object of the contest as for the greatness and ability of the speakers ctesiphon a partizan and friend of demosthenes brought a cause before the assembly of the people in which he urged that a decree should be passed giving a golden crown to demosthenes this decree was strongly opposed by aeschines the rival of demosthenes as well in eloquence as in ambition  no cause ever excited so much curiosity nor was pleaded with so much pomp people flocked to it from all parts and they had great reason for so doing for what sight could be nobler than a conflict between two orators each of them excellent in his way both formed by nature improved by art and animated by perpetual dissentions and an implacable animosity against each other  the juncture seemed to favor aeschines very much for the macedonian party whom he always befriended was very powerful in athens especially after the ruin of thebes nevertheless aeschines lost his cause and was justly sentenced to banishment for his rash accusation he thereupon went and settled himself in rhodes where he opened a school of eloquence the fame and glory of which continued for many ages he began his lectures with the two orations that had occasioned his banishment great encomiums were given to that of aeschines but when they heard that of demosthenes the plaudits and acclamations were redoubled and it was then he spoke these words so greatly laudable in the mouth of an enemy and a rival alas what applauses would you not have bestowed had you heard demosthenes speak it himself  demosthenes thus become victor made a good use of his conquest for the instant aeschines left athens in order to embark for rhodes demosthenes ran after him and forced him to accept of a purse of money on this occasion aeschines cried out how will it be possible for me not to regret a country in which i leave an enemy more generous than i can hope to find friends in any other part of the world  in the mean time philip had his ambition pleased but not satisfied with his last victory he had one object long in view and that he never lost sight of this was to get himself appointed in the assembly of the greeks their chief general against the persians it had long been the object not only of the confederate states but also of the neighboring greek nations to revenge upon the kingdom of persia the injuries they had sustained from it and to work the total destruction of that empire this was an object which had early inflamed the mind of philip and his late victory paved the way to it he therefore got himself declared generalissimo of the greek forces and accordingly made preparations to invade that mighty empire  but whilst philip was thus successful in politics and war the domestic divisions that reigned in his family embittered his happiness and at last caused his destruction he had married olympias the daughter of the king of epirus and the early part of their union was crowned with happiness but her ill temper soon clouded that dawn which promised so much felicity she was naturally jealous vindictive and passionate and their dissentions were carried to such a degree that philip was often heard to wish for death but his passion for cleopatra niece to attalus his general completed their separation as cleopatra was no less amiable in her temper and accomplishments than in the extraordinary graces of her person philip conceived that he should consult his own happiness most effectually by forming an inviolable and perpetual union with this lady and without the least hesitation resolved to separate himself for ever from the princess who had long appeared so great an enemy to his tranquillity in vain did alexander his son remonstrate that by divorcing olympias and engaging in a second marriage he exposed him to the danger of contending with a number of competitors for the crown and rendered his succession precarious my son said the king if i create you a number of competitors you will have the glorious opportunity of exerting yourself to surpass them in merit thus shall their rivalship by no means affect your title his marriage with cleopatra was now declared in form and celebrated with all the grandeur and solemnity which the great occasion demanded the young prince however dissatisfied was yet obliged to attend on these solemnities and sat in silent indignation at that feast which proclaimed the disgrace of his mother in such circumstances his youthful and impetuous mind could not but be susceptible of the slightest irritation attalus the uncle of the new queen forgetting that just caution which should have taught him to be scrupulously observant to avoid offending the prince intoxicated by the honors paid to his kinswoman as well as by the present festivity was rash enough to call publicly on the macedonian nobles to pour out their libations to the gods that they might grant the king the happy fruits of the present nuptials and legitimate heirs to his throne wretch cried alexander with his eyes sparkling with that fury and vexation which he had till now suppressed do thou then call me bastard and instantly darted his goblet at attalus who returned the outrage with double violence clamor and confusion arose and the king in a sudden fit of rage snatched his sword and flew directly toward his son his precipitation his lameness and the quantity of wine in which he had by this time indulged happily disappointed his rash purpose he stumbled and fell on the floor while alexander with an unpardonable insolence cried out behold ye macedonians this is the king who is preparing to lead you into asia see where in passing from one table to another he is fallen to the ground  philip however did not lose sight of the conquests of asia full of the mighty project he revolved he consulted the gods to know what would be the event of it and the priestess replied the victim is already crowned his end draws nigh and he will soon be sacrificed philip hearing this did not hesitate a moment but interpreted the oracle in his own favor the ambiguity of which ought at least to have kept him in some suspense in order therefore that he might be in a condition to apply entirely to his expedition against the persians and elevate himself solely to the conquest of asia he dispatched with all possible diligence his domestic affairs after this he offered up a solemn sacrifice to the gods and prepared to celebrate with incredible magnificence in egae a city of macedonia the nuptials of cleopatra his daughter whom he gave in marriage to alexander king of epirus and brother to olympias his queen he had invited to it the most considerable persons of greece and heaped upon them friendship and honors of every kind by way of gratitude for electing him generalissimo of the greeks the cities made their court to him in emulation of each other by sending him gold crowns and athens distinguished its zeal above all the rest neoptolemus the poet had written purposely for that festival a tragedy entitled cinyras in which under borrowed names he represented this prince as already victor over darius and master of asia philip listened to these happy presages with joy and comparing them with the answer of the oracle assured himself of conquest the day after the nuptials games and shows were solemnized as these formed part of the religious worship there were carried in it with great pomp and ceremony twelve statues of the gods carved with inimitable art a thirteenth that surpassed them all in magnificence represented philip as a god the hour for his leaving the palace arrived he went forth in a white robe and advanced with an air of majesty in the midst of acclamations toward the theater where an infinite multitude of macedonians as well as foreigners waited his coming with impatience  but this magnificence only served to make the catastrophe more remarkable and to add splendour to ruin some time before attalus inflamed with wine at an entertainment had insulted in the most shocking manner pausanias a young macedonian nobleman the latter had long endeavored to revenge the cruel affront and was perpetually imploring the kings justice but philip unwilling to disgust attalus uncle to cleopatra whom as was before observed he had married after his divorcing olympias his first queen would never listen to pausaniass complaints however to console him in some measure and to express the high esteem he had for and the great confidence he reposed in him he made him one of the chief officers of his lifeguard but this was not what the young macedonian required whose anger now swelling to fury against his judge he formed the design of wiping out his shame by imbruing his hands in the blood of his sovereign  and now while this unhappy youth continued brooding over those malignant passions which distracted and corroded his mind he happened to go into the school of one hermocrates who professed to teach philosophy to whom he proposed the following question what shall that man do who wishes to transmit his name with luster to posterity hermocrates either artfully and from design or the natural malignity of his temper replied he must kill him who has achieved the greatest actions thus shall the memory of the hero be joined with his who slew him and both descend together to posterity this was a maxim highly agreeable to pausanias in the present disposition of his mind and thus various accidents and circumstances concurred to inflame those dangerous passions which now possessed him and to prompt him to the dreadful purpose of satiating his revenge  the present solemnity was that which pausanias chose to put his dreadful design into execution philip clothed in a white flowing robe waving in soft and graceful folds the habiliments in which the grecian deities were usually represented moved forward with an heart filled with triumph and exultation while the admiring crowds shouted forth their flattering applause his guards had orders to keep at a considerable distance from his person to show that the king confided in the affections of his people and had not the least apprehensions of danger amidst all this mixed concourse of different states and nations unhappily the danger was but too near him the injured pausanias had not yet forgot his wrongs but still retained those terrible impressions which the sense of the indignity he had received and the artful and interested representations of others fixed deeply in his mind he chose this fatal morning for the execution of his revenge on the prince who had denied reparation to his injured honor his design had been for some time premeditated and now was the dreadful moment of effecting it as philip marched on in all his pride and pomp this young macedonian slipped through the crowd and with a desperate and malignant resolution waited his approach in a narrow passage just at the entrance into the theater the king advanced toward him pausanias drew his poniard plunged it into his heart and the conqueror of greece and terror of asia fell prostrate to the ground and instantly expired  the murderer flew toward the gates of the city where there stood horses ready to favor his escape which olympias herself is said to have prepared the tumult and confusion was such as might be expected from so fatal an event some of the macedonians crowded round the fallen king with officious and ineffectual care while others pursued pausanias among these were perdicas attalus and leonatus the first who excelled in swiftness came up to the assassin where he was just preparing to mount his horse but being by his precipitation entangled in some vines a violent effort to extricate his foot brought him suddenly to the ground as he prepared to rise perdicas was upon him and with his companions soon dispatched him by the repeated wounds which their fury inflicted his body was immediately hung on a gibbet but in the morning appeared crowned with a golden diadem the only means by which olympias could now express her implacable resentment in a few days indeed she took a further occasion of publishing her triumph and exultation in her husbands fall by paying the same funeral honors to pausanias which were prepared for philip both bodies were burnt on the same pile and the ashes of both deposited in the same tomb she is even said to have prevailed on the macedonians to pay annual honors to pausanias as if she feared that the share she had taken in the death of philip should not be sufficiently known to the world she consecrated to apollo the dagger which had been the instrument of the fatal deed inscribed with the name myrtalis the name which she had borne when their loves first began  thus died philip whose virtues and vices were directed and proportioned to his ambition his most shining and exalted qualities were influenced in a great measure by his love of power and even the most exceptionable parts of his conduct were principally determined by their convenience and expediency if he was unjust he was like caesar unjust for the sake of empire if he gloried by the success acquired by his virtues and his intellectual accomplishments rather than in that which the force of arms could gain the reason which he himself assigned points out his true principle in the former case said he the glory is entirely mine in the other my generals and soldiers have their share  the news of philips death was a joyful surprise in greece and particularly in athens where the people crowned themselves with garlands and decreed a crown to pausanias they sacrificed to the gods for their deliverance and sung songs of triumph as if philip had been slain by them in battle but this excess of joy did ill become them it was looked upon as an ungenerous and unmanly insult upon the ashes of a murdered prince and of one whom they just before had revered and crouched to in the most abject manner these immoderate transports were raised in them by demosthenes who having the first intelligence of philips death went into the assembly unusually gay and cheerful with a chaplet on his head and in a rich habit though it was then but the seventh day after the death of his daughter from this circumstance plutarch at the same time that he condemns the behavior of the athenians in general upon this occasion takes an opportunity to justify demosthenes and extols him as a patriot for not suffering his domestic afflictions to interfere with the good fortune of the commonwealth but he certainly might have acted the part of a good citizen with more decency and not have given up to insult what was due to good manners  chap iii from the birth of alexander to his setting out for asia a m     ante j c     alexander the son of philip ascended the throne upon the death of his father and took possession of a kingdom rendered flourishing and powerful by the policy of the preceding reign  he came into the world the very day the celebrated temple of diana at ephesus was burnt upon which occasion the report goes that hegesias the historian was heard to say that it was no wonder the temple was burnt as diana was that day employed at the delivery of olympias to facilitate the birth of alexander  the passion which prevailed most in alexander even from his tender years was ambition and an ardent desire of glory but not for every species of glory philip like a sophist valued himself upon his eloquence and the beauty of his style and had the vanity to have engraved on his coins the several victories he had won at the olympic games in the chariot race but it was not after such empty honors that his son aspired his friends asked him one day whether he would not be present at the games abovementioned in order to dispute the prize bestowed on that occasion for he was very swift of foot he answered that he would contend in them provided kings were to be his antagonists  every time news was brought him that his father had taken some city or gained some great battle alexander so far from sharing in the general joy used to say in a plaintive tone of voice to the young persons that were brought up with him friends my father will possess himself of every thing and leave nothing for me to do  one day some ambassadors from the king of persia being arrived at court during philips absence alexander gave them so kind and so polite a reception and regaled them in so noble and generous a manner as charmed them all but that which most surprised them was the good sense and judgment he discovered in the several conversations they had with him he did not propose to them any thing that was trifling and like one of his age such for instance as enquiring about the so much boasted gardens suspended in the air the riches and magnificence of the palace and court of the king of persia which excited the admiration of the whole world the famous golden plantanetree and that golden vine the grapes of which were of emeralds carbuncles rubies and all sorts of precious stones under which the persian monarch was said frequently to give audience alexander i say asked them questions of a quite different nature enquiring which was the road to upper asia the distance of the several places in what the strength and power of the king of persia consisted in what part of the battle he fought how he behaved toward his enemies and in what manner he governed his subjects these ambassadors admired him all the while and perceiving even at that time how great he might one day become they observed in a few words the difference they found between alexander and artaxerxes by saying one to another this young prince is great and ours is rich that man must be vastly insignificant who has no other merit than his riches  so ripe a judgment in this young prince was owing as much to the good education which had been given him as to the happiness of his natural parts several preceptors were appointed to teach him all such arts and sciences as are worthy the heir to a great kingdom and the chief of these was leonidas a person of the most severe morals and a relation to the queen this leonidas in their journies together used frequently to look into the trunks where his beds and clothes were laid in order to see if olympias his mother had not put something superfluous into them which might administer to delicacy and luxury  but the greatest service philip did his son was appointing aristotle his preceptor the most famous and the most learned philosopher of his age whom he entrusted with the whole care of his education one of the reasons which prompted philip to choose him a master of so conspicuous reputation and merit was as he himself tells us that his son might avoid committing a great many faults of which he himself had been guilty  philip was sensible how great a treasure he possessed in the person of aristotle for which reason he settled a very genteel stipend upon him and afterward rewarded his pains and care in an infinitely more glorious manner for having destroyed and laid waste the city of stagira the native place of that philosopher he rebuilt it purely out of affection for him reinstated the inhabitants who had fled from it or were made slaves and gave them a fine park in the neighborhood of stagira as a place for their studies and assemblies even in plutarchs time the stone seats which aristotle had placed there were standing as also spacious vistoes under which those who walked were shaded from the sunbeams  alexander likewise discovered no less esteem for his master whom he believed himself bound to love as much as if he had been his father declaring that he was indebted to the one for living and to the other for living well the progress of the pupil was equal to the care and abilities of the preceptor he grew vastly fond of philosophy and learned the several parts of it but in a manner suitable to his birth aristotle endeavored to improve his judgment by laying down sure and certain rules by which he might distinguish just and solid reasoning from what is but speciously so and by accustoming him to separate in discourse all such parts as only dazzle from those which are truly solid and constitute its whole value but alexander applied himself chiefly to morality which is properly the science of kings because it is the knowledge of mankind and of their duties this he made his serious and profound study and considered it even at that time as the foundation of prudence and wise policy  the greatest master of rhetoric that antiquity could ever boast and who has left so excellent a treatise on that subject took care to make that science part of his pupils education and we find that alexander even in the midst of his conquest was often very urgent with aristotle to send him a treatise on that subject to this we owe the work entitled alexanders rhetoric in the beginning of which aristotle proves to him the vast advantages a prince may reap from eloquence as it gives him the greatest ascendant over the minds of men which he ought to acquire as well by his wisdom as authority some answers and letters of alexander which are still extant show that he possessed in its greatest perfection that strong that manly eloquence which abounds with sense and ideas and which is so entirely free from superfluous expressions that every single word has its meaning which properly speaking is the eloquence of kings  his esteem or rather his passion for homer shows not only with what vigor and success he applied to polite literature but the judicious use he made of it and the solid advantages he proposed to himself from it he was not only prompted to peruse this poet merely out of curiosity or to unbend his mind or from a great fondness for poetry but his view in studying this admirable writer was to borrow such sentiments from him as were worthy a great king and conqueror courage intrepidity magnanimity temperance prudence the art of commanding well in war and peace the verse which pleased him most in homer was that where agamemnon is represented as a good king and a brave warrior  after this it is no wonder that alexander should have so high an esteem for this poet thus when after the battle of arbela the macedonians had found among the spoils of darius a gold box enriched with precious stones in which the excellent perfumes used by that prince were put alexander who was quite covered with dust and regardless of essences and perfumes ordered that this box should be employed to no other use than to hold homers poems which he believed the most perfect the most precise production of the human mind he admired particularly the iliad which he called the best provision for a warrior he always had with him that edition of homer which aristotle had revised and corrected and to which the title of the edition of the box was given and he laid it with his sword every night under his pillow  fond even to excess of every kind of glory he was displeased with aristotle his master for having published in his absence certain metaphysical pieces which he himself desired to possess only and even at the time when he was employed in the conquest of asia and the pursuit of darius he wrote to him a letter which is still extant wherein he complains upon that very account alexander says in it that he had much rather surpss the rest of men in the knowledge of sublime and excellent things than in the greatness and extent of his powers he in like manner requested aristotle not to show the treatise of rhetoric above mentioned to any person but himself  he had also a taste for the whole circle of arts but in such a manner as became a prince that is he knew the value and usefulness of them music painting sculpture architecture flourished in his reign because they found him both a skilful judge and a generous protector who was able to distinguish and to reward merit  but he despised certain trifling feats of dexterity that were of no use some macedonians admired very much a man who employed himself very attentively in throwing small peace through the eye of a needle which he would do at a considerable distance and without once missing alexander seeing him at this exercise ordered him as we are told a present suitable to his employment viz a basket of peace  alexander was of a sprightly disposition was resolute and very tenacious of his opinion which never gave way to force but at the same time would submit immediately to reason and good sense it is very difficult to treat with persons of this turn of mind philip accordingly notwithstanding his double authority of king and father believed it necessary to employ persuasion rather than force with respect to his son and endeavored to make himself beloved rather than feared by him  an accident made him entertain a very advantageous opinion of alexander there had been sent from thessaly to philip a warhorse a noble strong fiery generous beast called bucephalus the owner would not sell him under thirteen talents an immense sum the king went into the plains attended by his courtiers in order to view the perfections of this horse but upon trial he appeared so very fierce and pranced about in so furious a manner that no one dared to mount him philip being angry that so furious and unmanageable a creature had been sent him gave orders for their carrying him back again alexander who was present at that time cried out what a noble horse we are going to lose for want of address and boldness to back him philip at first considered these words as the effect of folly and rashness so common to young men but as alexander insisted still more upon what he had said and was very much vexed to see so noble a creature just going to be sent home again his father gave him leave to try what he could do the young prince overjoyed at this permission goes up to bucephalus takes hold of the bridle and turns his head to the sun having observed that the thing which frighted him was his own shadow alexander therefore first stroked him gently with his hand and soothed him with his voice then seeing his fierceness abate and artfully taking this opportunity he let fall his cloak and springing swiftly upon his back first slackened the rein without once striking or vexing him and when he perceived that his fire was cooled that he was no longer so furious and violent and wanted only to move forward he gave him the rein and spurring him with great vigor animated him with his voice to his full speed while this was doing philip and his whole court trembled for fear and did not once open their lips but when the prince after having run his first heat returned with joy and pride at his having broke a horse which was judged absolutely ungovernable all the courtiers in general endeavored to outvie one another in their applauses and congratulations and we are told philip shed tears of joy on this occasion and embracing alexander after he was alighted and kissing him he said to him my son seek a kingdom more worthy of thee for macedon is below thy merit  alexander upon his accession to the throne saw himself surrounded with extreme dangers the barbarous nations with whom philip contended during his whole reign thought this change for their advantage and despising the youth and inexperience of the young monarch resolved to seize this opportunity of regaining their freedom for satiating themselves with plunder nor had he less to fear from the greeks themselves who now thought this a convenient opportunity to restore their ancient form of government revenge their former injuries and reclaim those rights which they had enjoyed for ages  alexander however resolved to prevent their machinations and to give them no time to complete their confederacies against him after taking revenge upon the conspirators against his father whom he slew upon his tomb he first conciliated the affections of the macedonians to him by freeing them from a vexatious and bodily slavery only commanding their service in his wars  the macedonians reflecting on his precarious situation advised him to relinquish greece and not persist in his resolution of subduing it by force to recover by gentle methods the barbarians who had taken arms and to soothe as it were those glimmerings of revolt and innovation by prudent reserve complacency and insinuations in order to conciliate their affections however alexander would not listen to these timorous counsels but resolved to secure and support his affairs by boldness and magnanimity firmly persuaded that should he relax in any point at first all his neighbors would fall upon him and that were he to endeavor to compromise matters he should be obliged to give up all philips conquests and by that means confine his dominions to the narrow limits of macedon he therefore made all possible haste to check the arms of the barbarians by marching his troops to the banks of the danube which he crossed in one night he defeated the king of the triballi in a great battle made the getae fly at his approach subdued several barbarous nations some by the terror of his name and others by force of arms and notwithstanding the arrogant answers of their ambassadors he taught them to dread a danger which they found but too well prepared to overwhelm them  whilst alexander was thus employed at a distance against the barbarians all the cities of greece who were animated more particularly by demosthenes formed a powerful alliance against him a false report which prevailed of his death inspired the thebans with a boldness that proved their ruin they cut to pieces part of the macedonian garrison in their citadel demosthenes on the other side was every day haranguing the people and fired with contempt for alexander whom he called a child and a hairbrained boy he assured the athenians with a decisive tone of voice that they had nothing to fear from the new king of macedon who did not dare to stir out of his kingdom but would think himself vastly happy could he sit peaceably on his throne at the same time he wrote letters upon letters to attalus one of philips lieutenants in asia minor to excite him to rebel this attalus was uncle to cleopatra philips second wife and was very much disposed to listen to demostheness proposals nevertheless as alexander was grown very disfident of him for which he knew there was but too much reason he therefore to eradicate from his mind all the suspicions he might entertain and the better to screen his designs sent all demostheness letters to that prince but alexander saw through all his artisices and thereupon ordered hecataeus one of his commanders whom he had sent into asia for that purpose to have him assassinated which was executed accordingly attaluss death restored tranquillity to the army and entirely destroyed the seeds of discord and rebellion  the object which seized alexanders earliest ambition was the conquest of persia and he now expected that he would have leisure and opportunity to prepare for so great an enterprise but he was soon called to a new undertaking the athenians thebans and lacedaemonians united against him hoping by the assistance of persia to recover their former freedom in order to persuade the greeks to this demosthenes made use of a device which had more cunning in it than wisdom he caused it to be reported that alexander was slain in a battle against the triballi and he produced a man to the assembly who ventured to affirm that he was present and wounded when his general was slain these false reports which serve for a day are but bad policy like a false alarm in battle the people may sometimes be mocked by them but in the end the success will prove as ridiculous as the invention for as those that find themselves at one time abused by such at other times neglect the real call of truth by being summoned without occasion they fatally despise the hour of danger this unfortunate obstacle obliged alexander to turn his sword from the persians against the greeks of whose assistance he had but just before assured himself  expedition and activity were the characteristics of this monarchs conduct he led his army against the greeks with so much celerity that his appearance before them gave the first news of his preparation he appeared so suddenly in boeotia that the thebans could scarce believe their eyes and being come before their walls was willing to give them time to repent and only demanded to have phoenix and prothules the two chief ringleaders of the revolt delivered up to him and published by sound of trumpet a general pardon to all who should come over to him but the thebans by way of insult demanded to have philotas and antipater delivered to them and invited by a declaration all who were solicitous for the liberty of greece to join with them in its defense  alexander finding it impossible for him to get the better of their obstinacy by offers of peace saw with grief that he should be forced to employ his power and decide the affair by force of arms a great battle was thereupon fought in which the thebans exerted themselves with a bravery and ardour much beyond their strength for the enemy exceeded them vastly in numbers but after a long and vigorous resistance such as survived of the macedonian garrison in the citadel coming down from it and charging the thebans in the rear being surrounded on all sides the greatest part of them were cut to pieces and the city taken and plundered  it would be impossible for words to express the dreadful calamities which the thebans suffered on this occasion some thracians having pulled down the house of a virtuous lady of quality timoclea by name carried off all her goods and treasures and their captain having seized the lady and satiated his brutal lust with her afterward enquired whether she had not concealed gold and silver timoclea animated by an ardent desire of revenge replying that she had hid some took him with herself only into her garden and showing him a well told him that the instant she saw the enemy enter the city she herself had thrown into it the most precious things in her possession the officer overjoyed at what he heard drew near the well and stooping down to see its depth timoclea who was behind pushing him with all her strength threw him in and afterward killed him with great stones which she heaped upon him she was instantly seized by the thracians and being bound in chains was carried before alexander the prince perceived immediately by her mien that she was a woman of quality and great spirit for she followed those brutal wretches with a very haughty air and without discovering the least fear alexander asking her who she was timoclea replied i am sister to theagenes who fought against philip for the liberty of greece and was killed in the battle of chaeronea where he commanded the prince admiring her generous answer and still more the action that she had done gave orders that she should have leave to retire wherever she pleased with her children  alexander then debated in council how to act with regard to thebes the phocians and the people of plataea thespiae and orchomenus who were all in alliance with alexander and had shared in his victory represented to him the cruel treatment they had met with from the thebans who also had destroyed their several cities and reproached them with the zeal which they had always discovered in favor of the persians against the greeks who held them in the utmost detestation the proof of which was the oath they had all taken to destroy thebes after they should have vanquished the persians  cleades one of the prisoners being permitted to speak endeavored to excuse in some measure the revolt of the thebans a fault which in his opinion should be imputed to a rash and credulous imprudence rather than to depravity of will and declared perfidy he remonstrated that his countrymen upon a false report of alexanders death had indeed too rashly broke into rebellion not against the king but against his successors that what crimes soever they might have committed they had been punished for them with the utmost severity by the dreadful calamity which had befallen their city that there now remained in it none but women children and old men from whom they had nothing to fear and who were so much the greater objects of compassion as they had been no ways concerned in the revolt he concluded with reminding alexander that thebes which had given birth to so many gods and heroes several of whom were that kings ancestors had also been the seat of his father philips rising glory and like a second native country to him  these motives which cleades urged were very strong and powerful nevertheless the anger of the conqueror prevailed and the city was destroyed however he set at liberty the priests all such as had right of hospitality with the macedonians the descendants of pindar the famous poet who had done so much honor to greece and such as had opposed the revolt but all the rest in number about thirty thousand he sold and upwards of six thousand had been killed in battle the athenians were so sensibly afflicted at the sad disaster which had befallen thebes that being about to solemnize the festival of the great mysteries they suspended them upon account of their extreme grief and received with the greatest humanity all those who had fled from the battle and the plunder of thebes and made athens their asylum  alexanders so sudden arrival in greece had very much abated the haughtiness of the athenians and extinguished demostheness vehemence and fire but the ruin of thebes which was still more sudden threw them into the utmost consternation they therefore had recourse to entreaties and sent a deputation to alexander to implore his clemency demosthenes was among them but he was no sooner arrived at mount cytheron than dreading the anger of that prince he quitted the embassy and returned home  immediately alexander sent to athens requiring the citizens to deliver up to him ten orators whom he supposed to have been the chief instruments in forming the league which philip his father had defeated at chaeronea it was on this occasion that demosthenes related to the people the fable of the wolves and dogs in which it is supposed that the wolves one day told the sheep that in case they desired to be at peace with them they must deliver up to them the dogs who were their guard the application was easy and natural especially with respect to the orators who were justly compared to dogs whose duty it was to watch to bark and to fight in order to save the lives of the flock  in this afflicting dilemma of the athenians who could not prevvail with themselves to deliver up their orators to certain death though they had no other way to save their city demades whom alexander had honored with his friendship offered to undertake the embassy alone and intercede for them the king whether he had satiated his revenge or endeavored to blot out if possible by some act of clemency the barbarous action he had just before committed or rather to remove the several obstacles which might retard the execution of his grand design and by that means not leave during his absence the least pretense for murmurs waved his demand with regard to the delivery of the orators and was pacified by their sending caridemus into banishment who being a native of oraea had been presented by the athenians with his freedom for the services he had done the republic he was soninlaw to chersobleptus king of thrace had learned the art of war under iphicrates and had himself frequently commanded the athenian armies to avoid the pursuit of alexander he took refuge with the king of persia  as for the athenians he not only forgave them the several injuries he pretended to have received but expressed a particular regard for them exhorting them to apply themselves vigorously to public affairs and to keep a watchful eye over the several transactions which might happen because in case of his death their city was to give laws to the rest of greece historians relate that many years after this expedition he was seized with deep remorse for the calamity he had brought upon the thebans and that this made him behave with much greater humanity toward many other nations  so dreadful an example of severity toward so powerful a city as thebes spread the terror of his arms through all greece and made all things give way before him he summoned at corinth the assembly of the several states and free cities of greece to obtain from them the same supreme command against the persians which had been granted his father a little before his death no assembly ever debated upon a more important subject it was the western world deliberating upon the ruin of the east and the methods for executing a revenge which had been suspended more than an age the assembly held at this time gave rise to events the relation of which appear astonishing and almost incredible and to revolutions which contributed to change the disposition of most things in the political world  to form such a design required a prince bold enterprising and experienced in war one of great views who having acquired a great name by his exploits was not to be intimidated by dangers nor checked by obstacles but above all a monarch who had a supreme authority over all the states of greece none of which singly was powerful enough to make so arduous an attempt and which required in order for their acting in concert to be subject to one chief who might give motion to the several parts of that great body by making them all concur to the same end such a prince was alexander it was not difficult for him to rekindle in the minds of the people their ancient hatred of the persians their perpetual and irreconcilable enemies whose destruction they had more than once swore and whom they had determined to extirpate in case an opportunity should present itself for that purpose a hatred which the intestine feuds of the greeks might indeed have suspended but could never extinguish the immortal retreat of the ten thousand greeks notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the prodigious army of the persians showed plainly what might be expected from an army composed of the flower of the forces of all the cities of greece and those of macedon commanded by generals and officers formed under philip and to say all in a word led by alexander the deliberations of the assembly were therefore very short and that prince was unanimously appointed generalissimo against the persians  immediately a great number of officers and governors of cities with many philosophers waited upon alexander to congratulate him upon his election he flattered himself that diogenes of synope who was then at corinth would also come like the rest and pay his compliments this philosopher who entertained a very mean idea of grandeur thought it improper to congratulate men just upon their exaltation but that mankind ought to wait till those persons should perform actions worthy of their high stations diogenes therefore still continued at home upon which alexander attended by all his courtiers made him a visit the philosopher was at that time lying down in the sun but seeing so great a crowd of people advancing toward him he sat up and fixed his eyes on alexander this prince surprised to behold so famous a philosopher reduced to such extreme poverty after saluting him in the kindest manner asked whether he wanted any thing diogenes replied yes that you would stand a little out of my sunshine this answer raised the contempt and indignation of all the courtiers but the monarch struck with the philosophers greatness of soul were i not alexander says he i would be diogenes in a word all or nothing presents us with the true image of alexander and diogenes how great and powerful soever that prince might think himself he could not deny himself on this occasion inferior to a man to whom he could give and from whom he could take nothing  alexander before he set out for asia was determined to consult the oracle of apollo he therefore went to delphos where he happened to arrive in those days which are called unlucky a season in which people were forbid consulting the oracle and accordingly the priestess refused to go to the temple but alexander who could not bear any contradiction to his will took her forcibly by the arm and as he was leading her to the temple she cried out my son thou art irresistible this was all he desired and catching hold of these words which he considered as spoke by the oracle he set out for macedonia in order to make preparations for his great expedition  alexander being arrived in his kingdom held a council with the chief officers of his army and the nobles of his court on the expedition he meditated against persia and the measures he should take in order to succeed in it the whole assembly were unanimous except in one article antipater and parmenio were of opinion that the king before he engaged in an enterprise which would necessarily be a long one ought to make choice of a consort in order to secure himself a successor to his throne but alexander who was of a violent fiery temper did not approve of this advice and believed that after he had been nominated generalissimo of the greeks and that his father had left him an invincible army it would be a shame for him to lose his time in solemnizing his nuptials and waiting for the fruits of it for which reason he determined to set out immediately  accordingly he offered up very splendid sacrifices to the gods and caused to be celebrated at dia a city of macedon scenical games that had been instituted by one of his ancestors in honor of jupiter and the muses this festival continued nine days agreeable to the number of those goddesses he had a tent raised large enough to hold an hundred tables on which consequently nine hundred covers might be laid to this feast the several princes of his family all the ambassadors generals and officers were invited  before he set out upon his great expedition he settled the affairs of macedon over which he appointed antipater as viceroy with twelve thousand foot and near the same number of horse he also enquired into the domestic affairs of his friends giving to one an estate in land to another a village to a third the revenues of a town to a fourth the toll of an harbor as all the revenues of his demesnes were already employed and exhausted by his donations perdicas said to him my lord what is it you reserve for yourself alexander replied hope upon which perdicas said the same hope ought therefore to satisfy us and so refused very generously to accept of what the king had appointed him  after having completely settled his affairs in macedonia and used all the precautions imaginable to prevent any troubles from arising in it during his absence he set out for asia in the beginning of the spring his army consisted of little more than thirty thousand foot and four or five thousand horse but then they were all brave men well disciplined and enured to fatigues they had made several campaigns under philip and were each of them in case of necessity capable of commanding most of the officers were near threescore years of age and the common men fifty and when they were either assembled or drawn up at the head of a camp they had the air of a venerable senate parmenio commanded the infantry philotas his son had eighteen hundred horse under him and callas the son of harpalus the same number of thessalian cavalry the rest of the horse were composed of natives of the several states of greece and amounted to six hundred had their particular commander the thracians and poeonians who were always in front were headed by cassander alexander began his march along the lake cercinum toward amphipolis crossed the river strymon near its mouth afterward the hebrus and arrived at sestos after twenty days march he then commanded parmenio to cross over from sestos to abydos with all the horse and part of the foot which he accordingly did with the assistance of an hundred and threescore galleys and several flatbottomed vessels while he himself crossed over the hellespont steering his gally with his own hands and when he arrived near the shore as if to take possession of the continent he leaped from his ship in complete armor and testified many transports of joy  this confidence soon began to diffuse itself over all the rest of his army it inspired his soldiers with so much courage and security that they fancied themselves marching not to a precarious war but a certain victory  being arrived at the city of lampsacus which he was determined to destroy in order to punish the rebellion of its inhabitants anaximenes a native of that place came to him this man who was a famous historian had been very intimate with philip his father and alexander himself had a great esteem for him having been his pupil the king suspecting the business he came upon to be beforehand with him swore in express terms that he would never grant his request the favor i have to desire of you says anaximenes is that you would destroy lampsacus by this witty evasion the historian saved his country  from thence alexander went to troy where he paid great honors to the shade of achilles and caused games to be celebrated round his tomb he admired and envied the felicity of that grecian hero in having found during life a faithful friend in patroclus and after death a noble panegyrist in homer  when the news of alexanders landing in asia was brought to darius he testified the utmost contempt for the macedonian army and indignation at the presumption of their generals in a letter which he wrote he reprehended his audacious insolence and gave orders to his various governors in the different parts of his dominions that if they took alexander alive to whip him with rods make prisoners of his whole army and send them as slaves to one of the most deserted parts of his dominions thus confiding in the glittering but barbarous multitude which he commanded he disposed of the enemy as already vanquished but confidence goes but a short part of the road to success the great numbers which he had gathered only brought unwiedly splendour into the field and instead of procuring him security increased his embarrassments  alexander being at length arrived on the banks of the grannicus a river of phrygia there first found the persians disposed to dispute his passage the persian satrap taking possession of the higher banks at the head of an army of one hundred thousand foot and upwards of ten thousand horse seemed to promise themselves victory memnon who was a rhodian and commanded under darius all the coast of asia had advised the generals not to venture a battle but to lay waste the plains and even the cities thereby to starve alexanders army and oblige him to return back into europe memnon was the best of all dariuss generals and had been the principal agent in his victories it is not easily to determine what we ought to admire most in him whether his great wisdom in council his courage and capacity in the field or his zeal and attachment to his sovereign the council he gave on this occasion was excellent when we consider that his enemy was fiery and impetuous had neither town magazine or place of retreat that he was entering a country to which he was absolutely a stranger and inhabited by enemies that delays alone would weaken and ruin him and that his only hopes lay in giving battle immediately but arfites a phrygian satrap opposed the opinion of memnon and protested he would never suffer the grecians to make such havoc in the territories he governed this ill council prevailed over that of the rhodian whom the persians to their great prejudice suspected of a design to protract the war and by that means of making himself necessary to darius  alexander in the mean time marched on at the head of his heavy armed infantry drawn up in two lines with the cavalry in the wings and the baggage following in the rear being arrived upon the banks of the grannicus parmenio advised him to encamp there in battle array in order that his forces might have time to rest themselves and not to pass the river till very early next morning because the enemy would then be less able to prevent him he added that it would be too dangerous to attempt crossing a river in sight of an enemy especially as that before them was deep and its banks very craggy so that the persian cavalry who waited their coming in battle array on the other side might easily defeat them before they were drawn up that besides the loss which would be sustained on this occasion this enterprise in case it should prove unsuccessful would be of dangerous consequence to their future affairs the fame and glory of arms depending on the first actions  however these reasons were not able to make the least impression on alexander who declared that it would be a shame should he after crossing the hellespont suffer his progress to be retarded by a rivulet for so he called the grannicus out of contempt that they ought to take advantage of the terror which the suddenness of his arrival and the boldness of his attempt had spread amongst the persians and answer the high opinion the world conceived of his courage and the valor of the macedonians the enemys horse which was very numerous lined the whole shore and formed a large front in order to oppose alexander wherever he should endeavor to pass and the foot which consisted chiefly of greeks in dariuss service was posted behind upon an easy ascent  the two armies continued a long time in sight of each other on the banks of the river as if dreading the event the persians waited till the macedonians should enter the river in order to charge them to advantage upon their landing and the latter seemed to be making choice of a place proper for crossing and to survey the countenance of their enemies upon this alexander ordered his horse to be brought commanded the noblemen of the court to follow him and behave gallantly he himself commanded the right wing and parmenio the left the king first caused a strong detachment to march into the river himself following it with the rest of the forces he made parmenio advance afterward with the left wing he himself led on the right wing into the river followed by the rest of the troops the trumpets sounding and the whole army raising cries of joy  the persians seeing this detachment advance forward began to let fly their arrows and march to a place where the declivity was not so great in order to keep the macedonians from landing but now the horse engaged with great fury one part endeavoring to land and the other striving to prevent them the macedonians whose cavalry was vastly inferior in number besides the advantage of the ground were wounded with the darts that were shot from the eminence not to mention that the flower of the persian horse were drawn together in this place and that memnon in concert with his sons commanded there the macedonians therefore at first gave ground after having lost the first ranks which made a vigorous defense alexander who had followed them close and reinforced them with his best troops headed them himself animated them by his presence pushed the persians and routed them upon which the whole army followed after crossed the river and attacked the enemy on all sides  alexander first charged the thickest part of the enemys horse in which the generals fought he himself was particularly conspicuous by his shield and the plume of feathers that overshadowed his helmet on the two sides of which there rose two wings as it were of a great length and so vastly white that they dazzled the eyes of the beholder the charge was very furious about his person and though only the horse engaged they fought like foot man to man without giving way on either side every one striving to repulse his adversary and gain ground of him spithrobates lieutenant governor of ionia and soninlaw to darius distinguished himself above the rest of the generals by his superior bravery being surrounded by forty persian lords all of them his relations of experienced valor and who never moved from his side he carried terror wherever he went alexander observing in how gallant a manner he signalized himself clapped spurs to his horse and advanced toward him immediately they engaged and each having thrown a javelin wounded the other slightly spithrobates falls furiously sword in hand upon alexander who being prepared for him thrusts his pike into his face and laid him dead at his feet at that very moment rasaces brother to that nobleman charging him on the side gave him so furious a blow on the head with his battleaxe that he beat off his plume but went no deeper than the hair as he was going to repeat his blow on the head which now appeared through his fractured helmet clitus cut off rasacess hand with one stroke of his scimetar and by that means saved his sovereigns life the danger to which alexander had been exposed greatly animated the courage of his soldiers who now performed wonders the persians in the center of the horse upon whom the lightarmed troops who had been posted in the intervals of the horse poured a perpetual discharge of darts being unable to sustain any longer the attack of the macedonians who struck them all in the face the two wings were immediately broke and put to flight alexander did not pursue them long but turned about immediately to charge the foot  these at first stood their ground but when they saw themselves attacked at the same time by the cavalry and the macedonian phalanx which had crossed the river and that the battalions were now engaged those of the persians did not make either a long or a vigorous resistance and were soon put to flight the grecian infantry in dariuss service excepted this body of foot retiring to a hill demanded a promise from alexander to let them march away unmolested but following the dictates of his wrath rather than those of reason he rushed into the midst of this body of foot and presently lost his horse not bucephalus who was killed with the thrust of a sword the battle was so hot round him that most of the macedonians who lost their lives on this occasion fell here for they fought against a body of men who were well disciplined had been inured to war and fought in despair they were all cut to pieces two thousand excepted who were taken prisoners  a great number of the persian commanders lay dead on the spot aristes fled into phrygia where it is said he laid violent hands on himself for having been the cause that the battle was fought twenty thousand foot and two thousand five hundred horse were killed in this engagement on the side of the barbarians and of the macedonians twentyfive of the royal horse were killed at the first attack alexander ordered lysippus to make their statues in brass all of which were set up in a city of macedon called dia from whence they were many years after carried to rome by metellus about threescore of the other horse were killed and near thirty foot who the next day were all laid with their arms and equipage in one grave and the king granted an exemption to their fathers and children from every kind of tribute and service  he also took the utmost care of the wounded visited them and saw their wounds dressed he enquired very particularly into their adventures and permitted every one of them to relate his actions in the battle and boast his bravery he also granted the rites of sepulture to the principal persians and did not even refuse it to such greeks as died in the persian service but all those whom he took prisoners he laid in chains and sent to work as slaves in macedonia for having fought under the barbarian standard against their country contrary to the express prohibition made by greece upon that head  alexander made it his duty and pleasure to share the honor of his victory with the greeks and sent particularly to the athenians three hundred shields being part of the plunder taken from the enemy and caused the glorious inscription following to be inscribed on the rest of the spoils  alexander son of philip with the greeks the lacedaemonians excepted gained these spoils from the barbarians who inhabit asia the greatest part of the gold and silver plate the purple carpets and other furniture of the persian luxury he sent to his mother  this victory not only impressed the persians with consternation but served to excite the ardour of the invading army the persians perceiving that the greeks were not able to overcome them though possessed of manifest advantages supposed that they never could be able to face them upon equal terms and thus from the first mischance they gave up all hopes of succeeding by valor indeed in all invasions where the nations invaded have been once beaten with great advantages of place on their side such as defensive rivers straits and mountains they soon begin to persuade themselves that upon equal terms such an enemy must be irresistible it is the opinion of machiavel that he who resolves to defend a passage should do it with his ablest forces for few regions of any circuit are so well defended by nature that armies of such force as may be thought sufficient to conquer them cannot break through the natural difficulties of the entrance one passage or other is commonly left unguarded and some place weakly defended will be the cause of a fatal triumph to the invaders how often have the alps given way to armies breaking into italy and though they produced dreadful difficulties and dangers among those that scaled them yet they were never found to give security to those that lay behind it was therefore wisely done of alexander to pass the river in the face of the enemy without marching higher to seek an easier passage or laboring to convey his men over it by some saser method having beaten the enemy upon their own terms he no less destroyed their reputation than their strength leaving the wretched subjects of such a state no hopes of succor from such unable protectors  soon after the battle of grannicus he recovered sardis from the enemy which was in a manner the bulwark of the barbarian empire on the side next the sea he took the inhabitants under his protection received their nobles with the utmost condescension and permitted them to be governed by their own laws and maxims observing to his friends around him that such as lay the foundations of a new dominion should always endeavor to have the fame of being merciful four days after he arrived at ephesus carrying with him those who had been banished from thence for being his adherents and restored its popular form of government he assigned to the temple of diana the tributes which were paid to the kings of persia before he left ephesus the deputies of the cities of trallis and magnesia waited upon him with the keys of those places  he afterward marched to miletus which city flattered with the hopes of a sudden and powerful support shut their gates against him and indeed the persian fleet which was very considerable made a show as if it would succor that city but after having made several fruitless attempts to engage that of the enemy it was forced to sail way memnon had shut himself up in this fortress with a great number of his soldiers who had escaped from the battle and was determined to make a good defense alexander who would not lose a moments time attacked it and planted scalingladders on all sides the scalade was carried on with great vigor and opposed with no less intrepidity though alexander sent fresh troops to relieve each other without the least intermission and this lasted several days at last finding his soldiers were every where repulsed and that the city was provided with every thing for a long siege he planted all his machines against it made a great number of breaches and whenever these were attacked a new scalade was attempted the besieged after sustaining all these efforts with prodigious bravery capitulated to prevent being taken by storm alexander treated the milesians with the utmost humanity but sold all the foreigners who were found in it  after possessing himself of miletus he marched into caria in order to lay siege to halicarnassus this city was of prodigious difficult access from its happy situation and had been strongly fortified besides memnon the ablest as well as the most valiant of all dariuss commanders had got into it with a body of choice soldiers with a design to signalize his courage and fidelity for his sovereign he accordingly made a very noble defense in which he was seconded by ephialtes another general of great merit whatever could be expected from the most intrepid bravery and the most consummate knowledge in the science of war was conspicuous on both sides on this occasion memnon finding it impossible for him to hold out any longer was forced to abandon the city as the sea was open to him after having put a strong garrison into the citadel which was well stored with provisions he took with him the surviving inhabitants with all their riches and conveyed them into the island of cos which was not far from halicarnassus alexander did not think proper to besiege the citadel it being of little importance after the city was destroyed which he demolished to the very foundations he left it after having encompassed it with strong walls and left some good troops in the country  soon after this he restored ada queen of caria to her kingdom of which she had been dispossessed some time before and as a testimony of the deep sense she had of the favors received from alexander she sent him every day meats dressed in the most exquisite manner and the most excellent cooks of every kind alexander answered the queen on this occasion that all this train was of no service to him for that he was possessed of much better cooks whom leonidas his governor had given him one of whom prepared him a good dinner and an excellent supper and those were temperance and exercise  several kings of asia minor submitted voluntarily to alexander mithridates king of pontus was one of these who afterward adhered to this prince and followed him in his expeditions he was son to ariobarzanes governor of phrygia and king of pontus of whom mention has been made elsewhere he is computed to be the sixteenth king from artabanus who is considered as the founder of that kingdom of which he was put in possession by darius son of hystaspes his father the famous mithridates who so long employed the roman armies was one of his successors  the year ensuing alexander began the campaign very early he had debated whether it would be proper for him to march directly against darius or first subdue the rest of the maritime provinces the latter opinion appeared the safest since he thereby would not be molested by such nations as he should leave behind him this progress was a little interrupted at first near phaselis a city situated between lysia and pamphilia is a defile along the sea shore which is always dry at low water so that travelers may pass it at that time but when the sea rises it is all under water as it was now winter alexander whom nothing could daunt was desirous of passing it before the waters fell his forces were therefore obliged to march a whole day in the water which came up to their waste  alexander after having settled affairs in cilicia and pamphilia marched his army to coelenae a city of phrygia watered by the river marsyas which the fictions of poets have made so famous he summoned the garrison of the citadel whither the inhabitants were retired to surrender but these believing it impregnable answered haughtily that they would first die however finding the attack carried on with great vigor they desired a truce of sixty days at the expiration of which they promised to open their gates in case they were not succored and accordingly no aid arriving they surrendered themselves upon the day fixed  from thence he marched into phrygia the ancient dominion of the celebrated king midas having taken the capital city he was desirous of seeing the famous chariot to which the gordian knot was tied this knot which fastened the yoke to the beam was tied with so much intricacy that it was impossible to discover where the ends begun or how they were concealed according to an ancient tradition of the country an oracle had foretold that the man who could untie it should possess the empire of asia alexander being firmly persuaded that the oracle was meant for him after many fruitless trials instead of attempting to untie it in the usual manner drew his sword and cut it in pieces crying out that that was the only way to untie it the priest hailed the omen and declared that alexander had fulfilled the oracle  darius who now began to be more alarmed than before used all the art in his power to raise an army and encourage his forces he sent memnon into greece to invade macedon in order to make a diversion of the grecian forces but this general dying upon that expedition dariuss hopes vanished on that quarter and instead of invading the enemy he was obliged to consult for the protection of his empire at home  in the mean time alexander having lest gordion marched into paphlogonia and cappadocia which he subdued it was there he heard of memnons death the news whereof confirmed him in the resolution he had taken of marching immediately into the provinces of upper asia accordingly he advanced by hasty marches into cilicia and arrived in the country called cyruss camp from thence there is no more than fifty stadia two leagues and a half each to the pass of cilicia which is a very narrow strait through which travelers are obliged to go from cappadocia to tarsus the officer who guarded it in dariuss name had left but few soldiers in it and those fled the instant they heard of the enemys arrival upon this alexander entered the pass and after viewing very attentively the situation of the place admired his own good fortune and confessed he might have been very easily stopped and defeated there merely by the throwing of stones for not to mention that this pass was so narrow that four men completely armed could scarcely walk a breast in it the top of the mountain hung over the road which was not only strait but broke in several places by the fall of torrents from the mountains  alexander marched his whole army to the city of tarsus where it arrived the instant the persians were setting fire to that place to prevent his plundering the great riches of so flourishing a city but parmenio whom the king had sent thither with a detachment of horse arrived very seasonably to stop the progress of the fire and marched into the city which he saved the barbarians having fled the moment they heard of his arrival  through this city the cydnus runs a river not so remarkable for the breadth of its channel as for the beauty of its waters which are vastly limpid but at the same time excessively cold because of the tufted trees with which its banks are overshadowed it was now about the end of the summer which is excessively hot in cilicia and in the hottest part of the day when the king who was quite covered with sweat and dirt arriving on its banks had a mind to bathe invited by the beauty and clearness of the stream however the instant he plunged into it he was seized with so violent a shivering that all the bystanders fancied he was dying upon this he was carried to his tent after fainting away the physicians who were sensible they should be answerable for the event did not dare to hazard violent and extraordinary remedies however philip one of his physicians who had always attended upon him from his youth and loved him with the utmost tenderness not only as his sovereign but his child raising himself merely out of affection to alexander above all prudential considerations offered to give him a dose which though not very violent would nevertheless be speedy in its effects and desired three days to prepare it at this proposal every one trembled but he only whom it most concerned alexander being afflicted upon no other account than because it would keep him three days from appearing at the head of his army  whilst these things were doing alexander received a letter from parmenio who was left behind in cappadocia in whom alexander put greater confidence than in any other of his courtiers the purport of which was to bid him beware of philip his physician for that darius had bribed him by the promise of a thousand talents and his sister in marriage this letter gave him great uneasiness for he was now at full leisure to weigh all the reasons he might have to hope or fear but the considence in a physician whose sincere attachment and fidelity he had proved from his infancy soon prevailed and removed all suspicions he folded up the letter and put it under his bolster without acquainting his attendants with the contents in the mean time his physician entered with a medicine in his hand and offered the cup to alexander the hero upon this took the cup from him and holding out the letter desired the physician to read while he drank off the draught with an intrepid countenance without the least hesitation or discovering the least suspicion or uneasiness the physician as he perused the letter showed greater signs of indignation than of fear he bid him with a resolute tone harbor no uneasiness and that the recovery of his health would in a short time wipe off all suspicion in the mean time the physic wrought so violently that the symptoms seemed to strengthen parmenios accusation but at last the medicine having gained the ascendant he began to assume his accustomed vigor and in about three days he was able to show himself to his longing soldiers by whom he was equally beloved and respected  in the mean time darius was on his march filled with a vain security in the superiority of his numbers and consident not in the valor but in the splendour of his forces the plains of assyria in which he was encamped gave him an opportunity of extending his horse as he pleased and of taking the advantage which the great difference between the number of soldiers in each army gave him but instead of this he resolved to march to narrow passes where his cavalry and the multitude of his troops so far from doing him any service would only incumber each other and accordingly advanced toward the enemy for whom he should have waited and thus ran visibly on his destruction  his courtiers and attendants however whose custom it was to flatter and applaud all his actions congratulated him upon an approaching victory as if it had been certain and inevitable there was at that time in the army of darius one caridemus an athenian a man of great experience in war who personally hated alexander for having caused him to be barlished from athens darius turning to this athenian asked whether he believed him powerful enough to defeat his army caridemus who had been brought up in the bosom of liberty and forgetting that he was in a country of slavery where to oppose the inclinations of the prince is of the most dangerous consequence replied as follows permit me sir to speak truth now when only my sincerity may be of service your present splendour your prodigious numbers which have drained the east may be terrible indeed to your effeminate neighbors but can be no way dreadful to a macedonian army discipline close combat courage is all their care every single man among them is almost himself a general these men are not to be repulsed by the stones of slingers or stakes burnt at the end none but troops armed like themselves can stop their career let therefore the gold and silver which glitters in your camp be exchanged for foldiers and steel for weapons and for hearts that are able to defend you darius though naturally of a mild disposition had all his passions roused at the freedom of this mans advice he ordered him at once to be executed caridemus all the time crying out that his avenger was at hand darius too soon repented his rashness and experienced when it was too late the truth of all that had been told him  the emperor now advanced with his troops toward the river euphrates over his tent was exhibited to the view of his whole army the image of the sun in jewels while wealth and magnificence shone in every quarter of the army  first they carried silver altars on which lay fire called by them sacred and eternal and these were followed by the magi singing hymns after the manner of their country they were accompanied by three hundred and sixtyfive youths equalling the number of days in a year clothed in purple robes afterward came a chariot consecrated to jupiter drawn by white horses and followed by a courser of a prodigious size to whom they gave the name of the suns horse and the equeries were dressed in white each having a golden rod in his hand  ten chariots adorned with sculptures in gold and silver followed after then marched a body of horse composed of twelve nations whose manners and customs were various and all armed in a different manner next advanced those whom the persians called the immortals amounting to ten thousand who surpassed the rest of the barbarians in the sumptuousness of their apparel they all wore golden collars were clothed in robes of gold tissue with vestments having sleeves to them quite covered with precious stones  thirty paces from them followed those called the kings relations to the number of fifteen thousand in habits very much resembling those of women and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dress than the glitter of their arms  those called the doriphori came after they carried the kings cloak and walked before his chariot in which he seemed to sit as on a high throne this chariot was enriched on both sides with images of the gods in gold and silver and from the middle of the yoke which was covered with jewels rose two statues a cubit in height the one representing war the other peace having a golden eagle between them with wings extended as ready to take its flight  but nothing could equal the magnificence of the king he was clothed in a vest of purple striped with silver and over it a long robe glittering all over with gold and precious stones that represented two falcons rushing from the clouds and pecking at one another around his waist he wore a golden girdle after the manner of women whence his scymitar hung the scabbard of which flamed all over with gems on his head he wore a tiara or mitre round which was a fillet of blue mixed with white  on each side of him walked two hundred of his nearest relations followed by two thousand pikemen whose pikes were adorned with silver and tipped with gold and lastly thirty thousand infantry who composed the rearguard these were followed by the kings horses four hundred in number all which were led  about one hundred or an hundred and twenty paces from thence came sysigambis dariuss mother seated on a chariot and his confort on another with the several female attendants of both queens riding on horseback afterward came fifteen large chariots in which were the kings children and those who had the care of their education with a band of eunuchs who are to this day in great esteem among those nations then marched the concubines to the number of three hundred and sixty in the equipage of queens followed by six hundred mules and three hundred camels which carried the kings treasure and guarded by a great body of archers  after these came the wives of the crownofficers and of the greatest lords of the court then the sutlers and servants of the army seated also in chariots  in the rear were a body of lightarmed troops with their commanders who closed the whole march  such was the splendour of this pageant monarch he took the field encumbered with an unnecessary train of concubines attended with troops of various nations speaking different languages for their numbers impossible to be marshalled and so rich and effeminate in gold and in garments as seemed rather to invite than deter an invader  alexander after marching from tarsis arrived at bactriana from thence still earnest in coming up with his enemy he came to solae where he offered sacrifice to esculapius from thence he went forward to pyramus to malles and at last to cartabala it was here that he first received advice that darius with his whole army was encamped at sochus in assyria two days journey from cilicia he therefore resolved without delay to meet him there as the badness of the weather obliged him to halt  in the mean time darius led on his immense army into the plains of assyria which they covered to a great extent there he was advised by the grecian commanders who were in his service and who composed the strength of his army to halt as he would there have sufficient room to expand his forces and surround the invader darius rejected their advice and instead of waiting alexanders approach vainly puffed up with pride by his surrounding courtiers he resolved to pursue the invader who wished for nothing more ardently than to come to an engagement  accordingly darius having sent his treasures to damascus a city of assyria he marched with the main body of his army toward cilicia then turned short toward issus and quite ignorant of the situation of the enemy supposed he was pursuing alexander when he had actually left him in the rear there is a strange mixture of pride cruelty splendour and magnanimity in all the actions of this persian prince at issus he barbarously put to death all the greeks who were sick in that city a few soldiers only excepted whom he dismissed after having made them view every part of his camp in order to report his numbers and his strength to the invader these soldiers accordingly brought alexander word of the approach of darius and he now began to think seriously of preparing for battle  alexander fearing from the numbers of the enemy that they would attack him in his camp fortified it with a ditch and a rampart but at the same time discovered great joy to see the enemy hastening to its own destruction and preparing to attack him in a place which was but wide enough for a small army to act and move at liberty in thus the two armies were in some measure reduced to an equality the macedonians had space sufficient to employ their whole force while the persians had not room for the twentieth part of theirs  nevertheless alexander as frequently happens to the greatest captains felt some emotion when he saw that he was going to hazard all at one blow the more fortune had favored him hitherto the more he now dreaded her frowns the moment approaching which was to determine his fate but on the other side his courage revived from the reflection that the rewards of his toils exceeded the dangers of them and though he was uncertain with regard to the victory he at least hoped to die gloriously and like alexander however he did not divulge these thoughts to any one well knowing that upon the approach of a battle a general ought not to discover the least marks of sadness or perplexity and that the troops should read nothing but resolution and intrepidity in the countenance of their commander  having made his soldiers refresh themselves and ordered them to be ready for the third watch of the night which began at twelve he went to the top of a mountain and there by torchlight sacrificed after the manner of his country to the gods of the place as soon as the signal was given his army which was ready to march and fight being commanded to make great speed arrived by daybreak at the several posts assigned them but now the spies bringing word that darius was not above thirty furlongs from them the king caused his army to halt and then drew it up in battle array the peasants in the greatest terror came also and acquainted darius with the arrival of the enemy which he would not at first believe imagining as we have observed that alexander fled before him and was endeavoring to escape this news threw his troops into the utmost confusion who in their surprise ran to their arms with great precipitation and disorder  the spot where the battle was fought lay near the city of issus which the mountains bounded on one side and the sea on the other the plain that was situated between them both must have been considerably broad as the two armies encamped in it and i before observed that dariuss army was vastly numerous the river pinarius ran through the middle of this plain from the mountain to the sea and divided it very near into two equal parts the mountain formed a hollow kind of gulf the extremity of which in a curved line bounded part of the plain  alexander drew up his army in the following order he posted at the extremity of the right wing which stood near the mountains the argyraspides commanded by nicanor then the phalanx of coenus and afterward that of perdicas which terminated in the center of the main army on the extremity of the left wing he posted the phalanx of amyntas then that of ptolemy and lastly that of meleager thus the famous macedonian phalanx was formed which we find was composed of six distinct bodies each of those was headed by able generals but alexander being always generalissimo had consequently the command of the whole army the horse were placed on the two wings the macedonians with the thessalians on the right and of peloponnesians with the other allies on the left craterus commanded all the foot which composed the left wing and parmenio the whole wing alexander had reserved to himself the command of the right he had desired parmenio to keep as near the sea as possible to prevent the barbarians from surrounding him and nicanor on the contrary was ordered to keep at some distance from the mountains to keep himself out of the reach of the arrows discharged by those who were posted on them he covered the horse on his right wing with the light horse of protomachus and the poeonians and his foot with the bowmen of antiochus he reserved the agrians commanded by attalus who were greatly esteemed and some forces that were newly arrived from greece to oppose those darius had posted on the mountains  as for dariuss army it was drawn up in the following order having heard that alexander was marching toward him in battle array he commanded thirty thousand horse and twenty thousand bowmen to cross the river pinarius that he might have an opportunity to draw up his army in a commodious manner on the hither side in the center he posted the thirty thousand greeks in his service who doubtless were the flower and chief strength of his army and were not at all inferior in bravery to the macedonian phalanx with thirty thousand barbarians on their right and as many on their left the field of battle not being able to contain a greater number these were all heavily armed the rest of the infantry distinguished by their several nations were ranged behind the first line it is pity arrian does not tell us the depth of each of those two lines but it must have been prodigious if we consider the extreme narrowness of the pass and the amazing multitude of the persian forces on the mountain which lay to their left against alexanders right wing darius posted twenty thousand men who were so ranged in the several windings of the mountain that some were behind alexanders army and others before it  darius after having set his army in battle array made his horse cross the river again and dispatched the greatest part of them toward the sea against parmenio because they could fight on that spot with the greatest advantage the rest of his cavalry he sent to the left toward the mountain however finding that these would be of no service on that side because of the too great narrowness of the spot he caused a great part of them to wheel about to the right as for himself he took his post in the center of his army pursuant to the custom of the persian monarchs  the two armies being thus drawn up in order of battle alexander marched very slowly that his soldiers might take a little breath so that it was supposed they would not engage till very late for darius still continued with his army on the other side of the river in order not to lose the advantageous situation of his post and even caused such parts of the shore as were not craggy to be secured with palisadoes where the macedonians concluded that he was already afraid of being defeated the two armies being come in sight alexander riding along the ranks called by their several names the principal officers both of the macedonians and foreigners and exhorted the soldiers to signalize themselves speaking to each nation according to its peculiar genius and disposition the whole army set up a shout and eagerly desired to be led on directly against the enemy  alexander had advanced at first very slowly to prevent the ranks on the front of his phalanx from breaking and halted by intervals but when he was got within bowshot he commanded all his right wing to plunge impetuously into the river purposely that he might surprise the barbarians come sooner to a close engagement and be less exposed to the enemys arrows in all which he was very successful both sides fought with the utmost bravery and resolution and being now forced to fight close they charged both sides sword in hand when a dreadful slaughter ensued for they engaged man to man each aiming the point of his sword at the face of his opponent alexander who performed the duty both of a private soldier and of a commander wished nothing so ardently as the glory of killing with his own hand darius who being seated on a high chariot was conspicuous to the whole army and by that means was a powerful object both to encourage his own soldiers to defend and the enemy to attack him and now the battle grew more furious and bloody than before so that a great number of persian noblemen were killed each side fought with incredible bravery oxathres brother to darius observing that alexander was going to charge that monarch with the utmost vigor rushed before his chariot with the horse under his command and distinguished himself above the rest the horses that drew dariuss chariot lost all command and shook the yoke so violently that they were upon the point of overturning the king who seeing himself going to fall alive into the hands of his enemies leaped down and mounted another chariot the rest observing this fled as fast as possible and throwing down their arms made the best of their way alexander had received a slight wound in his thigh but happily it was not attended with ill consequences whilst part of the macedonian infantry posted to the right were driving the advantages they had gained against the persians the remainder of them who engaged the greeks met with greater resistance these observing that the body of infantry in question were no longer covered by the right wing of alexanders army which was pursuing the enemy came and attacked it in flank the engagement was very bloody and victory a long time doubtful the greeks endeavored to push the macedonians into the river and to recover the disorder into which the left wing had been thrown the macedonians also signalized themselves with the utmost bravery in order to preserve the advantage which alexander had just before gained and support the honor of their phalanx which had always been considered as invincible there was also a perpetual jealousy between the greeks and macedonians which greatly increased their courage and made the resistance on each side very vigorous on alexanders side ptolemy the son of seleucus lost his life with an hundred and twenty more considerable officers who all had behaved with the utmost gallantry  in the mean time the right wing which was victorious under its monarch after defeating all who opposed it wheeled to the left against those greeks who were fighting with the rest of the macedonian phalanx whom they charged very vigorously and attacking them in flank entirely routed them  at the very beginning of the engagement the persian cavalry which was in the right wing without waiting for their being attacked by the macedonians had crossed the river and rushed upon the thessalian horse several of whose squadrons they broke upon this the remainder of the latter in order to avoid the impetuosity of the first charge and oblige the persians to break their ranks made a feint of retiring as terrified by the prodigious numbers of the enemy the persians seeing this were filled with boldness and confidence and thereupon the greatest part of them advancing without order or precaution as to a certain victory had no thoughts but of pursuing the enemy upon this the thessalians seeing them in such confusion faced about on a sudden and renewed the fight with fresh ardour the persians made a brave defense till they saw darius put to flight and the greeks cut to pieces by the phalanx when they fled in the utmost disorder  with regard to darius the instant he saw his left wing broke he was one of the first who fled in his chariot but getting afterward into craggy rugged places he mounted on horseback throwing down his bow shield and royal mantle alexander however did not attempt to pursue him till he saw his phalanx had conquered the greeks and the persian horse put to flight which was of great advantage to the prince that fled  sysigambis dariuss mother and that monarchs queen who also was his sister were found remaining in the camp with two of the kings daughters his son yet a child and some persian ladies for the rest had been carried to damascus with part of dariuss treasure and all such things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court no more than three thousand talents were found in his camp but the rest of the treasure fell afterward into the hands of parmenio at the taking the city of damascus  as for the barbarians having exerted themselves with bravery enough in the first attack they afterward gave way in the most shameful manner and being intent upon nothing but saving themselves they took different ways some struck into the high road which led directly to persia others ran into woods and lonely mountains and a small number returned to their camp which the victorious enemy had already taken and plundered in this battle threescore thousand of the persian infantry and ten thousand horsemen were slain forty thousand were taken prisoners while of alexanders army there fell but two hundred and fourscore men in all  the evening after the engagement alexander invited his chief officers to a feast at which he himself presided notwithstanding he had been wounded that day in battle the festivity however had scarce begun when they were interrupted by sad lamentations from a neighboring tent which at first they considered as a fresh alarm but they were soon taught that it came from the tent in which the wife and mother of darius were kept who were expressing their sorrow for the supposed death of darius an eunuch who had seen his cloak in the hands of a soldier imagining he was killed brought them these dreadful tidings alexander however sent one of his officers to undeceive them and to inform them that the emperor was still alive the women little used to the appearance of strangers upon the arrival of the macedonian soldier imagining he was sent to put them to death threw themselves at his feet and entreated him to spare them a little while they were ready they said to die and only desired to bury darius before they should suffer the soldier assured them that he came rather to comfort than afflict them that the monarch whom they deplored was still living and he gave sysigambis his hand to raise her from the ground  the next day alexander after visiting the wounded caused the last honors to be paid to the dead in presence of the whole army drawn up in the most splendid order of battle he treated the persians of distinction in the same manner and permitted dariuss mother to bury whatever persons she pleased according to the customs and ceremonies practiced in her country after this he sent a message to the queens to inform them that he was coming to pay them a visit and accordingly commanding all his train to withdraw he entered the tent accompanied only by hephoestion who made so cautious and discreet a use of the liberty granted him that he seemed to take it not so much out of inclination as from a desire to obey the king who would have it so they were of the same age but hephoestion was taller so that the queens took him first for the king and paid him their respects as such but some captive eunuchs showing them alexander sysigambis fell prostrate before him and entreated pardon for her mistake but the king raising her from the ground assured her this his friend also was another alexander and after comforting her and her attendants took the son of darius that was yet but a child in his arms the infant without discovering the least terror stretched out his arms to the conqueror who being affected with its confidence said to hephoestion oh that darius had some share some portion of this infants generosity  this interview has done more honor to alexanders character than all the rest of his conquests the gentleness of his manners to the suppliant captives his chastity and continence when he had the power to enforce obedience were setting an example to heroes which it has been the pride of many since to imitate  after this overthrow all phoenicia the capital city of tire only excepted was yielded to the conqueror and parmenio was made governor good fortune followed him so fast that it rewarded him beyond his expectations antigonus his general in asia overthrew the capadocians paphlagonians and others lately revolted aristodemus the persian admiral was overcome at sea and a great part of his fleet taken the city of damascus also in which the treasures of darius were deposited was given up to alexander the governor of this place forgetting the duty he owed his sovereign informed alexander by letter upon a certain day that he would lead out his soldiers laden with spoil from the city as if willing to secure a retreat and these with all their wealth might be taken with a proper body of troops to intercept them alexander punctually followed the governors instruction and thus became possessed of an immense plunder besides money and plate which was afterward coined and amounted to immense sums thirty thousand men and seven thousand beasts laden with baggage were taken we find by parmenios letter to alexander that he found in damascus three hundred and twenty nine of dariuss concubines all admirably well skilled in music and also a multitude of officers whose business it was to regulate and prepare every thing relating to that monarchs entertainments  in the mean time darius having traveled on horseback the whole night struck with terror and consternation arrived in the morning at sochus where he assembled the remains of his army still however his pride would not forsake him with his fortune he wrote a letter to alexander in which he rather treated him as an inferior he commanded rather than requested that alexander would take a ransom for his mother wife and children with regard to the empire he would fight with him for it upon equal terms and bring an equal number of troops into the field to this alexander replied that he disdained all correspondence with a man whom he had already overcome that in case he appeared before him in a supplicating posture he would give up his wife and mother without ransom that he knew how to conquer and to oblige the conquered  thus coming to no issue the king marched from thence into phoenicia the citizens of byblos opening their gates to him every one submitted as he advanced but no people did this with greater pleasure than the sidonians we have seen in what manner ochus had destroyed their city eighteen years before and put all the inhabitants of it to the sword after he was returned into persia such of the citizens as upon account of their traffic or for some other cause had been absent and by that means had escaped the massacre returned thither and rebuilt their city but they had retained so violent a hatred to the persians that they were overjoyed at this opportunity of throwing off their yoke and indeed they were the first in that country who submitted to the king by their deputies in opposition to strato their king who had declared in favor of darius alexander dethroned him and permitted hephoestion to elect in his stead whomsoever of the sidonians he should judge worthy of so exalted a station  this favorite was quartered at the house of two brothers who were young and of the most considerable family in the city to these he offered the crown but they refused it telling him that according to the laws of their country no person could ascend the throne unless he were of the blood royal hephoestion admiring this greatness of soul which could contemn what others strive to obtain by fire and sword continue says he to them in this way of thinking you who before were sensible that it is much more glorious to refuse a diadem than to accept it however name me some person of the royal family who may remember when he is king that it was you set the crown on his head the brothers observing that several through excessive ambition aspired to this high station and to obtain it paid a servile court to alexanders favorites declared that they did not know any person more worthy of the diadem than one abdolonymus descended though at a great distance from the royal line but who at the same time was so poor that he was obliged to get his bread by day labor in a garden without the city his honesty and integrity had reduced him as well as many more to such extreme poverty solely intent upon his labor he did not hear the clashing of the arms which had shaken all asia  immediately the two brothers went in search of abdolonymus with the royal garments and found him weeding in his garden when they saluted him king abdolonymus looked upon the whole as a dream and unable to guess the meaning of it asked if they were not ashamed to ridicule him in that manner but as he made a greater resistance than suited their inclinations they themselves washed him and threw over his shoulders a purple robe richly embroidered with gold then after repeated oaths of their being in earnest they conducted him to the palace  the news of this was immediately spread over the whole city most of the inhabitants were overjoyed at it but some murmured especially the rich who despising abdolonymuss former abject state could not forbear showing their resentment upon that account in the kings court alexander commanded the newelected prince to be sent for and after surveying him attentively a long time he spoke thus thy air and mien do not contradict what is related of thy extraction but i should be glad to know with what frame of mind thou did bear thy poverty would to the gods replied he that i may bear this crown with equal patience these hands have procured me all i desired and whilst i possessed nothing i wanted nothing this answer gave alexander an high idea of abdolonymuss virtue so that he presented him not only with the rich furniture which had belonged to strato and part of the persian plunder but likewise annexed one of the neighboring provinces to his dominions  syria and phoenicia were already subdued by the macedonians the city of tire excepted this city was justly entitled the queen of the sea that element bringing to it the tribute of all nations she boasted her having first invented navigation and taught mankind the art of braving the winds and waves by the assistance of a frail bark the happy situation of tire the convenience and extent of its ports the character of its inhabitants who were industrious laborious patient and extremely courteous to strangers invited thither merchants from all parts of the globe so that it might be considered not so much as a city belonging to any particular nation as the common city of all nations and the center of their commerce  alexander thought it necessary both for his pride and his interest to take this city the spring was now coming on tire was at that time seated in an island of the sea about a quarter of a league from the continent it was surrounded with a strong wall an hundred and fifty feet high which the waves of the sea washed and the carthaginians a colony from tire a mighty people and sovereigns of the ocean whose ambassadors were at that time in the city offering to hercules according to ancient custom an annual sacrifice had engaged themselves to succor the tyrians it was this made them so haughty firmly determined not to surrender they fix machines on the ramparts and on the towers arm their young men and build workhouses for the artificers of whom there were great numbers in the city so that every part resounded with the noise of warlike preparations they likewise cast iron grapples to throw on the enemys works and tear them away as also cramp irons and such like instruments formed for the defense of cities so many difficulties opposing such a hazardous design and so many reasons should have made alexander decline the siege  it was impossible to come near this city in order to storm it without making a bank which would reach from the continent to the island and an attempt of this kind would be attended with difficulties that were seemingly insurmountable the little arm of the sea which separated the island from the continent was exposed to the west wind which often raised such dreadful storms there that the waves would in an instant sweep away all works besides as the city was surrounded on all sides by the sea there was no fixing scaling ladders nor throwing up batteries but at a distance in the ships and the wall which projected into the sea toward the lower part prevented people from landing not to mention that the military engines which might have been put on board the galleys could not do much execution the waves were so very tumultuous  these obstacles however by no means retarded the enterprizing resolutions of alexander but willing to gain a place rather by treaty than by the sword he sent heralds into the place proposing a peace between the tyrians and him the citizens however a tumultuous ungovernable body instead of listening to his proposals instead of endeavoring to avert his resentment contrary to the law of nations killed his heralds and threw them from the top of the walls into the sea this outrage inflamed alexanders passions to the highest degree he resolved upon the citys destruction and sat down before it with persevering resentment his first endeavor was to form a pier jutting from the continent and reaching to the city which was built upon an island from the foundations of an ancient city upon the shore he dug stones and rubbish from mount lebanus that hung over the city he cut down cedars that served for piles and thus he began his work without interruption but the farther they went from shore the greater difficulties they met with because the sea was deeper and the workmen were much annoyed by the darts discharged from the top of the walls the enemy also who were masters at sea coming in great boats prevented the macedonians from carrying on their work with vigor at last however the pile appeared above water a level of considerable breadth then the besieged at last perceived their rashness they saw with terror the vastness of the work which the sea had till then kept from their sight and now began to attack the workmen with javelins and wound them at a distance it was therefore resolved that skins and sails should be spread to cover the workmen and that two wooden towers should be raised at the head of the bank to prevent the approaches of the enemy yet these were burned soon after by the besieged together with all the woodwork composing the pile that could be touched by the fire  alexander though he saw most of his designs defeated and his works demolished was not at all dejected upon that account his soldiers endeavored with redoubled vigor to repair the ruins of the bank and made and planted new machines with such prodigious speed as quite astonished the enemy alexander himself was present on all occasions and superintended every part of the works his presence and great abilities advanced these still more than the multitude of hands employed in them the whole was near finished and brought almost to the wall of the city when there arose on a sudden an impetuous wind which drove the waves with so much fury against the mole that the cement and other things that barred it gave way and the water rushing through the stones broke it in the middle as soon as the great heap of stones which supported the earth was thrown down the whole sunk at once as into an abyss  any warrior but alexander would that instant have quite laid aside his enterprise and indeed he himself debated whether he should not raise the siege but a superior power who had foretold and sworn the ruin of tire and whose orders this prince only executed prompted him to continue the siege and dispelling all his fear and anxiety inspired him with courage and confidence and fired the breasts of his whole army with the same sentiments for now the soldiers as if but that moment arrived before the city forgetting all the toils they had undergone began to raise a new mole at which they worked incessantly  in the mean time alexander being convinced that while the enemy remained masters at sea the city could not be taken with great diligence procured a fleet from various parts and embarking himself with some soldiers from among his guard he set sail toward the tyrian fleet forming a line of battle the tyrians were at first determined to oppose him openly but perceiving the superiority of his forces they kept all the galleys in their harbor to prevent the enemy from entering there alexander therefore was contented to draw up his ships near the bank along the shore where they rode in safety and kept the enemy from annoying his workmen who were employed upon the bank  the besiegers thus protected went on with great vigor the workmen threw into the sea whole trees with all their branches on them and laid great stones over these on which they put other trees and the latter they covered with clay which served instead of mortar afterward heaping more trees and stones on these the whole thus joined together formed one entire body this bank was made wider than the former ones in order that the towers that were built in the middle might be out of the reach of such arrows as should be shot from those ships which might attempt to break down the edges of the bank thus after many delays the patience of the workmen surmounting every obstacle it was at last finished in its utmost perfection the macedonians placed military engines of all kinds on the bank in order to shake the walls with batteringrams and hurl on the besieged arrows stones and burning torches thus by degrees approaching to the foot of the wall the tyrians were attacked in close combat and invested on all sides both by sea and land  a general attack was now therefore thought necessary and the king manning his galleys which he had joined to each other ordered them to approach the walls about midnight and attack the city with resolution the tyrians now gave themselves over for lost when on a sudden the sky was overspread with such thick clouds as quite took away the faint glimmerings of light which before darted through the gloom the sea rose by insensible degrees and the billows being swelled by the fury of the winds increased to a dreadful storm the vessels dashed one against the other with so much violence that the cables which before fastened them together were either loosened or broke to pieces the planks split and making a horrible crash carried off the soldiers with them for the tempest was so furious that it was not possible to manage or steer the galleys thus fastened together at last however they brought them near the shore but the greatest part were in ashattered condition  this good fortune of the tyrians was counterbalanced by an unexpected calamity they had long expected succors from carthage a flourishing colony of their own but they now received advice from thence that the carthaginians were absolutely unable to give them any assistance being overawed themselves by a powerful army of syracusans who were laying waste their country the tyrians therefore frustrated in their hopes still maintained their resolution of defending themselves to the last extremity and accordingly sent off their women and children to carthage as being of no use in the defense of their city  and now the engines playing the city was warmly attacked on all sides and as vigorously defended the besieged taught and animated by imminent danger and the extreme necessity to which they were reduced invented daily new arts to defend themselves and repulse the enemy they warded off all the darts discharged from the balistas against them by the assistance of turningwheels which either broke them to pieces or carried them another way they deadened the violence of the stones that were hurled at them by setting up a kind of sails and curtains made of a soft substance which easily gave way to annoy the ships which advanced against their walls they fixed grappling irons and scythes to joists or beams then straining their catapultas an enormous kind of crossbow they laid those great pieces of timber upon them instead of arrows and shot them off on a sudden at the enemy these crushed some to pieces by their great weight and the hooks or pensile scythes with which they were armed tore others to pieces and did considerable damage to their ships they also had brazen shields which they drew redhot out of the fire and filling these with burning sand hurled them in an instant from the top of the wall upon the enemy there was nothing the macedonians so much dreaded as this last invention for the moment this burning sand got to the flesh through the crevices in the armor it pierced to the very bone and stuck so close that there was no pulling it off so that the soldiers throwing down their arms and tearing their clothes to pieces were in this manner exposed naked and defenseless to the shot of the enemy it was now thought that alexander quite discouraged with his loss was determined to relinquish the siege but he resolved to make a last effort with a great number of ships which he manned with the flower of his army accordingly a second naval engagement was fought in which the tyrians after fighting with intrepidity were obliged to draw off their whole fleet toward the city the king pursued their rear very close but was not able to enter the harbor being repulsed by arrows shot from the walls however he either took or sunk a great number of their ships  both the attack and defense were now more vigorous than ever the courage of the combatants increased with the danger and each side animated by the most powerful motives fought like lions wherever the batteringrams had beat down any part of the wall and the bridges were thrown out instantly the argyraspides mounted the breach with the utmost valor being headed by admetus one of the bravest officers in the army who was killed by the thrust of a spear as he was encouraging his soldiers the presence of the king and especially the example he set fired his troops with unusual bravery he himself ascended one of the towers which was of a prodigious height and there was exposed to the greatest dangers his courage had ever made him hazard for being immediately known by his insignia and the richness of his armor he served as a mark for all the arrows of the enemy on this occasion he performed wonders killing with javelins several of those who defended the wall then advancing nearer to them he forced some with his sword and others with his shield either into the city or the sea the tower where he fought almost touching the wall he soon ascended the wall by the assistance of floating bridges and followed by the principal officers possessed himself of two towers and the space between them the batteringrams had already made several breaches the fleet had forced into the harbor and some of the macedonians had possessed themselves of the towers which were abandoned the tyrians seeing the enemy master of their rampart retired toward an open place called agenor and there stood their ground but alexander marching up with his regiment of bodyguards killed part of them and obliged the rest to fly at the same time tire being taken on that side which lay toward the harbor the macedonians ran up and down every part of the city sparing no person who came in their way being highly exasperated at the long resistance of the besieged and the barbarities they had exercised toward some of their comrades who had been taken in their return to sidon and thrown from the battlements after their throats had been cut in the sight of the whole army the tyrians thus reduced to the last extremity shut themselves up in their houses to avoid the sword of the conqueror others rushed into the midst of the enemy to sell their lives as dearly as they could and some threw stones from the tops of the houses to crush the sailors below the old men waited at their doors expecting every instant to be sacrificed from the rage of the soldiers in this general carnage the sidonian soldiers alone that were in alexanders army seemed touched with pity for the fate of their wretched inhabitants they gave protection to many of the tyrians whom they considered as countrymen and carried great numbers of them privately on board their ships the numbers that were thus slaughtered by the enraged soldiers were incredible even after conquest the victors resentment did not subside he ordered no less than two thousand men that were taken in the storm to be nailed to crosses along the shore the number of prisoners amounted to thirty thousand and were all sold as slaves in different parts of the world thus fell tire that had been for many ages the most flourishing city in the world and had spread the arts of commerce into the remotest regions  whilst alexander was carrying on the siege of tire he received a second letter from darius in which that monarch seemed more sensible of his power than before he now gave him the title of king and offered him ten thousand talents as a ransom for his captive mother and wife he offered him his daughter statira in marriage with all the country he had conquered as far as the river euphrates he hinted to him the inconstancy of fortune and described at large the powers he was still possessed of to oppose these terms were so considerable that when the king debated upon them in council parmenio one of his generals could not help observing that if he were alexander he would agree to such a proposal to which alexander nobly replied and so would i were i parmenio he therefore treated the proposals of darius with haughty contempt and refused to accept of treasures which he already considered as his own from tire alexander marched to jerusalem fully resolved to punish that city for having refused to supply his army with provisions during the late siege but the resentment of the conqueror was averted by meeting a procession of the inhabitants of that city on his way marching out to receive him dressed in white with a jewish high priest before them with a mitre on his head on the front of which the name of god was written the moment the king perceived the high priest he advanced toward him with an air of the most profound respect bowed his body adored the august name upon his front and saluted him who wore it with religious veneration then the jews surrounding alexander raised their voices to wish him every kind of prosperity all the spectators were seized with inexpressible surprise they could scarce believe their eyes and did not know how to account for a sight so contrary to their expectation and so vastly improbable  parmenio who could not yet recover from his astonishment asked the king how it came to pass that he who was adored by every one adored the high priest of the jews i do not replied alexander adore the high priest but the god whose minister he is for whilst i was at dia in macedonia my mind wholly fixed on the great design of the persian ar as i was revolving the methods how to conquer asia this very man dressed in the same robes appeared to me in a dream exhorted me to banish my fear bade me cross the hellespont boldly and assured me that god would march at the head of my army and give me the victory over that of the persians this speech delivered with an air of sincerity no doubt had its effect in encouraging the army and establishing an opinion that alexanders mission was from heaven alexander having embraced the high priest was conducted by him to the temple where after he had explained to him many prophecies in different parts of the old testament concerning his invasion he taught him to offer up a sacrifice in the jewish manner  alexander was so much pleased with his reception upon this occasion that before he left jerusalem he assembled the jews and bade them ask any favor they should think proper their request was to be allowed to live according to their ancient laws and maxims to be exempted from tribute every seventh year as they were by their laws exempted from labor and could consequently have no harvests they requested that such of their brethren as were settled in asia should be indulged in the same privileges thus being gratified in all their desires great numbers of them offered to enlist themselves in his army soon after the samaritans demanded the same favors but he gave them an evasive answer and promised to take the matter into consideration upon his return  from this city he went on to gaza where he found a more obstinate resistance than he had expected but at length taking the town by storm and having cut the garrison consisting of ten thousand men to pieces with brutal ferocity he ordered boetis the governor to be brought before him and having in vain endeavored to intimidate him commanded at last that holes should be bored through his heels and thus to be tied by cords to the back of his chariot and in this manner to be dragged round the walls of the city this he did in imitation of achilles whom homer describes as having dragged hector round the walls of troy in the same manner but it was reading the poet to very little advantage to imitate his hero in the most unworthy part of his character  as soon as alexander had ended the siege of gaza he left a garrison there and turned the whole power of his arms toward egypt in seven days march he arrived before pelusium whither a great number of egyptians had assembled with all imaginable diligence to own him for their sovereign being heartily displeased with the persian government as likewise the persian governors as the one destroyed their liberty the other ridiculed their religion masaeus the persian governor who commanded in memphis finding it would be to no purpose for him to resist so triumphant an army and that darius his sovereign was not in a condition to succor him set open the gates of the city to the conqueror and gave up eight hundred talents about one hundred and forty thousand pounds and all the kings furniture thus alexander possessed himself of all egypt without meeting with the least opposition  he now therefore formed a design of visiting the temple of jupiter this temple was situated at a distance of twelve days journey from memphis in the midst of the sandy deserts of lybia alexander having read in homer and other fabulous authors of antiquity that most of the heroes were represented as the sons of some deity was willing himself to pass for a hero and knew that he could bribe the priests to compliment him as of celestial origin setting out therefore along the river memphis and after having passed canopus opposite the island of pharos he there laid the foundation of the city of alexandria which in a little time became one of the most flourishing towns for commerce in the world from thence he had a journey of three hundred and forty miles to the temple of jupiter the way leading through inhospitable deserts and plains of sand the soldiers were patient enough for the two first days march before they arrived amidst the dreadful solitudes but as soon as they found themselves in vast plains covered with sands of a prodigious depth they were greatly terrified surrounded as with a sea they gazed round as far as their sight could extend to discover if possible some place that was inhabited but all in vain for they could not perceive so much as a single tree nor the least footsteps of any land that had been cultivated to increase their calamity the water that they had brought in goat skins upon camels now failed and there was not so much as a single drop in all that sandy desert they were however greatly refreshed by the accidental falling of a shower which served to encourage them in their progress till they came to the temple of the deity nothing can be more fanciful than the description the historians have given us of this gloomy retreat it is represented as a small spot of fertile ground in the midst of vast solitudes of sand it is covered with the thickest trees that exclude the rays of the sun and watered with several springs which preserved it in perpetual verdure near the grove where the temple stood was the fountain of the sun which at daybreak was lukewarm at noon cold then toward evening insensibly grew warmer and was boiling hot at midnight the god worshipped in this place had his statue made of emeralds and other precious stones and from the head to the navel resembled a ram no sooner had alexander appeared before the altar than the high priest declared him to be the son of jupiter the conqueror quite intoxicated with adulation asked whether he should have success in his expedition the priest answered that he should be monarch of the world the conqueror enquired if his fathers murderers were punished the priest replied that his father jupiter was immortal but that the murderers of philip had been all extirpated  alexander having ended his sacrifice and rewarded the priests who had been so liberal of their titles from that time supposed himself or would have it supposed that he was the son of jupiter upon his return from the temple and during his stay in egypt he settled the government of that country upon the most solid foundation he divided it into districts over each of which he appointed a lieutenant who received orders from himself alone and thus having settled affairs there he set out in the beginning of spring to march against darius who was now preparing to oppose him he made some stay at tire to settle the various affairs of the countries he had left behind and advanced toward new conquests on his march the wife of darius died in childbed and wa honored with a funeral ceremony due to he exalted character he continued his journey toward the tygris where he at last expected to come up with the enemy and to strik one blow which should decide the fate o nations  darius had already made overtures of peace to him twice but finding at last that there were no hopes of their concluding one unless he resigned the whole empire to him prepared himself again for battle for this purpose he assembled in babylon an army half as numerous again as that at issus and marched it toward nineveh his forces covered all the plains of mesopotamia advice being brought that the enemy was not far off he caused satropates colonel of the cavalry to advance at the head of a thousand chosen horse and likewise gave six thousand to masaeus governor of the province all whom were to prevent alexander from crossing the river and to lay waste the country through which that monarch was to pass but he arrived too late  the tygris is the most rapid river of all the east and it was with some difficulty that alexanders soldiers were able to stem the current carrying their arms over their heads the king walked on foot among the infantry and pointed out with his hand the passage to his soldiers he commanded them with a loud voice to save nothing but their arms and let their baggage that retarded them in the water float away with the stream at length they were drawn up in battlearray on the opposite shore and encamped two days near the river still prepared for action an eclipse of the moon which happened about that time gave alexanders soldiers great uneasiness but he brought forward some egyptian soothsayers who assured the army that the moon portended calamities not to the greeks but the persians by this artifice the hopes and the courage of the soldiers being revived once more the king led them on to meet the enemy and began his march at midnight on his right hand lay the tygris and on his left the gordylean mountains at break of day news was brought that darius was but twenty miles from the place they then were all things now therefore threatened an approaching battle when darius who had already twice sued for peace sent new conditions still more advantageous than the former but alexander refused his offers proudly replying that the world would not permit two suns nor two sovereigns thus all negotiation being at an end both sides prepared for battle equally irritated and equally ambitious darius pitched his camp near a village called gangamila and the river bumila in a plain at a considerable distance from arbela he had before levelled the spot which he pitched upon for the field of battle in order that his chariots and cavalry might have full room to move in that his fighting in the streights of cilicia had lost him the battle fought there  alexander upon hearing this news continued four days in the place he then was to rest his army and surrounded his camp with trenches and pallisadoes for he was determined to leave all his baggage and the useless soldiers in it and march the remainder against the enemy with no other equipage than the arms they carried accordingly he set out about nine in the evening in order to fight darius at day break who upon this advice had drawn up his army in order of battle alexander also marched in battlearray for both armies were within two or three leagues of each other when he was arrived at the mountains where he could discover the enemys army he halted and having assembled his general officers as well macedonians as foreigners he debated whether they should engage immediately or pitch their camp in that place the latter opinion being followed because it was judged proper for them to view the field of battle and the manner in which the enemy was drawn up the army encamped in the same order in which it had marched during which alexander at the head of his infantry lightly armed and his royal regiments marched round the plain in which the battle was to be fought  being returned he assembled his general officers a second time and told them that there was no occasion for making a speech because their courage and great actions were alone sufficient to excite them to glory and he desired them only to represent to the soldiers that they were not to fight on this occasion for phoenicia or egypt but for all asia which would be possessed by him who should conquer and tha after having gone through so many provinces and left behind them so great a number of rivers and mountains they could secure their retreat no otherwise than by gaining a complea victory after this speech he ordered them to take some repose  it is said parmenio advised him to attack the enemy in the night time alleging that they might easily be defeated if fallen upon by surprise and in the dark but the king answered so loud that all present might hear him tha it did not become alexander to steal a victory and therefore he was resolved to fight and conquer in broad day light this was a haughty but at the same time a prudent answer for it was running great hazard to fall upon so numerous an army in the night time and in an unknown country darius fearing he should be attacked at unawares because he had not entrenched himself obliged his soldiers to continue the whole night under arms which proved of the highest prejudice to him in the engagement in the mean time alexander went to bed to repose himself the remaining part of the night as he revolved in his mind not without some emotion the consequence of the battle which was upon the point of being fought he could not sleep immediately but his body being oppressed in a manner by the anxiety of his mind he slept soundly the whole night contrary to his usual custom so that when his generals were assembled at daybreak before his tent to receive his orders they were greatly surprised to find he was not awake upon which they themselves commanded the soldiers to take some refreshment parmenio having at last awaked him and seeming surprised to sind him in so calm and sweet a sleep just as he was going to fight a battle in which his whole fortune lay at stake how could it be possible said alexander for me not to be calm since the enemy is coming to deliver himself into my hands upon this he immediately took up his arms mounted his horse and rode up and down the ranks exhorting the troops to behave gallantly and if possible to surpass theirancient fame and the glory they had hitherto acquired  there was a great difference between the two armies in respect to numbers but much more with regard to courage that of darius consisted at least of six hundred thousand foot and forty thousand horse and the other of no more than forty thousand foot and seven or eight thousand horse but the latter was all fire and strength whereas on the side of the persians it was a prodigious assemblage of men not of soldiers an empty phantom rather than a real army both sides were disposed in very near the same array the forces were drawn up in two lines the cavalry on the two wings and the infantry in the middle the one and the other being under the particular conduct of the chiefs of each of the different nations that composed them and commanded in general by the principal crown officers the front of the battle under darius was covered with two hundred chariots armed with scythes and with fifteen elephants that king taking his post in the center of the first line besides the guards which were the flower of his forces he also had fortified himself with the grecian infantry whom he had drawn up near his person believing this body only capable of opposing the macedonian phalanx as his army spread over a much greater space of ground than that of the enemy he intended to surround and to charge them at one and the same time both in front and flank which from alexanders disposition he soon after found impossible  darius being afraid lest the macedonians should draw him from the spot of ground he had levelled and carry him into another that was rough and uneven commanded the cavalry in his left wing which spread much farther than that of the enemys right to march directly forward and wheel about upon the macedonians in flank to prevent them from extending their troops farther upon which alexander dispatched against them the body of horse in his service commanded by menidas but as these were not able to make head against the enemy because of their prodigious numbers he reinforced them with the paeonians whom aretas commanded and with the foreign cavalry besides the advantage of numbers the persians had that also of coats of mail which secured themselves and their horses much more and by which alexanders cavalry was prodigiously annoyed however the macedonians marched to the charge with great bravery and at last put the enemy to flight  upon this the persians opposed the chariots armed with scythes against the macedonian phalanx in order to break it but with little success the noise which the soldiers who were lightly armed made by striking their swords against their bucklers and the arrows which flew on all sides frighted the horses and made a great number of them turn back against their own troops others laying hold of the horses bridles pulled the riders down and cut them to pieces part of the chariots drove between the battalions which opened to make way for them as they had been ordered to do by which means they did little or no execution  alexander seeing darius set his whole army in motion in order to charge him employed a stratagem to encourage his soldiers when the battle was at the hottest and the macedonians were in the greatest danger aristander the soothsayer clothed in his white robes holding a branch of laurel in his hand advances among the combatants as he had been instructed by the king and crying that he saw an eagle hovering over alexanders head a sure omen of victory he showed with his finger the pretended bird to the soldiers who relying upon the sincerity of the soothsayer fancied they also saw it and thereupon renewed the attack with greater cheerfulness and ardour than ever alexander now pressed to the place in which darius was stationed and the presence of the two opposing kings inspired both sides with vigor darius was mounted on a chariot and alexander on horseback both surrounded with their bravest officers and soldiers whose only endeavors were to save the lives of their respective princes at the hazard of their own the battle was obstinate and bloody alexander having wounded dariuss equerry with a javelin the persians as well as macedonians imagined that the king was killed upon which the former breaking aloud into the most dismal sounds the whole army was seized with the greatest consternation the relations of darius who were at his left hand fled away with the guards and so abandoned the chariot but those who were at his right took him into the center of their body historians relate that this prince having drawn his scymetar reflected whether he ought not to lay violent hands upon himself rather than fly in an ignominious manner but perceiving from his chariot that his soldiers still fought he was ashamed to forsake them and as divided between hope and despair the persians retired insensibly and thinned their ranks when it could no longer be called a battle but a slaughter then darius turning about his chariot fled with the rest and the conqueror was now wholly employed in pursuing him but in the mean time finding that the left wing of his army which was commanded by parmenio was in great danger alexander was obliged to desist from pursuing darius whom he had almost overtaken and wheeled round to attack the persian horse that after plundering the camp were retiring in good order them he cut in pieces and the scale of battle turning in favor of the macedonians a total rout of the persians ensued the pursuit was warm and the slaughter amazing alexander rode as far as arbela after darius every moment hoping to come up with that monarch he had just passed through when alexander arrived but he left his treasure with his bow and shield as a prey to the enemy  such was the success of this famous battle which gave empire to the conqueror according to arrian the persians lost three hundred thousand men besides those who were taken prisoners which at least is a proof that the loss was very great on their side that of alexanders was very inconsiderable he not losing according to the last mentioned author above twelve hundred men most of whom were horse this engagement was fought in the month of october about the same time that two years before the battle of isus was fought as gangamela in assyria the spot where the two armies engaged was a small place of very little note this was called the battle of arbela that city being nearest to the field of battle  darius after this dreadful defeat rode toward the river lycus with a very few attendants he was advised to break down the bridges to secure his retreat but he refused saying he would not save his life at the expense of thousands of his subjects after riding a great number of miles full speed he arrived at midnight at arbela from thence he fled toward media over the armenian mountains followed by his satraps and a few of his guards expecting the worst despairing of fortune a wretched survivor of his countrys ruin  in the mean time alexander approached near babylon and mazaeus the governor who had retired thither after the battle of arbela surrendered it to him without striking a blow alexander therefore entered the city at the head of his whole army as if he had been marching to a battle the walls of babylon were lined with people notwithstanding the greatest part of the citizens were gone out before from the impatient desire they had to see their new sovereign whose renown had far outstripped his march bagophanes governor of the fortress and guardian of the treasure unwilling to discover less zeal than mazaeus strewed the streets with flowers and raised on both sides of the way silver altars which smoaked not only with frankincense but the most fragrant perfumes of every kind last of all came the presents which were to be made to the king viz herds of cattle and a great number of horses as also lions and panthers which were carried in cages after these the magi walked singing hymns after the manner of their country then the chaldeans accompanied by the babylonish soothsayers and musicians the rear was brought up by the babylonish cavalry of which both men and horses were so sumptuous that imagination can scarce reach their magnificence the king caused the people to walk after the infantry and himself surrounded with his guards and seated on a chariot entered the city and from thence rode to the palace as in a kind of triumph the next day he took a view of all dariuss money and movables which amounted to incredible sums and which he distributed with generosity among his soldiers he gave the government of the province to mazaeus and the command of the forces he left there to apollodorus of amphipolis  from rabylon alexander marched to the province of syraceni afterward to susa where he arrived after a march of twenty days and found treasures to an infinite amount these also he applied to the purposes of rewarding merit and courage among his troops in this city he left the mother and children of darius and from thence he went forward till he came to a river called pasitigris having crossed it with nine thousand foot and three thousand horse consisting of agrians as well as of grecian mercenaries and a reinforcement of three thousand thracians he entered the country of uxii this region lies near susa and extends to the frontiers of persia a narrow pass only lying between it and susiana madathes commanded this province he was not a timeserver nor a follower of fortune but faithful to his sovereign he resolved to hold out to the last extremity and for this purpose had withdrawn into his own city which stood in the midst of craggy rocks and was surrounded with precipices having been forced from thence he retired into the citadel whence the besieged sent thirty deputies to alexander to sue for quarter which they obtained at last by the interposition of sysigambis the king not only pardoned madathes who was a near relation of that princess but likewise set all the captives and those who had surrendered themselves at liberty permitted them to enjoy their several rights and privileges would not suffer the city to be plundered but let them plough their lands without paying any tribute from thence he passed on to the pass of susa defended by mountains almost inaccessible and by ariobarzanes with a body of five thousand men he there stopped for a while but being led by a different rout among the mountains he came over the pass and so cut the army that defended it in pieces  alexander from an effect of the good fortune which constantly attended him in all his undertakings having extricated himself happily out of the danger to which he was so lately exposed marched immediately toward persia being on the road he received letters from tiridates governor of persepolis which informed him that the inhabitants of that city upon the report of his advancing toward him were determined to plunder dariuss treasures with which he was entrusted and therefore that it was necessary for him to make all the haste imaginable to seize them himself that he had only the araxes to cross after which the road was smooth and easy alexander upon this news leaving his infantry behind marched the whole night at the head of his cavalry who were very much harrassed by the length and swiftness of his march and passed the araxes on a bridge which by his order had been but some days before  but as he drew near the city he perceived a large body of men who exhibited a memorable example of the greatest misery these were about four thousand greeks very far advanced in years who having been made prisoners of war had suffered all the torments which the persian tyranny could inflict the hands of some had been cut off the feet of others and others again had lost their noses and ears they appeared like so many shadows rather than like men speech being almost the only thing by which they were known to be such alexander could not refrain from tears at this sight and as they irresistably brought him to commiserate their condition he bade them with the utmost tenderness not to despond and assured them that they should again see their wives and country they chose however to remain in a place where misfortune now became habitual wherefore he rewarded them liberally for their sufferings and commanded the governor of the province to treat them with mildness and respect the day following he entered the city of persepolis at the head of his victorious soldiers who though the inhabitants made no resistance began to cut in pieces all those who still remained in the city however the king soon put an end to the massacre and forbid his soldiers further violence the riches he had found in other places were but trifling when compared to those he found here this however did not save the city for being one day at a banquet among his friends and happening to drink to excess the conversation ran upon the various cruelties exercised by the persians in greece particularly at athens thais an athenian courtezan urged the pusillanimity of not taking revenge for such repeated slaughters all the guests applauded the discourse when immediately the king rose from table his head being crowned with flowers and taking a torch in his hand he advanced forward to execute his mad exploit the whole company followed him breaking into loud acclamations and after singing and dancing surrounded the palace all the rest of the macedonians at this noise ran in crowds with lighted tapers and set fire to every part of it however alexander was sorry not long after for what he had done and thereupon gave orders for extinguishing the fire but it was too late  while alexander was thus triumphing in all the exultation of success the wretched darius was by this time arrived at ecbatana the capital of media there remained still with this fugitive prince thirty thousand foot among whom were four thousand greeks that were faithful to him to the last besides these he had four thousand slingers and upwards of three thousand bactrian horse whom bessus their governor commanded darius even with so small a force still conceived hopes of opposing his rival or at least of protracting the war but he was surrounded with traitors his want of success had turned all mankind against him but nabarzanes one of the greatest lords of persia and general of the horse had conspired with bessus general of the bactrians to commit the blackest of all crimes and that was to seize upon the person of the king and lay him in chains which they might easily do as each of them had a great number of soldiers under his command their design was if alexander should pursue them to secure themselves by giving up darius alive into his hands and in case they escaped to murder that prince and afterward usurp his crown and begin a new war these traitors soon won over the troops by representing to them that they were going to their destruction that they would soon be crushed under the ruins of an empire which was just ready to fall at the same time that bactriana was open to them and offered them immense riches these promises soon prevailed upon the perfidious army the traitors seized and bound their monarch in chains of gold under the appearance of honor as he was a king then enclosing him in a covered chariot they set out toward bactriana in this manner they carried him with the utmost dispatch until being informed that the grecian army was still hotly pursuing them they found it impossible either to conciliate the friendship of alexander or to secure a throne for themselves they therefore once more gave darius his liberty and desired him to make the best of his escape with them from the conqueror but he replied that the gods were ready to revenge the evils he had already suffered and appealing to alexander for justice refused to follow a band of traitors at these words they fell into the utmost fury thrusting him with their darts and their spears and left him to linger in this manner unattended the remains of his wretched life the traitors then made their escape different ways while the victorious macedonians at length coming up found darius in a solitude lying in his chariot and drawing near his end however he had strength enough before he died to call for drink which a macedonian polystratus by name brought him he had a persian prisoner whom he employed as his interpreter darius after drinking the liquor that had been given him turned to the macedonian and said that in the deplorable state to which he was reduced he however should have the comfort to speak to one who could understand him and that his last words would not be lost he therefore charged him to tell alexander that he had died in his debt that he gave him many thanks for the great humanity he had exercised toward his mother his wife and his children whose lives he had not only spared but restored to their former splendour that he besought the gods to give victory to his arms and make him monarch of the universe that he thought he need not entreat him to revenge the execrable murder committed on his person as this was the common cause of kings  after this taking polystratus by the hand give him said he thy hand as i give thee mine and carry him in my name the only pledge i am able to give of my gratitude and affections saying these words he breathed his last  alexander coming up a moment after and seeing dariuss body he wept bitterly and by the strongest testimonies of affection that could be given proved how intimately he was affected with the unhappiness of a prince who deserved a better fate he immediately pulled off his military cloak and threw it on dariuss body then causing it to be embalmed and his coffin to be adorned with royal magnificence he sent it to sysigambis to be interred with the honors usually paid to the deceased persian monarchs and entombed with his ancestors thus died darius in the fiftieth year of his age six of which he reigned with felicity in him the persian empire ended after having existed from the time of cyrus the great a period of two hundred and ninetynine years  the death of darius only served to inflame the spirit of ambition in alexander to pursue further conquests after having in vain attempted to pursue bessus who now assumed the name of king he desisted in order to cross parthia and in three days arrived on the frontiers of hyrcania which submitted to his arms he afterward subdued the mandii the arii the drangae the arachosii and several other nations into which his army marched with greater speed than people generally travel he frequently would pursue an enemy for whole days and nights together almost without suffering his troops to take any rest by this prodigious rapidity he came unawares upon nations who thought him at a great distance and subdued them before they had time to put themselves in a posture of defense  it was upon one of these excursions that thalestris queen of the amazons came to pay him a visit a violent desire of seeing alexander had prompted that princess to leave her dominions and travel through a great number of countries to gratify her curiosity being come pretty near his camp she sent word that a queen was come to visit him and that she had a prodigious inclination to cultivate his acquaintance and accordingly was arrived within a little distance from that place alexander having returned a favorable answer she commanded her train to stop and herself came forward with three hundred women and the moment she perceived the king she leaped from her horse having two lances in her right hand she looked upon the king without discovering the least sign of admiration and surveying him attentively did not think his stature answerable to his fame for the barbarians are very much struck with a majestic air and think those only capable of mighty achievements on whom nature has bestowed bodily advantages she did not scruple to tell him that the chief motive of her journey was to have posterity by him adding that she was worthy of giving heirs to his empire alexander upon this request was obliged to make some stay in this place after which thalestris returned to her kingdom and the king into the province inhabited by the parthians  alexander now enjoying a little repose abandones himself to sensuality and he whom the arms of the persians could not conquer fell a victim to their vices nothing was now to be seen but games parties of pleasure women and excessive feasting in which he used to revel whole days and nights not satisfied with the buffoons and the performers on instrumental music whom he had brought with him out of greece he obliged the captive women whom he carried along with him to sing songs after the manner of their country he happened among these women to perceive one who appeared in deeper affliction than the rest and who by a modest and at the same time a noble confusion discovered a greater reluctance than the others to appear in public she was a perfect beauty which was very much heightened by her bashfulness whilst she threw her eyes to the ground and did all in her power to conceal her face the king soon imagined by her air and mien that she was not of vulgar birth and enquiring himself into it the lady answered that she was granddaughter to ochus who not long before had swayed the persian scepter and daughter of his son that she had married hystaspes who was related to darius and general of a great army alexander being touched with compassion when he heard the unhappy fate of a princess of the blood royal and the sad condition to which she was reduced not only gave her liberty but returned all her possessions and caused her husband to be sought for in order that she might be restored to him  but now the veteran soldiers who had fought under philip not having the least idea of sensuality inveighed publicly against the prodigious luxury and the numerous vices which the army had learnt in susa and ecbatena the king therefore thought that the safest remedy would be to employ them and for that purpose led them against bessus but as the army was incumbered with booty and an useless train of baggage so that it could scarce move he first caused all his own baggage to be carried into a great square and afterward that of his army such things excepted as were absolutely necessary then ordered the whole to be carried from thence in carts to a large plain every one was in great pain to know the meaning of all this but after he had sent away the horses he himself set fire to his own things and commanded every one to follow his example  hitherto we have seen alexander triumphing by a course of virtue we are now to behold him swollen up by success spoiled by flattery and enervated by vices exhibiting a very doubtful character and mixing the tyrant with the hero a conspiracy was formed against him by one dymnus this was communicated by a macedonian soldier to philotas one of alexanders favorites philotas neglected divulging it to his master and thus became suspected himself as being concerned in the conspiracy parmenio also the father of this young favorite became equally obnoxious and as the suspicion of tyrants is equally fatal with a conviction alexander doomed both to destruction  in the beginning of the night various parties of guards having been posted in the several places necessary some entered the tent of philotas who was then in a deep sleep when starting from his slumbers as they were putting manacles on his hands he cried alas my sovereign the inveteracy of my enemies has got the better of your goodness after this they covered his face and brought him to the palace without uttering a single word his hands were tied behind him and his head covered with a coarse wornout piece of cloth lost to himself he did not dare to look up or open his lips but the tears streaming from his eyes he fainted away in the arms of the man who held him as the standersby wiped off the tears in which his face was bathed recovering his speech and his voice by insensible degrees he seemed desirous of speaking  the result of this interview was that philotas should be put to the rack the persons who presided on that occasion were his most inveterate enemies and they made him suffer every kind of torture philotas at first discovered the utmost resolution and strength of mind the torments he suffered not being able to force from him a single word nor even so much as a sigh but at last conquered by pain he confessed himself to be guilty named several accomplices and even accused his own father the next day the answers of philotas were read in full assembly he himself being present upon the whole he was unanimously sentenced to die immediately after which he was stoned according to the custom of macedonia with some other of the conspirators  the condemnation of philotas brought on that of parmenio whether it were that alexander really believed him guilty or was afraid of the father now he had put the son to death polydamus one of the lords of the court was appointed to see the execution performed he had been one of parmenios most intimate friends if we may give that name to courtiers who affect only their own fortunes this was the very reason of his being nominated because no one could suspect that he was sent with any such orders against parmenio he therefore set out for media where that general commanded the army and was entrusted with the kings treasure which amounted to an hundred and fourscore thousand talents about twenty seven millions sterling alexander had given him several letters for cleander the kings lieutenant in the province and for the principal officers two were for parmenio one of them from alexander and the other sealed with philotass seal as if he had been alive to prevent the father from harboring the least suspicion polydamus was but eleven days on his journey and alighted in the nightime at cleanders after having taken all the precautions necessary they went together with a great number of attendants to meet parmenio who at this time was walking in a park of his own the moment polydamus spied him though at a great distance he ran to embrace him with an air of the utmost joy and after compliments intermixed with the strongest indications of friendship had passed on both sides he gave him alexanders letter which opening and afterward that under the name of philotas he seemed pleased with the contents at that very instant cleander thrust a dagger into his side then made another thrust in his throat and the rest gave him several wounds even after he was dead he was at the time of his death threescore and ten years of age and had served his master with a fidelity and zeal which in the end was but very ill rewarded  in order to prevent the ill consequences that might arise from the contemplation of these cruelties alexander set out upon his march and continued to pursue bessus upon which occasion he exposed himself to great hardships and dangers bessus however was treated by his followers in the same manner he had treated the king his master spitamenes his chief confidant having formed a conspiracy against him seized his person put him in chains forced the royal robes from his back and with a chain round his neck he was delivered up in the most ignominious manner to alexander the king caused this man to be treated with his usual cruelty after reproaching him for his treachery and causing his nose and ears to be cut off he sent him to ecbatana there to suffer whatever punishment dariuss mother should think proper to inflict upon him four trees were bent by main force one toward the other and to each of these trees one of the limbs of this traitors body was fastened afterward these trees being let return to their natural position they flew back with so much violence that each tore away the limb that was fixed to it and so quartered him  thus uniting in his person at once great cruelty and great enterprise alexander still marched forward in search of new nations whom he might subdue a city inhabited by the branchid he totally overturned and massacred all the inhabitants in cool blood only for being descended from some traitorous greeks that had delivered up the treasures of a temple with which they had been entrusted he then advanced to the river jaxerthes where he received a wound in the leg from thence he went forward and took the capital of sogdiana he there received an embassy from the scythians who lived free and independent but now submitted to him he then marched to cyropolis and besieged it this was the last city of the persian empire and had been built by cyrus after whom it was called and taking the place he abandoned it to plunder in this manner he went on capriciously destroying some towns and building others settling colonies in some places and laying whole provinces waste at his pleasure among his other projects an invasion of the kingdom of scythia was one but the crossing of the river jaxerthes was by no means an easy task however alexander being always foremost in encountering dangers led on his troops across the stream which was very rapid and gained a signal victory over the scythians who vainly attempted to oppose him on the other side  a strong hold called petra oxiani defended by a garrison of thirty thousand soldiers with ammunition and provision for two years was still considered as impregnable however as difficulties only seemed to excite his ambition his soldiers scaled the cliff and the barbarians supposing that the whole macedonian army was got over their heads surrendered upon condition that their lives should be spared but alexander forgetting the faith of treaty and the humanity which became a soldier on this occasion caused them all to be scourged with rods and afterward to be fixed to crosses at the foot of the same rock  after this having subdued the massagetae and dahae he entered the province of barsaria from thence he advanced to maracander and appointed clytus governor of that province this was an old officer who had fought under philip and signalized himself on many occasions at the battle of the granicus as alexander was fighting bareheaded and bosaces had his arm raised in order to strike him behind clytus covered the king with his shield and cut off the barbarians hand hellanice his sister had nursed alexander and he loved her with as much tenderness as if she had been his own mother  this favor however only advanced clytus to a post of greater danger one evening at an entertainment the king after drinking immoderately began to celebrate his own exploits his boasting even shocked those very persons who knew that he spoke truth but particularly the old generals of his army whose admirations were engrossed by the actions of his father clytus was intoxicated and turning about to those who sat below him at table quoted to them a passage from euripides but in such a manner that the king could only hear his voice and not the words distinctly the sense of the passage was that the greeks had done very wrong in ordaining that in the inscriptions engraved on trophies the names of kings only should be mentioned because by these means brave men were robbed of the glory they had purchased with their blood the king suspecting clytus had let drop some disobliging expressions asked those who sat nearest him what he had said as no one answered clitus raising his voice by degrees began to relate the actions of philip and his wars in greece prefering them to whatever was doing at that time which created a great dispute between the young and old men though the king was prodigiously vexed in his mind he nevertheless stifled his resentment and seemed to listen very patiently to all clitus spoke to his prejudice it is probable he would have quite suppressed his passion had clitus stopped there but the latter growing more and more insolent as if determined to exasperate and insult the king he went such lengths as to defend parmenio publicly and to assert that the destroying of thebes was but trifling in comparison of the victory which philip had gained over the athenians and that the old macedonians though sometimes unsuccessful were greatly superior to those who were so rash as to despise them  alexander telling him that in giving cowardice the name of ill success he was pleading his own cause clitus rises up with his eyes sparkling with wine and anger it is nevertheless this hand said he to him extending it at the same time that saved your life at the battle of granicus it is the blood and wounds of these very macedonians who are accused of cowardice that raised you to this grandeur but the tragical end of parmenio shows what reward they and myself may expect for all our services this last reproach stung alexander however he still restrained his passion and only commanded him to leave the table he is in the right says clitus as he rose up not to bear freeborn men at his table who can only tell him truth he will do well to pass his life among barbarians and slaves who will be proud to pay their adoration to his persian girdle and his white robe but now the king no longer able to suppress his rage snatched a javelin from one of his guards and would have killed clitus on the spot had not the courtiers withheld his arm and clitus been forced but with great difficulty out of the hall however he returned into it that moment by another door singing with an air of insolence verses reflecting highly on the prince who seeing the general near him struck him with his javelin and laid him dead at his feet crying out at the same time go now to philip to parmenio and to attalus  the king had no sooner murdered his faithful servant than he perceived the atrociousness of the act he threw himself upon the dead body forced out the javelin and would have destroyed himself had he not been prevented by his guards who seized and carried him forcibly to his own apartment where the flattery and the persuasions of his friends at length served to alleviate his remorse in order to divert his melancholy alexander having drawn his army out of the garrisons where they had wintered three months marched toward a country called gabana in his way he met with a dreadful storm in which his army suffered greatly from thence he went into the country of sacae which he soon overrun and laid waste soon after this axertes one of its monarchs received him in his palace which was adorned with barbarous magnificence he had a daughter called roxana a young lady whose exquisite beauty was heightened by all the charms of wit and good sense alexander sound her charms irresistible and made her his wife covering his passion with the specious pretense of uniting the two nations in such bonds as should improve their mutual harmony by blending their interests and throwing down all distinctions between the conquerors and the conquered this marriage displeased the macedonians very much and exasperated his chief courtiers when it was seen that he made one of his slaves his fatherinlaw but as after his murdering clitus no one dared to speak to him with freedom they applauded what he did with their eyes and countenances for they had nothing else left that was free  alexander having thus conquered all the persian provinces now with boundless ambition resolved upon a perilous march into india this country was considered as the richest in the world not only in gold but in pearls and precious stones with which the inhabitants adorned themselves but being willing either to impress his soldiers with an idea of his authority or to imitate the barbarians in the magnificence of their titles he was resolved not only to be called but to be believed the son of jupiter as if it had been possible for him to command as absolutely over the mind as over the tongue and that the macedonians would condescend to fall prostrate and adore him after the persian manner  to sooth and cherish these ridiculous pretensions there were not wanting flatterers those common pests of a court who are more dangerous to princes than the arrows of their enemies but the macedonians indeed would not stoop to this base adulation all of them to a man refusing to vary in any manner from the customs of their country among the number who disdained to offer these base adulations was callisthenes the philosopher but his integrity cost him his life he was accused of being privy to a conspiracy formed by hermolaus a young officer upon the life of the king and for this reason he was thrown into a dungeon and loaded with irons he soon found that he had no mercy to expect the most grievous tortures were inflicted upon him in order to extort a confession of guilt but he persisted in his innocence to the last and expired in the midst of his torments  the kingdom of india for which alexander now set out was an extensive territory which has been usually divided into two parts  india on this side and india on the other side of the ganges all the indians at that time were free nor even did they adopt the base custom of the greeks in purchasing slaves to do the common offices of life the people of that country were then divided into seven classes the first and most honorable though the smallest were the guardians of religion the second and the greatest was that of the husbandman whose only employment was to cultivate the ground the third was that of herdsmen and shepherds who led the herds and flocks among the mountains the fourth consisted of tradesmen and merchants among whom pilots and seamen were included the fifth was of soldiers whose only employment was war the sixth was of magistrates who superintended the actions of others either in cities or in the country and reported the whole to the king the seventh class consisted of persons employed in the public councils and who shared the cares of government with their sovereign these orders of state never blended nor intermarried with each other none of these were permitted to follow two professions at the same time nor quit one class for another  alexander having entered india all the petty kings of the country came to meet him and make their submissions on his march he took the city of nysa he then marched toward daedala and dispersed his army over the whole country and took possession of it without resistance he afterward went forward toward the city of hagosa which after being besieged in form surrendered at discretion the rock of aornos which was deemed inaccessible and which it was said hercules himself was not able to take but the garrison in a panic delivered it up to his army from thence he marched to acleslimus and after a march of sixteen days arrived on the banks of the great river indus where he found that hephestion had got all things ready for his passage pursuant to the orders he had before received here he was met by omphis a king of the country who did homage to alexander and made him a present of fiftysix elephants and other animals of prodigious size the ambassadors from abisaries a neighboring monarch came with the same offers sent presents and promised fidelity there was still a third monarch whose name was porus from whom alexander expected similar submission he even went to require it of him but porus answered with great coldness that while he could fight he should disdain to obey  in pursuance of this message alexander resolved to enforce obedience and giving the superintendance of his elephants to omphis who had now changed his name to taxilus he advanced as far as the borders of the hydaspes porus was encamped on the other side of it in order to dispute the passage with him and had posted at the head of his army eightyfive elephants of a prodigious size and behind them three hundred chariots guarded by thirty thousand foot not having at most above seven thousand horse this prince was mounted upon an elephant of a much larger size than any of the rest and he himself exceeded the usual stature of men so that clothed in his armor glittering with gold and silver he appeared at the same time terrible and majestic the greatness of his courage equalled that of his stature and he was as wise and prudent as it was possible for the monarch of so barbarous a people to be  the macedonians dreaded not only the enemy but the river they were obliged to pass it was four furlongs wide about four hundred fathoms and so deep in every part that it looked like a sea and was no where fordable it was vastly impetuous notwithstanding its great breadth for it rolled with as much violence as if it had been confined to a narrow channel and its raging foaming waves which broke in many places discovered that it was full of stones and rocks however nothing was so dreadful as the appearance of the shore which was quite covered with men horses and elephants those hideous animals stood like so many towers and the indians exasperated them in order that the horrid cry they made might fill the enemy with great terror however this could not intimidate an army of men whose courage was proof against all attacks and who were animated by an uninterrupted series of prosperities but then they did not think it would be possible for them as the banks were so crazy to surmount the rapidity of the stream or land with safety  alexander was in great perplexity with the difficulties that attended the passage of this narrow river however he resolved to attempt it by night and chose one whose lightening thunder and impetuous winds conspired to drown the noise of his troops in their embarkation scarce any person appeared to oppose their descent and the moment alexander was landed he drew up the forces that had passed with him consisting of six thousand foot and five thousand horse in order of battle  porus upon hearing that alexander had passed the river had sent against him a detachment commanded by one of his sons of two thousand horse and one hundred and twenty chariots alexander imagined them at first to be the enemys vanguard and that the whole army was behind them but being informed it was but a detachment he charged them with such vigor that poruss son was killed upon the spot with four hundred horses and all the chariots were taken  porus upon receiving advice of the death of his son the defeat of the detachment and of alexanders approach resolved to go and meet alexander whom he justly supposed to be at the head of the choicest troops of his army accordingly leaving only a few elephants in his camp to amuse those who were posted on the opposite shore he set out with thirty thousand foot four thousand horse three thousand chariots and two hundred elephants being come into a firm sandy soil in which his horses and chariots might wheel about with ease he drew up his army in battlearray with an intent to wait the coming up of the enemy he posted in front and on the first line all the elephants at a hundred feet distance one from the other in order that they might serve as a bulwark to his foot who were behind it was his opinion that the enemys cavalry would not dare to engage in these intervals because of the fear those horses would have of the elephants and much less the infantry when they should see that of the enemy posted behind the elephants and in danger of being trod to pieces he had posted some of his foot on the same line with the elephants in order to cover their right and left and this infantry was covered by his two wings of horse before which the chariots were posted such was the order and disposition of poruss army  alexander being come in sight of the enemy waited the coming up of his foot which marched with the utmost diligence and arrived a little after and in order that they might have time to take breath and not to be led as they were very much fatigued against the enemy he caused his horse to make a great many evolutions in order to gain time but now every thing being ready and the infantry having sufficiently recovered their vigor alexander gave the signal of battle he did not think proper to begin by attacking the enemys main body where the infantry and the elephants were posted for the very reason which had made porus draw them up in that manner but his cavalry being stronger he drew out the greatest part of them and marching against the left wing sent coenus with his own regiment of horse and that of demetrius to charge them at the same time ordering him to attack that cavalry on the left behind during which he himself would charge them both in front and flank seleucus antigonus and tauron who commanded the foot were ordered not to stir from their posts till alexanders cavalry had put that of the enemy as well as their foot into disorder  being come within arrowshot he detached a thousand bowmen on horseback with orders for them to make their discharge on the horse of poruss left wing in order to throw it into disorder whilst he himself would charge this body in flank before it had time to rally the indians having joined again their squadrons and drawn them up into a narrower compass advanced against alexander at that instant coenus charged them in the rear according to the orders given him insomuch that the indians were obliged to face about on all sides to defend themselves from the thousand bowmen and against alexander and coenus alexander to make the best advantage of the confusion into which this sudden attack had thrown them charged with great vigor those that had made head against him who being no longer able to stand so violent an attack were soon broke and retired behind the elephants as to an impregnable rampart the leaders of the elephants made them advance against the enemys horse but that very instant the macedonian phalanx moving on a sudden surrounded those animals and charged with their pikes the elephants themselves and their leaders this battle was very different from all those which alexander had hitherto fought for the elephants rushing upon the battalions broke with inexpressible fury the thickest of them when the indian horse seeing the macedonian foot stopped by the elephants returned to the charge however that of alexander being stronger and having greater experience in war broke this body a second time and obliged it to retire toward the elephants upon which the macedonian horse being all united in one body spread terror and confusion wherever they attacked the elephants being all covered with wounds and the greatest part having lost their leaders did not observe their usual order but distracted as it were with pain no longer distinguished friends from foes but running about from place to place they overthrew every thing that came in their way the macedonians who had purposely left a greater interval between their battalions either made way for them whenever they came forward or charged with darts those that fear and the tumult obliged to retire alexander after having surrounded the enemy with his horse made a signal to his foot to march up with all imaginable speed in order to make a last effort and to fall upon them with his whole force all which they executed very successfully in this manner the greatest part of the indian cavalry were cut to pieces and a body of their foot which sustained no ess loss seeing themselves charged on all sides at last fled catorus who had continued in the camp with the rest of his army seeing alexander engaged with porus crossed the river and charging the routed soldiers with his troops who were cool and vigorous by that means killed as many enemies in the retreat as had fallen in the battle  the indians lost on this occasion twenty thousand foot and three thousand horse not to mention the chariots which were all broke to pieces and the elephants that were either killed or taken poruss two sons fell in this battle with spitacus governor of the province all the colonels of horse and foot and those who guided the elephants and chariots as for alexander he lost but fourscore of the six thousand soldiers who were at the first charge ten bowmen of the horse twenty of his horseguards and two hundred common soldiers  porus after having performed all the duty both of a soldier and a general in the battle and fought with incredible bravery seeing all his horse defeated and the greatest part of his foot did not behave like the great darius who in a like disaster was the first that fled on the contrary he continued in the field as long as one battalion or squadron stood their ground but at last having received a wound in the shoulder he retired upon his elephant and was easily distinguished from the rest by the greatness of his stature and his unparelleled bravery alexander finding who he was by those glorious marks and being desirous of saving this king sent taxilus after him because he was of the same nation the latter advancing as near to him as he might without running any danger of being wounded called out to him to stop in order to hear the message he had brought him from alexander porus turning back and seeing it was taxilus his old enemy how says he is it not taxilus that calls that traitor to his country and kingdom immediately after which he would have transfixed him with his dart had he not instantly retired notwithstanding this alexander was still desirous to save so brave a prince and thereupon dispatched other officers among whom was meroe one of his intimate friends who besought him in the strongest terms to wait upon a conqueror altogether worthy of him after much entreaty porus consented and accordingly set forward alexander who had been told of his coming advanced forwards in order to receive him with some of his train being come pretty near alexander stopped purposely to take a view of his stature and noble mien he being about five cubits in height porus did not seem dejected at his misfortune but came up with a resolute countenance like a valiant warrior whose courage in defending his dominions ought to acquire him the esteem of the brave prince who had taken him prisoner alexander spoke first and with an august and gracious air asked him how he desired to be treated like a king replied porus but continued alexander do you ask nothing more no replied porus all things are included in that single word alexander struck with this greatness of soul the magnanimity of which seemed heightened by distress did not only restore him his kingdom but annexed other provinces to it and treated him with the highest testimonies of honor esteem and friendship porus was faithful to him till his death  it is hard to say whether the victor or the vanquished best deserved praise on this occasion  alexander built a city on the spot where the battle had been fought and another in that place where he had crossed the river he called the one nicaea from his victory and the other bucephalus in honor of his horse who died there not of his wounds but of old age after having paid the last duties to such of his soldiers as had lost their lives in battle he solemnised games and offered up sacrifices of thanks in the place where he had passed the hydespes  alexander having now conquered porus advanced into india which having never been a warlike nation he subdued with the rapidity rather of a traveller than a conqueror numberless petty states submitted to him sensible that his stay would be short and his conquests evanescent  alexander passing near a city where several brachmans or indian priests dwelt was very desirous to converse with them and if possible to prevail with some of them to follow him being informed that these philosophers never made visits but that those who had an inclination to see them must go to their houses he concluded that it would be beneath his dignity to go to them and not just to force these sages to any thing contrary to their laws and usages onesicritus the philosopher who had been a disciple of diogenes the cynick was deputed to them he met not far from the city fifteen boxamins who from morning till evening stood always naked in the same posture in which they at first had placed themselves and afterward returned to the city at night he addressed himself first to calanus an indian reputed the wisest man of his country who though he professed the practice of the most severe philosophy had however been persuaded in his extreme old age to attend upon the court and him he told the occasion of his coming the later gazing upon onesicrituss clothes and shoes could not forbear laughing after which he told him that anciently the earth had been covered with barley and wheat as it was at that time with dust that besides water the rivers used to flow with milk honey oil and wine that mans guilt had occasioned a change of this happy condition and that jupiter to punish their ingratitude had sentenced them to a long painful labor that their repentance afterward moving him to compassion he had restored them their former abundance however that by the course of things they seemed to be returning to their ancient confusion this relation shows evidently that these philosophers had some notion of the felicity of the first man and of the evil to which he had been sentenced for his sins  onesicritus was very urgent with both of them to quit their austere way of life and follow the fortune of alexander saying that they would find in him a generous master and benefactor who would heap upon them honor and riches of all kinds then mandanis assuming a haughty philosophical tone answered that he did not want alexander and was the son of jupiter as well as himself that he was exempted from want desire or fear that so long as he should live the earth would furnish him with all things necessary for his subsistence and that death would rid him of a troublesome companion meaning his body and set him at full liberty calodanus appeared more tractable and notwithstanding the opposition and even the prohibition of his superior who reproached him for his abject spirit in stooping so low as to serve another master besides god he followed onesicritus and went to alexanders court who received him with great demonstrations of joy as it was alexanders chief ambition to imitate bacchus and hercules in their expeditions into the east he resolved like them to penetrate as long as he could meet new nations to conquer however his soldiers satiated with spoil and fatigued with repeated encounters at last began to open their eyes at the wildness of his ambition some bewailed their calamities in such terms as raised compassion others insolently cried out that they would march no further the chief object of the kings wishes was to invade the territories of agramenes a prince who lived beyond the great river ganges and who was able to bring into the field two hundred thousand foot two thousand elephants twenty thousand horse and two thousand armed chariots the soldiers however refused to wander over those great deserts that lay beyond the ganges and more terrible to them than the greatest army the east could muster he addressed them in the most persuasive terms not to leave their general behind he threatened them that he would take his scythian and his persian soldiers and with them alone he would make conquests worthy of his name and of his glory but still the macedonian soldiers persisted sullen and inflexible and only at last complied after many persuasive orations to follow him toward the south to discover the nearest ocean and to take the course of the river indus as their infallible guide  for this expedition he embarked in a fleet consisting of eight hundred vessels as well galleys as boats to carry the troops and provisions after five days sailing the fleet arrived where the hydespes and the acesines mixed their streams there the ships were very much shattered because these rivers unite with prodigious rapidity at last he came to the country of the oxydrace and the mallis the most valiant people in the east however alexander defeated them in several engagements dispossessed them of their strong holds and at last marched against their capital city where the greatest part of their forces were retired it was upon this occasion that seizing a scaling ladder himself the first he mounted the wall followed only by two of his officers his attendants believing him to be in danger mounted swiftly to succor him but the ladder breaking he was left alone it was now that his rashness became his safety for leaping from the wall into the city which was crowded with enemies sword in hand he repulsed such as were nearest and even killed the general who advanced in the throng thus with his back to a tree that happened to be near he received all the darts of the enemy in a shield and kept even the boldest at a distance at last an indian discharging an arrow of three feet long it pierced his coat of mail and his right breast and so great a quantity of blood issued from the wound that he dropped his arms and lay as dead the indian came to strip him supposing him really what he appeared but alexander that instant recalled his spirits and plunged the dagger in his side by this time a part of the kings attendants came to his succor and forming themselves round his body till his soldiers without found means of bursting the gates saved him and put all the inhabitants without distinction to the sword  the wound which at first seemed dangerous having in the space of six or seven days a most favorable appearance alexander mounted his horse and showed himself to the army who seemed to view him with insatiable pleasure thus continuing his voyage and subduing the country on each side as he passed along the pilots perceived from the softness of the breezes that the ocean was near nothing so much astonished the macedonian soldiers as the ebbing and flowing of the tide they were amazed when they saw it rise to a great height and overflow the country which they considered as a mark of divine resentment they were no less terrified some hours after when they saw the river forsake its banks and leave those lands uncovered it had so lately overflowed thus after a voyage of nine months he at last stood upon the shore and after having offered sacrifices to neptune and having looked wishfully on the broad expanse of waters before him he is said to have wept for having no more worlds left to conquer here he put an end to his excursions and having appointed nearchus admiral of his fleet with orders to coast along the indian shore as far as the persian gulf he set out with his army for babylon  nothing could exceed the hardships which his army sustained in their return passing through a country destitute of all sorts of provisions they were obliged to feast on the beasts of burden and were forced to burn those rich spoils for the sake of which they had encountered so many dangers those diseases also that generally accompany famine completed their calamity and destroyed them in great numbers after a march of threescore days they arrived in the province of gedrosia the fertility of which soon banished from the minds of the soldiery all their former difficulties alexander passed through the country not with the military pomp of a conqueror but in the licentious disguise of an enthusiast still willing to imitate bacchus he was drawn by eight horses on a scaffold in the form of a square stage where he passed the days and nights in feasting along the roads where he passed were placed casks of wine in great abundance and these the soldiery drained in honor of his mock deity the whole country echoed with the sound of instruments and the howling of bachanals who with their hair dishevelled with frantic mirth ran up and down abandoning themselves to every kind of lewdness this vice produced one of a much more formidable nature in the kings mind for it always enflamed his passions to cruelty and the executioner generally followed the feast  while he refreshed his army in these parts nearchus was returned from his expedition along the coast and brought him strange accounts of the gold to be found in some islands and of the wonders that were to be seen in others he was therefore commanded to make some further discoveries and then enter the mouth of the river euphrates to meet the king at babylon he here also executed an act of rigorous justice upon cleander and others who had formerly been the ministers of his vengeance in cutting off parmenio against these murderers great complaints had been made by the deputies of the provinces in which they had commanded and such was the complexion of their crimes that nothing but the certain expectation of alexanders never returning from india could encourage them to commit such all men were glad to see them delivered over to justice cleander with six hundred soldiers whom he had employed were publicly executed every one rejoicing that the anger of the king was at last turned against the ministers of his vengeance as alexander drew nearer to babylon he visited the tomb of cyrus in the city of pasargada and here he put a persian prince whose name was orsines to death at the instigation of bagoas an eunuch who falsely accused orsines of robbing the tomb here also calanus the indian having lived fourscore and three years without ever having been afflicted with sickness now feeling the approaches of disorder resolved to put himself to death alexander imagined he might easily be dissuaded from his design but finding in opposition to all the arguments he could use that calanus was inflexible he gave orders for erecting a funeral pile for him upon which the indian was resolved to die  calanus rode on horseback to the foot of the funeral pile offered up his prayers to the gods caused libations to be performed and the rest of the ceremonies to be observed which are practiced at funerals cut off a tuft of his hair in imitation of victims embraced such of his friends as were present entreated them to be merry that day and to feast and carouse with alexander assuring them at the same time that he would soon see that prince in babylon after saying these words he ascended with the utmost cheerfulness the funeeral pile laid himself down upon it and covered his face and when the flame reached him he did not make the least motion but with a patience and constancy that surprised the whole army continued in the same posture in which he at first had laid himself and completed his sacrifice by dying agreeably to the strange superstitions of the enthusiasts of his country alexander punctually obeyed him in his admonitions to debauchery a banquet followed the night after in which promacus received a talent as a prize for having drank the largest quantity of wine he survived his victory however but three days and of the rest of the guests fortyone died of their intemperance from pasargada alexander proceeded to susa where he married statira the eldest daughter of darius and gave her youngest sister in marriage to his favorite hephestion fourscore persian ladies of rank were given to the principal favorites among his captains the nuptials were solemnized after the persian manner he likewise feasted all the macedonians who had married before in that country it is related that there were nine thousand guests at this feast and that he gave each of them a golden cup for their libations upon this occasion there appeared at susa three hundred young soldiers dressed in the macedonian manner whom alexander intended particularly to favor in order to check the licentiousness of his veterans who had but too just reasons to murmur  while alexander was thus employed in persia a new commotion was carrying on in greece harpalus whom alexander had appointed governor of babylon being disgusted with his masters cruelty and ambitious of power himself went over into greece with immense sums which he raised from the plundered prisoners of persia he had credit enough to assemble a body of six thousand soldiers and with these he landed at athens money at that time being thought allpowerful in greece he lavished immense sums among the mercenary orators whose business it was to inflame the minds of the people of all these phocion alone to whom he offered seven hundred talents preserved his wellknown integrity and remained inflexible his disinterestedness had long been the object of admiration even in the time of philip being offered a great sum of money if not for his own acceptance at least for the benefit of his children if my children cried phocion resemble me the little spot of ground with the produce of which i have hitherto lived and which has raised me to the glory you mention will be sufficient to maintain them if it will not i do not intend to leave them wealth merely to stimulate and heighten their luxury alexander having likewise sent him an hundred talents phocion asked those who brought them why alexander sent him so great a sum and did not remit any to the rest of the athenians it is replied they because alexander looks upon you as the only just and virtuous man phocion rejoined let him suffer me still to enjoy that character and be really what i am taken for this therefore was not a character to be corrupted on the contrary he used all his influence to prevent the success of harpalus who being ordered by the assembly to depart the city lost all hopes of success  this commotion was scarcely quelled when another ensued in consequence of a declaration by which all the macedonians who from their age or infirmities were unable to bear the fatigues of war should be sent back to greece they with seditious cries unanimously demanded to be entirely discharged from his service murmuring against him as a despiser of his bravest troops and as a cruel king who wanted not their absence but their destruction alexander however acted with that resolution upon this occasion which always marked his character being seated on his tribunal of justice he rushed among the principal mutineers seized thirteen and ordered them to be immediately punished the soldiers amazed at his intrepidity withheld their complaints and with downcast eyes seemed to beg for mercy you desired a discharge cried he go then and publish to the world that you have left your prince to the mercy of strangers from henceforth the persians shall be my guards this menace served only to increase the misery and the consternation of his troops they attended him with tears and lamentations till at last softened by their penitence he once more took them into favor and affection  now secure from insurrection he gave himself up to mirth and feasting his army was sollowed by all the ministers of pleasure he spent whole nights and days in immoderate drinking and in one of those excesses hephestion lost his life this courtier was the most intimate friend of alexander craterus alone of all the macedonians seemed to dispute this honor with him craterus as the king used to say loves the king but hephestion loves alexander the death of this favorite threw the monarch into excessive sorrow he seemed to receive no consolation he even put to death the physician who attended him and the extraordinary funeral honors celebrated at his arrival in babylon marked the greatness of his affliction  after various combats conquests cruelties follies and excesses alexander arrived at babylon the chaldeans who pretended to foresee future events attempted to persuade him not to enter that city the greek philosophers on the other hand displayed the futility of their predictions babylon was a theater for him to display his glory in and ambassadors from all the nations he had conquered were there in readiness to celebrate his triumphs after making a most magnificent entry he gave audience to the ambassadors with a grandeur and dignity suitable to his power yet with the affability and politeness of a private courtier  at that time he wrote a letter which was to have been read publicly in the assembly at the olympicgames whereby the several cities of greece were commanded to permit all exiles to return into their native country those excepted who had committed sacrilege or any other crime deserving death ordering antipater to employ an armed force against such cities as should refuse to obey this letter was read in the assembly but the athenians and etolians did not think themselves obliged to put orders in execution which seemed to interfere with their liberty  finding babylon in extent and convenience superior to all the other cities of the east he resolved to make it the seat of his empire and for that purpose was desirous of adding to it all the ornaments possible but though he was much employed in projects of this kind and in schemes even beyond human power to execute he spent the greatest part of his time in such pleasures as this magnificent city afforded he was often present at new banquets where he drank with his usual intemperance on a particular occasion having spent the whole night in a debauch a second was proposed he accepted the invitation and drank to such excess that he fell upon the floor dead to appearance and in this lifeless manner was carried a sad spectacle of debauchery to his palace the fever continued with some intervals in which he gave the necessary orders for the sailing of the fleet and the marching of his land forces being persuaded he should soon recover but at last finding himself past all hopes and his voice beginning to fail he gave his ring to perdiccas with orders to convey his corpse to the temple of ammon he struggled however with death for some time and raising himself upon his elbow he gave his hand to the soldiers who pressed to kiss it being then asked to whom he would leave his empire he answered to the most worthy perdiccas enquiring at what time he should pay him divine honors he replied when you are happy with these words he expired being thirtytwo years and eight months old of which he had reigned twelve with more fortune than virtue  in whatever light we view this monarch we shall have little to admire and less to imitate that courage for which he was celebrated is but a subordinate virtue that fortune which still attended him was but an accidental advantage that discipline which prevailed in his army was produced and cultivated by his father but his intemperance his cruelty his vanity his passion for useless conquests were all his own his victories however served to crown the pyramid of grecian glory they served to show to what a degree the arts of peace can promote those of war in this picture we view a combination of petty states by the arts of refinement growing more than a match for the rest of the world united and leaving mankind an example of superiority of intellect over brutal force after the death of this monarch greece was rather considered as a seminary for the education and promotion of the laws of other nations than a confederacy for enforcing and promulgating her own the successors of alexander seized upon particular parts of his extensive empire and what he gained with much fatigue and danger became a prey to men who sheltered their ambition under the sanction and glory of his name they had been taught by him a lesson of pride and as he would never suffer an equal his numerous successors could not think of admitting a superior they continued their disputes for dominion until in some measure they destroyed each other and as no governments were ever worse conducted than theirs so no period of history was ever left in such darkness doubt and confusion  index n
