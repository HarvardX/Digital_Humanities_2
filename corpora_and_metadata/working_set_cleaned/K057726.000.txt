robin hood  price one shilling and sixpence  robin hood or sherwood forest a comic opera  as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  by leonard mac nally esquire  london printed by j almon at no     fleet street m dcc lxxxiv  to mr wm shield composer to the theater royal covent garden sir gil blas advised a friend who had written for the stage with success to publish his works observing that as he had imposed upon the public by the representation of bad pieces he ought to open their eyes in gratitude for the reception they had met this opera i fear like the works of the spanish dramatist though applauded on the stage may fall under censure in the closet where it must appear divested of that aid it received from your excellent musical compositions and the incomparable acting with which the characters were supported the three principal ideas which combine the subject are not original but borrowed from the ballads of robin hood the nutbrown maid and the the hermit of the dale is taken from a ballad called the friar of orders gray which is taken from an old ballad called the herdsman hermit of the dale i adopted them as being popular it was my first intention to have taken all the songs from old ballads those i have selected are i trust not ill chosen or unapplicable to the piece robin hood and his merry archers have often been upon the stage the biographia dramatica gives an account of six pieces in which this celebrated outlaw was the hero exclusive of the sad shepherd by ben johnson but it does not appear that any of them met with success i address these observations to you as a tribute to your merit happy in having an opportunity of publicly assuring you that no man stands higher in my esteem your friend  leonard mac nally  dramatis personae

also know that on the very eve of marriage he was ordered from court   bowman true   john now this was all owing to the bishop of hereford who maliciously poisoned the royal ear and the instant the noble huntingdon became an object of the kings displeasure the whole court tribe even the very caterpillars who fed upon his bounty avoided him as if he was contagious   bowman but we john stuck to him and will while we have life   john give me your hand  a man never truly knows his friends till misfortune overtakes him but mark  our leaders heart is fixed upon the lady clorinda and she loves

remain long with us falling with one of the bishop of herefords tenants who was flying from his habitation being unable to pay his rent robin with his accustomed humanity made him a present of the friars tribute   john perhaps this fellow is an impostor so open his pack pointing to ruttekin a good heart may lie in a deformed body a diamond may be concealed in a dunghill and why not gold or

led the wanton hours when may was in her prime opened the cells of flowers to airy paramours and bid the lovesick poet sigh in rhyme oh summer all too fair oh blisses all too high oh might she not

great friendship for john you know brother when i fell into the river he plunged in and saved my life while scarlet run for assistance   allen i do not blame your gratitude but be cautious johns simplicity might prove as injurious as scarlets cunning   stella i will follow your advice for i have heard young girls often meet ruin where they expect security    allen and ever after suffer under the pangs of shame repentance and bitter grief   air hard beats her heart her eyes pour tears corroding grief consumes her years no more she sports with damsels gay but mourns in penance night and day
