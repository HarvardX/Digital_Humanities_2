the case fairly stated between the turkey company and the italian merchants  by a merchant  london printed in the year    0  the case fairly stated between the turkey company and the italian merchants the turkey company would be but ill charged with so much art in the conduct of their trade if they were capable of using no art in the defense of it  no man can charge them with want of cunning in what they now push at and had they used as much honesty in their argument as they show art in their design some plain questions and answers would bring us all to the end of the dispute and the house of lords had not had the trouble of this act  the papers they have hitherto published have generally aimed at two things and both of them seem to be unfair and something sophistical i am loath to call it shuffling with respect to the persons of the gentlemen concerned but necessity obliges me to say that what they offer evidently looks one way but means another the specious pretenses they make for the public good of trade encouragement of manufactures and the like are only covers to conceal the grand end of separate interest which it is manifest is the thing they aim at    they pretend in their papers to advocate for the good of their country against the encouragement given by the italian merchant to the french to sell their cloth in turkey by taking off the raw silk which is the return whereas really they are in their capacity as a company the reason of all the encouragement the french meet with in the turkey trade and if it were not for the ill conduct of the turkey company the french would have no silk to sell nor vend any cloth in turkey worth naming   they pretend that the supporting the turkey company is the interest of the trade whereas their being a company in the sense of their present management is the great obstruction of the trade and will if not restrained be the ruin of it in their papers therefore it is evident they aim   at suppressing the italian merchants trade to turkey and   at engrossing the trade of selling cloth in turkey and of silk in england in order to imposing their own price upon the buyers of cloth abroad and the manufacturers of silk at home both which would if obtained effectually declare them a monopoly in the grossest sense of that word  their oppressions abroad their unfair dealings with the merchants who from leghorn interfere as they call it with their trade their bylaws their arbitrary proceedings upon them and all the rest of their ill conduct they give up and seem to plead guilty to them all so they can but get this bill  with so much eagerness they push for this bill that they not only managed their introduction into it with the utmost art and pushed it on with unwearied application to hinder their books being looked into but they said they were willing to consent to any future laws to limit nay even to punish their exorbitance so they may but be indulged with the advantages they drive at in this bill  in a word they were in such a passion for this darling bill that they are willing to give up their reputation as a company submit to all the parliament may think fit to do with them or all the punishment that may be inflicted upon them provided they may but save this bill  it is their own expression in one of their cases possibly the turkey company may have committed faults and made unfitting bylaws if they have done both yet this bill may be necessary and in another place all that can be objected against the turkey company may be remedied by a bill in another parliament and they may take another time for the remedying of it if a company oppresses the parliament may curb and restrain it by future laws and the like  i would not treat the company with indecency but this seems to me to be little more than that of a man detected of a grievous trespass craving leave for an immediate power to oppress and injure his neighbor and putting off the examination and punishment of his own crime to another season as if the remedying the grievance on one side had not the same justice in it and did not call for the same concern of the public to rectify as the other i might have illustrated this by a more severe simily if i were willing to carry things to the height  but let us take these gentlemen in their own way and use their own words as above possibly the company have committed faults and made unfitting bylaws it is most certain they have and i inter what i believe every one will grant viz therefore it is not reasonable those that have already abused their power should be now enabled to abuse it farther and i humbly hope that the nature of the companies bylaws and orders may be inspected  what they now ask is neither more or less than to have a power granted them to oppress and injure the traders to turkey by way of italy who they grant already they have injured and oppressed as to the bill they demand the nature of it shall presently appear when the fraud of the design is more effectually laid open something extraordinary must sure be the case that these men are so very earnest to have the examination of the conduct of the turkey company put off it is a shrewd suspicion of guilt when men are so extraordinary shy of coming to an examination see how it runs through all their arguings if the bill passes say they again the conduct of the turkey company all their bylaws and even their charter if liable to any just exceptions may be examined afterward by parliament very good and why not now why must not the parliament be allowed to examine now into their conduct their bylaws their oppressions their arbitrary proceedings and their charter if liable to exceptions as there is some reason to believe they all are  nor is the examining into these things so incongruous to the bill depending as they would insinuate i allege and undertake to make it appear that the bill they seek cannot be rational if the other conduct of the company is fully examined into and therefore it is not at all unreasonable to demand that both be entered into together it is a great mistake to say that the conduct of the company has no relation to this bill on the contrary if the company have misbehavd if they have oppressed and injured the fairtraders if their bylaws are unjust and they are a real monopoly and ablove all if they seek to be able to act as a monopoly by virtue of this bill then it is absolutely necessary to examine their conduct before this bill should pass as for example  if this bill in its nature tends to making the company a monopoly if it is evident that in soliciting this bill they aim at a power to monopolize if it appears that this bill if passed will put that power into their hands then with humble submission to the house it is absolutely necessary to examine into the abuse of the power they have and the reason of the power they seek and of their seeking it and all before this bill be suffered to pass  and what can it be but this plain dependence of these things one upon another that makes these men so backward to have their conduct examined but that they are sensible that if the house should ransack their behavior and the use they have made of the powers and privileges which they have been entrusted with they would see very good reason to consider well of it before they entrusted them any farther  nor is this an unjust or an unfair reflection because we that are oppressed by the company and have reason feelingly to mention the abuse of the powers they have been entrusted with have much more reason than other men to conclude what use they would make of it if farther powers were committed to them as a company  and here because i am necessarily to enter with plainness and freedom upon the detecting a general scheme of fraud and injustice which evidently seems to run through the whole course of this matter and that as above much less honesty than art shows itself in the earnest solicitations which are and have been made for this bill i must be allowed to distinguish between the gentlemen concerned in their personal and private capacities and in their capacities as a company  in their former capacities i have nothing in the least to say here is no personal satyr intended nor do i direct any reflection in this affair to this or that particular man there are without doubt many worthy and honorable persons in the turkey company  but their conduct as a company is another thing and no mans private reputation is concerned in it and yet i must acknowledge my self to be of the same mind which king charles iid gave as his opinion to a certain lord mayor of london  viz that it was not possible for a man to act in a society with the same honesty and jussice as in their separate and private capacities but that all societies and companies were tyrants and oppressors by the nature of the thing  having made these postulata with the gentlemenmembers of the company as private persons i shall with the more freedom speak to their behavior as a company  i have mentioned how strange it is that these gentlemen should be so very earnest for this bill and for its passing without enquring into their conduct i shall now unravel this mystery and lay it open to the world and when i have done so the wonder will cease    the first reason is because enquiring into their past conduct will necessarily discover the true but concealed design of the bill   it will discover the reason for endeavoring to obtain it   it will discover the consequences of it if obtained that the discovery of any or of all these things would most effectually overthrow the bill seems reasonable for me to conclude from the knowledge i have of the certain application of the house of peers to detecting all clandestine measures projects and attempts couched under the specious pretense of right property public good and the like by which the subjects are frequently imposed upon the public abused and private persons injured  it will be impossible the house can see the exact connection that there is between the former conduct of that company and the attempt couched under the cover of this bill and not see how artfully they seek to protect their past ill conduct by obtaining an authority for worse and to support the oppressions of their former measures by enlarging them in those they should now get power to act by to bring this home to the point in discute that is to say the bill  the pretenses of the bill are specious  viz   that the raw silk which the italian merchants import from leghorn is french and the return for their french cloths sold in turkey   that the quantity of the said silk imported into england is very great   that it is injurious to the turkey trade   if these things were really so every man should grant the consequence at the first word  viz that the bill was necessary which is what they allege  but as was said in one of the italian merchants cases these things would go a great way in the charge but for one misfortune attending them which is that they happen not to be true  the chiefest evidence they bring of it is that in the years      and      a very great quantity of raw silk was bought in france brought to leghorn and shipped to england now though i should grant this that in those two years a great deal of french raw silk was brought from marseilles yet that will neither prove that it has been so in other years or that it can ever happen so again nor if it were to happen again can they argue from it any advantage to the french trade or disadvantage to the english but just the contrary as will appear in the following heads    from the reason and occasion of the french merchants having that great quantity of raw silk upon their hands at that time  viz that they had a prospect of an open trade with england for their wrought silks the treaty of commerce being then on foot here which failing and the alteration of their coin happening at the same time they were obliged to sell off the silk raw at a very great loss so that half the banquiers of paris half the banquiers of lions and almost all the merchants at marseilles were ruined by it and became bankrupt having lost above one third of the value of their capital stock if this be the way that the italian merchants shall always encourage the french trade the french will have little to boast of and the levant company little to complain of   it is well known that the french did not receive that great quantity of silk which was then upon their hands in return for cloth or any manufactures all the cloth that could have been in france could not have purchased it but they sent away ready money and bought up such a quantity upon the prospect of advantage by the treaty of commerce in england as above the disappointment of which was the ruin of so many merchants there   when the raw silk in france was thus cheap and bought by us so much to their loss it was greatly wanted in england and the price in january         refused by turkey merchants here was  0 s and    s per lb and there was not silk enough to be had in england to employ our weavers or to carry on our own silk manufacture so that at this time which these men dwell so much upon the importation of french turkey silk was infinitely the advantage of our trade and in proportion ruinous to france and the silk so imported was about june      sold to our manufacturers in london at    s and the price will be always kept low so long as there can be two importations this sufficiently answers the great importation in the years           on which these men insist so much and proves that it was a circumstance of trade which can never happen again and if ever it should would every bale of it be an incredible advantage to england and a disadvantage to france and it is hoped that an extraordinary case which can never in the ordinary course of trade happen again will not be looked upon a sufficient reason to break into an act which is the support of our navigation  that it cannot be thus now is plain and the italian merchants have made it appear so by the calculation of the price of silk at leghorn and at london which generally is and for the last three years has been from   s   d to   s   d per lb cheaper in london than at leghorn which is a sure rule to judge by why this importation cannot be considerable for that merchants never extend or continue a trade that they cannot carry on but to loss nor indeed can there ever be any considerable importation of raw silk from leghorn but when the turkey company by their oppressive limitations and other monopolizing arts restrain or withold the importation of a quantity sufficient for the market on purpose to advance the price for their private gain and this engrossing is so easy to them such a grievance to trade and so injurious to our manufactures in england that even the possibility of their doing so is an unanswerable reason against their bill and proves that it not only is not necessary as they pretend but that it is absolutely necessary their power of imposing upon the market as above should be restrained  the second head is the quantity which they pretend is imported to which the turkey merchants have annexed no evidence expecting to be taken upon their words this quantity they allege to be about an hundred bales a year but this the italian merchants deny and appeal to the customhouse books for their proof also they have proved at the house of commons that in the current year all the raw silk imported at leghorn from france amounts to no more than thirty six bales and that italy for expense of their own silk manufacture annually uses two or three hundred bales of turkey raw silk  the last is that this is injurious to the turkey trade and this they explain two ways   that it is the return of the french cloths sold in turkey and consequently assists the french in their sale of cloth in turkey   that it ruins the market for the turkey raw silk here at london by sinking the price of it so as to make the merchant lose by his goods or keep them on his hands unsold   the first is incumbent on the levant company to prove which they only barely asserted when on the contrary the italian merchants proved that from leghorn according to the constant course of trade all the turkey raw silk imported from italy was the return of english manufactures and to this they offered to call merchants who had resided there for these forty years last past  to the second the italian merchants say that the affording all commodities to our manufactures cheap is a general benefit and the importing them dear will make our neighbors undersell us  now neither of these being true as above how will it appear that this trade is injurious to the turkey trade from and to england  the appearance of these things being thus and all these pretenses for the bill being thus repealed and exposed it leads me to the original design of the turkey merchants pushing this affair so warmly and to enquire what must be the true reasons for their desiring the bill to stop the importation of so small a quantity of raw silk as communibus annis is brought into england from leghorn  and this question necessarily carries me back to view the state of the turkey trade which i shall study to do as clearly and with as much brevity as i have done the french  the trade to turkey is carried on in a company their charter their privileges their manner of carrying on their trade is known the number of persons concerned in their trade or free of their company is great they tell us they are above two hundred and others may and indeed all even the italian merchants themselves may be free of this company paying the usual fine at their admission and taking the freedom of the city also  but i suppose it will not be contended that the gross of the trade to turkey is carried on by a very few men and even of those few a yet fewer number have the governing influence of the trade and can go far very far to limit the rest by their interest to ship or not to ship trade or not to trade as their quantities of goods abroad or at home want a market or want a price  and as this is an article which renders the company a most effectual monopoly when they make use of it so it is evident that it is but a little while since they did effectually make use of it to the great injury of the trade and this power together with an oath every merchant must take if he will come in to be free of this company and which subjects him to be subject to such monopolizing arts as those is the reason why the italian merchants have always declined the company and carried on their trade to turkey by the way of leghorn  in favor of this trade which as it is a fair and just branch of commerce and was found to be very considerable but above all as it was found to be a just check upon the turkey company and calculated to prevent the encroachment they were always apt to run into for their private ends to the injury of the english trade and art of navigation a law particularly calculated for the encouragement of trade and the increase of our shipping thought fit by a clause on purpose to make provision for the trade of the said italian merchants and that they should be allowed to import the asiatick goods by way of leghorn  and here i must say lies the whole stress of the bill now depending it is this trade to turkey by the way of leghorn that the turkey merchants push at the bringing some french raw silk by accident and on an extraordinary occasion when it may be very cheap in france and very dear in england this is made the specious pretense but is nothing in the case it is the italian merchants trading to turkey via leghorn that is the grievance this is that they shoot at though they set up the other as a blind  to clear themselves of this and if they would have the house believe them to be as good patriots as they pretend why do they not declare openly that they desire nothing but to prevent the bringing in turkey raw silk bought of the french that the french may not be encouraged to carry on the turkey trade to their disadvantage and to send greater quantities of french cloth to turkey and the like  had this been the real and only thing they had sought what need had they to strike at the root of the italian trade which is so much more considerable and advantageous than their own why petition for the repeal of a clause which admits them to bring home the returns of their trade to turkey why had they not only prayed that an act might pass to prohibit raw silk from france being imported by way of leghorn in which all the italian merchants would readily have concurred and are still ready to do it  or on the other hand if they were not ashamed at thus publicly aiming to monopolize both the cloth trade in turkey and the silk trade in england i say if they were not ashamed of such an open attempt to engross an exclusive trade and that they could think a house of commons the guardians of liberty could be capable of being brought into such an invasion of the liberties of trade why did they not petition fairly that the italian merchants might not carry english cloths and tin into turkey via leghorn or in a word that if they did they should not be allowed to bring back the returns of it into england  this had been indeed to have acted with less cunning but with more honesty than to aim and strike fairly at this prohibition under pretense of prohibiting bringing in french turkey silk a thing which as it is proved is seldom done so it is plain it can never be done but to our advantage and the loss of the french merchants unless it be as above when the turkey merchants have put the dice upon the market and raised the price to an unreasonable and injurious height and then the refuge of a french market or of any other market would be but a justice to the manufactures and a just check upon the engrossers  it seems necessary in the next place to give a short state of this bytrade as they would call it from italy to turkey or from england to turkey by way of italy  the turkey merchants take much pains to represent this article as very small and inconsiderable but why then do they not propose to the parliament that in the bill they solicit for a clause be reserved for leaving this little small inconsiderable trade entirely free and its returns free to be brought home if it be small the damage to them must likewise be small why is it so hotly opposed and attacked if it were really so small and inconsiderable as they represent it i can answer for the italian merchants that they would not have struggled with them for the preserving it and even the opposition made to them by the italian merchants is an evidence to all the world that it is very far from being a small and inconsiderable trade  by this very thing the whole quarrel may be decided if the turkey merchants aim only at and desire only the preventing the bringing french turkey silk hither and are willing to leave the italian trade to turkey and back to england by the way of leghorn open as it always was let them say so ask for that and the italian merchants will heartily join with them but while they thus push at one thing under pretense of another they most plainly discover what they endeavor to conceal  it is meet therefore to put this affair in a clear light the italian merchants trade to turkey by way of leghorn is far from being small or inconsiderable they export and sell in turkey from  0 to  0 thousand pounds a year in english cloth and in tin lead etc a considerable sum and they bring back the returns of it to leghorn  great part of those returns being sold in italy the produce of which must be clear gain to the public stock of great britain it would be very hard if they should be denied the privilege of english men and of bringing home the rest to sell in their own country as markets may present  except in the cases already mentioned they bring no silk from marseilles and nothing but the exorbitances of the turkey company imposing upon the markets as before can make it practicable if the house thinks fit even to prevent it under those exorbitances they submit it wholly to the wisdom of parliament but they humbly hope they have a right of property in common with the rest of his majestys faithful subjects to bring back and vend in open market the returns of the english woollen cloths and other products of their own country which they export and without which they cannot carry on their trade  while the company oppose so just a request how can they take it ill that we say they are a dangerous monopoly and how can they clear themselves of the charge while they seek to be the only exporters of cloth to the whole turkish empire and the only importers of raw silk to the kings dominions is it not plain that in this case they would consult their own advantages rather than the demands or occasions of the manufacturers  this is the article the company visibly press for and it cannot be denied but it is of great consequence to them that is to say to them personally and as a company but the more it is so of the more fatal consequence would it be to the trade in general seeing they would as above put their own price upon their woollen cloth at home to the impoverishing if not destruction of the manufacturer and their own price upon their silk at home nor would it weigh with them that by this conduct they would lessen the consumption of english cloth in turkey and to hold it up to a price for their private gain keep it always scarce at market forbidding their members in england to ship but in general ships sometimes once a year sometimes once in two years or more as they think fit without regarding that by this means there would be many thousands of cloths less exported than the markets would otherwise carry off to the irreparable damage and discouragement of woollen manufactures and the encouragement of the french and the ruin of the clothiers who when they had made large quantities of cloth for the turkey trade must be obliged to keep them on hand or perhaps sell them under price to two or three rich moneyed men who make use of the necessities of the poor clothiers for that very advantage all which still proclaims them a set of monopolizers in the worst sense of the word  and this very practice throws another charge back upon them which they never can get off from and which they now endeavor to put upon the italian merchants viz that whereas they allege that the italian merchants are the supporter of the french trade to turkey the contrary of which is manifest the turkey company by not duly supplying the markets by laying mulcts and restraints upon the english cloth which comes there by way of leghorn by swearing their factors and servants not to sell any of their goods but for present payment whereas the french give credit where there is any certainty or security of being paid by these i say and many such like methods they are themselves the encouragers and indeed the supporters of the french trade to turkey who on the contrary were the markets constantly and fully supplied and proper measures for trade pursued as would be if the trade were opened as it might be would not be able to vend one quarter part of the cloth which they now sell there i do not mean by this totally to lay open the turkey trade but humbly hope your lordships in your great wisdom will put it on the foot the russia company was by an act of the   th of king william and queen mary and i do believe such an act would effectually drive the french out of the turkey trade and have the same effect that had viz that instead of six or seven sail of ships the then russia company annually employed and the now turkey company annually employs the next year the russia merchants sent  0 sail of ships and do now annually employ above a hundred and twenty and our english manufactories are now carried to places where before they were never so much as heard of and this would be the case of the turkey trade were the levant company regulated by a like act of parliament and the honor of the english nation kept up with a much less charge on our manufactures than it now is for the trade being more diffusive half per cent instead of two would be sufficient to defray the necessary national charge  so that in a word it is the turkey company who encourage the french and many ways this may be made out as for example the    d of may   0  by laying a mulct of five dollars per cloth on all english cloth which comes thither from leghorn when the french cloth comes in free forbidding english cloth from leghorn to come in english ships but permitting english ships to bring french and dutch cloth free as above they tell us if we stop the french silk from coming hither we destroy them at once how can they impose this upon mankind when it is known that all the cloth the french merchant can send to turkey will not supply the demand they have for silk in france but they buy a great deal with ready money as was the case those two years      and      when they lost so much money by it as almost ruined them all and what must our poor manufacturers have done in england in those two years had they not been supplied by the italian merchants buying that silk cheap is it not evident their goods must have cost them here  0 l per cent more than the french and italians could have imported them at the consequence of which must have been that our english manufacturers must have been starved and wrought silks from all our neighboring manufactories instead of turkey raw silks would have been run in upon us from abroad  it is denied and has already been explained that turkey raw silk ever did or ever can come from france hither by way of leghorn in the ordinary course of trade it is plain it can never come but when their markets in france are so full and so low as that they must sell it to great loss or when our markets starved by the cunning of the company are so extravagantly dear that to reduce the price will be our gain so that in short to bring the turkey silk in either of those two junctures will be always to our gain and to the loss of the french and in which of these two lies the advantage to france i would fain have these gentlemen answer  but let us examine next what disadvantage the turkey company can pretend to suffer from the italian trade can any merchants complain of the competitors who cannot trade under them but at a disadvantage of  0 or    per cent and if they please  0 or  0 per cent unless means can be found to evade the force of their impositions it cannot be the advantage must lie somewhere else and it is manifest it does so viz in the having power by an exclusive trade to impose other rates and prices upon the markets abroad and at home than they have ever yet been able to do this it is they aim at and this they find they can come at no other way but by putting a stop to the merchants sending cloth to turkey by way of leghorn and bringing back the silk to london and this they cannot expect but by persuading the world to believe than which nothing can be more false that this silk comes from france  again to prove the inconsistence of this pretense i would desire those merchants to calculate the price which this silk costs the french merchants in turkey whether it be bought for cloth or for money let them add to it the charges of carrying first to marseilles then bringit from marseilles to leghorn then shipping it again for england commission in all those places and charges of sundry sorts also insurance and the like and then let them take the price in france and at london at the same time and tell us if the french gain or lose by the trade if the first let them prevent it by such legal methods as they shall think fit if the last which i affirm is true what can be the meaning of so warmly engaging against a trade which the french lose money by  i observe in several of the cases given out by the turkey company they would be thought very popular and claim it of the world that they are the great encouragers of the woollen manufacture and that they not only export great quantities but that they take all proper measures to encourage the consumption of it in the country whither they carry it  but were this true how comes it that there are so many bylaws for the discouraging any one to bring it thither but themselves such as laying a mulct or duty of    dollars per bale upon all the english cloth that shall come by way of leghorn not allowing it to be brought in english ships when at the same time as before the dutch and french cloth as i have observed already may come in english bottoms also forbidding their factors there to sell any english cloth but for the company and the like  let any indifferent person judge whether this is encouraging or whether it is not rather a visible combination to discourage and destroy the trade of our english cloth in turkey  with what assurance can these men bring a rabble of packers and clothdressers clothiers and dyers and other mechanics up to the door of the house to solicit in their cause as if the whole manufacture was concerned which is making the poor ignorant clothworkers and manufacturers so many soliciters against themselves and bringing them to be parties to their own destruction as manufacturers  so also they bring the pewterers and dealers in tin insinuating that they are great benefactors to the tinmines supposing perhaps that this may have some influence on such members as represent the stannary towns and who are supposed to have estates in the mines of tin in the counties of devon and cornwall but are they so ignorant as to imagine that the cornish gentlemen do not know that the italian merchants are much greater exporters of tin than the turkey merchants even to above double the quantity and that as well to turkey as italy which things if duly known and if the italian merchants were as much inclined to make themselves popular and needeed it as these men do would presently bring the manufacturers dyers dealers in tin and the like to appear on their side rather than on the other  but i leave all these little things as artifices too mean to be taken notice of and fit only to assist a bad cause i come next to enter into the merit of this question with regard to the navigation it must be of some concern to let the world see how many ways this company who value themselves so highly are an obstruction and discouragement to our navigation and to the employing both shipping and seamen even in this very trade in which they would pretend to recommend themselves  they were indeed inquired of at the bar of the house how many ships they employed to turkey in a year and though i hear they answered falsely and said ten which is more than they employ and in some years send none at all yet at best what number of ships is this to boast of or to give them any claim to be encouragers of navigation  on the other hand the italian merchants allege that they hinder by their limitations upon the trade ten times more ships being employed than all the trade they carry on employs though they have all the grand seigniors dominions for their trade the others only italy they employ   or   ships a year the italian trade near   0 to  00 many of which lie mouldring in port while the french and other foreign vessels thanks to the companys by laws and restrictions run away with all the freights to turkey whilst our ships for want of employ as usual in the levant are obliged to return home empty  which way shall these men be discoursed with let impartial men but hear their argument how incoherent how inconsistent with itself if they talk of our importation to england it is exceeding great on the other hand if they talk of our exportation from england it is exceeding small though we vend and send  0 or  0000 l a year in english cloth to turkey by way of leghorn  if we speak of our trade to turkey they tell us one ship a year will bring all our returns and there is not above  00 cloths a year brought into turkey and yet at the same time speak of our returns as a thing fatal to their trade to avoid the absurdity of these things they insist and affirm that the silk we import is from france offering nothing to prove it but their affirming positively that it is so the credit of which the italian merchants desire to be excused as to their giving any weight to and as positively deny it  but there is a way how the turkey merchants may obtain all that they asked and which if it may be obtained no cloth will be carried to turkey via leghorn any more and no raw silk be brought from france via leghorn any more no clamor against the turkey companys being a monopoly will be made any more no interruption to our navigation will be made by the company more but the trade will flourish the company will be enriched and the nation also and this is but by laying open the trade to all mankind on the foot of the russia company to trade freely and unconfined to send out ships when they will and by what ways they will and every body being left to push their own trade there is no doubt but the grand seigniors dominions and the kingdoms and countries of persia georgia armenia and the caspian sea might if encouragement was given them consume much more english cloth than is now sold among them  this and no other is the way effectually to increase the trade to ruin the french manufactories of cloth and to encourage both the english manufacture and navigation and in this case a few years would bring the turkey trade not to employ seven ships a year but seventy and perhaps sevenscore ships  for then would all the trade be encouraged together and those ships that had a hundred and perhaps two hundred bales of cloth on board would run away take in freight for other places as for genoa leghorn naples messina and so to smyrna or constantinople and thus instead of few ships there would be many sail in a year employed  and then the trade would appear as it indeed is very considerable whereas now it is contracted it is limited and indeed by those limitations it is almost quite lost  the russian company is an instance of this who while they were under the like limitations as the turkey company sent usually   or   ships a year to archangel whereas they now employ above   0 sail of large ships a year one year with another and they export infinitely more woollen manufactures to that country than ever they did before and thus pushing the trade on with all the art and with the utmost diligence they have brought infinite numbers more of people to use the british manufacture than ever used it before  the like is before us and the like advantages offer themselves for by this one act  viz of laying the trade open industry would have her hands at liberty to struggle and to push the trade into countries and among inhabitants that were never heard of before methods would then be used by the vigilant merchant to send his goods and to sell his goods without exacting ready money where payment was sure leaving the factor a discretionary power to act as for himself  as the trade would thus be bettered so the encouragement to shipping the increase of seamen and above all the consumption of our manufactures would be enlarged and then the mockcomplaint of the importation of raw silk from marseilles would be at an end neither would there be any occasion of a bill to prevent the importation of asiatick goods from leghorn every merchant having a liberty in the course of his own business to bring away the returns directly  likewise as a far greater number of ships would go to turkey having but part of their loading thither from england and having the liberty to take in goods for leghorn naples and messina in their way to turkey so in their return having part of their loading for italy or england there being a constant trade to and from turkey to italy the freight of which is considerable they will be enabled to take the rest of their loading in italian goods at messina naples or leghosn as opportunity presents or as their employers direct so that in this case the end of the act of navigation which as i said before was to increase and encourage english seamen and english shipping especially ships of force would much better be answered than by carrying on a narrow contracted trade as now they do managed by about thirty merchants only and those thirty managd again by two or three by which the whole commerce is straightend the consumption of english cloth hindered and the dutch and french encouraged to carry cloth to turkey and worm us out of the trade  this laying open the trade may with ease be so regulated as that the ambassadors consuls and other officers necessary to act there may be still maintained and all the necessary expenses of the trade be supplied either by the commerce itself or by the public for which suitable provision may be made as to the wisdom of the parliament shall seem meet and for the complete and easy direction whereof a scheme of suitable measures shall be presented to the house whenever such a thing shall come upon the stage nor is there any doubt to be made but that the italian merchants will be able to answer all the objections that can be justly brought against such a change of the companys constitution  by the aforesaid case which i think i have stated impartially it is humbly hoped that the italian merchants as englishmen have a natural right to the trade to the grand seigniers dominions i shall only give the heads of some few restrictive orders and instance others whereby they have taxed our woollen manufactures and navigation and prohibited even their own members from trading in such manner and at such times as they thought proper and your lordships may then judge whether a company with power or assuming a power to make restrictive laws be a monopoly or not  the first is a mulct of  0 per
