the law of liberty or royal law by which all mankind will certainly be judged  the law of liberty or royal law by which all mankind will certainly be judged  earnestly recommended to the serious consideration of all slaveholders and slavedealers  by granville sharp  so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty jam ii    london printed for b white at horaces head in fleet street and e and c dilly in the poultry  mdcclxxvi  the law of liberty or royal law in two former tracts i have attempted to describe the just limitation of slavery in the laws of god and the law of passive obedience with respect more particularly to the due submission of christian servants or slaves to their masters  the purpose of the present tract is not only to point out the reciprocal duty of christian masters to their servants and all other persons with whom they are connected but also more particularly to enable our british american slaveholders to examine or measure with very little trouble by the rule of gods holy word the legality or illegality of slavery among christians for this purpose some of the clearest and most essential maxims or principles of scripture are selected and compared with each other in the following pages  so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty  this the earnest advice of the apostle james in his general epistle ii    and as it is therefore manifest that we shall certainly be judged by the law of liberty it becomes a business of the utmost importance to ascertain what particular law is thereby to be understood that we may write it on our hearts since our everlasting happiness depends upon it and the peril of eternal damnation seems to attend a breach of it for he shall have judgment without mercy says the apostle in the following verse who has showed no mercy the necessary premises for the examination of the question are nothing less than the fundamental moral principles of christianity and if i am rather prolix in defining them i hope the importance of the subject will be considered as a sufficient excuse for indeed the subject is not only important to those persons for whose use this tract is particularly intended  i mean those persons who desire to be satisfied concerning the legality or illegality of slavery among christians but to all mankind besides of every rank and denomination  all the moral duties of the gospel are briefly comprehended in two single principles of the law of moses viz the love of god and the love of our neighbor nothing therefore can be esteemed truly lawful under the gospel that is in the least repugnant to either of these and we need never be at a loss to distinguish what is or what is not so if we will but carefully consider the proportion or degree of that love which is clearly expressed to be due both to god and our neighbor in these two comprehensive and eternal maxims the degree of love due to god exceeds all comparison or consideration of other things for it must says the text be  with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might deuteronomy vi   which necessarily implies a most fervent zeal for the glory of god far exceeding all worldly considerations and with respect to the degree or true proportion of love due to our neighbor we have no pretense to plead ignorance since the appointed measure of it is contained in every mans breast  thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself lev xix    on these two commandments said the eternal judge hang all the law and the prophets mat    0 the same eternal judge of mankind made also on another occasion a similar declaration concerning the sum or compendium of the law and the prophets  all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you said he do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets matthew vii    this most excellent rule of conduct and behavior toward our neighbors which includes the whole substance or spirit of the law and the prophets so perfectly corresponds with the second great commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves viz to manifest our love by doing to them as we ourselves might with reason and justice expect and desire they would do unto us that it seems intended like a sort of paraphrase to explain the true tenor of it for though the mode of expression is different yet the effect of the doctrine is undoubtedly the same because the apostle paul has in like manner declared this second great commandment to be the compendium of all the law all the law says he is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself gal v     selflove therefore must be the rule or measure not of selfgratification or private interest but of our conduct and behavior toward other men it must not be sole tenant of the heart but is always to leave equal room for a due balance of that love which we owe to our neighbor whenever the present circumstances whatever they may be require a conscientious regard to the public good or a sympathetick consideration for the feelings and sufferings of individuals to enable us to fulfill our duty to our neighbor selflove is not hereby excluded for selfpreservation and a prudent regard for our own support and happiness may still be allowed an equal share of our consideration without a breach of this second great commandment which would otherwise be too hard and difficult for human nature to receive we are not commanded therein to love our neighbors more than ourselves but only  as ourselves so that selflove is apparently the true measure of our conduct and behavior toward other men and though an exalted sense of duty to god according to the first great commandment may in some particular cases prompt men to noble actions wherein selflove may seem to be lost in a generous and benevolent regard to others of which there are several instances in scripture as i have elsewhere shown   see my tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man p      0   and also though the like admirable generosity and perfect disinterestedness may possibly upon some unforeseen occasion become likewise the peculiar duty of any one of us viz to lay down our lives for the brethren   hereby perceive we or rather it should be rendered hereby have we perceived the love of god because he laid down his life for us said the apostle and then he immediately informs us of the duty which arises from that extraordinary manifestation of love and we ought says he to lay down our lives for the brethren   john iii    this plain declaration of our duty  etc we ought to lay down our lives etc sufficiently enables us to account for the many extraordinary examples of selflove being superseded by more noble principles some of which i have cited in my tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man p      0  to which also the following may be added  the gratitude of the galatians to their teacher paul is expressed by that apostle in the strongest terms  i bear you record says he that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me gal iv     not inferior to this was the love of that same apostle himself toward the corinthians though they were so far from returning a mutual affection like the galatians that the apostle it seems had reason to complain of their ingratitude  i will very gladly spend and be spent for you literally for your souls said he though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved   cor xii     to spend and be spent for others and that very gladly is the strongest expression of disinterested love that could have been chosen it implies a cheerful sacrifice of every thing that is dear in this world life itself not excepted and greater love has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends john xv    so that as no man can have greater love than this we may certainly esteem it the highest demonstration of perfect love and as the sentence last quoted from the apostle john relates in its primary application to the voluntary sacrifice which christ made of himself to save mankind it leads us to the true foundation of that perfect love enjoined in the scriptures which as the preceding examples demonstrate does occasionally overcome the general principle of selflove and every other interested motive natural to man  the apostle john informs us no less than twice in one chapter that god is love    john iv    ibid v     this information is introduced in an argument whereby the apostle endeavors to inculcate a due sense of the necessity we are laid under to love one another because god has first loved us so that gratitude to god must be the foundation of our love to one another and we are therefore bound to imitate and will certainly endeavor to imitate if god dwells in us see   john iv      that glorious attribute of the divine nature love god is love which he has manifested toward us by sacrificing all that could be truly perfect and dear in his sight even his only begotten son who also voluntarily submitted himself for our happiness and eternal welfare to the most severe temporal sufferings and trials even unto death  to god and to the eternal word therefore to whom we are indebted not only for that extraordinary manifestation of love but for all other things that we enjoy even for our very existence our return of love must be unlimited and the natural principle of selflove which is given as the measure of our love to our neighbor in the law of liberty or second great commandment must be entirely suppressed whenever it falls in competition with the love of god enjoined in the first great commandment and though this doctrine is very hard and difficult to be received and much more difficult to be practiced as it includes the most exalted heroism and greatness of soul that human nature is capable of attaining yet we have ample reason to hope and trust as the discharge of our duty to our neighbor includes and fulfils the most essential part of our duty to god that those men who carefully endeavor to make the law of liberty i mean the second great commandment their general or ordinary rule of conduct in life will not want due assistance from the almighty to enable them to fulfill also the duty which arises from the first great commandment even unto death if any extraordinary emergency should require such a manifestation of their love because we are assured by the scriptures that god dwells in those men who maintain the proper measure of love and benevolence for the rest of mankind  beloved said the beloved apostle let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loves is born of god and knows god he that loves not knows not god for god is love in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwells in us and his love is perfected in us   john iv       and again in the   th verse  we have known and believed the love that god has to us god is love and he that dwells in love dwells in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect etc      john iii    yet as this far exceeds the measure of love laid down in the second great commandment which is given us as the general or ordinary rule of life we may be assured that such a very difficult duty as that of laying down our lives for the brethren can only be required of us on very extraordinary occasions as in times of persecution or on other such pressing emergencies when some very singular good or benefit to our friends our country or mankind in general apparently depends upon our perseverance unto death for their sakes in a just cause to the glory of god or to the manifestation of his revealed truth for their confirmation and example this is indeed the best and most noble foundation not only for true patriotism in all men as members respectively of some particular nation but also for universal benevolence as citizens of the world which latter duty should always regulate and limit the former viz patriotism by the eternal rules of natural equity and justice but though a cheerful obedience in this ultimate duty of laying down our lives and sacrificing selflove and every temporal blessing for the good of others does undoubtedly exalt human nature to the highest pitch of heroism and real dignity let us all nevertheless pray god as in effect we do by that comprehensive expression in our daily prayers  lead us not into temptation to preserve us from any such severe trials of our obedience and love to him as the necessity of of laying down our lives for the brethren lest through the want of presence of mind or unwariness or through weakness and natural infirmity any of us should unhappily shrink back from that ultimate duty and thereby incur the dreadful condemnation of those that deny christ before men let us also be truly thankful that the absolute command in the second great branch of our duty by which all mankind are to be judged as shall hereafter be shown extends no farther than to limit selflove by a sympathetick consideration or fellowfeeling for our neighbors welfare lest the former selflove should be considered as the proper and universal principle of action and thereby endanger the peace and happiness of society by its partial instigations let me add too that if selflove is not thus restrained it will defeat its own purpose and fixed principles of selfpreservation by incurring a dreadful and eternal doom  the omission of an act of mercy and benevolence toward our neighbor when it is in our power and occasion requires it is declared by our lord the savior of the world to be as gross an affront even to himself as if he had been personally neglected and denied by us inasmuch says he as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me matt xxv    and if sins of omission even toward the meanest of our brethren are by our lord esteemed as a personal affront to himself we may be assured that the actual commission of injuries will be infinitely more heinous in his sight and cannot escape his just vengeance we must remember also that this declaration of our lord will be made to those miserable wretches who shall stand on the left hand after the tremendous final sentence is passed upon them depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels see verse     it is manifest therefore that a violalation of the love that is due to our neighbor is a violation also of the love of god and on the contrary the latter is perfected by a strict obedience to the former  if we love one another says the beloved apostle god dwells in us and his love is perfected in us   john iv    so that the two great commandments appear to be reciprocally included and blended together in their consequences by which we may more readily perceive the propriety of our lords declaration that the second great commandment is like unto the first   thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets matt xxii    to  0  and this reciprocal connection between them enables us also to comprehend the reason why the second is given alone when both are undoubtedly necessary as the grand test of christian obedience and as the sum and essence of the whole law of god for all the law is fulfilled says the apostle paul in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself gal v     now a continued multiplication of statutes as in england where the number exceeds the capacity of the human memory affords matter only for equivocation doubt and evasion whereby sound law is vitiated and corrupted and the loathsome prostitute still retaining the name of law arises like the harlot popery from pure christianity in another dress she is clothed with the manycoloured garment of misconstruction and seats herself at the right hand of the unjust judge prompting him with wily subterfuges and bad precedents instead of law whereby he is enabled to ensnare the innocent and screen the guilty but on the other hand when we consider that all law is reduced to so small a compass that it may be accounted comparatively as one word there is no room left for offenders to plead ignorance as an excuse for having violated the general laws of morality and the natural rights of mankind let me therefore exhort my opponents as they regard their own eternal welfare to take this subject into their most serious consideration and no longer refuse to acknowledge this glorious word or maxim as the true measure except a still greater measure of love is required   this exception relates only to such extraordinary cases of emergency as are mentioned in pages    to    of all their actions and more especially with respect to the present point before us the legality or illegality of slavery among christians for this question by infallible necessity falls under the decision of this very law because it sets before us our own personal feelings as the proper measure or standard of our behavior to other men for tyrants slaveholders extortioners and other oppressors would most certainly dislike to be treated as as they treat others so that this compendious law necessarily excludes the least toleration of slavery or of any other oppression which an innocent man   on the other hand notorious offenders that are clearly convicted of their crimes by the laws of the land may consistently with reason and justice be punished with a temporary deprivation of liberty provided they be not sold to strangers nor even to their own countrymen to be subjected to private dominion or the absolute rule of individuals which is dreadfully baneful to morality the community at large and that community only whose laws they have broken can alone have any right to detain them in bondage and this right of detaining should be moderated by such wholesome regulations for the religious instruction as well as employment of the unhappy convicts as should apparently tend more to their reformation to render them worthy of being speedily restored to liberty than to any other object and no persons whatsoever should be entrusted with the care instruction or employment of such public delinquents without being subject to the inspection and legal control of the kings judges and of other regular crown officers of the law department but of no other crown officers as such whatever as also of the county courts of assizes and sessions courts of inquest grand juries justices of the peace sheriffs and of such other legal guardians of the public peace for and in behalf of the public lest the cause of liberty should suffer by the influence of any innovation in that respect would be unwilling to experience in his own person from another  we must therefore acknowledge this heavenly maxim to be the true standard not only of mutual benevolence among men but also of our love and duty to god since it includes the first great commandment by perfecting the love of god in us as i have before remarked see p  0 so that it must necessarily be esteemed the most sure and best foundation of perfect liberty and accordingly we find it expressly distinguished in scripture by the title of the law of liberty  so speak ye and so do says the apostle james as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty james ii    this title properly belongs indeed to the whole law or gospel of christ and seems to be so applied by the same apostle in the preceding chapter   th verse wherein he speaks of the perfect law of liberty  yet the general application of the title does not lessen the propriety of that particular application which i conceive to have been intended by the apostle in this  d chapter because the precept in question is a complete compendium of christian morality containing as i have before observed the very essence of the whole gospel or general law of liberty with respect to our duty toward men and has therefore an indisputable right also to the general title of the whole but there are other reasons to justify the application of this general title of the gospel to that one comprehensive word or maxim in which all the law is fulfilled  though the apostle james seems to mean the whole gospel in that passage of his first chapter wherein he mentions the perfect law of liberty  yet the whole tenor of his argument in the  d chapter where he again mentions the law of liberty is apparently founded on the principles of the glorious maxim in question  thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself for the subject in the beginning of the chapter particularly relates to the duty we owe to our neighbors being a warning against respect of persons or partiality and as the maxim in question forbids even selfpreference by directing us to love our neighbors  as ourselves it is so apparently suitable to the apostles subject that he expressly cites it under the eminent title of the  royal law  to enforce his argument my brethren says he have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons and then after charging them in the  d and  d verses with partiality in preferring a welldressed man in their assemblies to the poor and after appealing to them thereupon in the  th and  th verses saying are ye not partial in yourselves etc and also after reproving them in the  th and  th verses for despising the poor he adds in the  th verse  if ye fulfill says he  the royal law  according to the scripture thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself which is the very maxim in question ye do well but if ye have respect to persons says he thereby plainly pointing out this partiality as a direct breach of the said royal law ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors for whosoever shall keep the whole law continues the apostle and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law so speak ye and so do ye as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty manifestly referring us to the indispensible principle of doing as we would be done by or to that which is exactly parallel  the loving our neighbors as ourselves for he shall have judgment without mercy said the apostle that has showed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment james ii   to     this absolute necessity that we are laid under to show mercy that we may obtain mercy is apparently founded on the very same principle which our lord declared to be the law and the prophets that is the sum and essence of the whole scriptures as i have before remarked  all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets mat vii    and i have already shown in p   that this comprehensive maxim is exactly the same in effect though expressed in different words as the second great commandment of our lord thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself in which as the apostle paul has expressly declared all the law is fulfilled viz  all the law says he is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself gal v     this one word as the maxim is esteemed by the apostle paul is therefore undoubtedly that glorious law of liberty by which we shall all be judged as the apostle james has fairly warned us  so speak ye and so do says he as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty and therefore if what has already been said be duly considered the propriety of citing this glorious and comprehensive law of liberty in vindication of the natural liberty of mankind against the tyranny of slaveholders cannot be doubted or called in question for though this supreme law virtually prohibits every other kind of oppression yet its very title leads us to a more particular and express application of it against the toleration of slavery among christians because it seems to be thus eminently distinguished by the appointment of god himself in his holy word as the peculiar antidote against that baneful evil slavery which is most opposite and repugnant to its glorious title  the law of liberty this law of liberty this supreme this royal law must therefore be our guide in the interpretation and examination of all laws which relate to the rights of persons because it excludes partiality or respect of persons and consequently removes all ground for the pretense of any absolute right of dominion inherent in the masters over their slaves for as all ranks of men are equal in the sight of god the christian slave or servant being the freeman of the lord and the christian master the servant of christ   cor vii    there is no doubt but that the same christian qualities are necessary to be maintained by the christian master that are required of the christian servant as humility forgiveness of trespasses or debts and though not submission yet certainly brotherly love toward inferiors with unfeigned charity and universal benevolence founded on the glorious maxim or royal law thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself all which are as indispensably necessary to form the disposition of a true christian master as they are absolutely incompatible with the oppressive and tyrannical claims of our american slaveholders quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris what thou would not have done to thee do not thou to another  was the favorite maxim of the emperor alexander severus according to the report of lampridius quoted by the learned jos mede book   p   0 this principle was probably deduced from the royal law or law of liberty for lampridius relates that the emperor heard it either from some jews or christians  quod a quibusdam sive judoeis sive christianis audierat et tenebat etc and it cannot be denied that the doctrine of it is necessarily included in that great and indispensable commandment the doctrine was expressed even by christ himself nearly to the same effect which i have already quoted  all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets mat vii    so that slavery is absolutely inconsistent with christianity because we cannot say of any slaveholder that he does not to another what he would not have done to himself for he is continually exacting involuntary labor from others without wages which he would think monstrously unjust were he himself the sufferer nay many of them are so besotted with avarice that they are not content with reaping the whole fruit of other mens labor upon earth without wages   woe unto him that builds his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that uses his neighbors service without wages and gives him not for his work jer xxii     but would deprive their poor laborers even of their eternal comfort if they could exact a little more work from them by reducing them nearer to the state of brutes  what i advance cannot be denied for it is notorious that many masters oppose the instruction of their slaves in christian knowledge and but very few promote it as they ought so that the iniquity of the ignorant slave must rest with double weight on the guilty head of the owner to fill up the measure of his sins  suppose a reverse of fortune  that an english or scotch slaveholder or slavedealer is shipwrecked on the barbary coast and is retained as a slave by the moors who seize him or is sold as such to another person according to the detestable customs of that savage people  would he esteem himself the lawful property of his tawney master because the wretched police of those barbarians in tolerating slavery is similar to his own former practices as an american slaveholder or african trader would he not think it cruel treatment to be esteemed a mere chattel and as such to be ranked with the horses and oxen of his african master like them to be compelled by stripes to perform the most servile and abject labor like them to receive no wages or other reward for his service except a little coarse provender merely to keep him in working order for his masters benefit would he not think himself grievously injured by being forcibly detained and prevented from working for himself and would he not think himself absolutely robbed of the fruits of his own labor he would certainly have ample reason to lament the mahometans ignorance of the heavenly precept thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself for he would then be taught by his own sufferings to comprehend the full force extent and and meaning of that benevolent command which in his prosperity he was never willing to understand though the doctrine is so plain and obvious that there can be no excuse for misunderstanding it for unless the slaveholder can make it appear that his slave is not his neighbor he must necessarily acknowledge this law of liberty to be the true measure of his conduct and behavior toward his slave as well as toward all other men  let not slaveholders or african traders conceive that they are at liberty to receive or reject this glorious precept according as it may suit their interest or convenience but rather let them carefully examine for they are particularly interested in the determination of the question whether obedience to the doctrine of the great law of liberty is not absolutely indispensable and whether the violation of it is not dangerous to salvation  if they think there is any room to flatter themselves that they do not offend god by tolerating slavery among them let them but examine their actions by this royal law and they will clearly perceive both their guilt and danger unless they have consciences seared with a hot iron  if ye have respect unto persons says the apostle james when he enforces the observation of the royal law ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors etc ii   now this offense of having respect unto persons is a mark which strongly characterizes slaveholders as violaters of the royal law  they are courteous friendly and hospitable enough in general to persons of their own rank as indeed they ought to be but at the same time they look down upon their slaves who are equally their brethren as if they were not human beings and rank them as mere chattels with their horses and dogs so that there needs no argument to prove them guilty of having respect unto persons in a most notorious degree whereby they surely commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors what therefore have such men to expect when they shall be judged by the law of liberty especially as the apostle adds they shall have judgment without mercy that have showed no mercy etc  and even our lord himself has declared the very same doctrine though in different words  with the same measure that ye mete says he  shall it be measured unto you again  luke vi    mat vii   mark iv     what measure of benevolence therefore have these men to expect who endeavor to enrich themselves by enslaving and oppressing their brethren for men who without mercy or fellowfeeling have violated the royal law of liberty can neither be said to love god nor their neighbor as directed in the two great commandments and consequently are violaters of the whole law by which they absolutely deprive themselves of the benefit of christs redemption this seems to be the necessary meaning of that dreadful doom beforementioned he shall have judgment without mercy that has showed no mercy  but let no man conceive that i presume to charge individuals or any person in particular with the want of this mercy so necessary to salvation even though they are apparently guilty of that oppressive treatment of their neighbor which i now oppose for this would seem like setting bounds to the mency of god whereby i should be liable to involve myself as an uncharitable judge in the same condemnation and there are certainly a variety of circumstances beyond the reach of human knowledge that may extenuate the guilt of particular persons of which the great searcher of hearts alone can judge  it is not therefore the persons but the uncharitable practices of slaveholders and slavedealers that i now venture to condemn and these i can with confidence affirm to be really damnable or dangerous to salvation as being the most notorious violations of that christian charity or love of our neighbor which god indispensably requires of us and without which the highest gifts are vain and even faith itself for though i have all faith said the apostle paul so that i could remove mountains and have no charity i am nothing   cor xiii   the nature of this indispensable charity is more particularly described by the same apostle under the appellation of love  love says he works no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law romans xiii  0 but as the being detained in an involuntary slavery is one of the greatest ills or evils that can happen to our neighbor it must necessarily be allowed that he who causes or continues such an unnatural oppression of poor unfortunate strangers who never injured him nor his nor ever voluntarily contracted to serve him even for the shortest term much less for life such a man i say most certainly  works ill to his neighbor and consequently violates that saving love which is required for the fulfilling of the law for he that loves another says the apostle in a preceding verse of the same chapter has fulfilled the law and after repeating the several articles of the decalogue respecting our duty toward our neighbor he adds and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprchended in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself romans xiii     0 we may therefore fairly conclude that this glorious maxim is the touchstone or proof of that saving love which is the fulfilling of the law and without which faith is dead as declared by the apostle paul that it is also the royal law being thus eminently distinguished from all other precepts of the gospel by the apostle james and if it is not also particularly signified though i am fully convinced that it is under the title of the law of liberty by the same apostle in his  d chapter yet it is surely one of the most essential and comprehensive principles of that law of liberty by which we shall all be judged because the apostle at the same time declares that  he shall have judgment without mercy who has showed no mercy chap ii    by which he manifestly refers to the breach of that particular precept which ought to regulate the conduct of all mankind toward each other and therefore lastly we must acknowledge this same precept to be also the true measure or test on which our eternal doom will depend in that awful day when it shall be measured unto us again according to the measure of our actions as declared by the eternal judge himself mat vii   mark iv    luke vi    whose words cannot fail and if even a mere neglect or omission in our duty toward our neighbor is so offensive to our blessed lord that he esteems it as a denial and affront to his own person which i have already observed how much more offensive to him must be the actual commission of the grossest injuries such as the exaction of an involuntary service from our poor brethren without wages and the various cruelties usually practiced to enforce the same which are the necessary and unavoidable attendants on slavery  what a dreadful measure of retribution then may obstinate and unrepenting slaveholders and slavedealers justly expect from the righteous judge surely there is but too much cause to apprehend that christ will one day profess unto them  inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me mat xxv  0  this sentence indeed is applied in the text to those who shall have done good to their brethren yet by necessary consequence it is equally applicable as in the   th verse to those who have neglected or shown them no brotherly love and charity   inasmuch said our lord as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me and these by which our lord plainly referred to all that should neglect or violate that indispensible brotherly love and charity which he enjoined shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal  but alas  to worldly minded men the judgments of another world seem too far distant to awaken their attention though they are liable to be called away in the very next hour to a state of existence wherein the most pungent remorse will avail them nothing from such therefore and from those unrepenting individuals that will still persist in violating the law of liberty by slavedealing and slaveholding it is time to turn away i have already bestowed too much labor upon them i mean with respect to themselves but this warning was not intended for them alone  the whole community  every individual without excepting even those who never had the least concern in promoting slavery is personally interested in the consideration of this subject for if a breach of gods command even in the hidden crime of a single individual as in the case of achan could involve a whole nation in trouble    for achan the son of carmi  took of the accursed thing i e of that which was devoted to destruction by gods express command and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel joshua vii    thus the whole nation was involved in the consequences of achans guilt nay jehovah himself expressly imputed the action of that one individual to the nation at large until a solemn and public exertion of national justice had expiated that presumptive breach of his command for when joshua and the elders of israel lay prostrate before god lamenting the public calamity and disgrace which a late defeat of their army had brought upon the nation  the lord jehovah said unto joshua get thee up wherefore lie thou thus upon thy face israel has sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have stolen that is they have stolen  and they have dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff yet this general crime for so it was imputed was perpetrated by a single individual though the whole nation was doomed to suffer for it till the actual aggressor should be brought to public justice and this should teach us that the welfare of nations greatly depends on a strict administration of public justice and righteousness lest the state should be accountable for the crimes of individuals therefore the children of israel said jehovah himself could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they were accursed thus the curse was transferred to the people from the accursed thing until public justice could trace and transfer it to the devoted head of the guilty person  neither will i said jehovah be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among you see the whole chapter  and deprive them of gods blessing how much more hateful in the sight of god must be a public infringement of his royal law the perfect law of liberty by national authority  the african slave trade which includes the most contemptuous violations of brotherly love and charity that men can be guilty of is openly encouraged and promoted by the british parliament and the most detestable and oppressive slavery that ever disgraced even the unenlightened heathens is notoriously tolerated in the british colonies by the public acts of their respective assemblies  by acts that have been ratified with the assent and concurrence of british kings  the horrible guilt therefore which is incurred by slavedealing and slaveholding is no longer confined to the few hardened individuals that are immediately concerned in those baneful practices but alas the whole british empire is
