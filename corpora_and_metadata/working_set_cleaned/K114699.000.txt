the cause of the deluge demonstrated before i proceed to my present demonstration of the cause of the deluge i must premise this that in my new theory of the earth especially as improved and corrected in the second edition i have eviently shown that in case a comet passed by bere the earth in its annual course on the   th day of the second month from the autumnal equinox or nov    in the     th year before the christian era the phenomenon of nature and history and particularly the mosaic account of the deluge of noah which are no otherwise to be acounted for are exactly explained that the calcuations and proportions wherever we can come  them are on that hypothesis right agreeable to  another to ancient especially sacred history and to the system of astronomy that there are tras in ancient books of a tradition that a comet id appear at the very beginning of the deluge at the very month and day mentioned by moses  such its beginning is attested to by other old ecords and on this hypothesis by astronomical alculations also whence i concluded that it was most highly probable or rather physically demonstrable that a comet did pass by at that time and was under the conduct of the divine providence and as his instrument in punishing a wicked world the cause of that deluge the only thing wanting was to demonstrate from the period of some comet and its situation in the heavens astronomically stated and computed that such a comet did actually come by at that very time which if it could be once shown the whole must be owned as certain and demonstrated and all the natural corollaries therefrom must be allowed as true even by the obstinate and incredulous this indeed at first was looked upon by me as not at all to be expected since we then barely began to know or rather strongly to conjecture that comets did revolve about the sun in settled periods but without being able to determine any one of those periods but of late god has so blessed the labors of the learned and this part of astronomy is so much improved especially by the farther pains and observations of the great inventor himself sir isaac newton whose name will never be forgotten while mathematics and astronomy are preserved among mankind and by the laborious calculations of the acute dr halley on the principles laid down by the former that what was a few years ago almost despaired of is now in great measure discovered and we know not only that one comet has come round three or four times already in later ages viz ad             0  and      and will no doubt come round again ad      as making its period in about    years that another has probably come round in the same later ages twice already viz ad      and      and so is to return a d      or    0 as making its period in about     years but which is the greatest discovery of all that the last most remarkable comet whose descent into our regions has occasioned almost all the modern solid knowledge we have relating to the whole cometick system it self has also several times been seen already within the time of certain records i mean in the   th year before christ and again ad     or     and yet again ad   0  besides this its last appearance ad    0 whereby we know that it revolves in about     years this last comet i may well call the most remarkable one that ever appeared since besides the former consideration i shall presently show that it is no other than that very comet which came by the earth at the beginning of noahs deluge and which was the cause of the same now considering the premises i shall only have occasion in order to my present design to prove these five things concerning it   that no other of the known comets could pass by the earth at the beginning of the deluge   that this comet was of the same bigness with that which passed by at that time   that its orbit was then in a due position to pass by at that time   that its descending node was then also in a due position for the same passage by   that its period exactly agrees to the same time or in short that all the known circumstances of this comet do correspond and that it actually passed by on or about that very year and on or about that very day of the year when the deluge began all which things i shall demonstrate in their order  i none of the other comets yet known i mean of the    in dr halleys table and my solar system could be that which passed by the earth at the beginning of the deluge this appears by these certain arguments following    none of them appear to have been of a due bigness for the phenomenon of the deluge as i new theor  d edit co   lem   and p  0   0  have elsewhere showed require a small one in comparison of the earth whereas the rest of the comets seem to have been commonly larger than it    none of their descending orbits are duly situate i mean between  0 and  00 degrees from aries which position is yet absolutely necessary in this case for the precession of the equinox which is about  0 degrees added to the    degrees that the earth was distant from aries when the flood began must suppose the descending orbit of the comet to be now between  0 and  00 degrees from aries at which place none of the descending orbits of the other comets are now situate as dr halleys table and my solar system grounded thereon will readily show   none of the others nodes are so situate as is necessary to bring the comet near enough to our earth i mean between  0 or  00 degrees from aries and so as to cross the plane of the ecliptic very near to the distance of the earth from the sun as is also plain from the same table and system nay indeed the wrong situation of the descending orbits noted under the last head renders this due situation of the nodes plainly impossible for it being necessary that the orbit it self intersect the ecliptic it self in the   th degree of taurus this cannot possibly be in such a situation of the orbit as that we have already mentioned to belong to all the rest of the known comets so that these other comets were utterly incapable of being instrumental in the deluge even tho their periods should any of them agree which yet we know not that any of them do  ii this comet was of the same bigness with that which passed by at that time i mean a very small one and only  0 times as large as the moon v this appears by mr flamsteeds determination of its apparent diameter about  0 when it was nearly as far off as the sun whereas he supposes that of the moon at the same distance to be about   so that if due allowance be made for that large and dense part of the atmosphere which hides the nucleus or comet it self from us suppose   the diameter of the solid body it self will be only    now the cube of    or      is to the cube of   or     as about  0 to   whence it appears that this comet is about ten times so great as the moon or so great as the earth as the real comet that occasioned the deluge ought to be  iii the descending part of the orbit of this comet was about the   th degrees of taurus at the time of the deluge as that of the comet at the deluge must have been for this descending orbit is now in the  d degree of cancer and if we allow    degrees for its apparent motion since the deluge which is very little different from the real precession of the equinox the main if not only occasion of it it will appear to have been in the   th degree of taurus at that time according to the foregoing computation  iv the descending node of this comet which is of the greatest consideration here and liable to the greatest variety of all does also exceeding well agree in the present case for this is now in the  d degree of cancer and if we allow as before    degrees for its apparent motion since the deluge or for the real precession of the equinox the main if not only cause of it it will appear to have been in the   th of taurus at that time also nay if we allow the least inequality in these two motions or the least alteration of the planes either of the ecliptic or of the comets orbit or of both as we justly may both from the physical causes and astronomical observations we may suppose them still nearer the earths distance from the sun and so more exactly suitable to the case of the deluge  v the period of this comet most exactly agrees to the same time i mean to   revolutions in  0   years the interval from the deluge till its last appearance    0 cip      for as sir isaac newton first observed from its elliptick curvature before it disappeared that its period must be in general above  00 years so has he and dr halley since observed that the same comet has been seen four times viz the   th year before christ ad     or     ad   0  and ad    0 and that by consequence it makes a revolution in about     years now if we make a very small allowance for the old periods before christ and suppose that one with another it has revolved in     years we shall find that   such periods amount to  0   years exactly according to that number since the deluge this is so remarkable an observation and so surprising that it will deserve a particular demonstration from the original authors themselves to begin then with the first of the appearances recorded in later history i mean that in the   th year before christ the year that julius caesar was slain en not  i v c    hst not  ii c     we have no fewer nor lesser persons than seneca suetonius plutarch and pliny to attest it and the last as bringing augustuss own words for his voucher take the account in those words as being the most authentic and remarkable on those very days says augustus when i was exhibiting some games to the people begun about sept    a comet appeared for   days and was seen in the northern part of heaven it rose about the   th hour of the day it was a remarkable one and visible all over the world the common people believed that it signified the reception of the soul of caesar into the number of the immortal gods on which account the image of this star was added to that statue representing caesars head which we a while after consecrated in the forum accordingly it is known that some of caesars coins have a star upon them for a memorial of this comet and observable that virgil hints at the same also aeneid viii patrium aperitur vrtice sidus plutarchs senecas and suetoniuss words are almost the very same that are included in the passage from augustus and so need not be distinctly set down only the time of its rising is by suetonius set down about the    th hour without the words of the day which the other two have and its northern position is only mentioned by augustus himself now if we interpret the   th hour or   th hour of the day to be either    a clock before noon or an hour before sunset this will render the whole almost incredible it being next to impossible that this comet should be seen in the daytime but the romans then accounting midnight the beginning of their day as is well known by chronologers we may reckon this   th hour to be    at night and all will agree to the comet before us and it will show that as it had been concealed by cloudy weather for some time so it now appeared ascending from the sun with its long and splendid tail for a week before the like cloudy weather or the comets too great remoteness rendered it no longer observable accordingly the northern position of this comet noted here by augustus secures us still farther that it must have been the same with that ad    0 which is ever in the same position at the same place of its orbit to say nothing of its remarkable brightness which i take to belong to its tail and which rendered it so very remarkable then in the world in which point it as well or better agrees with this than with any other in the whole cometary system so that on all these accounts the comet seen then by the romans and that seen ad    0 must have been one and the same comet the next period when this comet might be seen again according to the foregoing time of its revolution was ad     or     when yet we hear nothing of it in heveliuss history of comets but then we have it in lubienietzs more exact catalogue out of zonaras the original historian whose words are these annal l xiv p    in the  th year of the emperor justinian  ad     or     a comet appeared of that sort which is called lampadias it sent its bright tail upward and continued to shine  0 days which words exactly agree to this comet the next period when it was to be expected was ad   0  at which time the historians are full of their accounts of it take those accounts in their own words as they stand in hevelius and lubienietz who have given us a most complete collection of them in their histories of comets  vath ex       ex  ad   0  we saw a comet of wonderful brightness from the first week in lent until the passion of our lord an extraordinary star was seen to shine this year on friday in the evening southward and westward and appeared bright for    days together and always at the same hour   ad   0  in the month of february two days after the new moon a great comet appeared southwestward      gebert  ad   0  a comet appeared like a fire almost all the month of february  a very great comet was seen in the time of lent praetorius adds that the emperor henry iv died the same year which calvisius also agrees to   ad   0  a star which we call a comet appeared  ad   0  a dreadful comet appeared from the first week in lent till the vigil of palm sunday the same year the emperor henry iv died  on the year of our lord   0  the   th of the calends of march  feb    a certain strange star was discovered and was seen to shine between the south and west for    days after the same manner and at the same hour it seemed to be small and obscure but that light which went out from it was exceeding bright and a splendour like a great beam proceeded from the east and north and shot it self upon the same star  in these testimonies we may see that all the circumstances of this comet agree to that of ad    0 i mean the smallness and obscurity of its nucleus the brightness and remarkableness of its tail its position southwest and the direction of its tail northeast so that there is no reason  doubt but it was the very same only we must here note that these two periods were one with another three quarters of a year shorter han the last period for from september in the  th year before christ till february or march a d   0  are but      years or two periods of    apiece one with another whereas from he same february or march ad   0  till februy or march    0  when this comet was about  same position again there are just     years  is rather a wonder that the three last periods  our famous comet are so very nearly equal an that there is this small inequality among em nor is it by the way any wonder therere that the four first periods after the deluge are  be supposed one with another rather above     ears to agree exactly to that time it is rather  question whether the rest of the comets periods ill prove any of them near so equal in proportion  even that allowance makes these to be accordgly sir isaac newton and dr halley rightly observe princip p   0 praelect physico math p         at these cometary orbits are the most easily  sensibly disturbed by the occasional nearness of eir comets to other bodies of all others and so considerable inequalities are to be expected among them  note   that it is highly remarkable that this is the only comet yet known whose node renders it capable of approaching very near the body of the earth and that the same node is still so little remote from the earths orbit as dr halley well observes that it brought this comet about as near to the same as the moon this very last time hear his remarkable words and consider the consequence of them in this matter synops comet in calce no comet says he has hitherto threatened the earth with a nearer appulse than that of    0 for by calculation i find that november   th  h   after noon that comet was not above a semidiameter of the sun which i take to be equal to the distance of the moon to the northwards of the way of the earth at which time had the earth been there the comet would i think have had a parallax equal to that of the moon nor can i pass over his following words without setting them down they are so apposite to my present purpose the former observations says he are to be supposed as spoken to astronomers but what might be the consequences of so near an appulse or of a contact or lastly of a collision of these celestial bodies which are none of them impossible i leave to be discussed by the philosophers    since this comets period is     years its middle distance must be about   00000000 miles from the sun its longer axis and greatest distance twice so long or nearly    00000000 miles its aphelion distance about    times as great as the distance of saturn its greatest distance to its least as above  0000 to   and so its greatest light and heat to its least as above  00000000 to      since     years appears to be the period of the comet that caused the deluge what a learned friend of mine who was the occasion of my examination of this matter suggests will deserve to be considered viz whether the story of he phoenix that celebrated emblem of the resurrection in christian antiquity that it returns once after   centuries and goes to the altar and city of he sun and is there burnt and another arises out of its ashes and carries away the remains of the former etc be not an allegorical representation of this comet which returns once after   centuries and goes down to the sun and is there vehemently heated and its outward regions dissolved yet that it flies off again and carries away what remains after that terrible burning etc and whether the conflagration and renovation of things which some such comet in its ascent from e sun may bring upon the earth be not hereby refigurd i will not here be positive but i own that i dont know of any solution of this famous piece of egyptian mythology and hieroglyphics  this seems to be that can be compared with it  note   that none of those comets whose orits are yet known can come near enough to our earth in their ascent from the sun to cause the conflagration this is evident to those who conder dr halleys table or my solar system built upon it since none of them move in or very near he plane of the ecliptic and those four which ave their nodes nearest the earths orbit and so might approach nearest to the earth are either ch as have these nodes so near only in their deent to the sun as that in      and that in      and that in    0 or go not any time much near to the sun than the earth it self as that in      and so are on all accounts utterly incapable of affording heat enough for such a conflagration  note   that therefore the period of time for that conflagration upon the supposition that it is to be caused by a comet cannot now be discovered by any natural means but must still remain as formerly only knowable from divine revelation  new theory p        note   that hence those remarkable corollaries drawn from the accurate solution of such difficulties now as formerly were plainly insoluble i mean the great regard due to the ancientest sacred and profane records and to the inspired method whence they must have been derived the imperfection of human knowledge the folly of rejecting revealed truths out of regard to uncertain human reasonings the wisdom of adhering to the most obvious sense of scripture the reasonableness of believing scriptureaccounts and scripturemysteries though not fully comprehended by us the justness of expecting satisfaction in moral difficulties in due time from the like satisfaction afforded already in those that are philosophical and the like do all receive a new and surprising confirmation and will therefore deserve a new and serious consideration  nb dr halley having himself given an account of this comet lately in dr gregorys english astronomy p  0   0   0  i here present it to the reader verbatim that he may compare the two accounts together for his more entire satisfaction  but as far as probability from the equality of periods and similar appearance of comets may be urged as an argument the late wondrous comet of    0  seems to have been the same which was seen in the time of our king henry i anno   0  which began to appear in the west about the middle of february and continued for many days after with such a tail as was seen in that of    0  and again in the consulate of lampadius and orestes about the year of christ     such another comet appeared in the west of which malela perhaps an eyewitness relates that it was  a great and fearful star that it appeared in the west and emitted upwards from it a long white beam and was seen for  0 days it were to be wished the historian had told us what time of the year it was seen but it is however plain that the interval between this and that of   0  is nearly equal to that between   0  and    0  viz about     years and if we reckon backward such another period we shall come to the   th year before christ in which julius caesar was murdered and in which there appeared a very remarkable comet mentioned by almost all the historians of those times and by pliny in his natural history lib    c    who recites the words of augustus caesar on this occasion which lead us to the very time of its appearance and its situation in the heavens these words being very much to our purpose it may not be amiss to recite them in ipsis ludorum meorum diebus sydus crinitum per septem dies in regione coeli quae sub septentrionibus est conspectum id oriebatur circa undecimam horam diei clarumque and omnibus terris conspicuum fuit now these ludi were dedicated veneri genetrici for from venus the caesars would be thought to be descended and began with the birthday of augustus viz sept    as may be collected from a fragment of an old roman calendar extant in gruter page     and continued for   days during which the comet appeared nor are we to suppose that it was seen only those   days but possibly both before and after nor are we to interpret the words sub septentrionibus as if the comet had appeared in the north but that it was seen under the septem triones or brighter stars of ursa major and as to its rising hora undecima diei it can no ways be understood unless the word diei be left out as it is by suetonius for it must have been very far from the sun either to rise at five in the afternoon or at eleven at night in which cases it must have appeared for a long time and its tail have been so little remarkable that it could by no means be called clarum and omnibus terris conspicuum sydus but supposing this comet to have traced the same path with that of the year    0 the ascending part of the orb will exactly represent all that augustus has said concerning it and is yet an additional argument to that drawn from the equality of the period thus it is not improbable but this comet may have four times visited us at intervals of about     years whence the transverse diameter of its elliptic orb will be found     x    times greater than the annual orb or     times greater than the mean distance of the sun which distance though immensely great bears no proportion
