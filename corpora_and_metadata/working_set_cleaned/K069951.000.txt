observation on young people particularly those of my own family i have long thought it of as great importance to teach them lessons of compassion for the dumb creation as a fellow feeling for their own species not only because the one is connected with the other but because an early neglect of the duties of humanity in regard to the first leads but too naturally to an omission of those duties as to the last and every one must have noticed in most children a tyrannical sometimes a cruel propensity to torment animals within their power such as  persecuting flies torturing birds cats dogs etc some friends of mine joined me in thinking that a collection of humane facts and arguments in favor of these suffering creatures might be of considerable use if brought into view not only to our own offspring but if made public to youth in general with this idea it was my intention to have made a selection from various authors but a sufficient number of tales being found in the writings first examined i did not look further unwilling to swell the compilation to a size that might fatigue or appear formidable to my little friends  perhaps indeed so great a number of stories for my purpose could not have been met with in the works of any other author and i trust the present use made of them will neither injure the same of that gentleman nor the property of any other person  pitys gift the brothers and the blackbird in the cold season a poor blackbird had taken shelter in sir armines greenhouse animated by the genial heat it was basking upon an orangetree and warmed out of the cold remembrance of time and place stretched out its wings in a kind of summer languor over the branches and had begun to pour a seminote of gratitude and joy henry the younger brother hastily yet on tiptoe ran round to shut the window at which it had entered first closing the doors  i have wished for a blackbird i know not how long whispered he and it will be quite a charity to give that poor fellow good winter quarters in the castle  i own it is almost a pity to disturb him now he seems so comfortable but if he knew how very kindly i would use him he would come a volunteer into my chamber very kind to be sure said john the eldest to make him a slave for life to my thoughts he had better choose his own lodging though the best to be had were in a barn or in a hollow tree and an independent warm here in the hothouse when he finds an opportunity than be a prisoner in the best room of the castle nay in the kings palace so be advised brother and let him alone  john softly opened part of the window nearest the bird no i will tell you how it shall be observed little james give the bird fair play leave the window open and let harry try his fortune if the bird suffers himself to be caught when the path of freedom is before his eyes it will be his own affair you know  but the act of catching him at all is arbitrary said john sturdily throwing his hat at the orange and other exotic plants that grew in the direction of the tree where the blackbird had been perched not at all brother cried henry when it is only to convey him to a better place running as he spoke after the object of his wishes almost with the swiftness of its own wings john kept always behind in the hope of pointing its flight to the window and james the second brother stood impartially in the middle unless he stepped on one side or the other to maintain fair dealing the blackbird meantime alarmed by all parties flew irregularly from shrub to shrub from window to window sometimes beating his breast against one object sometimes striking its wing or beak against another often being in the very path of liberty and as often driven out of it at length it sank exhausted to the ground and was taken up almost without an effort to flutter by henry whose little heart quick breathing lip and high coloring cheek spoke his triumphs yet amidst his exultings he forgot not mercy the fairest laurel of the conqueror is humanity and the very instincts of henry were humane he smoothed the ruffled plumes of his captive poured over it every assurance of protection pressed its glossy pinion on his cheek detained it with a soft trembling hand and at length putting it lightly held into his bosom ran with it into his chamber he has fairly won the bird brother said james following certainly replied john with a dissatisfied tone nothing can be fairer than to run down a poor terrified little wretch who has no power to resist then seizing and dragging it to prison it struggled for freedom till it was almost gasping for breath and i am ashamed that i suffered any thing to prevent my taking part with the unprotected in the cause of liberty but this i suppose you and my brother will call foul play just as you have styled his thefts a kindness yes the kindness of a christian robber who steals the innocent savage from his native land and covers him with chains  dreading the loss of his treasure henry guarded it with a misers care kept it concealed in his own room but treated it with the utmost indulgence being at once its nurse and companion and suffering no hand but his own to feed it alas it droops said its protector  bringing it down one day into an apartment where his brothers were sitting  what can be done for it james questioned he with tears in his eyes let it go interrupted john it pines for the friends from whose society it has been ravished it languishes for freedom let it go and it will soon recover perhaps answered james it only wants more air your chamber may be too confined suppose then continued he  willing to compromise betwixt liberty and slavery you were to tie a silken string round its leg and lead it now and then about the garden i propose an improvement to that idea said john  clip one of its wings and as you persist in refusing it its right to fly in the air let it have the run of the garden that on the south side of the castle you know is walled round and it cannot walk off  he reconciled henry to this measure by telling him that it would produce many good ends besides restoring the blackbirds health and giving it a relish for its former enjoyments amongst other things he assured him that it would recover its spirits which would enable it to whistle back its lost friends and relations henry could not resist this the idea of giving joy to others was a joy to his own heart the action by which it was bestowed could alone surpass it  in effect the bird was all the better for its liberty it hopped pecked twittered and daily appeared to gain new visitors  there was in the walled garden a shed where it nestled toward evening but henry with soft steps would take care while it reposed to strew food on the ground below so that it always found breakfast ready in the morning nor was dinner or supper provision forgotten so that what it picked up in the garden was mere amusement to relish exercise the kind hearted henry was perfectly satisfied with this plan john was only half satisfied james prudently suggested giving the growing wing another cutting henry agreed for his favorite could now take half the garden at a low flight though not top the walls wait a little longer said john he is so tame and so well pleased with his present usage that perhaps he will indeed be a volunteer amongst us and there will be a thousand times the gratification in having his society with his own consent but if he should leave me said henry have confidence in him think how delightful it is to have friendship as a free will offering i should hate any thing i forced to stay with me as much as it could hate me can a jailbird love the jailor  i have a good mind to trust it observed henry but i sometimes think it looks up at the walls very sly  that is nothing but a way they have with them said john laughing what is your opinion james questioned henry there can be i should think but one opinion about that replied james taking out a little pair of scissars o he always was for cutting out just like a girl but act a more liberal part my brother said john henry was overruled the feathers grew and the blackbird flew away henry accused john defended james meditated the grateful bird however staid in the neighborhood sang better and looked happier henry was therefore reconciled to his loss and john was at length contented  the dutch draft dogs we are told by a traveller who has lately performed the tour of holland that the very dogs of that country are constrained to promote the trade of the republic insomuch that there is not an idle dog of any size in the seven provinces you encounter at all hours of the day an incredible number loaded with fish and men under the burden of which they run off at a long trot and sometimes when driven by young men or boys at full gallop the whole mile and a half which is the distance from gate to gate nor on their return are they suffered to come empty being filled not only with the aforesaid men or boys but with such commodities as cannot be had at the village these poor brutes are frequently to be seen in the middle of summer urged beyond their force till they have dropped on the road to gather strength which is seldom the case however except when they have the misfortune to fall under the management of boys for the dutch are the farthest from being cruel to their domestic dumb animals of any people in the world on the contrary an hollander of whatever rank is merciful unto his cattle whether horse dog cow etc that they are the objects of his marked attention as sleek skins happy faces plump sides sufficiently demonstrate the cows and oxen for draft they rub down curry and clean till they are as glossy as the most pampered steed in england nay you frequently see them with a light fancy dress to guard them from the flies and other annoying animalcula in the meadows which are the finest in the world and in a warmer suit of clothes during the winter even these canineslaves look hale and well as to condition and being habituated to labor feel little hardship in it it is fortunate also that holland is a country somewhat prone to be strict in the ceremonies of religion by observance of which the dogs like their masters find the seventh a day of unbroken rest for sunday shines a sabbath to them the first impression which is allowed a grand point being much in favor of these industrious creatures this traveller had an eye on them as well in the hours of their repose as toil and felt his heart warm to see several whom he had observed to have seen very heavily laden on saturday taking a sound nap outstretched and happy at their masters doors on the day in which their leisure is even an allotment and bounty of heaven all the morning and afternoon they have remained basking in the sun or in the shade in profound tranquillity while a number of unthinking whelps and lazy puppies who had been passing their time in idleness all the week were playing their gambols in the street not without a vain attempt to wake the serious and make them join in their amusement toward evening adds our traveller i have in my sunsetting rounds been much pleased to notice the honest creatures sit at their respective thresholds looking quite refreshed giving occasionally into a momentary frolic and the next morn returning to the labors of the week absolutely renewed reader  stranger  ant thou too proud of heart  or too full of dignity of human nature  to enter into these brute concerns pass on then and pity my weakness but not without remembering that dogs are honest creatures never fawn on that they love not and i am a friend to dogs they never betray their masters if therefore thou have no feeling for their sufferings respect at least their virtues mark but his true his faithful way and in thy service copy tray   the hermit and his dog in lifes fair morn i knew an aged seer who sad and lonely passed his joyless year betrayed heart broken from the world he ran and shunned o dire extreme the face of man humbly he reared his hut within the wood hermit his vest a hermits was his food nitchd in some corner of the gelid cave where chilling drops the rugged rockstone lave hour after hour the melancholy sage drop after drop to reckon would engage the lingering day and trickling as they fell a tear went with them to the narrow well then thus he moralizd as slow it past this brings me nearer lucia than the last and this now streaming from the eye said he oh my loved child will bring me nearer thee when first he roamd his dog with anxious care his wandrings watched as emulous to share in vain the faithful brute was bid to go in vain the sorrower sought a lonely woe the hermit paused the attendant dog was near slept at his feet and caught the falling tear up rose the hermit up the dog would rise and every way to win a master tries then be it so come ai  e said one pat encouraged and  ought the shade an  they found  the leafy ground  told the fountains nigh fount which well a pilgrims drink supply and thence by many a labyrinth it led where every tree bestowed an evening bed skilled in the chase the faithful creature brought whatever at morn or moonlight course he caught but the sage lent his sympathy to all nor saw unwept his dumb associate fall he was in sooth the gentlest of his kind and though a hermit had a social mind and why said he must man subsist by prey why stop yon melting music on the spray why when assailed by hounds and hunters cry must half the harmless race in terrors die why must we work of innocence the woe still shall this bosom throb these eyes overflow a heart too tender here from man retires a heart that aches if but a wren expires thus lived the master good the servant true till to its god the masters spirit flew beside a fount which daily water gave stooping to drink the hermit found a grave all in the running stream his garments spread and dark damp verdure ill concealed his head the faithful servant from that fatal day watched the loved corpse and hourly pined away his head upon his masters cheek was found while the obstructed waters mourned around the decayed merchant and his dutiful daughter a merchant of considerable eminence in london was reduced to the situation of poor bassanio and from precisely the same run of illluck in his sea adventures the dangerous rocks touching his gentle vessels side had scattered all his spices on the stream enrobd the roaring waters with his silks and not one vessel scapd the dreadful touch of merchant marring rocks   to these miscarriages abroad were added similar calamities at home several great houses broke in his debt and with the wrecks of his fortune gathered together he left the metropolis and took refuge in the mountains of montgomeryshire a little girl then only nine years of age his only surviving child was the sole companion of his retreat and smiled away his misfortunes the care of her education was his most certain relief from the corroding reflections of the past and the certainty of her possessing at his death sufficient to prevent a good mind from the horrors of dependence softened his thoughts of the future the present was filled up with the delights of seeing her ambition yet humbler than her fortunes and literally bounded by the objects that surrounded her to tend the flowers she had set with her own hand to nurse the shrubs the had planted to sport with and feed the lamb she had domesticated to see it follow her in her rambles and to listen to the melodies of nature as they murmured in the waters or echoed through the woods were her chief amusements without doors and by a thousand lovetaught duties to make a father forget that he had ever been unhappy or unfortunate her dearest study within of her personal attractions i shall say little a single line of thomsons gives the truest image of them and of the unaffected mind by which they were illumined artless of beauty she was beautys self  it is not easy to be wretched in the constant society of perfect innocence the company ot a beautiful child wholly unpolluted by the world affords one the idea of angelic association its harmlessness appears to guarantee one from harm we reflect nay we see and hear almost every moment it is climbing our knees playing at our side engaging our attentions or reposing in our arms the words and acts of an unspotted being and one can scarce be persuaded any real ill can befall us while a companion so like a guardian cherub is near when the babe is our own  say ye parents how the sensation is then exalted  which of you having at your option the loss of the amplest fortune or of the feeblest infant would not cleave to the last and resign the former or if any of you balanced a moment would not one lisping word one casual look turn the scale in favor of nature and make you think it a crime to have hesitated  such were the sentiments of the merchant and under their cheering influence he lived many years during which a few mountain peasants an old relict of his better days as a servant who had been nurse to the young lady and his daughter were the only objects with whom he conversed so powerful is habit that we assimilate to persons places and things that on our first introduction to them we might imagine neither philosophy custom or religion could make supportable we are surprised to find we attach to them even to endearment in time even our former habits no less strong in us are but slightly remembered and those pursuits diversions and societies without which it once appeared impossible we should ever pass a day are yielded for others that it then would have been thought as impossible even to be endured our merchant would have deemed the company of a monarch an intrusion and the jargon of the exchange which had for so many years been music to his ears could not now have been borne i have here given you some of his own expressions at length he fell sick his daughter was then in her eighteenth year the disorder was of a gradual kind that threatened to continue life after one has ceased to love it and to close in death he lingered eleven weeks and the old domestic being now superannuated and almost blind his daughter was at once his nurse his cook his consoler and might truly be said to make his bed in his sickness she wanted not the world to teach her the filial duties her own pure heart supplied them all and her own gentle hands administered them but now for the first time of her existence she added to her fathers anguish it almost kills me to look on you my only love cried he with an emphasis of sorrow and bursting into tears i am sure replied she falling on her knees at his bedside it has almost killed me to hear you say so and if it would make my dearest father better i would kill myself this moment and trust in gods mercy to forgive me ah my child you mistake the cause and motive of my regrets resumed the parent  the thoughts of leaving you without protection  there is the bitterness  i am not going to be left said she rising hastily i have a presage you will be well soon and i am a great prophetess my beloved father be in good spirits for i am sure you will recover i have sent to montgomery and welsh pool and tomorrow i am to have the two best doctors in wales  your goodness is always a comfort my darling replied the desponding merchant but two thousand welsh doctors could not set me again on my legs  if indeed i was in a condition to procure  but that is impossible   procure what whom nothing is impossible answered his daughter with the most eager haste  i have an idle and romantic faith in the only man in the whole world that knows my constitution and he is as far beyond my reach as if he were out of existence  good heaven you mean dr  exclaimed the daughter i have heard you often speak of his having twice before saved your precious life for which i have had him in my nightly prayers ever since and shall go on blessing him to the hour of my death o that i were a man to fetch him   the father pressed her tenderly in his feeble arms in acknowledgment of her affection but told her that from a multiplicity of other claims it would be as impossible for the doctor to get down to wales as for himself to go out of his sick bed to london do not therefore let us think of it my child continued the father since it is only the aggravation of a vain wish to know that it must end in disappointment  i am resigned  notwithstanding this declaration the merchant receiving no manner of benefit from the welsh doctors and being unable indeed to pay for their continued attendance without an injury to that scanty fund out of which he had to draw all the necessaries of life he often sighed out in a voice of pining as it were involuntarily the name of  the sound of that voice languishing for that which might possibly change its tone to gladness penetrated the soul of his daughter who needed not so pathetic a memento of her fathers wishes to make her bitterly regret her inability to gratify them the poor gentleman grew worse and expressing a desire for something which he imagined might afford a momentary relief his amelia so was the young lady named took the first opportunity of his being composed to go into the neighborhood in search of a person to fetch it from montgomery a little roadside publichouse about a mile from her fathers cottage appeared the most likely place to find a messenger thither she repaired and arrived just in time to take shelter from a sudden storm that fell with great violence at the moment of her entrance there were none but the old host and hostess in the alehouse but in a very few minutes after it filled with laborers and passengers who like herself sought protection from the hurricane during the fury however of which she had too much compassion to mention her wishes for she was amongst those whose nature would not suffer her to turn an enemys dog out of doors at such a season this necessary delay nevertheless greatly increased her uneasiness and she kept watching the rain and the hoped return of fine weather at the window seeing no prospect of its clearing she determined to do that herself at all hazards which she could not ask another to perform  namely to be herself the messenger to which end she desired to know whether the road she saw from the window was the nearest and most direct to montgomery or to any other town where there was an apothecarys shop and what might be the distance to any such place  the affecting voice in which these questions were demanded and the prevailing appearance of the speaker gained her an interest in every hearer and beholder several of whom knew and acknowledged her for a neighbor mingling their expressions of good will with numberless kind enquiries after her sick father for whose languishing situation they unanimously declared their pity and regard and whose death if it should please god to snatch him away they should long lament  this last observation bringing to mind the image of her fathers danger more closely the trembling amelia lost all thought of herself or of the weather and thanking every body around her for their civility while her lovely face was covered with her tears she had got the latch of the door in her hand and was preparing to hurry out on her commission according to the directions she had received when a traveller who had not opened his lips during the conversation of the peasants but sat drying himself at the fire rose up suddenly and begged permission to speak to her she went with surprise and tottering steps into an adjoining room where he used to her these very words  one of your neighbors young lady has told me you have been for many years the best daughter in the world to the best father who has been once the richest though now the poorest man in wales considering you and he are to be supported as gentlefolks it is plain to see there is a great deal of distress upon your mind and it is natural to guess the cause of it may be removed i am not by any means a wealthy man but i have had my share of evils sufficiently to make me feel for the unfortunate and i have always thank god a something to spare for the mitigation of honest distress in whatever country it is presented to my view i beg you will present this trifle giving her a bank bill with compliments begging the favor of his making use of it till it may suit his circumstances to return it  i have no manner of occasion for it till about this time next year when i will call to ask after his health which i hope will long ere that be established and if it should not at that time be convenient to make restitution of the loan we will put it off till the year after when i will pay a second visit to you as i purpose passing through this country into ireland where i have concerns annually i am now going to london  the last sentence seemed to annihilate the rest the very name of london had at that instant more charms for amelia than it could ever boast of creating in the head of any miss in her teens who had her mammas promise to pass a winter amongst the fine folks and fine sights with which it abounds but it drew the attention of amelia from superior motives it was the residence of her poor fathers physician on whose heart she now resolved to make an attempt by the medium of the generous stranger who she rightly judged would suffer his bounty to take any direction she might wish and to whom she stated the merchants anxious but hopeless desires  you have just the soul my dear friend to suggest the extacy of amelias on hearing that this muchwished for physician was an intimate acquaintance of the traveller and all the interests of an old affection shall be tried with the doctor exclaimed the stranger as soon as i get to town on condition that you will now go home to your father with this purse and as an assurance that although i am an usurer i will receive neither principal nor interest till he is very able to pay both  he did not give the astonished amelia time to refuse but seeing the weather inclined to remit its rigours he put halfacrown into the hands of the peasants to drink the young lady and her sick fathers health and ordering his horse to the door  mounted and proceeded on his journey  does not your bounding heart assure you his feelings would have defended him from bestowing a thought on the peltings of the pitiless storm had they continued to rage and does it not also inform you that this fair pattern of filial piety was proof against the war of elements the sunshine of benevolence had indeed so animated her that its sudden and intense rays might have been too strong for her tender frame had they not been moderated by a shower of tears she had scarcely regained her cottage indeed when overcome by her sensations she fainted in the arms of her aged nurse who had been mourning her delay  alas my friend what fragile creatures we are how much at the disposal of contrary events how totally the vassals of sorrow and of joy how little able to encounter the extremes of either but you will not easily forgive exclamations that detain you from poor amelia whom i left in distress to indulge them my heart is but too often the master of my pen and guides it as it lists let me hasten to make atonement by informing you that our lovely sufferer on her recovery had the pleasure to find her father had dosed best part of the morning and though he missed her from his apartment when he awoke he told the nurse that he hoped she was taking a little necessary rest in her own room where he desired she might remain undisturbed  this gave her opportunity to manage her good fortune of which she resolved to be so excellent an oeconomist that the supply she had received should answer the wisest and happiest purposes she recollected that the day before she met the benevolent stranger her father had received by the post a bankbill to the amount of the quarterly division of his annuity of course a farther reinforcement was not immediately necessary on which account she had to regret that the flurry into which her spirits were thrown had hindered her from persisting in her refusal of the loan to the acceptance of which however she was somewhat reconciled when she reflected on the condition annexed to her borrowing it and an idea which just then started to her imagination of the manner in which it might be appropriated completely satisfied her feelings on the occasion she considered the gentlemans bankbill as the luckiest fund in the world to serve as the physicians fee in case the generous stranger should prevail on him to come and to that sacred use her heart devoted it the sum was fifty pounds a recompense which her ignorance in the price of medical advice in the golden climes of england led her to suppose would be allsufficient for a journey down to wales alas were a regular charge to be made out by doctors w r g f l or any other of the popular sons of esculapius of london for such a tour from the grand mart of custom the fifty pound would scarcely be thought by those messieurs a more than sufficient sum to pay traveling expenses in many parts of the continent indeed where a shilling value in coin that has less of silver in its composition than would be found in the analysis of a silver penny is received as a settled gratuity for running a german mile fifty pounds would cut a handsome figure in physic and go very far toward curing a whole city of an epidemy so far as prescriptions could assist in its recovery  as however the visit of dr  was a point rather devoutly to be wished than expected it being the middle of a very hard winter amelia thought it prudent to conceal the little adventure at the public house from her father whose malady nevertheless rather increased than abated and his love of life being in effect his love for his daughter he could not help occasionally regretting his impassable distance from the only man by whose aid there might be a chance of resisting his disease there is you know a sort of superstition which often runs through a family in favor of its family physician nor is it altogether without a support from reason since the person who has long been in the secrets of our constitution and familiar with our habits of living must in all general cases be better able to apply the proper remedies than he who is called into our bed chambers when there is a disease in it and when he sees us for the first time under its influence besides which an old physician is commonly an old friend and unites the lenitives of affection to the cathartics of science no wonder then that we have faith in him and faith you know is a a great doctor in itself performing a thousand cures which the highest professional skill has not been able to accomplish without it  you will readily believe that the bountiful stranger did not break promise to amelia he kept it indeed so religiously holy that in less than ten days from the date of his departure our pious daughter received a message purporting that a person at the public house begged to speak with her you my friend whose fancy is ever warmed by your affectionate heart will immediately conclude what was concluded by amelia that it could be only the muchdesired doctor who had thus delicately to prevent the ill effect of surprise on the sick merchant announced his arrival if so you are in the right however inconsistent with the spirit of business such a long journey might be it was perfectly in unison with the spirit of benevolence by which dr  was moved to determine upon it the instant the case was stated to him and to execute what he had so determined with all the dispatch necessary to an affair of life and death and the life and death moreover of an old and unfortunate friend my good little girl said he on the entrance of amelia who gliding from her fathers bedside with slipshod steps ran with duteous haste to the village inn  my good little girl i am come from  heaven interrupted amelia falling on her knees you are come from heaven to make my father well  under the auspices of that heaven i trust i am resumed the doctor let us fly this instant exclaimed amelia in the animated accents of nature  let us do all things in order replied the doctor in the language of friendly discretion otherwise we shall do more harm than good  i presume i am not expected amelia bowed a negative then my sudden appearance would make thy father worse child continued the doctor no go back to him and by telling him an old friend of his from london and who has particular business in that part of wales which he inhabits means to pay him a visit on the score of ancient amity and will take cottage fare from him in his chamber the name of this old london friend will then be a matter of amuseing conjecture in the midst of which thou child may suggest that thou should not wonder if it were me telling him as much of the adventure that i find happened at this inn between thee and the gentleman who brought me thy message and with it the story of thy virtues and misfortunes to support and to relieve which would have brought me ten times as far but we have no time for profession i am come here to practice so fare thee well my good little maid  all that i have premised will be the work only of an hour at the end of which i will be with thee  she kissed his hand fervently and without speaking a single word sprung up and might rather be said to fly than run to the cottage though the paths thereto were lost in snow her father was sitting up in his bed supported by pillows which the aged adherent had made shift to place in the absence of his filial nurse who gently chid the old woman for taking her proper business out of her hands but that if her dear father had found a moments ease by this usurpation of her natural rights she would then forgive the usurper she then entered on her errand which she managed so well as to make the old friends name after much pleasant conjecture on both sides the subject of a wager the father observing that if it should prove to belong to the doctor providence had sent him to reward the virtue of his daughter who on her part maintained that it would be chiefly owing to the value which heaven itself would set on her parents life this amicable strife had put the invalid into unwonted spirits and thereby perhaps not only prepared the way for the cure of a fever on the nerves but laid the best foundation of it the poor gentleman did not dare to lay any stress on the possibility of a visit from the physician and yet a faint blush of hope denoted that he should think himself most happy to lose his wager  at this auspicious crisis it was that our doctor made his enter saying as he advanced to the bedside my esteemed friend i am come to return my personal thanks to thee for having me in thy thoughts when thou were too sick to remember any but those who are dear to thee and of whom thou have a good opinion give me thy hand and without entering into long histories let us see if in return for thy kindness i can make thee well again yes this pulse i foresee before i have done with it shall temperately keep time and beat more healthful music those eyes have i see still the spirit of life in them and this heart shall yet bound with renovated enjoyments  the emotions of amelia during these favorable prognostications no words can tell you the merchant was strongly affected the doctor perceived that his patient was recoverable both in the maladies of body and mind and as he was no less a philosopher and philanthropist than a physician he could with equal skill prescribe for each he was one of the people called quakers and to a perfect knowledge of the world of his profession and of the human heart united all the honest plainness of the character the merchants disorder was as i have said a fever on the spirits of which the symptoms were as usual want of appetite lassitude watchfulness and dejection of mind a pulse slow and creeping difficulty of respiration and a dread yet hope of death  i need not tell you that in this disease the cathartics of the mind such as exhilarate enliven and amuse the patient are the most effectual remedies and such as were administered with uncommon success on the present occasion in less than a fortnight the sick man not only was in a condition to leave his bed but his chamber and play his part in the little cottage parlour in a thousand little frolics that amelia and the doctor devised to entertain him in the course of the third week he resumed his accustomed exercises and under the cordial supports of his friend and his child he could ascend the mountains that environed his habitation in the middle of the fourth week his spirits and strength were so well restored that in returning home to dinner after a walk of some miles he jocularly proposed to run against the doctor and amelia for a wager which being agreed upon by the other parties he set off and beat them both it was in the afternoon of this victorious day that the good doctor intimated the necessity of his return to town goodhumouredly observing that although by a lucky arrangement he had left his sick and wounded in very good hands with a brother physician in london he could not trespass any longer without fear of being set down by the college as a deserter and he must therefore repair to headquarters in the morning  the reasonableness of this was admitted yet the merchant sighed and amelia wept the doctor knew it must be done and he saw that his prophecy as to his friends recovery was fulfilled to his hearts content but there is a sympathy in generous regret and his eyes were not more dry than amelias in despite of exertions the evening past heavily away the morning did not rise without casting clouds on every countenance the hour the almost instant that was to separate the cottagers from their preserver approached  friend said the doctor to his patient as he heard the wheels of his carriage advancing since i saw thee last in the great city i have prospered exceedingly all those families to whom thou tookest me by the hand were more for thy sake than mine on my list some merit however or infinite good fortune i must needs have had since from an yearly gain of one hundred i have increased my income to several thousands per annum and yet i do not take fees for one in forty of my prescriptions  my house is too large for my family  will thou come once again into the busy world with this mountain blossom and occupy some of the apartments  this as thou will  at present i must give thee a few words of parting advice and must rely on this damsel to see that it is adopted thou art so much thy former self friend that i fear not a relapse but to fortify and strengthen thee in my absence i have written and made up a prescription which i am convinced hits thy case exactly hearing something of thy maladies from the friend who conveyed to me thy amelias message and forming a judgment soberly thereupon i brought with me such drugs as i thought could not be readily procured in thy neighborhood they lie however in a small compass even in this little box yet being compounds of peculiar strength they will last you i judge for at least a year to come probably more  if they should not thou know where to address the prescriber for a fresh supply there friend take it but do not open it till you seem to wish for something of a cordial nature it will then i have no doubt do thee good  he received their tearful embraces and departed you are impatient to lift up the lid of the box when it was opened by the merchant and his daughter they discovered two separate pieces of paper each containing a draft on a different banker for one thousand pounds  the one a present from the physician the other from the stranger who had given him an account of this little family wrapped round these drafts was a slip of paper in the doctors handwriting containing these words  tributes from the friends of filial piety and parental love  i must not deny you the gratification of knowing that the father recovered and the child added to his blessings and her own many years in the smiling course of which the young ladys virtues attracted the affections of a very wealthy and worthy gentleman whose power and inclinations not only enabled the merchant to make restitution of the generosity received from the physician but to make also the residue of that mans life from whom he derived the best and loveliest of wives as happy in prosperity as it had been respectable in misfortune  the nightingale for elusino lost renew the strain pour the sad note upon the evening gale and as the lengthening shades usurp the plain the silent moon shall listen to the tale sore was the time illfated was the hour the thicket shook with many an omen dire when from the topmost twig of yonder bower i saw my husband flutter and expire twas when the peasant sought his twilight rest beneath the brow of yonder breezy hill it was when the plumy nation sought the nest and all but such as loved the night was still that fondly sitting with a lovers pride my tender custom while the sun withdrew dear elusino sudden left my side and the cursed form of man appeared in view for sport the tube he levelled at our head and curious to behold more near my race low in the copse the artful robber laid explored our haunt and thundered at the place ungrateful wretch he was our shepherds son the harmless good old tenant of yon cot that shepherd would not such a deed have done for love of him first fixed us to this spot often as at eve his homeward steps he bent when the laborious task of day was over our mellowd warblings soothed him as he went till the charmed hind forgot that he was poor ah could not this thy gratitude inspire could not our gentle visitations please could not the blameless lessons of thy fire thy barbarous hand restrain from crimes like these o cruel boy thou tyrant of the plain could thou but see the sorrows thou have made o did thou know the virtues thou have slain and view the gloomy horrors of the shade could thou behold my infant younglings lie in the mossd cradle by our bills prepared babes as they were unable yet to fly their wings defenseless and their bosoms barred surely the mighty malice of thy kind thy power to wrong and readiness to kill in common pity to the parents mind would cease the newmade fathers blood to spill happily the time may come when heaven shall give to thee the troubles thou have heaped on me happily ere well thy babes begin to live death shall present the dart of misery just as the tender hope begins to rise as the fond mother hugs her darling boy as the big rapture trembles in the eyes and the breast throbs with all the parents joy then may some midnight robber skilled in guile resolved on plunder and on deeds of death thy fairy prospects tender transports spoil and to the knife resign thy childrens breath in that sad moment shall thy savage heart feel the sad anguish desperate and wild conscience forlorn shall doubly point the smart and justice whisper  this is child for child reavd of their fire my babes alas must sigh for grief obstructs the anxious widows care this wasted form this everweeping eye and the deep note of destitute despair all load this bosom with affright so sore scarce can i cater for the daily food wherever i search my husband searched before and soon my nest will hold an orphan brood for elusino lost then pour the strain waft the sad note on every evening gale and as the lengthening shades usurp the plain the silent moon shall listen to the tale the dove the transactions and friendly intercourse of noah and his dove have a tenderness and ceremony in them truly delightful the eye melts at the simplicity and the heart warms at the sentiment poetry in her happiest flight could imagine nothing more interesting to the fancy hail gentlest of birds  hail messenger of security through thy means was the dry ground discovered and the gratitude of man shall not easily forget the fidelity of the dove he sent forth the dove to see if the waters were abated what an important errand for so small an express yet the industrious little wing flew over the wafry universe and employed every feather in the service of man after a vain excursion she returned for the waters were still without a shore methinks i see the patriarch stand upon the deck to wait the return of his messenger and as soon as she rests her fatigued foot upon the ark he tenderly puts forth his hand and pulls her to him thus rewarded for her labors after seven days repose her assistance being again summoned she trusts to her pinions and lo in the evening she came by mention of the evening it should appear that she was dispatched in the morning or at least very early in the day what a task of toil must it then have been how many billowy leagues must she have traveled ere she found that of which she was in search linger upon the land we may be convinced she never did however the verdure and vegetable novelty might charm her no it was not till the evening she succeeded in her endeavors and then upon the wings of kindness she hasted to satisfy the impatience of her master upon her second return behold a leaf was in her mouth what a sweet way is here of communicating the happy tidings but indeed every syllable of this matter has a grace and a consequence peculiar to it it was an olive leaf which she bore the leaf of amity the emblem of peace as much as to say lo master the waters are abated and i have plucked a leaf as a testimony of my truth the power who commands the waves to dry up and disappear has ordained me to bear to thee this olive branch happily it is the pledge of promise and conciliation betwixt him and thee and thou shall not only set thy foot safely upon land but there prosper and enjoy the pardon of god and after seven days more he sent her forth again and she returned no more one is divided here betwixt smiles and tears it is an exquisite passage the land and earth had by this time resumed their accustomed beauties the trees displayed a greener glory the flowers sprung brighter from the wave and the dove having performed her duty enjoyed as directed the beauties of renovated verdure yet she returned no more noah though he knew the cause of her delay had lost his favorite bird alas it was a drawback upon the felicity of the newappearing world fie upon the heart that has not feelings upon such occasions the softness of the dove however is still held among the children of men in grateful remembrance she is equally celebrated in profane and sacred history and every epithet of endearment is allotted to her she is considered as favorable to love and propitious to every tender undertaking nor can we at any time express a courteous character without giving to it among other qualities the gentleness and truth of the dove  the address of the superannuated horse to his master who on account of his the horse being unable from extreme old age to live through the winter had sentenced him to be shot  and have thou fixed my doom sweet master say and will thou kill thy servant old and poor a little longer let me live i pray a little longer hobble round thy door for much it glads me to behold this place and house within this hospitable shed it glads me more to see my masters face and linger near the spot where i was bred for old to think of what we both enjoyed in my lifes prime ere i was old and poor when from the jocund morn to eve employed my gracious master on this back i bore thrice told ten years have danced on down along since first these wayworn limbs to thee i gave sweet smiling years when both of us were young the kindest master and the happiest slave ah years sweet smiling now for ever flown ten years thrice told alas are as a day yet as together we are aged grown let us together wear our age away for still the times long past are dear to thought and rapture marked each minute as it flew to youth and joy all change of seasons brought pains that were soft or pleasures that were new even when thy lovesick heart felt fond alarms alternate throbbing with its hopes and fears did i not bear thee to thy fair ones arms assure thy faith and dry up all thy tears and have thou fixed my death sweet master say and will thou kill thy servant old and poor a little longer let me live i pray a little longer hobble round thy door ah could thou bear to see thy servant bleed even though thy pity has decreed his sat and yet in vain thy heart for life shall plead if nature has denied a longer date alas i feel it is nature dooms my death i feel too sure it is pity deals the blow but ere it falls o nature take my breath and my kind master shall no bloodshed know ere the last hour of my allotted life a softer sat shall end me old

sequestration for the above space of time this faithful adherent has been noticed to lead a pathetic kind of life his constant practice and the gloomy habits of his existence are as follow  opposite to the house of a gentleman near the churchyard of st olave where the little receptacles of humanity are in many parts dilapidated amongst these appears a cragged aperture scarce large enough to admit the mournful animal into the subterraneous ruins where he pursues his way unseeing and unseen till as has since been discovered he explores the spot that is consecrated to his sorrows the neighbors have celebrated him for this pensive pursuit till so much of his sad history as can be collected from his melancholy and its motives running into a popular tale the subsequent facts have got into every ones mouth of late it has been his fate to meet a friend in an ingenious artist who has gazed upon his in and out goings with an eye of stricture and surprise the result of his remarks is that this visitant of the vaults  a singular solitary whose monastery is erected amongst the dead  invariably follows one course of conduct shunning all canine as well as human intercourse at once resigning our species and his own going gloomily into his cavern and never returning but on the extremest calls and severest insistings of nature by which he instinctively is driven into daylight  he however endures it no longer than just to walk solemnly with ghostly steps and slow into the gentlemans house to eat the food which he probably takes because he would not wish to part with or shorten his sorrows or to terminate them amidst the sacred dust of some loved friend over which he is now the generous sentinel yet in this effort of perpetuating his sympathy and of grudging the moments that are stolen from it he is not represented as a being apt to form new attachments or who wishes to expunge the old by the force of novelty he is a steady martyr to his fidelity and knows nor the shadow of changing on the contrary even the sweet voice of benevolence which would call him into prosperity and the liberal hand which offers the means of subsistence so sorely wanted have no corrupting power of seducing him into one hours forgetfulness the great duty of the mourners life is evidently drawn to a point  that of attending the ashes of an ancient benefactor in the progress of mortal decay from this no bribes no bounties can entice him and wonderful to tell no sooner is natures meanest want abstemiously as rapidly abated for he seems to grudge the time so wasted than the memory of the dear charge he has forsaken returns invigorated upon him and he entombs himself again in this pious manner for three or four days then once more he crawls forth lean and emaciated his eyes sunk his hair dishevelled and with every other mark of the prisoner and the mourner thus does he literally pass his days and nights in the darkness and shadow of death no sun to cheer no companion to soothe him it may not be omitted for it is a circumstance too honorable to his principles of affection and to which truth gives her sanction that his terrene habitation is rendered additionally uncomfortable by a kind of thoroughfare sink which conducts the noisome damps along his cave so that his post of honor which is a sickbed is made in the waters and all the horrors of an illaired dungeon must surround him but his tender nature recks not this  love endures all things in coming suddenly into day he is represented as feeling no kind of festivity at the transition either from the fanning of the breeze or fervor of the sun none of those rebounds of joy or fond elevations that denote an ordinary dogs release from a long and painful confinement no  his character is uniform this penserosomoralist is a volunteer in captivity and if in his way from the vaults to his house of feeding he encounters any of his own kind from his coffin to his kitchen which is the utmost limit of his journey it has been observed that he takes no notice of their bearing the same impressed form of nature as if the connecting band was torn from the living and transferred to the dead he takes his hasty repast  his necessary morsel and retires to bury himself alive in his sable retreat his friendship seems to have worn out the very distinction of sex and the female form with all its attractions is absorbed in that thick night of sad sensation which has seized upon his heart yet he is not ungrateful nor unmindful of the dues of hospitality to the servant maid of the house who prepares his pottage against his hour of resurrection from the dead he expresses a decent sense of acknowledgment he is not sullen but sorrowful but he keeps aloof and dips his morsel in the vinegar reservedly which i take to hint civilly to his benefactor his wishes to avoid all approximation to intimacy it is easy to translate the dogs heart upon this circumstance as well as if we could see into his generous bosom it runs thus  to show my good principles i pay thee my tender thanks but prithee damsel attempt not my affections they are so entirely engaged that i have not so much as might be put into a wrens eye for any other of thy species or my own we are very much afraid that the kindhearted wench will suffer her good nature to get the better of her discretion and that she will bewoman away the dogs morals till he becomes no better than an human being no we injure him  the fame the immortality of the dog require that he should continue inconsolable one weeks felicity  yea one moments mirth would ruin his reputation with us for ever and by all that is honorable in nature or graceful in the affections we had rather creep into his sepulcher and assassinate him on his masters tomb and we are sure the generous reader would do the same than have him grow fat and get into flesh and recover yea but a little the tone of his mind it is for his glory he should go mourning all his life long and  which love forbid  should he be ever base enough to hold up his head again or to prance it about like the other heedless happy puppies of this world who so easily forget they ever lost

we shall pass over having nothing remarkable to distinguish it from other annual meetings where people assemble to stare at cheat each other and divert themselves and to spend the years savings in buying those bargains which would have been probably better bought at home one day after dinner as the desert was just brought on the table the traveling german musicians who commonly ply the houses at these times presented themselves and were suffered to play and just as they were making their bows for the money they received for their hamony a birdcatcher who had rendered himself famous for educating and calling forth the talents of the feathered race made his appearance and was well received by the party which was numerous and benevolent the musicians who had heard of this birdcatchers fame begged permission to stay and the master of the house who had a great share of good nature indulged their curiosity a curiosity indeed in which every body participated for all that we have heard or seen of learnedpigs asses dogs and horses was said to be extinguished in the wonderful wisdom which blazed in the genius of this birdcatchers canary the canary was produced and the owner harrangued him in the following manner placing him upon his forefinger bijou jewel you are now in the presence of persons of great sagacity and honor take heed you do not deceive the expectations they have conceived of you from the worlds report you have got laurels beware their withering in a word deport yourself like the bijou  the jewel  of the canary birds as you certainly are all this time the bird seemed to listen and indeed placed himself in the true attitude of attention by sloping his head to the ear of the man and then distinctly nodding twice when his master left off speaking and if ever nods were intelligible and promissory these were two of them that is good said the master pulling off his hat to the bird now then let us see if you are a canary of honor give us a tune  the canary sung pshaw that is too harsh it is the note of a raven with a hoarseness upon him something pathetic the canary whistled as if his little throat was changed to a lute faster says the man  slower  very well  what a plague is this foot about and this little head  no wonder you are out mr bijou when you forget your time that is a jewel  bravo bravo my little man all that he was ordered or reminded of did he do to admiration his head and foot beat time  humoured the variations both of tone and movement and the sound was a just echo to the sense according to the strictest laws of poetical and as it ought to be of musical composition  bravo bravo reechoed from all parts of the dining room the musicians declared the canary was a greater master of music than any of their band and do you not show your sense of this civility sir cried the birdcatcher with an angry air the canary bowed most respectfully to the great delight of the company his next achievement was going through martial exercise with a straw gun after which my poor bijou says the owner thou have had hard work and must be a little weary a few performances more and thou shall repose show the ladies how to make a curtesy the bird here crossed his taper legs and sunk and rose with an ease and grace that would have put half our subscriptionassembly belles to the blush that is my fine bird  and now a bow head and foot corresponding here the striplings for ten miles round london might have blushed also let us finish with a hornpipe my brave little fellow  that is it  keep it up keep it up the activity glee spirit accuracy with which this last order was obeyed wound up the applause in which all the musicians joined as well with their instruments as with their clappings to the highest pitch of admiration bijou himself seemed to feel the sacred thirst of fame and shook his little plumes and carroled an io paean that sounded like the conscious notes of victory thou have done all my biddings bravely said the master caressing his feathered servant now then take a nap while i take thy place hereupon the canary went into a counterfeit slumber so like the effect of the poppiedgod first shutting one eye then the other then nodding then dropping so much on one side that the hands of several of the company were stretched out to save him from falling and just as those hands approached his feathers suddenly recovering and dropping as much on the other at length sleep seemed to fix him in a steady posture whereupon the owner took him from his finger and laid him flat on the table where the man assured us he would remain in a good sound sleep while he himself had the honor to do his best to fill up the interval accordingly after drinking a glass of wine in the progress of taking which he was interrupted by the canarybird springing suddenly up to assert his right to a share really putting his little bill into the glass and then laying himself down to sleep again the owner called him a saucy fellow and began to show off his own independent powers of entertaining the forte of these lay chiefly in balancing with a tobaccopipe while he smoaked with another and several of the positions were so difficult to be preserved yet maintained with such dexterity that the general attention was fixed upon him but while he was thus exhibiting an huge black cat who had been no doubt on the watch from some unobserved corner sprung upon the table seized the poor canary in its mouth and rushed out of the window in despite of all opposition though the dining room was emptied in an instant it was a vain pursuit the life of the bird was gone and its mangled body was brought in by the unfortunate owner in such dismay accompanied by such looks and language as must have awakened pity in a misanthrope he spread himself half length over the table and mourned his canarybird with the most undissembled sorrow well may i grieve for thee my poor little thing well may i grieve more than four years have thou fed from my hand drank from my lip and slept in my bosom i owe to thee my support my health my strength and my happiness without thee what will become of me thou it was that did ensure my welcome in the best companies it was thy genius only made me welcome thy death is a just punishment for my vanity had i relied on thy happy powers all had been well and thou had been perched on my finger or lulled on my breast at this moment but trusting to my own talents and glorifying myself in them a judgment has fallen upon me and thou art dead and mangled on this table accursed be the hour i entered this house and more accursed the detestable monster that killed thee accursed be myself for i contributed i ought not to have taken away my eyes when thine were closed in frolic o bijou my dearest only bijou would i were dead also  as near as the spirit of his disordered mind can be transfused such was the language and sentiment of the forlorn birdcatcher whose despairing motion and frantic air no words can paint he took from his pocket a little green bag of faded velvet and drawing from out of it some wool and cotton that were the wrapping of whistles birdcalls and other instruments of his trade all of which he threw on the table as in scorn and making a couch placed the mutilated limbs and ravaged feathers of his canary upon it and renewed his lamentations these were now much softened as is ever the case when the rage of grief yields to its tenderness when it is too much overpowered by the effect to advert to the cause it is needless to observe that every one of the company sympathized with him but none more than the band of musicians who being engaged in a profession that naturally keeps the sensibilities more or less in exercise felt the distress of the poor birdman with peculiar force it was really a banquet to see these people gathering themselves into a knot and after whispering wiping their eyes and blowing their noses depute one from amongst them to be the medium of conveying into the pocket of the birdman the very contribution they had just before received for their own efforts the poor fellow perceiving them took from the pocket the little parcel they had rolled up and brought with it by an unlucky accident another little bag at the sight of which he was extremely agitated for it contained the canaryseed the food of the dear lost companion of his heart there is no giving language to the effect of this trifling circumstance upon the poor fellow he threw down the contributionmoney that he brought from his pocket along with it not with an ungrateful but a desperate hand he opened the bag which was fastened with red tape and taking out some of the seed put it to the very bill of the lifeless bird exclaiming no poor bijou no  thou can not peck any more out of this hand that has been thy feeding place so many years  thou can not remember how happy we both were when i bought this bag full for thee had it been filled with gold thou had deserved it  it shall be filled  and with gold said the master of the house if i could afford it the good man rose from his seat which had been long uneasy to him and gently taking the bag put into it some silver saying as he handed it to his nearest neighbor who will refuse to follow my example it is not a subscription for mere charity it is a tribute to one of the rarest things in the whole world namely to real feeling in this sophistical pretending parading age if ever the passion of love and gratitude was in the heart of man it is in the heart of that unhappy fellow and whether the object that calls out such feelings be bird beast fish or man it is alike virtue and  ought to be rewarded  said his next neighbor putting into the bag his quota it is superfluous to tell you that after the seed had been taken wholly away and put very delicately out of the poor mans sight every body most cheerfully contributed to make up a purse to repair as much as money could the birdmans loss the last person applied to was a very beautiful german young lady who as she placed her bounty into the bag closed it immediately after and blushed as there are all sorts of blushes at least one to every action of our lives that is worth any characteristic feeling supposing the actor can feel at all suspicion would have thought this young lady who was so anxious to conceal her gift gave little or nothing but candor who reasons in a different manner would suppose what was really the case  that it was a blush not of avarice or deception but of benevolence graced with modesty curiosity however caught the bag opened it and turned out its contents amongst which were a golden ducat that by its date and brightness had been hoarded ah ha said curiosity who does this belong to i wonder guilt and innocence avarice and benignity are alike honest in one point since they all in the moment of attack by some means or other discover what they wish to conceal there was not in the then large company a single person who could not have exclaimed to this young lady with assurance of the truth  thou art the woman there was no denying the fact it was written on every feature of her enchanting face she struggled however with the accusation almost to tears but they were such tears as would have given luster to the finest eyes in the world for they gave luster to here is and would have added effulgence to a ray of the sun well then if nobody else will own this neglected ducat said the master of the house who was uncle to the lady abovementioned i will whereupon he took it from the heap exchanged it for two others which enriched the collection while the business of the heart was thus carrying on the poor birdman who was the occasion and object of it was at first divided by contrary emotions of pain and pleasure his eye sometimes directed to the massacred canary sometimes to the company at length generosity proved the stronger emotion and grief ebbed away he had lost a bird but he had gained the good will of human beings the bird it was true was his pride and support but this was not the crisis any longer to bewail his fate he accepted the contributionpurse by one means or other filled like the sack of benjamin even to the brim and bowed but spoke not then folding up the corpse of the canary in its wool and cotton shroud departed with one of those looks that the moment it is seen it is felt and understood but for which being too powerful for description no language has yet been provided on going out he beckoned the musicians to follow they did so striking a few chords that would have graced the funeral of juliet the very soul of the english gentleman pursued the sounds and so did his feet he hastened to the outer door and saw the birdman contending about returning the money which the founders of the benevolence  for such were the musicians  had subscribed on his coming down to breakfast the next morning he saw the footman departing with the cat who killed the bird not said his master to put her to death for an act that was natural to her but to put her where i know she will be out of my sight for i never could look on her again without being reminded of the most uncomfortable part of yesterdays adventure poor bijou i have not a doubt but all we have done atones but scantily for the loss of such a friend just as he said this the niece whose person and mind i have already particularized came into the breakfast room and now said the old gentleman to finish the business look ye henrietta i gave you this new ducat to lay out at the fair in any manner you liked best and though i think the way in which you disposed of it the very best you could have chosen  nay no more blushing  i think it never ought to go out of our family for do you know that i have taken it into my superstitious old head that the blessing of the giver of all good will stay with us while such a ducat remains amongst us i therefore bought it back cheaply with two others age is superstitious you know my dear indulge me then love and take care of it while i live after which it shall be yours  and in the mean time that you may not lose your fairing in this little purse are ten others that though not so distinguished by what to my old heart is more precious than the gold of ophir may serve well enough the common purposes of life much of this was spoken with tender difficulty and the gift was received with more but she loved the hand which in the first instance had enabled her to be generous too well not to reward it was not this indeed an illustration of the virtue of the man of ross who did good yet blushed to find it fame  the robin in times of old lived a man near a great forest he was a keeper of sheep and had as the story goes a numerous family some of his children were grown up and some were infants one was rocked in the cradle and two were lulled upon the lap the mother was a noted spinner and when they could hold the wool in their hands and had strength enough to turn round the wheel she set her daughters to work while the father took care to find sufficient outdoor business for the boys some were to tend the herd and some that were too weak for hard work scared the birds from the corn now it is reported by the neighbors of the adjacent village that the old shepherd the father was a mighty odd character and bred up his family in a very different manner from his poor neighbors as he was unable to give them the advantage of an education like ours and teach them latin and greek he was resolved to furnish them with such accomplishments as his situation permitted he was a man of tenderness and simplicity and often spoke to his children in this manner do all the good you can boys and girls and be sure you do no harm you must labor for a livelihood but you may always get your bread innocently and the bread that is earned honestly will be always the sweeter for it i am myself obliged to attend a flock your mother is compelled to spin to the poor sheep we are therefore all indebted they afford us food and raiment they shield us from the cold and prevent us falling into the jaws of famine i therefore love the harmless creatures and would not hurt them for all that they are worth let this conduct teach you children to behave properly to poor dumb animals and to use them as they deserve to be used you are their friends and they are yours prove yourselves their protectors but i charge you presume not to think you have any right of tyranny and be assured wanton cruelty will always be returned upon the tormentor the whole family listened to the old mans argument and it would have been well for them if they had always obeyed the precepts of their father but now comes the cream of the story pray therefore attend the eldest son had one day taken the nest of a robin which consisted of five young ones and a sixth just bursting from the shell he carried them home to his brothers and sisters to each of which he gave a bird but the little nestling he gave to one of the children in the lap who wrapping it up in a piece of flannel put it into a small wicker basket and set it by the fire the boy that found the nest tied a string to the leg of his bird and cruelly dragged it after him the second son run pins through the eyes of his bird and took a delight in seeing it bleed to death the third gave his to the cat or rather pretended to give it for he held it first pretty close to pusss whiskers and then pulled it away from her but at last she pounced upon it and carried off one of the legs the eldest daughter intended to have taken care of here is but one of her brothers having murdered his own seized upon her property and both pulling the poor wretch different ways betwixt compassion and cruelty it died in the contest and the younger girl now in possession of the only bird that was left put here is into a cage and covered it over with wool at this crisis the mother who had been gleaning and the poor old shepherd returned home the limbs of the dead birds were seen upon the floor and the cat was busily employed in a corner at clearing them away the old man insisted upon the truth the trembling boy confessed it barbarous wretches cried the shepherd is this the return for my care and instruction but i will punish you for it the eldest son he tied by the leg and did to him as he did to the bird the second son he scratched with pins till his hands were all over blood at the third he set his dog who caught him by the leg as he used to catch the sheep the eldest daughter who had lost her bird he pitied he kissed the second daughter which had put her poor thing into the cage but hugged to his very heart the little creature that had placed the nestling in a warm basket now it pleased god that about six or seven months after this the eldest son which had been the cause of all this mischief fell sick and died and many people are now living who say that as he was going to be put into the ground the ravens rooks kites and other vast birds all flew over his coffin screamed and could by no means be got away nor could he rest in his grave for them because the animals were always digging up the earth under where he lay as if they were resolved to eat him up  and some declare he is actually gone i beg pardon schoolfellows for this long story but i shall finish directly i cannot help mentioning to you the different fate of the good little girl who treated the animal tenderly a year after the death of her brother she died herself of the smallpox and i do assure you it has been told to me as fact that her grave is a perfect garden for the robins do not suffer a single weed to grow upon it and god almighty has adorned it with wild flowers as innocent as the baby which they cover  the old horse on his travels related by his master the whole life of this poor slave till within the two last years has been a continued trial of strength labor and patience he was broken to the bit by a yorkshire jockey to be rode the moment he was fit for service by an oxonian scholar who whatever might have been his learning in the abstruser sciences was little conversant in the rudiments of humanity though they are level with the lowest understanding and founded on the tender code of that great lawgiver who has told us a just man is merciful to his beast during the very first vacation this sprightly youth so completely outrode the strength of his steed that he sold him on the same day that he regained his college at the recommencement of the term for two guineas to one of those persons who keep livery stables and at the same time have horses to let it was not easily possible for a poor wretch so badly situated before to change so much for the worse and of all the fates that attend a hackney horse that which belongs to the drudge of a public university is the most severe it is even harder than that of the servitors of the college he remained in this servitude however sixteen years during which he was a thousand times not only priestridden but parish ridden and yet was rarely known to stumble and never to fall is it not questionable whether half the parishioners or even the priests with reverence be it spoken could say as much for their own travels in the rugged journey of life his master rather from policy than compassion thought it most for his future interest to allow his fourfooted servant a short respite and he was accordingly favored with a months run in what is called a salt marsh but before his furlow was expired he was borrowed by some smugglers who then infested the coast and who made him the receiver of contraband commodities as well as aider and abettor in practices which like many other underhand actions are best carried on in the night time we say borrowed because after a winters hard work in the company of these landpirates the horse was thrown up by his temporary employers in the very marsh out of which he had been pressed into their service and a leathern label on which was marked this facetious intelligence fastened to his fetlock  owner i have been smuggled by these means he unexpectedly came again into his quondam masters possession out of which however he departed the summer after in the society of an old fellow commoner who after many years close confinement in the cloisters was disposed to relinquish them in favor of a piece of church preferment in norfolk which happened to be in the gift of a lady about his own standing in life and who in the days of her youth avowed so strong a partiality for this gentleman that her father disapproving her alliance with a person who had only the hopes of a curacy before his eyes thought fit to clog her inheritance over which he had complete authority with a formidable condition of forfeiting the whole estates should she marry a son of the church shutting out hereby the whole body of divinity to exclude the aforesaid individual member faithful however to the merits of the man who had won her heart she was glad to find that the parental tyranny which had tied her hand had left free her fortune she therefore took the first opportunity to present the object of her early choice with the only piece of service in her power  a presentation to the living of which she was become the patroness thinking this a better evidence of her still existing partiality than if she had set fortune at defiance and sacrificed not only her own advantages but her lovers to gratifying a passion which would have impoverished both an example of tenderness this well worthy the imitation of more romantic minds it was to be inducted to this living our learned clerk now journeyed on the ancient steed whose memoirs i am now writings and as he did not intend to revisit the banks of the isis and had often been securely carried to a neighboring chapel where he officiated on the back of this identical horse he purchased him to the intent that he should get into a good living also but the turbulent part of this poor brutes adventures was not yet performed his patron died without himself deriving what might have been expected from his benefice and soon after the decease of the master the servant fell into the hands of a man in the same parish who to a variety of other endeavors to subsist a large and needy family added that of letting out occasionally a horse our hero still unbroken in either knees or constitution was deemed fit for his purpose and being thought of little value was obtained at an easy price his new master removed soon after to lowestoft which you know is a considerable seabathing town by the seaside in the county of suffolk where the toils imposed by his oxford tyrant were more than accumulated for besides dragging a cart all the morning with loads of bread a baker being amongst the businesses of his master he was on account of his gentle disposition the horse fixed upon to take a couple of gouty invalids in the bathing machine after the more vigorous diverse and dippers had finished their ablutions in the afternoon he was harnessed to the london postcoach which daily past from lowestoft to yarmouth the next morning by daybreak he came with the return of the said coach and was then ready for the diurnal rotation at home unless a more profitable offer happened to take him another way four years of his life were passed in this miserable round of labors and it was at this period of his history he and i became acquainted  my affections were engaged and i was predetermined to make a present to them of this horse for a sight of which i immediately sent my servant but when he was led to the door of my friends house and though my resolution to mark him for my own grew firmer as i gazed upon his pitymoving carcass i totally gave up all ideas of his utility the owner himself confessed he was almost done up at which thought a long sigh ensued and a confession that he had been the chief support of the family observing while he patted his neck that the poor fellow might be said not only to carry his childrens bread to be sold but to make it  but its all over with you now my old boy  continued the baker  you may get me through the autumn mayhap and then  what then said i he must hobble away to the kennel  to the kennel even so master  what must be must be i cannot afford to let him die by inches and if i could i dont see the humanity of that better give him to the dogs while they can make a meal of him and pay me a small matter for their entertainment  he will however carry your honor this month to come creditably  predetermined as i said to spare the remains of this poor wretch i bought him on the spot convinced that it would be difficult to find any other person who would receive him on any terms his appearance was such as would have justified rosinante in refusing his acquaintance on the etiquette of comparative poverty the association would have disgraced that celebrated spectre nor did quixote himself exhibit so woeful a countenance if ever therefore i could boast of an action purely disinterested and which had unalloyed compassion for its basis it was the giving five times more than he was worth that is to say five guineas for this old horse intending only at the time that he should pass the residue of his days in peaceful indolence broke in upon by the infirmities of life and die a natural death to this end i obtained him the run of a friends park where i considered him as a respectable veteran retired on a pension in this verdant hospital he remained unsought unseen a whole year at the end of which being invited to pass the christmas with the noble and generous owners of the park aforesaid i paid a visit also to my pensioner who had grown so much beyond himself on their unmeasured bounty that he seemed to be renovated do not wonder that i scarce knew him in his improvements for he appeared not to know himself the poor fellows very character was inverted the alteration reached from head to heel he neighed snorted kicked and frolicked about the pasture on my first attempt to stop him with the airs of a sillyfoal i reminded him that he ought to deport more humbly considering the melancholy situation from which he was but recently delivered yet so far from paying any attention he turned from my morality with another snort of disdain tossed up his saucy head and threw up his heels wholly forgetting like other ingrates his former condition like them too he appeared to consider the world now made for him and therefore betwixt jest and earnest i was resolved once more to show him he was made for the world  the very next day i caused him to be taken from his green recess and performed the tour of the environs on his back more airily more pleasantly i could not have been carried nor toward the end of the ride more soberly the spirit which he showed in the pasture was but as the levities of a hearty and happy old age in the plenitude of uncurbed leisure like the gaiety of a veteran who finding himself in health might take it into his head to finish in a country dance but these are sallies for a moment ah my friend how many poor starving wretches worn down by their cruel taskmasters goaded like this horse by the whips and spurs of the time and driven out of one hard service to another might like him be rescued in the extremity at small expense and by the hand of bounty be protected from farther rigours even till they were renewed for a serviceable instead of a diseased old age how many halffamished hardridden creatures of the human race i say might in like manner be replenished reject not this long story  this episode  this heroicomiepic if you please  but i cannot allow you to call it a digression you will admit it to be in point when you are given to understand that on this very horse thus restored by a little indulgence i have measured a thousand miles and find my associate in sufficient heart to measure a thousand more in the fourandtwentieth year of his age we sallied forth and if the master had in course of his travels made as few trips as few false steps as the servant he might be a match for the safest goer on the road of life   to this we cannot but subjoin an account of the treatment of the benevolent howard to his aged horses not only as strongly and tenderly allied to  pitys gift but as an incentive to and an example of the divine and blessed quality of mercy  the late mr howard had a range of pastures sacred to the old age of those horses who had carried him pleasantly or worked for him honestly and industriously till they were no longer fit for service this is the moment when horses are in general either sold at an under price to people who are constrained to allow no touch of pity to predominate over that charity which begins at home or else they are destroyed and given to the dogs their masters alleging that it is an act of humanity our philanthropists humanity never leading him to kill an old servant he turned his useless horses into the aforesaid pastures where they remained happy pensioners on his bounty for the rest of their lives  walking over those grounds with the generous master of them it was delightful to see twenty or thirty of these quadruped pensioners enjoying themselves in perfect freedom from labor and in full supply of all that old age requires each of the fields had a comfortable shed which the inhabitants could resort to in the hard weather and were sure of finding the rigours of the season softened by a wellfurnished crib of the best hay and a manger either of bran or corn ground or some other nourishing food chelsea hospital is not better accommodated it was charming on a pleasant day to observe some of the pensioners renovating in the sun others reposing in the shade but on the approach of their benefactor all of them actuated by a spirit of gratitude worthy of imitation that could move with ease came toward him invited his attentions and seemed very sensible of their situation some whose limbs almost refused their offices put themselves to no small difficulties to limp toward him and even those who being confined to their hovels might be fairly said to be bedridden turned their languid eyes to him and appeared sensible of his pity and caressings  these have been all very faithful creatures he would say and have strong claims upon me that poor fellow who has now scarce a leg to stand upon was the constant companion of my peregrinations for sixandtwenty years and was as proud and prancing as he is now humble and decrepid and the irongrey invalid which you see yonder dragging his slow length along was in the days of his youth such a roving riotous fellow that no gate or hedge could keep him within bounds and it was a days work sometimes to catch him nay when he was caught it required more address and horsemanship than ever i was master of to make him understand that the philosophy of a parsons pad had more charms for me than all the flights of bucephalus or even of pegasus himself look at him now the morality of the contrast is obvious  in this manner he went on enumerating the several qualities and historical anecdotes of the several pensioners there was one he remarked that was at no time a horse for him and would not probably have been amongst his pensioners but that he had been once rode by a relation of his a young agreeable rake who valued him for the very points that made him useless to me his skittishness and impetuosity all which he asserted were the sure marks both in man and beast of a generous spirit high heart and noble disposition now as my little frolicloving cousin was precisely of this character himself and after a mad but not vicious career of fifteen years consolidated into a very good man i suffered the horse and his master to reform themselves at leisure and wish with all my soul that half the reformed rakes about town had turned out so well after sowing their wild oats as did this young gentleman and his favorite steed who for the eight last years of his servitude was a pattern of sobriety to horses and riders  the ox and the lamb about a mile from the westerngate of the town of cleves a traveller perceived a man and boy busied in doing something to the most beautiful ox he ever beheld as he came nearer he found they were adorning it with a great variety of fanciful ornaments a large collar of yew branches tied with ribbon and wreathed with other evergreens was thrown over its neck papers on which were drawn herds flocks and shepherds and folded into large beauknots were fixed it is to be feared pinned with large corkers to its skin in various parts of the body bunches of the same were tied to the tail braided into the mane and the brows were hung with a garland of holly of which there was a twist fastened by a red filleting even to the horns the tips of which were stuck with little maybushes in bloom his attention was presently called from this by the bleat of a sheep and its lamb those creatures were bound to an hege in a corner of the same enclosure they were dressed nearly in the taste of the ox with this variation in the lamb a collar of early opening flowers of the field and some twigs of hawthorn in bud and which betwixt sport and earnest it was trying to get into its mouth on asking the cause of all this finery he was told it was upon account of its being a jourdefete and also the day before that of the greatest beef mutton and lamb market in the whole year and pray friend said the traveller where is the necessity of dressing the animals in that manner it is our custom sir replies the man driving the ox toward the town and the boy with the sheep and lamb now unbound following his example the traveller had not time for more interrogatories being wholly taken up with the anticks of the lamb which frolicking sometimes with its mother and sometimes with the boy and sometimes even with its own shadow brought so close under his eye and so near indeed to his very heart the fine lines of mr pope that he repeated them over and over every image of this description had its immediate illustration in the object before him the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today had he thy reason would he skip and play pleased to the last he crops the flowery food and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood   they gained cleves as the traveller pronounced for the tenth time that impressive verse which gives the moral in the following line  o blindness to the future kindly given  the animals were led or rather driven through the principal streets literally for show it being the practice of westphalia for the butchers to exhibit their meat alive the day preceding the slaughter i pretend says our traveller to question neither the use nor the necessity of all this nor by any means to stretch pity or feeling beyond its bounds i only observe that my affections followed these creatures in their funeral procession through the town of cleves and could not leave them till on turning a narrow lane i saw with a kind of emotion easily guessed the door of the place destined for their destruction it being a practice in this country to slaughter their meat and a very filthy one it is the same vile custom prevails in many parts of holland  in the open street the pavements and kennels of which are stained running with blood i will carry you no further into this little adventure than just to note that being the next day obliged to pass the end of the street where i took leave of my poor dumb companions i observed not only several parts of them hung upon hooks at the butchers shop but several of the ornaments even the flowers that were wreathed about the face of the lamb were now crowded into its mouth and spotted with its harmless blood poor little fellow said the traveller thou were yesterday the merriest of the frisking tribe would i had never met thee if in the course of the week it was my lot to eat any part of these animals at the tables where i then visited as was most probably the case consider poor human nature and forgive me i am not preposterous enough to advise a being who is made up of appetites to abstain from the gratification of such as are necessary to existence but while we yield to the stern laws of our mortality let us not spurn all sort of feeling like the man who on seeing some lambs at sport in a meadow exclaimed ah ye dear innocent beautiful creatures would to heaven i had a joint of ye today for dinner with nice spinnage and butter a very different sentiment sprung up in the mind of the spectator of this scene as he surveyed the amputated limbs of these his late associates and he could not but remember what the heartmelting otway says on the subject lead lead me like a tame lamb to sacrifice thus in his fatal garlands decked fine and pleased the wanton skips and plays  trots by the enticing flattering priestess side and much transported with his little pride forgets his dear companions of the plain till by her bound he is on the altar lain and then too hardly bleats never can this affecting passage be more touchingly illustrated than in the case of the lamb of westphalia  finis new publications printed for t n longman no    paternosterrow   gleanings through wales holland and
